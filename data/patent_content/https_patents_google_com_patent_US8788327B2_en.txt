Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to content presentation.
- Advertisers provide advertisements in different forms in order to attract consumers.
- Ads can be provided in electronic form.
- online ads can be provided as banner ads on a web page, as ads presented with search results, or as ads presented in a mobile application.
- An advertising system can include an ad in a webpage, for example, in response to one or more keywords in a user search query input to a search engine. If a user selects the presented ad (e.g., by “clicking” the ad), the user is generally taken to another location associated with the ad, for example, to another, particular document.
- this specification relates to content presentation.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a group of content items at a user device, the content items configured for presentation to a user in association with other content, each content item of the group of content items including metadata associated with the content item; identifying a request from an application of the user device to present a content item in association with particular content; selecting, using one or more processors, a content item from the group of content items using the metadata for the content items along with local targeting information; and presenting the selected content item.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the operations of the methods.
- the content item is an advertisement.
- the method further includes periodically requesting a new group of content items from a remote server.
- a request for a group of content items includes user device information.
- a frequency of the periodic requesting varies according to network speed.
- a frequency of the periodic requesting varies according to utilization of the previously received group of content items.
- a frequency of the periodic requesting occurs in response to a change in client device location.
- the metadata associated with a content item includes one or more categories to which the content item is assigned.
- the metadata associated with a content item includes content item targeting information.
- the metadata associated with a content item includes restrictions for presenting the content item.
- the metadata associated with a content item includes historical performance information for the content item.
- the method further includes notifying a remote server when a content item is presented to the user.
- the method further includes notifying a remote server of user interactions with a presented content item.
- the method further includes using an ad serving application on the client device to select the content item.
- Selecting the content item includes comparing, on the client device, one or more keywords associated with one or more content items of the group of content items with one or more keywords of the request.
- Selecting the content item includes comparing, on the client device, one or more keywords associated with one or more content items of the group of content items with a location of the client device.
- the local targeting information includes a location of the client device.
- the local targeting information includes ad targeting information maintained only on the client device.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a request from a mobile device for a group of content items, the group of content items for selective presentation by the mobile device to a user in association with other content, the request including information associated with the user or mobile device; selecting, using one or more processors, a group of content items using the request information; and sending the group of content items to the mobile device, the content items including targeting information associated with each respective content item.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the operations of the methods.
- the method further includes receiving a notification indicating that a content item of the group of content items has been selected for presentation; and logging the presentation of the content item. Selecting the group of content items further includes using user profile data. Selecting the group of content items is performed without receiving local targeting information maintained on the mobile device.
- Ads can be pre-fetched and served with reduced latency to a user of a mobile device using a local ad serving application running on the mobile device as compared to requesting an ad from a remote location (e.g., a remote ad server).
- Privacy related information such as accurate location data, can be determined locally to target ads while being maintained on a user's mobile device.
- device location can be used in ad targeting without sending the device location externally.
- Ads can be served when a device has no or limited network connectivity.
- the local ad serving application can use a user's recent activity in targeting ads. User's interaction with presented ads (e.g., clicks, downloads, etc.) can be stored locally and sent to the remote ad server (e.g., contemporaneously with the interaction or at a later time).

- One or more content items can be downloaded and/or updated from an ad server (e.g., in background processes) prior to presenting particular content items on the mobile device.
- the mobile device e.g., using a local ad serving application
- the content items in the local repository can be displayed by applications, including as part of a document in applications, on the mobile device, with browser content displayed on a mobile device browser, or along with other content.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example content presentation system 100 .
- one or more advertisers 102 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track ad information in an advertising management system 104 (“system 104 ”).
- system 104 an advertising management system 104
- the ads can be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text only ads, image ads, barcode ads (e.g., ads that include one or more barcodes, for example, for use in redeeming the particular ad), audio ads, video ads, animated ads, ads combining one or more of any of such components, etc.
- the ads can also include embedded information, such as links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more users 108 may submit requests for ads to the system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending ads to the requesting users 108 for placement on or association with one or more of a publisher's 106 content items (e.g., web properties, mobile applications, or other third party content).
- a publisher's 106 content items e.g., web properties, mobile applications, or other third party content.
- Example web properties can include web pages, television and radio advertising slots, or print media space.
- Users 108 and the advertisers 102 can provide usage information to the system 104 , such as, for example, whether or not a conversion (e.g., a purchase or other interaction) or a click-through related to an ad (e.g., a user has selected an ad) has occurred.
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to ads that have been served.
- the system 104 may perform financial transactions, for example, crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- a network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 102 , the system 104 , the publishers 106 , and the users 108 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof
- One example publisher 106 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- requests for content e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.
- the user 108 can submit a request for ads to an advertisement server in the system 104 .
- the ad request can include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request can also include content request information, including information associated with the user 108 or the user's device (e.g., a mobile device), as described in greater detail below.
- a client browser, application, or other content provider combines the requested content with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 .
- the combined content and ads can be rendered to the users 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser, application interface, or other content display system) of a user device.
- the user device can transmit information about the ads back to the advertisement server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- search service can receive queries for search results.
- the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search results can be presented to users with one or more ads.
- a user 108 can submit a request for ads to the system 104 .
- the request may include a number of ads desired.
- the system 104 can use various information to identify a group of ads to provide to the user 108 .
- Ads from this group of ads can be provided by the user's device for presentation in response to a request from a user application, or associated with content to be displayed (e.g., a web page or search results).
- ads can be provided directly to the user device for presentation or indirectly through content provided to the user device (e.g., ads presented with search results where the ads are provided to the user with the search results).
- the advertisement management system 104 can use an auction process to select ads from the advertisers 102 , which can then be provided to the users 108 in response to the receive requests for ads.
- the advertisers 102 may be permitted to select, or bid, an amount the advertisers are willing to pay for each presentation of or interaction with (e.g., click) of an ad, e.g., a cost-per-click amount an advertiser pays when, for example, a user clicks on an ad.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay for each click of an ad based on a keyword, e.g., a word or words in a query.
- Other bid types can also be used. Based on these bids, ads can be selected and ranked for presentation.
- the user 108 can combine the search results with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then be displayed by the devices of the users 108 that requested the content. Alternatively, portions can be received at different times and integrated in the display as received. For example, the ads can be received and rendered separately by a browser or application. The search results can be maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid ads and presumably neutral search results.
- one or more publishers 106 provide web properties to the users 108 .
- the users 108 submit requests for ads to the advertising management system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending ads to the requesting users 108 for placement on one or more web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property.
- the user's device identifies a particular ad from the received ads for presentation with the provided web properties.
- the requests are executed by devices associated with the user 108 , e.g., by the execution of a particular script (e.g., javascript) when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device.
- a particular script e.g., javascript
- a mobile application is an application specifically designed for operation on a mobile device (e.g., a smart phone).
- the mobile application can also include ads positioned within the content of the mobile application. Similar to publishers 106 described above, the ads can be received from the advertising management system 104 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device).
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system 200 for storing and displaying ads.
- the system 200 includes a remote ad system 202 , mobile devices 212 to display the ads, and a network 220 .
- Mobile devices 212 can include a local ad serving application or a service integrated into the mobile operating system of the mobile device that requests groups of ads, store the ads, and display selected ads from the groups of ads at a later time.
- the remote ad system 202 can contain components for storing, recording, and presenting ads.
- An ad repository 204 can store ads submitted by advertisers.
- Ad logs 206 can store ad presentation and conversion events (e.g., users an ad is presented to, timestamps, ad identifiers, etc.), as well as user's interaction with a presented ad, e.g., user ad clicks.
- An ad group selection engine 208 can select a group of ads to provide to a mobile device (e.g., to the local ad serving application or service integrated with the operating system of the mobile device) based on information in a request, as well as based on targeting data 210 stored on the remote ad system 202 .
- Example requests can include information identifying the requesting user or the requesting device. In some implementations, this information is matched to targeting data 210 associated with the user, though any particularly user identifying information can preferably be rendered anonymous (e.g., using randomly generated identifiers) to remove any information that can particularly identify a specific individual.
- the targeting data 210 can include user information such as demographic information about the user, profile data, previous ads selected for a user, and general location information.
- General location information for example locating a user within a city or county instead of a street address, can allow for user privacy and use of ads in a greater geographic area.
- the ads can be more closely targeted to the user's location by the user's device as described in greater detail below.
- additional or updated user information can be included in requests for stored ads and added to the targeting data 210 for purposes of processing the request. For example, applications or application categories in use by the user's mobile device can be included such that ads matching those applications can be identified.
- local targeting information for example, particular user location information
- the local targeting information can be used in local ad serving by a local ad serving application (e.g., local ad serving application 213 a ).
- the remote ad system 202 can respond to a request for stored ads, from a mobile device 212 , by selecting a group of ads from the ad repository 204 .
- the selected group of ads, and additional information associated with the ads can be transmitted to the same mobile device 212 .
- the information or metadata associated with the ads is encrypted prior to sending to the mobile device 212 .
- the remote ad system 202 treats these ad requests distinctly from other ad requests. For example, impressions in response to the request for a group of ads are not logged or counted until notification has been received that the ads have been delivered or presented to the user.
- the additional information can include targeting information such as keywords for each ad, advertiser restrictions, presentation format, historical performance information, and location associations.
- Advertiser information provided can include an advertiser's bid (per ad) and overall budget information.
- the advertiser information can also include delivery restrictions, for example, time of day and ad rotation scheme.
- estimated quality/match scores and priority of delivery for particular ads can also be provided.
- a mobile device e.g., mobile device 212 a can include a local ad serving application 213 a that includes a local ad repository 214 a to store ads and additional information associated with ads and an ad presentation system 216 a .
- the local ad serving application 213 a can be an application downloaded by the user in order to opt-in or can be preloaded on the mobile device 212 a .
- the local ad serving is provided as a service provided by the mobile device operating system.
- One or more applications 218 a can display ads selected from the local ad repository 214 a .
- the applications 218 a request ads from the local ad serving application 213 a that can be selected from the local ad repository 214 a by the ad presentation system 216 a .
- the applications 218 a include both mobile applications developed to provide particular features or content to the user (e.g., games, news applications, etc.), as well as one or more mobile device browser applications.
- the ad presentation system 216 a of the local ad serving application 213 a uses information associated with ads (e.g., keywords, demographic/location ad targets), device information (e.g., current device location), and information associated with the local ad request (e.g., search query, application information, etc.) to select an ad from the local ad repository 214 a to present.
- ads e.g., keywords, demographic/location ad targets
- device information e.g., current device location
- information associated with the local ad request e.g., search query, application information, etc.
- the ad request can include the query submitted to a search system. This query can be matched to ads based on keywords as well as locations associated with the ads.
- the mobile device 212 a can use local targeting information including the precise location of the mobile device 212 a (and/or other privacy sensitive data that can be retained locally) in identifying an ad responsive to a local ad request without transmitting the precise location information external to the mobile device (e.g., to the ad system 202 ).
- the ad presentation system 216 a can determine that none of the ads in the local ad repository 214 a match, or match closely enough, an ad request.
- the mobile device 212 a can request one or more ads from the remote ad system 202 .
- Mobile device 212 b similarly includes a local ad serving application 213 b including a local ad repository 214 b and ad presentation system 216 b , and applications 218 b.
- the ad server e.g., a local ad serving application or operating system service
- the mobile devices 212 a and 212 b can request stored ads from the remote ad system 202 in response to an event or change in state.
- the mobile device 212 a can request stored ads periodically according to particular schedule (e.g., once every twenty four hours), when the number of unseen ads stored in the ads repository 214 a falls below a predetermined threshold, or when the mobile device 212 a moves into a new geographic area.
- the mobile device 212 a can request stored ads when a data connection is idle, when a new user logs into the mobile device, or when a new application is installed.
- ads are requested at device startup.
- one or more ads are requested when a suitable ad to present is not identified in response to a request (e.g., no locally stored ads match the selection criteria for the ad request).
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example method 300 for selecting ads for presentation from a locally stored group of ads.
- the method 300 can be performed by a processor executing instructions in a computer-readable storage medium.
- the method 300 can be performed by a mobile device, for example, by an application or service integrated into the operating system of the mobile device (e.g., local ad serving application 213 a of mobile device 212 a ).
- a request for a group of ads is sent ( 302 ) to an ad system.
- the request can be sent from a user device, for example, a mobile device (e.g., from the local ad serving application).
- the request can include additional information for identifying the user and/or device generating the request as well as information to aid in selecting targeted ads for the group of ads.
- the additional information can include an identifier associated with the user's device (e.g., a device hardware identifier, IP address, or other identifying information) or an identifier associated with the user.
- the request may not include particular local ad targeting information maintained on a client device. This can allow increased user privacy by limiting information provided to an ad system.
- the group of ads is received ( 304 ).
- the received group of ads can be stored, for example, in an ad cache on the mobile device (e.g., an ad repository of the local ad serving application).
- Ads in the group of ads can be stored or made available for presentation, according to particular criteria. For example, ads in the group of ads can have an expiration date, be replaced by other ads, and/or reach a predetermined limited number of impressions to the user.
- the receiving the group of ads includes receiving additional information associated with the received ads.
- the additional information can include keywords associated with the advertisements, advertiser restrictions, presentation format, historical performance information, and location associations. The information can be used in selecting a particular ad or ads from the group of ads for presentation.
- a local ad request is received ( 306 ).
- an ad request can be received from an application executing on the mobile device.
- an application running in the mobile device e.g., a news application, game application, or other type of mobile application
- the application content can include placeholders for receiving one or more advertisements when that content is displayed.
- a web browser can load a web page that includes one or more placeholders for displaying ads. The browser, in rendering the web page, search results, or other web content can request one or more ads.
- the request is routed locally instead of to a remote ad server.
- the local ad serving application e.g., local ad serving application 213 a of FIG. 2
- the local ad serving application can receive the request.
- the request can include information to aid in identifying one or more ads responsive to the request.
- the request can include information associated with the content to be presented (e.g., the query used to generate search results, a category of a mobile application being executed, etc.).
- an application can request a local ad in response to an input such as user input (e.g., requesting a new page.)
- An ad is selected ( 308 ) for presentation from the group of ads that are locally stored.
- the ad can be selected from the group of ads based on information including targeting information provided with the ads, information provided with the ad request, as well as information local to the mobile device, such as the particular location of the mobile device, time of day, etc.
- an ad request is made to a remote ad system.
- targeting information associated with one or more of the ads in the group of ads can be compared with information associated with the request including or in addition to local targeting information.
- the request can include one or more keywords that are compared with keywords associated with ads of the group of ads.
- the local targeting information can include a particular location associated with the user (e.g., a GPS location of the user device). This location can be compared with location targets associated with particular ads during ad selection (e.g., to identify an ad matching the user's location). This location matching can be performed without providing the user's location to an external ad server.
- Other local targeting information can be similarly used in isolation from an ad server, e.g., particular user demographic information or preferences are not sent to the ad system but instead can be used to target ads locally.
- the selected ad is presented ( 310 ) to the user.
- the ad is displayed by the requesting application in an area specified for ads.
- the ad is displayed as part of downloaded content, such as web content.
- a notification is sent ( 312 ) to the remote ad system in response to the ad selection.
- a message can be generated by the mobile device when an ad from the group of ads is selected or displayed.
- the message can be updated or a second message can be generated.
- the message or messages can be sent to the ad system when they are created, or as soon as possible if the mobile device's data connection is already in use, or if a connection is unavailable (e.g., offline use).
- messages can be collected and cached, for example to be sent as a group when the mobile device is otherwise idle.
- User interactions can be stored and/or notifications of interactions can be sent to the remote ad system ( 314 ).
- User interactions with the presented ad can include user selections e.g., user clicks) or other ad interactions available for the particular ad.
- the user interactions can also include downloads of additional content in response to the ad selection.
- the user interactions can be stored and transmitted to the remote ad system.
- the user interaction information can be transmitted concurrently in time with the user interaction or at a later time (e.g., according to a schedule or based on available connectivity to the network).
- the remote ad system can store these user interactions as well as process them to generate ad statistics or other usage information. This user interaction information can be anonymized such that the particular user providing the interaction is obscured.
- An updated group of ads is requested ( 316 ) according to particular update criteria.
- the update criteria can include an elapsed amount of time or at a particular time (e.g., once at the end of a block of a number of hours or day since a previous group of ads was requested or at least once every number of hours or days), an expiration of the existing group of ads, a number of ads served from an existing group of ads (e.g., including a number of ads of a particular type such as location based, text, or with a keyword), or available network speed.
- unused ads stored on the mobile device are prioritized higher than newly requested ads.
- unused ads stored on the mobile device are discarded when the requested updated group of ads is received.
- a mobile device may contain no stored ads.
- the mobile device local ad serving application can send ( 302 ) a request for ads to the ad system.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example method 400 for providing a group of ads to a device (e.g., a mobile device).
- the method 400 can be performed by a processor executing instructions in a computer-readable storage medium.
- the method 400 can be performed by a remote ad system (e.g., the remote ad system 202 ).
- a request for a group of ads is received ( 402 ) from a user device (e.g., from a local ad serving application or operating system service on the mobile device).
- the request includes identifying the user device sending the request, for example, with device specific information or user specific information (e.g. a device identifier or user identifier).
- the request can also include further information about the user and/or device such as location, usage history, or installed applications.
- a group of ads responsive to the request are identified ( 404 ).
- information from the request and/or stored targeting information about the requesting user and/or device e.g., user profile, demographic data
- the identified group of ads are sent ( 406 ) to the user device.
- the group of ads is sent immediately, or nearly immediately, after the step 404 .
- the group of ads is temporarily stored in an outgoing message buffer, for example, until the user device sends a second message indicating sufficient idle data bandwidth to receive the group of ads.
- the group of ads can include additional ad information, for example, information used to identify relevant ads for display (e.g., keywords associated with each ad).
- the group of ads is sent for storage in an ad repository of a local ad serving application on the mobile device.
- a notification that an ad of the group of ads has been selected for presentation is received ( 408 ).
- a message can be received indicating time, location, and context of a selection for presentation.
