- the filming, and the preparation process of the virtual movie is very simple, as it does not require the performing of complicated preparations in the site, such as the accurate marking of filming spots on the site's floor or the marking of accurate lines along which the scanning apparatus must be directed.
- the prior art does require such markings (in the form of spots, or wires), that are not allowed to appear in the filmed frames or will make the filming process unwieldy or expensive.
- FIG. 1 shows a scheme of an example of an office 10 having two corridors (C 1 , C 2 ) and two rooms (A, B).
- An object of the present invention is to produce a virtual movie enabling a user to navigate, i.e., to “walk” around the office.
- the user walks up to junction J 1 , in which he may either turn right into room B or continue straight ahead.
- junction J 2 the user may either turn right into room A or go straight ahead along corridor C 1 .
- junction J 3 the user may either turn to the right or to the left within corridor C 2 .
- the user While walking along the corridor the user generally needs to have a relatively limited field of view.
- junctions J 1 , J 2 , and J 3 the user needs a wider field of view, and in rooms A and B he generally needs a field of view of 360°.
- the user may select to continue along the corridor and view up to the end of the corridor, or he may select turning into room B and see the view of room B, or he may even in some cases decide to turn back and return along the corridor C 1 .
- the office is filmed by means of a scanning apparatus which can take frames in up to a 360° field of view.
- the scanning apparatus is moved forward along the route, while capturing photographs in a relevant field of view, from filming spots.
- the scanning apparatus may capture images every distance of 10 cm. and scan a predefined field of view, by capturing frames.
- the plurality of points along the route in which the scanning (filming) is performed are indicated in FIG. 2 as nodes 13 .
- the nodes 13 schematically indicate in each specific node location the manner of scanning at that point, and provide other parameters that are specific to this node.
- the nodes are created when the scanning apparatus pass a predefined distance D, which may be, for example, every 5-50 cm, or change its angular orientation by a predefined angle ⁇ ° (for example 5°).
- a specific camera unit field of view is created.
- the term “camera unit field of view” defines herein the angular for each node, a cumulative field of views that are captured by the individual camera forming the camera unit.
- FIGS. 3 a - 3 d Several examples of nodes with their corresponding camera unit field of views are indicated in FIGS. 3 a - 3 d .
- the shaded areas indicate the camera unit field of view. For example, as shown in FIG.
- the camera unit field of view in node 15 may span 90°, i.e., between ⁇ 45° to +45° (while the 0° is defined as the North direction).
- the camera unit field of view of same nodes may alternatively be as shown in FIG. 3 b , i.e., it may span two sectors, a first one between ⁇ 45° to +45°, and a second one between 225° to 135° for enabling the user to “walk” both forward and backward.
- Such double field of view may be obtained in one filming session by mounting two separate cameras within the camera unit, one facing forward and a second facing backward on a same platform.
- 3 c shows a preferable field of view for node 18 located at junction J 1 .
- the field of view spans a sector of 270°, i.e., between ⁇ 45° to 225°.
- the field of view of node 22 may be 360°, as shown in FIG. 3 d , in order to enable viewing of all directions.
- the parameter of maximal user field of view is predefined.
- the user field of view is the angular size of a sector that the user is allowed to view while navigating. In any node, the user field of view must be smaller than the camera unit field of view, or if there are more than one sector within the node camera unit field of view, the user field of view must be smaller than any one of said camera unit field of view sectors.
- the user field of view may be defined as a sector of 60°. Therefore, and as shown in FIG. 4 , while located at node 18 , the user, for example, may position his 60° user field of view at any range between ⁇ 45° to 225°, for example between +30° to 90°.
- the user viewing direction always lies at the center of the UFOV, i.e., in this case the viewing direction is 60°.
- the scanning apparatus After planning the routes, a distance D between nodes, a change in angular orientation ⁇ , a user field of view (which, as said, is a constant parameter), and a camera unit field of view for each node, the scanning apparatus is actually ready for carrying out recording of images.
- the scanning apparatus 203 according to a preferred embodiment present invention is shown in FIG. 5 , and comprises:
- the movable platform 202 is used for supporting the imaging unit 201 , the control unit 210 , and preferably the data unit 275 (the data unit 275 may in some embodiments be mounted away from the platform).
- the Position and orientation sensors 204 continuously provide to the imaging unit 201 the x,y absolute displacement of the platform, and its angular orientation ⁇ .
- the imaging unit 201 is also provided with the parameters, D, ⁇ , camera unit field of view, and activation signal A from the control unit.
- the said D, ⁇ , and other control parameters are supplied from the control unit 210 to the imaging unit 201 via control line 260 .
- the other control parameters may include, activation/deactivation signal A, and a camera unit field of view necessary.
- the control unit 210 controls the imaging unit 201 at each node location.
- the imaging unit 201 creates the nodes, associates with them all their related data including the visual data, and provides to the data unit 275 all the data related to each node.
- the data unit 275 receives the data related with each specific node from the imaging unit, and processes the plurality of nodes in order to determine neighborhood and links between nodes, and save the resulted links in a database within the data unit 275 .
- the saved data in the database represents a virtual interactive movie based on all the nodes processed until that time.
- the said data stored in the database can be exported to another media, or such data may be similarly imported into the database, for example for updating purposes, through cannel 273 .
- the import and export operations are controlled by signals 272 that are provided by the control unit 210 .
- the camera unit 214 comprises one or more cameras (for example two cameras 223 and 224 as shown in FIG. 5 ).
- the orientation of the camera unit 214 with respect to the platform 202 may be kept fixed, or may be adjustable by means of the camera position control unit 280 (which mechanically cause rotation 290 of the camera unit 214 ). In case of a camera that can obtain images in 360°, no such rotation of the camera unit 214 is needed (and in such a case, the unit 280 is not necessary).
- the angular orientation of the camera unit 214 with respect to the platform is given to the selector 291 from the camera position control unit 280 (signal 269 indicating the angle ⁇ 2 ).
- the camera unit 214 provides images to the selector 291 continuously or upon request by the selector, as indicated by trigger 300 .
- the selector 291 creates new nodes based on signals 260 , 270 , and 270 a . There may be two modes of operation for the selector 291 , as follows:
- the selector 291 may either select images from a continuous flow of images as obtained by the camera unit 214 , or initiate an image request using trigger 300 .
- the positioning unit 204 senses at any time the coordinates x,y of the platform 202 , and its angular orientation ⁇ .
- the temporary database 244 forms as a temporary storage of the nodes data, and is used for storing such data, for example when the processing by the data unit 275 is performed off-line, or not in real-time.
- the processing unit 301 retrieves data from the temporary database 244 . Upon each retrieved node data, the processing unit 301 calculates neighborhood with respect to other nodes stored in database 302 , and upon detection of neighborhood, it forms a link. The processing unit uses the parameter of maximal distance D 1 , the parameter of minimum distance d and the parameter of maximal allowed orientation change ⁇ °, and the maximal allowed user field of view (UFOVmax) (signal 261 ) for the calculation. The neighborhood calculation will be described in detail hereinafter. Upon completion of the neighborhood calculation, the node data and its associated links are stored via channel 249 in database 302 . The import and export unit 304 is used for exporting linked data stored in the database 302 via channels 261 and 310 , or importing such linked data via channels 262 and 310 .
- the control unit 210 comprises a user interface (not shown) which enables inputting of various parameters (such as D, D 1 ⁇ , CFOVn, ⁇ , d, ⁇ 2 , C#, etc.) and providing the same to the respective other units, displaying to the operator various data concerning the status of the scanning apparatus 203 , and performing any general control of the apparatus 203 .
- the control unit 210 enables control via line 272 of importing and exporting of linked data, selecting between two scan modes (fixed camera unit 214 or rotated) via line 214 .
- the nodes within a junction have been drawn as forming a 90° junction.
- the junction may be separated into two or more routes, as described in FIG. 6 . More particularly, while reaching junction J 1 in order to turn right to room B ( FIG. 2 ), it is more close to real that the user may start turning to the right at node 27 , in an angle of about 45°. Therefore, if for example, the camera field of view of node 27 is 165° as shown, and the user maximal field of view is defined as 60°, it is logical that after moving from node 26 to node 27 the user will first turn his looking to the 45° direction with user field of view set between 15° to 75°.
- the user In entering node 28 , it is then logical that the user will turn his looking direction further to the right, i.e., to about the 60° direction, i.e., his field of view will span angles of between 30° to 90° as shown in FIG. 6 .
- the exit direction i.e., the view direction to which the user looks while leaving a node to a next one
- the entrance direction to the next node i.e., the view direction to which the user looks while entering a node from a previous one
- node 32 has two entries, one from node 31 pointing to about the ⁇ 30° direction, and a second entry from node 35 , pointing to about the 0° direction.
- the entry and exit directions to or from nodes respectively may be those as determined by the orientation of the platform 202 while entering or exiting the node. More particularly, as said the positioning unit 204 of apparatus 203 is provided with direction means (such as gimbals) that measure at any given time the orientation of platform 202 . Alternatively, the direction may be calculated from the displacement vector as also obtained from positioning unit 204 .
- the difference between an exit direction from a first node and an entry direction to a next node should not exceed a predefined value ⁇ °. Furthermore, while maintaining the said difference less than ⁇ °, and while positioning the user field of view at the said next node, the system should ensure the providing of a full span of the maximal user field of view as defined. For example in the case of FIG.
- the camera field of view of node 28 should span at least the sector between 30° to 90°, and generally much more than that in order to enable the user varying his field of view direction.
- the processing unit 301 establishes the neighborhood of nodes. Neighborhood of nodes according to the invention involves saving the direction to the other neighboring node (entry or exit), and the identification of the said other neighboring node.
- FIG. 9 describes in detail a process for determining neighborhood of nodes.
- a new node N is obtained into storage N, for example this may be a new node just recorded by the camera.
- T storage
- their coordinates are verified in step 520 to check whether they are close enough (below predefined upper limit distance D 1 ). If the answer is Yes, and the new node in N has a 360° field of view (step 530 ) and the distance between N and T is smaller than another defined, lower distance limit d (No in step 570 ), the nodes in N and T can be merged into one node of 360°.
- the camera fields of view of N and T are checked whether the following two conditions are met: (a) a step from N into T requires a change in user field of view (UFOV) direction smaller than ⁇ °; and (b) whether in that case a full maximal user field of view (UFOVmax) as defined can be provided (in our example 60°). If the answer is Yes to both said conditions, the nodes of N and T can be linked (step 550 ), and their entry and exit directions are also associated (step 560 ). If, however, in step 540 the answer is No, the two nodes cannot be linked. If in step 570 the answer is Yes, the two nodes can be linked (step 550 ).
- Another way of constructing the scheme is to track the linear route of apparatus 203 while collecting the data. Tracking the linear route of the apparatus 203 can provide a way to determine when two routes of the apparatus 203 cross.
- the recognition of a cross can be used to define the node as a junction node and to expand its neighboring list.
- FIG. 10 describes two chains of nodes, each having a different route.
- Nodes N 1 to N 4 are the nodes recorded while the apparatus 203 has traveled to the “East” and N 11 to N 13 are the nodes recorded while apparatus has traveled to the “North”.
- the N 1 to N 4 route was recorded first, it already exists in the data base and the procedure has just finished connecting N 11 to N 10 as neighbors. Receiving N 12 into the procedure will connect N 12 to N 11 as neighbors too. Yet, the neighborhood test will indicate that there is a crossover that should receive a special treatment, as follows:
- FIG. 11 describes two chains of nodes, each chain belongs to a different route.
- N 21 to N 24 are the nodes recorded while the apparatus 203 traveled to “East” and N 31 to N 34 are the nodes recorded while the apparatus 203 traveled to “North”.
- the N 21 to N 24 route was recorded first, already exists in the scheme, and the procedure has just finished connecting N 31 to N 30 (not shown) as neighbors. Receiving N 32 into the procedure will connect N 32 to N 31 as neighbors too. Yet, the neighborhood test will indicate that there is a crossover that should receive a special treatment, as follows:
- the invention assumes that the virtual movie is a collection of image data that are captured along routes within the physical site.
- This is translated in the present invention to a linked graph of nodes in which every node comprises an image data that represents a camera unit field of view.
- the connection from one node to another i.e., from a selected user field of view UFOV in a first node to another UFOV in another node) is maintained smooth.
- the links between nodes allow movement from one node to another in a smooth manner.
- the filming, as well as the forming of nodes and their links can be established in real time, and in that case, at the end of the filming and processing, the movie is essentially ready for use.
- the user may “move” from a first node, viewing a selected view sector, to a second node viewing another view sector, however in closeness enough to maintain smoothness of view.
- the “moving” of the user from one node to a next node is performed by directing the center of the user field of view to an exit direction of the present node, and advancing to the node linked to said present node by said exit.
- the entry of the user to said next node is made by showing to the user the user field of view (portion of the next node image data) when the center of the user field of view points to the entry direction of said next node.
- animation may be added to selected image data that is then displayed to the user.
- elements existing within the image data displayed to the user may be made interactive, and may cause events.
- FIG. 8 provides an alternative procedure in which fewer calculations are made, however some possible links between nodes may not be recognized, but from the user point of view, the effect may not be significant.
- the apparatus obtains along routes a collection of nodes that are linked like a chain, wherein only the first node and last node of said chain a checked for possible linking with the existing linked graph in the database. Nodes that are considered to belong to a same chain have a same C#.
- step 310 a first node of a chain is selected.
- step 320 verification with respect to the linked graph is made in order to find whether neighborhood can be established.
- step 330 If the conditions for linking with another node in the graph are met, in step 330 a link is established. In step 340 a check is made to find whether the present node is the last in the chain. If the answer is Yes, the procedure ends. If, however, the answer is now, in step 360 the first node is put in a “previous” storage (P), and in step 370 a next node is obtained and a link is made in step 380 between the nodes N and node P. In step 390 , verification is made whether the node N is the last node in the chain. If the answer is Yes, we again search within the linked graph to find neighbors, and if found, a link is made in step 410 , and the procedure ends ( 350 ). If, however, the answer in step 390 is No, the procedure returns to step 360 .

- a. During a
static platform 202 position and orientation and rotating thecamera unit 214 with respect to the platform 202.: In such a case the x,y coordinates and orientation ∝ of theplatform 202 are fixed, and while thecamera unit 214 is rotated with respect to the platform 202 (∝2 changes). Theselector 291 creates a new node index based on the present coordinates. Then, theselector 291 captures an image or a part thereof every Δ2° within the CFOVn . For example, if the CFOVn (the camera field of view for the node) is between 90° to 270°, and Δ2° is 6°, we are using only onecamera 223 of the camera unit, and the center of the field of view of thiscamera 223 is directed to 0°, thecamera unit 214 will start rotating clockwise, and theselector 291 will ignore all image data coming fromcamera 223, until the left border of thecamera 223 field of view is directed to 90°. Only thereafter theselector 291 will select an image data coming fromcamera 223 every 6° until the right border of thecamera 223 field of view will direct to the 270° direction. Theselector 291 associates the selected image data coming fromcamera 223 with the same node index as created. Theselector 291 further associates with the node index and the image data the corresponding coordinates x,y, orientation ∝ of theplatform 202, and the camera (for example, camera 223) field of view. Theselector 291 finally transfers onchannel 247 the data totemporary database 244. - b. The
platform 202 moves, while thecamera unit 214 orientation with respect to theplatform 202 is fixed (∝2 is constant): Theselector 291 creates a new node every (i) displacement D from the coordinates of the previous node; or (ii) Orientation change Δ ofplatform 202 with respect to the orientation of theplatform 202 while selecting the previous node. The selector associates the current image data with the node index as created. Theselector 291 further associates with the node index and the image data the corresponding coordinates x,y, orientation ∝ of theplatform 202, and the camera unit field of view. The apparatus may operate in two different processing modes, as described hereinafter inFIGS. 8 and 9 . For operating in the mode ofFIG. 8 , theselector 291 must associate with each node also a chain number indication C#, which arrives from thecontrol unit 210. Theselector 291 finally transfers onchannel 247 the data totemporary database 244.

- b. While progressing by the user from one node to a next one while viewing the movie, assuring that the direction of the user field of view will not be forced to change by an amount larger than a maximal, predefined angle δ; and
- c. While assuring a change of field of view smaller than δ in progressing from one node to another (as indicated in item b), a full user field of view UFOV (as defined) will be available to the user.
-
- 1. Can N2 & N3 be connected as N11 neighbors?
- 2. In case the field of view is 360°, and the distance between them is below distance D1, but above d, they are defined as neighbors (see
steps FIG. 9 ) - 3. In case the field of view is smaller than 360°, for example, 180°, the two transfer conditions are checked (step 540) and if met, a link is established (step 550);
-
- 1. Should N21 & N22 be connected as N31 neighbors?;
- 2. In this example, N21 is located at a distance above the maximal range D1 from N31, and therefore it is not a neighbor of N31;
- 3. In case the field of view of both nodes is 360°, and N33 and N22 are within the minimal range, i.e., less than d, then they are merged to one node, having a camera field of view of 360°, and the link directions are united; More particularly, deleting N33 and making N23 and N34 as N22 neighbors (Yes in
