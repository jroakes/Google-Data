Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to predicting a computer user's interests and recommending information to the computer user based on the computer user's predicted interests.
- News items are commonly distributed and consumed through online news services. Online news services seek to recommend news items that users are likely to be interested in and therefore likely to view. Typically, popular news items are recommended to users. However, popularity alone may not accurately reflect a user's interest and thus may not accurately predict what items a user will select to view.
- News items can also be recommended based on a user's selection history. However, recommending news items solely on a user's selection history fails to account for news trends. For example, during the Olympics, a user may have many selections for sports related items but the user may not have a strong preference for sports. On the other hand, the user may want to view sports related items for exceptional sporting events such as the Olympics.
- a system and method are provided to provide personalized news recommendations based on a prediction of a user's interests.
- the prediction of the user's interest is based on the user's selection history and the selection history of a community of users or general population. This enables a user to receive news recommendations for news items in the categories the user has a strong interest in and news recommendations for news items that are very popular with the general population. For example, a user may have little or no interest in sports related news items except for exceptional events such as the Olympics. In the example, the user would receive news recommendations for exceptional sporting events such as the Olympics that score high enough with the general population.
- a method includes: at a server system, obtaining first click distribution data for a first subset of a plurality of media items, each of the media items being associated with one or more item categories, determining, from the first click distribution data, likelihood of a generic user selecting media items associated with at least a subset of the item categories, obtaining second click distribution data from a particular user for a second subset of the plurality of media items, determining, based on differences between the first and second click distribution data for respective item categories, an adjusted likelihood of the particular user selecting media items associated with the at least a subset of the item categories, and transmitting to a client device associated with the particular user recommendations related to a third subset of the plurality of media items based on the adjusted likelihood and respective item categories of the third subset of the plurality of the media items.

- the server system 106 receives requests for media items (e.g., 129 ) from a user of a client device 102 , determines a collection of media items 126 that the user is likely to be interested in, and sends the collection of media items 126 to the user of the client device 102 .
- the server system 106 also receives and stores click data 127 , media items 129 and links to media items.
- server system 106 may be implemented as a distributed system of multiple computers. However, for convenience of explanation, the server system 106 is described below as being implemented on a single computer, which can be considered a single logical system.
- the click data refers to any type of information that can be determined from user selections (i.e., clicks).
- the click data (e.g., 127 , 128 ) includes selection duration (amount of time between user selection of a URL link and user exiting the document), the time at which the click occurred, the type of browser used to view the content clicked on, the location of the user performing the click (e.g., through the IP address of the user), the URL or name of the item clicked on and the type of click (search click or browse click).
- a search click is a click on a search result.
- a browse click is a click on any item that is not included in a search result.
- click data includes click positions (e.g., the position of the item in the search result).
- the click data may include those clicks where a user accessed a respective document for at least a pre-determined time interval.
- the use of the pre-determined time interval may allow the system 106 to distinguish between so-called good clicks (the user access a document that he or she may currently be interested in) and so-called bad clicks (the user inadvertently accesses a document that he or she may not currently be interested in).
- the pre-determined time interval may provide a way to filter out such bad clicks from the click data (e.g., 127 , 128 ).
- the front end 108 provides an interface between the server system 106 and the client devices 102 .
- the front end 108 is configured to receive click data 127 from the client devices 102 and media items 129 from other server systems or other client devices 102 .
- the click data 127 is stored in the user profile database 120 .
- the front end 108 is also configured to receive requests for media items and to send media items 126 to the client devices 102 .
- the front end 108 sends a feed of media items 126 to the client devices 102 .
- the front end 108 is configured to send links to media items 126 to the client devices 102 .
- the user profile database 120 stores a plurality of profiles, each profile storing for a respective user (or group of users), click data (e.g., 210 , FIG. 2A ), custom preferences (e.g., 208 , FIG. 2A ) and a user/group id (e.g., 204 , FIG. 2A ).
- a profile corresponds to a group of users organized by some criteria, such as users who consume media items in a particular language, (e.g., English, Japanese, Chinese, French, German, etc.), users from a particular geographical location (e.g., city, state, country or region), users having IP addresses within a certain range, users using a certain device (e.g., netbook, mobile phone, desktop, tablet, laptop), or any suitable combination of such criteria.
- a particular language e.g., English, Japanese, Chinese, French, German, etc.
- users from a particular geographical location e.g., city, state, country or region
- users having IP addresses within a certain range e.g., netbook, mobile phone, desktop, tablet, laptop
- a certain device e.g., netbook, mobile phone, desktop, tablet, laptop
- a respective user or group profile includes a set of predictions (e.g., 212 , FIG. 2A ).
- the set of predictions includes a list of categories and for each category the likelihood that the user will view items associated with the category. For example, a user may be likely to select health related media items 60% of the time.
- a category refers to a division or class of media items (e.g., news, sports, travel, finance). In some embodiments, the categories are also related to specific groups of users for example by geographic location or language. For example, there may be a news category for Germans speakers and a news category for French speakers.
- Each media item e.g., 126 , 129
- a category refers to a type of media item (e.g., article, video or sound recording).
- the user profile module 116 creates and maintains at least some user profiles for users of the server system 106 and stores the profiles in the user profile database 120 .
- the media item recommendation module 110 in part uses the click data 127 for a respective user stored in the user profile database 120 to determine a set of media items 126 to recommend to a user.
- the community statistics database 118 stores click data 128 and click distributions 130 for a community of users.
- a click distribution is the percentage of total clicks for each category. For example, 10% of the clicks from a community of users may have been for media items in the category of health and 90% of the clicks may have been for media items in the category of sports.
- the community of users consists of a group of users organized by some criteria, such as users who consume media items in a particular language, (e.g., English, Japanese, Chinese, French, German, etc.), users from a particular geographical location (e.g., city, state, country or region), users have IP addresses within a certain range, users using a certain device (e.g., netbook, mobile phone, desktop, tablet, laptop), or any suitable combination of such criteria.
- the server system 106 includes multiple community statistics databases 118 , or the community statistics database 118 is partitioned, with each partition or database storing records corresponding to a respective community of users.
- the community statistics module 112 creates and maintains at least some of the click data 128 and the click distributions 130 for users of the server system 106 .
- the community statistics database 118 stores click data 128 and click distributions 130 .
- the community statistics database 118 stores multiple sets of statistics each set corresponding to a predefined period of time such as a an hour, day, week, month or year.
- the media item recommendation module 110 in part uses the click data 128 and the click distributions 130 stored in the community statistics database 118 to determine a set of media items 126 that the user is likely interested in.
- the media item recommendation module 110 is configured to use the click data 127 stored in the profile database 120 , the click distributions 130 and the click data 128 from the community statistics database 118 to determine the relatively likelihood of a particular user selecting media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) associated with particular categories as compared to a generic user.
- the relatively likelihoods or predictions are stored in the particular user's profile ( 212 , FIG. 2B ).
- the media item recommendation module 110 determines a set of media items 126 from the media item repository 114 based on the relative likelihood and sends the media items 126 to the particular user by way of the front end 108 .
- the media item repository 114 stores the media items 129 including but not limited to news articles, blog postings, videos, images and sound recordings. Optionally, the media item repository 114 also stores links to news articles, links to blog postings, links to videos, links to image and links to sound recordings. In some embodiments, the media item repository 114 stores both metadata (e.g., title, description, URL, date/time, and possibly other metadata) and the content of each media item. In some embodiments, the media item repository 114 stores the metadata but not the content for each content item.

- Click type includes search clicks and browsing clicks.
- a search click is a click on a search result.
- a browse click is a click on any items that is not included in a search result.
- the generic selection data does not include search selections.
- each one of the selection statistics is given a respective weight ( 310 ). For example, a browse click may be more valuable than a search click.
- a likelihood of a generic user selecting media items (e.g., 129 , 126 ) associated with particular classes is determined ( 314 ).
- the likelihood of a generic user's selection is modeled as representing the trend of news and is used to predict a particular user's news interest.
- the click data (e.g., 128 ) and click distributions (e.g., 130 ) used to determine the likelihood of a generic users selection can correspond to any period of time.
- the likelihood of a generic user's selection for a recent period of time, such as the past day, represents the current trend of news.
- a class can be a category of media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) such as sports, health, world, local, business, entertainment, U.S., local and technology.
- a class can also be a type of media item (e.g., 126 , 129 ) such as news articles, videos or sound recordings. For each category or type of media item, it is determined how likely it is that a generic user will select media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) belonging to the respective category. Stated in another way, the distribution of the generic user's clicks is determined with respect to each category.
- the likelihood or prediction is represented as a metric such as a percentage, ratio or rating (e.g., high, medium, low). For example, a user is likely to select technology items 10% of the time.
- the likelihood of a generic user selecting media items (e.g., 126 ) associated with particular classes is determined in accordance with click data (e.g., 127 , 128 ) for a community of users.
- the community of users is typically a group of users relevant to the particular user. For example, for a user living in Mountain View, Calif. the relevant community of users may be those users living in the same city, the state of California or the United States.
- the community of users includes all users of the server system 106 .
- statistics for a group of users having some shared characteristic e.g., language, geographic region, interests, device, or IP address falling in certain ranges
- the current news trend for a particular user's location, device or some other characteristics can be determined.
- click data e.g., 127 , 128
- click distributions e.g., 130
- the click distribution 130 of the community of users determines a generic user's likelihood of selecting media items (e.g., 126 ) associated with a respective category. For example, if 33% of the total number of clicks were for sports items, the generic user is likely to select sports items 33% of the time.
- weighted click data is used to determine the generic user's likelihood of selection. For example, 3% of total number of clicks may be for health items but the determined likelihood of a generic user selecting a health item may be greater than 3% due to weighted click data.
- search clicks may be given greater weight than browse clicks. Clicks with shorter selection duration may be given greater weight than clicks with longer selection duration.
- only certain types of click data e.g., 127 , 128 ) are used to determine the generic user's likelihood of selection. For example, only clicks that have selection duration of a predefined period of time are considered or only browse clicks are considered.
- the click data 128 used to determine a generic user's likelihood of selection is stored in the community statistics database 118 .
- the media item recommendation module 110 uses the click data 128 stored in the community statistics database 118 to generate the likelihood of the generic user's selection.
- the likelihood of the generic user's selection is stored in the community statistics database 118 .
- the generic user's likelihood of selection is generated, used and then disposed of without storing the prediction in the community statistics database 118 .
- a likelihood of the particular user selecting media items (e.g., 126 ) associated with the particular classes is determined ( 316 ).
- the likelihood of the particular user's selection is modeled as the particular user's interest and is used to influence what media items 126 are recommended to the particular user.
- the likelihood of the particular user's selection of a respective category corresponds to the particular user's click distribution for the respective category. For example, if 13% of the user's clicks are for sports then the use is likelihood of interest of sports is 13%.
- the distribution of the particular user's clicks is determined for each category.
- the likelihood or prediction is represented as a metric such as a percentage, ratio or rating (e.g., high, medium, low). For example, a user is likely to select world news items 10% of the time.
- the click data (e.g., 127 , 128 ) and click distributions (e.g., 130 ) used to determine the particular user's likelihood of selection can correspond to any number of time windows. Each time window can be of any duration. In some embodiments, the particular user's likelihood for each category is determined over multiple time windows of equal length. For example, the likelihood of the particular user's selection can be determined using click data (e.g., 127 , 128 ) correspond to three time windows each having a duration of one week.
- the click data (e.g., 127 , 128 ) used to determine the particular user's likelihood of selection corresponds to a longer period of time than the period of time corresponding to the click data (e.g., 127 , 128 ) used to generate the likelihood of the generic user's selection.
- a class can be a category of media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) such as sports, health, world, local, business, entertainment, U.S., local and technology.
- a class can also be a type of media item (e.g., 126 , 129 ) such as news articles, videos or sound recordings.
- click data e.g., 127 , 128
- the click distribution e.g., 130 of the particular user determines the particular user's likelihood of selecting media items associated with a respective category. For example, if 20% of the particular user's clicks were for technology, the particular user is likely to selection technology items 20% of the time.
- a combination of weighted click data is used to determine the particular user's likelihood of selection. For example, 5% of the particular user's clicks may have been for health items but the determined likelihood of the particular user selecting health items may be greater than 5% due to weighted click data. For example, search clicks may be given greater weight than browse clicks.
- Clicks with shorter selection duration may be given greater weight than clicks with longer selection duration.
- only certain types of click data e.g., 127 , 128 ) is used to determine the particular user's likelihood. For example, only clicks that have selection duration of a predefined period of time are considered or only browse clicks are considered.
- the click data (e.g., 127 , 128 ) over a predefined period of time such as days, weeks, months or years is used to determine the likelihood of a generic user's selection and the likelihood of the particular user's selection. For example, only clicks occurring in the past month or year may be used.
- the likelihood of both the generic user and the particular user selecting media items associated with the particular classes is determined in accordance with selection data corresponding to the same time period ( 320 ).
- the likelihood of both the generic user and the particular user selecting media items associated with the particular classes is determined in accordance with selection data (e.g., 127 , 128 , 130 ) corresponding to the some criteria such as location, spoken language, device or any combination of such criteria.
- selection data e.g., 127 , 128 , 130
- a particular user with little or no associated selection statistics is given a set of selection statistics corresponding to a generic user ( 318 ).
- the click data (e.g., 127 , 128 ) used to determine a particular user's likelihood of selection is stored in the user profile database 120 .
- the media item recommendation module 110 uses the click data 127 for the particular user stored in the profile database 120 to generate the likelihood of the particular user's selection.
- the likelihood of the particular user's selection is stored in the user profile database 120 .
- the particular user's likelihood of selection is generated, used and then disposed of without storing the prediction in the user profile database 120 .
- a relative likelihood of the particular user selecting media items (e.g., 126 ) associated with the particular classes compared to the generic user is determined ( 322 ).
- the relative likelihood is a prediction of the user's interests/selections and is determined based on the particular user's interests (i.e., the likelihood of the particular user's selection) and the current news trends (i.e., likelihood of the generic user's selection). For each category or type of media item (e.g., 126 , 129 ), it is determined how likely it is that a particular user will select media items (e.g., 126 ) belonging to the respective category relative to a generic user.
- the relative likelihood is used to identify which categories of media items (e.g., 126 ) a particular user will most likely be interested in and to identify media items (e.g., 126 ) from each category to recommend to the particular user.
- a relative likelihood takes into account both the particular user's news interests and the trend of news events.
- a user may select media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) relating to an exceptional event but the user may not be interested in the category associated with the selected media items. For example, a particular user who has many selections of Olympic related items during the Olympics may not have a strong preference for sports. Thus, after the Olympics are over the particular user may not want to view sports related items.
- the user may be interested in media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) relating to exceptional events.
- Recommending media items (e.g., 126 ) based on a relative likelihood ensures that media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) relating to exceptional events are still recommended to a user. For example, during the World Cup, media items relating to the World Cup may be recommended to the particular user even though the user is not normally interested in sports.
- a relative likelihood based on a particular user's selection history also takes into account changes in the particular user's news interests.
- a particular user's news interests typically change over time.
- the user's current interests can be determined.
- the user does not need to create an interest profile since the user's interests are determined from the user's selection history.
- the Bayesian model is used to predict a user's news interests. The determination is made in two parts. First, the particular user's interest in each respective category is determined based on the particular user's selection history. Second, a prediction of the distribution of the user's future clicks is determined based on the particular user's interests and current news trends.
- a particular user's interest in each respective category is determined in two parts. First, the particular user's interest in each respective category is determined for several time periods. For example, in week 1 the particular user may have a 13% interest in sports and in week 2 the particular user may have a 30% interest in sports. Second, the particular user's determined interest (in each respective category) for several time periods is combined to compute an accurate measurement of the particular user's interests. For example, the particular user's interest in sports is determined based on the particular user's interest in sports in week 1 and week 2.
- a particular user's interest for each category (or probability of selecting media items belonging to each category c i ) during a time period t is determined using the particular user's click distribution (e.g., 130 ). Stated in another way, the particular user's interest in each category is based on the particular user's click history.
- the particular user's interest is modeled as the probability of the particular user clicking on a media item in category c i and is represented as p t (click
- category c i ).
- p t click
- category c i
- click) corresponds to the particular user's click distribution (e.g., 130 ) during time period t for the respective category c i .
- Media items relating to popular events are typically published in greater numbers and selected in greater numbers.
- the click distribution (e.g., 130 ) for a community of users is used to approximate the proportion of media items for a category c i and the trend of news.
- the probability of the particular user clicking on any article at time t is represented by p t (click).
- the value of p t (click) is the same for all of the categories.
- Equation 1 computes the user's interest for a particular time period.
- Equation ⁇ ⁇ 2 Any number of time windows M can be used and each respective time window i can be of any length.
- the particular user's interest is computed for each category c i to create a distribution of the user's interests and to identify the user's categories of strong interest.
- the prediction of a particular user's news interests is made in two parts. First, the particular user's interest in each respective is determined. Second, a prediction of the distribution of the user's future clicks is determined based on the particular user's interests and current news trends. The Bayesian rule is used to predict the user's future click distribution,
- p 0 ⁇ ( category c i
- click ) p 0 ⁇ ( click
- p 0 (category c i
- click) is the user's predicted future click distribution for category c i
- category c i ) (determined from Equation 2) into Equation 3, the equation to predict a user's future click distribution becomes
- the prediction of the particular user's interest is adjusted by adding clicks to the particular user's click history or click distribution (e.g., 130 ).
- the distribution of additional clicks corresponds to the distribution of clicks of a community of users (e.g., a generic user) during the most recent time period (or any time period). For example, if in the last 2 hours 10% of the clicks were for entertainment related media items then 10% of the additional clicks will be entertainment clicks.
- Any number of generic clicks can be added to a particular user's click history.
- any type or combination of clicks can be added to the particular user's click history. For example, only search clicks may be added.
- the adjustment ensures that media items recommended to the particular user will be influenced by the selections by the community of users. As a result, media items (e.g., 126 ) relating to exceptional events will be recommended to the user even though the user is not normally interested in category the media item is associated with. If a particular user has made very few clicks, the user's interests and media items recommended to the user (e.g., 126 ) will be largely influenced by the interests of the community of users.
- the adjusted equation that includes additional clicks in the particular user's click history is represented by,
- a prediction of a particular user's interest or click distribution is computed for each category c i to create a distribution of the user's predicted interests. From the prediction of the particular user's interest, the user's categories of strong interest are identified. Media items (e.g., 126 ) are recommended to a user based on the user's predicted interests. For example, if the predicted probability of a user selecting sports items is 20% then 20% of the media items recommended to the user will be for sports items.
- the generic users and particular user are from a same geographic region ( 324 ).
- the generic and particular users consume media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) that include a same language ( 326 ).
- spikes in selection statistics by the generic user and the particular user for media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) associated with the particular classes are not used in determining the relative likelihood of the particular user selecting media items associated with the particular classes compared to the generic user ( 328 ).
- a first collection of media items (e.g., 126 ) reflecting the relative likelihood is sent to the particular user ( 330 ).
- Each media item (e.g., 126 ) sent to the particular user is selectable by the particular user.
- the particular user's relative interest in each category determines the likelihood that media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) associated with a respective category will be sent to the user. For example, if the user's relative interest in technology is 30% then there is a 30% chance a media item (e.g., 126 ) from technology will be selected.
- only media items (e.g., 126 , 129 ) from the top N categories are selected where N can be any number greater than one.
- media items (e.g., 126 ) associated with the one or more categories are selected.
- the media items (e.g., 126 ) with the highest ranks are selected.
- the criteria for ranking pages can be any criteria such as page ranks, click rates (e.g., the total number of users who clicked on an item divided by the number of times the item was displayed to users), page views, relevance metrics, time stamps and the like.
- the number of media items sent to a user is determined by the user's custom preferences.

Abstract
Description
In
In this equation,
M represents the total number of time windows combined, i represents a respective time window and ni represents the total number of clicks made by the particular user during a respective time window. When expanded, the equation becomes,
Any number of time windows M can be used and each respective time window i can be of any length. In
In the equation, p0(category=ci|click) is the user's predicted future click distribution for category ci and p0(category=ci) is the click distribution (e.g., 130) of a generic user (or community of users) for media items belonging category ci during a recent time period (e.g., in the past hour). p0(click|category=ci) is the particular user's interest in category ci computed using
(Equation 5), where N is the total number of clicks made by the particular user and G is the total number of generic clicks added. It is noted that any model for determining a relative likelihood can be used.
