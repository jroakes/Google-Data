Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to antenna tuning and, more particularly, to compensating for phase shifts that result from antenna tuning.
- Antenna tuning involves matching the impedance of the load of the components connected to an antenna to the impedance of the antenna itself.
- the antenna impedance may be affected by the state of the communication device (e.g., cell phone), which can be based on a variety of factors, including the position of the communication device with respect to the user's body.
- the impedance of the antenna changes, it is desirable to tune the antenna (e.g. by changing the impedance of the load) in order to keep the impedances as closely matched as possible.
- the phase of the signals travelling to and from the antenna also tends to change.
- phase changes in mobile communication signals are interpreted as meaningful data which can degrade the reception of the signal, and lead to garbled transmissions.
- impedance changes and the associated phase changes can be anticipated and tolerated by the communication system.
- the channel being used for communication changes the transmit modulator and receive modulator generally perform a channel estimate which is used to set up the use of the channel by the communication device. Should the phase change occur before the channel estimate, or while the transmitter is not emitting a signal then the phase change will have no affect on the received signal at the base station. Subsequent insertion phase changes of the channel such as those due receiver mobility and multipath channel fading are also tolerated by the receiver.
- it is much more difficult for the base station receiver to react to the resulting phase shift and the quality of the received signal could be degraded.

- the Rx demodulator 122 is more challenged than the Tx modulator 120 (e.g. the Rx demodulator 120 is experiencing bit and/or frame errors as a result of it being set at a level that is too sensitive)
- the Tx modulator and Rx demodulator will be in an Rx Favored mode, such that the tuning network 112 and the phase shift network 114 will need to be adjusted to minimize the loss on the receive frequency.
- the Tx modulator 120 and the Rx demodulator 122 are equally challenged then the Tx modulator and Rx demodulator are in a Balanced state.
- the lookup table 1000 also associates the tuner and sub-band of the communication device 102 with one of three application states: Left Hand Talking Position, Balanced and Right Hand Talking Position.
- the communication device 102 is said to be in a Left Hand Talking Position state when the user is holding the communication device 102 to his head with his left hand, and in the Right Hand Talking Position state when the user is holding it to his head with his right hand.
- a balanced state is when the communication device 102 is not next the user's head, but is, for example, resting on a table.
- the sensor 111 FIG. 1 ) detects (using, for example, proximity sensing electronics) the application state and provides this information to the application processor 109 which, in turn, provides the information to the controller 108 .
- Tx and Rx states are possible in the lookup table 1000 .
- the Rx may be challenged while the Tx is enjoying very low link loss. In this mode, the antenna tuner would be adjusted to improve the Rx signal, possibly even at the expense of the transmit signal. Since the Tx signal is enjoying low loss, the transmit modulation could be set to a higher order such as 64 QAM. In this state, the base station receiver will have heightened sensitivity to phase shifts of the Tx signal.
- the phase shift network 114 could be operated to compensate for phase shifts of the Tx signal, while the tuning network 112 is operated to improve the quality of the Rx signal.
- other criteria to describe the communication state of the communication device 102 may be used to index the lookup table 1000 (e.g., be used as row, column or page labels), including the state of the antenna 110 .
- the sensor 111 detects the state of antenna 110 directly by measuring electrical properties of the antenna 110 , and provides this information to the application processor 109 which, in turn, provides the information to the controller 108 .
- the controller 108 receives antenna 110 measurement data and uses the received data to reference a look-up table.
- the look-up table contains numerical values that indicate to the controller 108 what signals to send to the phase shift network 114 and to the tuning network 112 .
- the lookup table and the values contained therein may be stored in a memory of the controller 108 .
- Sensor 111 can detect an electrical property of the antenna 110 , such as delivered power, reflected power, return loss or impedance using, for example, a directional coupler and measurement receiver. In this way, the electrical properties of the antenna 110 are measured directly to determine of the desired state of tuning network 112 and phase shift network 114 ,
- the sensor 111 can feed back the antenna state to controller 108 directly as shown in phantom in FIG. 1
- Controller 108 can include a closed loop controller for controlling tuning network 112 and phase shift network 114 .
- sensor 111 can provide complex return loss data to controller 108 , which translates the complex return loss to a corresponding value of insertion phase, and adjusts phase shift network 114 to cancel any changes in insertion phase due to changes in the state of tuning network 112 .
- the controller 108 can perform a translation of complex return loss to insertion phase of antenna 110 by calculating the ratio of insertion phase to return loss in an antenna equivalent, such as circuit 800 ( FIG. 8 ) in series with the tuning circuit 112 ( FIG. 3 ).
- the phase shift network 114 is then adjusted to provide the negative of the calculated insertion phase. In this way, changes in antenna insertion phase can be cancelled in real time, to provide a constant antenna insertion phase.
- the controller 108 receives data regarding the state of the communication system 10 ( FIG. 1 ).
- This data may include data regarding the band, sub-band, or channel of on which the communication device 102 is communicating, data regarding the state of the Tx modulator 120 and the Rx demodulator 122 ( FIG. 2 ), data regarding the application state (e.g. the physical position of the communication device 102 with respect to a user or the application being executed by the application processor 109 ), and antenna state (the state of the antenna 110 , such as delivered power, reflected power, return loss or impedance).
- the controller 108 determines whether the impedance of the tuning network 112 and the phase shift carried out by the phase shift network 114 , respectively, need to be changed. For example, the controller 108 may determine that the user has switched the phone from the left side of the head to the right side of the head. The device is transmitting on the lowest channel in the 800 MHz band (3GPP band 5). The Transmit and Received signals are balanced (both are of good quality). Upon detecting the change from the left side to the right side the controller would consult the table 1000 ( FIGS. 10A and 10B ) and recover the tuner setting for the sub band including 800 MHz lowest channel for the right side of the head, with balanced Rx and Tx.
- the controller would recall the present antenna tuner setting and calculate the phase change from the present setting to the new setting which for example may be 30 degrees.
- the controller then calculates a setting for the phase shift network that would result in a ⁇ 30 degree phase shift.
- the new antenna tuner settings and phase shift settings are applied to the circuits. The result is improved link quality with minimal phase corruption to the signal. If the impedance and/or the phase shift needs to be changed, then the controller 108 makes the appropriate change at step 1004 . If not, then the process ends.
- phase shift networks may be used.
- two phase shift networks may be employed, where the first phase shift network is placed in the transmitter branch affecting the transmission signal but having minimal or no impact on the receive signal.
- the second phase shift network may be placed in the receiver branch affecting the phase of the receive signal but having minimal or no impact on the transmit signal.
- both the transmission and receive signals may be compensated for phase changes such as changes from gripping the phone differently, or changes from operation of the antenna tuning network.
- Devices with multiple transmitters or receivers may have multiple phase shift networks.
