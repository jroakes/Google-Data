- an annotation system analyzes each of these emails for annotation purposes.
- the annotation system analyzes its content against a set of e.g., content-based annotation rules.
- the annotation of MSG 1 includes: (a) searching for various keywords (e.g., “deal,” “itinerary,” “profile”) within different components of MSG 1 (e.g., message body, attachment, header, and subject line)
- the annotation system analyzes its content against a set of e.g., syntax-based annotation rules.
- the annotation of MSG 1 includes: (a) searching for content that have a commonly known format, such as phone number (which currently have ten digits in the United States, and the first three representing an area code can be verified against a database of phone area code), or email addresses (which currently include the character“@” or the phrase “at,” or phrases such as “.com”, “.edu”, or “.org”).
- the annotation system also uses a location service. For example, emails having addresses within two miles of a user's home residence are annotated as “Home”; and photos taken (e.g., identified by metadata) within 100 miles of a user's home residence are annotated as “Local.”
- the annotation system provides search results responsive to a search query.
- search term “Local” photos taken 100 miles within the user's residence are provided as part of search results.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a computing system 100 , in accordance with some implementations.
- the computing system 100 includes one or more devices 102 (e.g., device 102 A, 102 B, 102 C, 102 D . . . , and 102 N), a communication network 104 , and annotation system 106 .
- a device 102 is a phone (mobile or landline, smart phone or otherwise), a tablet, a computer (mobile or otherwise), a fax matching, or an audio/video recorder.
- a device 102 obtains an electronic message from (e.g., drafted or generated by) a user of the device 102 , and transmits the electronic message to the annotation system 106 for annotation and optionally for clustering. For example, after determining that user Jack sends an email to user Mary, the device 102 transmits the email to the annotation system 106 , which annotates messages for Mary.
- an electronic message is a file transfer 111 - a (e.g., a photo, document, or video download/upload), an email 111 - b , an instant message 111 - c (e.g., a GOOGLE HANGOUT message), a fax message 111 - d , a social network update 111 - e (e.g., a GOOGLE PLUS update), or a voice message 111 - f.
- a file transfer 111 - a e.g., a photo, document, or video download/upload
- an email 111 - b e.g., an instant message 111 - c (e.g., a GOOGLE HANGOUT message)
- a fax message 111 - d e.g., a GOOGLE PLUS update
- voice message 111 - f e.g., a voice message 111 - f.
- a device 102 includes a messaging application 150 and optionally an analysis module 110 (similar to the analysis module 180 included in the annotation system 106 ).
- the messaging application 150 processes incoming and outgoing electronic messages into and from the device 102 , such as an outgoing email sent by a user of the device 102 to another user, and a chat message by another user to a user of the device 102 .
- the analysis module 110 resident on the device 102 balances processing load with the analysis module 170 resident on the annotation system 106 .
- the analysis module 110 on the device 102 processes the first three emails (which include plain text emails, e.g., without HTML content or attachments, and thus might require less processing power), and the analysis module 170 on annotation system 106 processes the remaining three emails (which include HTML content or attachments, and thus might require more processing power).
- the communication network 104 interconnects one or more devices 102 with each other, and with the annotation system 106 .
- the communication network 104 optionally includes the Internet, one or more local area networks (LANs), one or more wide area networks (WANs), other types of networks, or a combination of such networks.
- LANs local area networks
- WANs wide area networks
- the annotation system 106 includes an analysis module 170 , a message queue 112 , a collection of (e.g., syntax- and content-based) annotation rules 114 (e.g., user- or system-provided rules), optionally a labeling module 116 , and optionally a rule customization module 118 .
- the annotation system 106 analyzes content of incoming electronic messages (e.g., incoming messages 111 ), and associates one or more search terms (annotations) 120 to such messages. For example, after analyzing the message body of an email (e.g., MSG 1 , MSG 2 , and MSG 3 ), the annotation system 106 determines (e.g., with a 90% confidence level) that MSG 1 includes a phone number and so the search term “phone” 120 - 1 is accordingly associated with the email. In some implementations, associating a search term with an electronic message includes assigning a label (a “phone number”) to the electronic message using the labeling module 116 .
- a label a “phone number”
- the analysis module 170 analyzes content of an electronic message against e.g. syntax- and content-based annotation rules. For example, the analysis module 170 conducts a syntax (e.g., a search of digits having a phone number like format, e.g., (123)-456-7890) and content search (e.g., a search of the term “deal” or the phrase “low price”) within various content components (e.g., message body, subject line, sender/recipient, and header section) of an electronic message, and then analyzes search results using annotation rules (e.g., whether the term “deal” appears more than three times within the body of an email, or whether the phrase “low price” appears within the subject line of a fax message).
- a syntax e.g., a search of digits having a phone number like format, e.g., (123)-456-7890
- content search e.g., a search of the term “deal” or the phrase “low price”
- annotation rules
- the analysis module 170 based on the results of the analysis, the analysis module 170 identified one or more index terms for an electronic message; e.g., after determining that the term “deal” appears more than four times in the message body of an email and that the term “travel” appears in the subject line of the email, the analysis module 170 assigns index terms “Promotion” and “Travel” to the electronic message.
- an electronic message is assigned to more two or more index terms.
- an electronic message is assigned to one index term only. For example, a message only appears in a search for “Travel” emails, but not in that of “Promotion” emails.
- the analysis module 110 is a software or hardware component resident on the device 102 , such as a software package/application or a hardware chipset, for clustering messages, and analysis module 170 on server 106 is not used. In some implementations, the analysis module 110 is not present and analysis module 170 , which exists separate from or independent of the device 102 is used (e.g., a GOOGLE mail annotation server that is connected with but not part of the device 102 , e.g., in the manner depicted in FIG. 1 with analysis module 170 ).
- the analysis module 110 is a software or hardware component resident on the device 102 , such as a software package/application or a hardware chipset, for annotating messages, and analysis module 170 on server 106 is also used. That is, both analysis module 110 on device 102 and analysis module 170 on server 106 are used.
- some annotation rules 114 e.g. user-specified rules
- some annotation rules 114 e.g., system-provided rules
- the message queue 112 stores one or more electronic messages awaiting analysis by the analysis module 170 , such as MSG 4 , MSG 5 , MSG 6 , . . . and MSG n ( FIG. 1 , 113 - 4 . . . 113 - n ).
- the message queue 112 includes different types of electronic messages, such as a file transfer 111 - a (e.g., a photo, document, or video upload), an email 111 - b , an instant message 111 - c (e.g., a Google HANGOUT message), a fax message 111 - d , a social network update 111 - e (e.g., a GOOGLE PLUS update), or a voice message 111 - f.
- a file transfer 111 - a e.g., a photo, document, or video upload
- an email 111 - b e.g., an instant message 111 - c (e.g., a Google HANGOUT message)
- a fax message 111 - d e.g., a GOOGLE PLUS update
- voice message 111 - f e.g., a voice message 111 - f.
- the collection of (e.g., content-based) annotation rules 114 include system- and user-specified annotation rules.
- system-provided rules are determined by the annotation system 106 (e.g., default annotation rules), and user-specified rules are customized (e.g., added, removed, or modified) by a user.
- the labeling module 116 labels an electronic message using a flag in accordance with to which annotations associated with an electronic message. For example, after an email is annotated as “Travel” or “Promotion,” the labeling module 116 assigns both the label “Travel” or the label “Promotion” to the electronic message, and makes these labels available (visually) to users.
- message labels may simplify searches and selective retrievals of electronic messages, e.g., electronic messages may be searched, and retrieved, both using labels.
- a rule customization module 118 enables a user to customize (e.g., add, remove, and modify) annotation rules within the collection of annotation rules 114 .
- These approaches enable customizing annotation rules to a user's specific need. For instance, users residing within the continental U.S. may consider an electronic message having the term “Alaska” associated with a “Travel” message (e.g., an electronic message with top-rated Alaska destinations) or a “Promotion” message cluster (e.g., an electronic message including promotional materials for trips to Alaska); users residing in the state of Alaska, however, might consider such electronic message “Local” or “Home” in nature and classify it as such.
- a user can personalize existing annotation rules.
- a user living Alaska can modify annotation rules 114 such that electronic messages including the term “Alaska” are annotated as “Home” or “Local” (associated with the search term “Home” or “Local,” or both, or their synonyms)—rather than the search term “Promotion” or “Travel” cluster, as users living in the continental U.S. may do.
- this example is addressed in system-defined rules by examining the geographic source or geographic destination of the electronic message, or by otherwise determining a way to associate a geographic location with the electronic message (e.g., by recognizing an address within the message) and applying a geographic dependent annotation rule to the message.
- the geographic source or geographic destination is approximated based on an origination IP address or a destination IP address. To illustrate, if a geographic destination for a respective electronic message is within the continental U.S., the term “Alaska” within the message is used to assign the electronic message to a “Travel” cluster. If a geographic destination for a respective electronic message is within the state of Alaska, the term “Alaska” within the message is used to associate with search terms such as “Travel” or “Trip.”

Abstract
Systems and methods for annotating electronic messages are disclosed. In some implementations, a method includes, at a computing device, analyzing content of a first electronic message against a set of annotation rules; and in accordance with the analyzing: identifying a search term not included in the content of the first electronic message as associated with the first electronic message. In some implementations, the first set of annotation rules includes one of: a content based annotation, a syntax based annotation rule, and a hybrid annotation rule. In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes one of: a text item, an audio item, an image item, and a video item.
Description
- The implementations disclosed herein relate generally to annotating electronic messages.
- Nowadays, a user often receives hundreds, if not thousands, of electronic messages a day. For ease of reference (e.g., search) by a user, it may be preferred that messages are labeled as belonging to a particular content category (e.g., “contact numbers”) or having a particular type of content (e.g., a friend Joe's email), even though these message themselves do not include these term.
- Difficulties abound with offering such a feature, however. One technical problem is that annotating messages with search terms that are not present within the messages involves analysis of the content of the messages and identifying appropriate annotation based on certain rules.
- The above identified technical problems are addressed by the systems and methods disclosed herein.
- The implementations disclosed herein are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings. Like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the drawings.

The one or more programs comprise instructions, which when executed by a computing system with one or more processors, cause the computing system to execute a method of analyzing content of a first electronic message against a set of annotation rules and, in accordance with the analyzing, identifying a search term not included in the content of the first electronic message as associated with the first electronic message. In some implementations, the set of annotation rules includes one of: a content based annotation, a syntax based annotation rule, and a hybrid annotation rule. In some implementations, the search term is specified by a user. In some implementations, the search term is identified automatically without user intervention.

- The implementations described herein provide various technical solutions to improving access to electronic messages, and in particular to the above-identified problems, by providing techniques for annotating electronic messages and for providing annotated electronic messages responsive to a user search.
- As a non-limiting example, after obtaining a string of emails (e.g., MSG 1, MSG 2, and MSG 3), an annotation system analyzes each of these emails for annotation purposes. In some cases, starting with MSG 1, the annotation system analyzes its content against a set of e.g., content-based annotation rules. In some cases, the annotation of MSG 1 includes: (a) searching for various keywords (e.g., “deal,” “itinerary,” “profile”) within different components of MSG 1 (e.g., message body, attachment, header, and subject line)
- In some cases, starting with MSG 1, the annotation system analyzes its content against a set of e.g., syntax-based annotation rules. In some cases, the annotation of MSG 1 includes: (a) searching for content that have a commonly known format, such as phone number (which currently have ten digits in the United States, and the first three representing an area code can be verified against a database of phone area code), or email addresses (which currently include the character“@” or the phrase “at,” or phrases such as “.com”, “.edu”, or “.org”).
- In some cases, the annotation system also uses a location service. For example, emails having addresses within two miles of a user's home residence are annotated as “Home”; and photos taken (e.g., identified by metadata) within 100 miles of a user's home residence are annotated as “Local.”
- Next, based on annotations with which an email has been associated with (e.g., the term “Local”, the term “Home”, or both), the annotation system provides search results responsive to a search query. When a user enters a search term “Local”, photos taken 100 miles within the user's residence are provided as part of search results.
- Providing at least these technical effects, the proposed technical solutions described in the present application address the above-identified technical problems in at least the following ways.
- Electronic messages relevant to a user's search are provided, even though the messages do not always literally include a user provided search term, thereby improving search effectiveness and efficiency.
- Additional details of implementations are now described in relation to the Figures.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating acomputing system 100, in accordance with some implementations. - In some implementations, the
computing system 100 includes one or more devices 102 (e.g.,device communication network 104, andannotation system 106. In some implementations, adevice 102 is a phone (mobile or landline, smart phone or otherwise), a tablet, a computer (mobile or otherwise), a fax matching, or an audio/video recorder. - In some implementations, a
device 102 obtains an electronic message from (e.g., drafted or generated by) a user of thedevice 102, and transmits the electronic message to theannotation system 106 for annotation and optionally for clustering. For example, after determining that user Jack sends an email to user Mary, thedevice 102 transmits the email to theannotation system 106, which annotates messages for Mary. - In some implementations, an electronic message is a file transfer 111-a (e.g., a photo, document, or video download/upload), an email 111-b, an instant message 111-c (e.g., a GOOGLE HANGOUT message), a fax message 111-d, a social network update 111-e (e.g., a GOOGLE PLUS update), or a voice message 111-f.
- In some implementations, a
device 102 includes amessaging application 150 and optionally an analysis module 110 (similar to the analysis module 180 included in the annotation system 106). In some implementations, themessaging application 150 processes incoming and outgoing electronic messages into and from thedevice 102, such as an outgoing email sent by a user of thedevice 102 to another user, and a chat message by another user to a user of thedevice 102. In some implementations, theanalysis module 110 resident on thedevice 102 balances processing load with theanalysis module 170 resident on theannotation system 106. For example, after a user requests to send out a total of six emails, theanalysis module 110 on thedevice 102 processes the first three emails (which include plain text emails, e.g., without HTML content or attachments, and thus might require less processing power), and theanalysis module 170 onannotation system 106 processes the remaining three emails (which include HTML content or attachments, and thus might require more processing power). - In some implementations, the
communication network 104 interconnects one ormore devices 102 with each other, and with theannotation system 106. In some implementations, thecommunication network 104 optionally includes the Internet, one or more local area networks (LANs), one or more wide area networks (WANs), other types of networks, or a combination of such networks. - In some implementations, the
annotation system 106 includes ananalysis module 170, amessage queue 112, a collection of (e.g., syntax- and content-based) annotation rules 114 (e.g., user- or system-provided rules), optionally alabeling module 116, and optionally arule customization module 118. - In some implementations, the
annotation system 106 analyzes content of incoming electronic messages (e.g., incoming messages 111), and associates one or more search terms (annotations) 120 to such messages. For example, after analyzing the message body of an email (e.g.,MSG 1,MSG 2, and MSG 3), theannotation system 106 determines (e.g., with a 90% confidence level) thatMSG 1 includes a phone number and so the search term “phone” 120-1 is accordingly associated with the email. In some implementations, associating a search term with an electronic message includes assigning a label (a “phone number”) to the electronic message using thelabeling module 116. - In some implementations, the
analysis module 170 analyzes content of an electronic message against e.g. syntax- and content-based annotation rules. For example, theanalysis module 170 conducts a syntax (e.g., a search of digits having a phone number like format, e.g., (123)-456-7890) and content search (e.g., a search of the term “deal” or the phrase “low price”) within various content components (e.g., message body, subject line, sender/recipient, and header section) of an electronic message, and then analyzes search results using annotation rules (e.g., whether the term “deal” appears more than three times within the body of an email, or whether the phrase “low price” appears within the subject line of a fax message). - In some implementations, based on the results of the analysis, the
analysis module 170 identified one or more index terms for an electronic message; e.g., after determining that the term “deal” appears more than four times in the message body of an email and that the term “travel” appears in the subject line of the email, theanalysis module 170 assigns index terms “Promotion” and “Travel” to the electronic message. In some implementations, as explained in the above example, an electronic message is assigned to more two or more index terms. These approaches are advantageous, because sometimes an electronic message can be reasonably (e.g., objectively) considered as falling into two or more content categories. In one example, an email promoting a discount cruise trip is considered by some users as relevant to both “Travel” and “Promotion”; as such, the email is responsive to a search of “Travel” emails as well as to that of “Promotion” emails. - In some implementations, however, an electronic message is assigned to one index term only. For example, a message only appears in a search for “Travel” emails, but not in that of “Promotion” emails. These approaches are also advantageous, because user access may be simplified and user confusion minimized, when an electronic message is assigned to a single index term.
- In some implementations, the
analysis module 110 is a software or hardware component resident on thedevice 102, such as a software package/application or a hardware chipset, for clustering messages, andanalysis module 170 onserver 106 is not used. In some implementations, theanalysis module 110 is not present andanalysis module 170, which exists separate from or independent of thedevice 102 is used (e.g., a GOOGLE mail annotation server that is connected with but not part of thedevice 102, e.g., in the manner depicted inFIG. 1 with analysis module 170). In still other implementations, theanalysis module 110 is a software or hardware component resident on thedevice 102, such as a software package/application or a hardware chipset, for annotating messages, andanalysis module 170 onserver 106 is also used. That is, bothanalysis module 110 ondevice 102 andanalysis module 170 onserver 106 are used. For instance, in some such embodiments some annotation rules 114 (e.g. user-specified rules) are implemented ondevice 102 and implemented usinganalysis module 110 and some annotation rules 114 (e.g., system-provided rules) are implemented onserver 106 and implemented usinganalysis module 170. - In some implementations, the
message queue 112 stores one or more electronic messages awaiting analysis by theanalysis module 170, such asMSG 4,MSG 5,MSG 6, . . . and MSG n (FIG. 1 , 113-4 . . . 113-n). In some implementations, themessage queue 112 includes different types of electronic messages, such as a file transfer 111-a (e.g., a photo, document, or video upload), an email 111-b, an instant message 111-c (e.g., a Google HANGOUT message), a fax message 111-d, a social network update 111-e (e.g., a GOOGLE PLUS update), or a voice message 111-f. - In some implementations, the collection of (e.g., content-based)
annotation rules 114 include system- and user-specified annotation rules. In some implementations, system-provided rules are determined by the annotation system 106 (e.g., default annotation rules), and user-specified rules are customized (e.g., added, removed, or modified) by a user. - In some implementations, the
labeling module 116 labels an electronic message using a flag in accordance with to which annotations associated with an electronic message. For example, after an email is annotated as “Travel” or “Promotion,” thelabeling module 116 assigns both the label “Travel” or the label “Promotion” to the electronic message, and makes these labels available (visually) to users. These approaches are advantageous, because message labels may simplify searches and selective retrievals of electronic messages, e.g., electronic messages may be searched, and retrieved, both using labels. - In some implementations, a
rule customization module 118 enables a user to customize (e.g., add, remove, and modify) annotation rules within the collection of annotation rules 114. These approaches enable customizing annotation rules to a user's specific need. For instance, users residing within the continental U.S. may consider an electronic message having the term “Alaska” associated with a “Travel” message (e.g., an electronic message with top-rated Alaska destinations) or a “Promotion” message cluster (e.g., an electronic message including promotional materials for trips to Alaska); users residing in the state of Alaska, however, might consider such electronic message “Local” or “Home” in nature and classify it as such. - In some implementation cases, therefore, a user can personalize existing annotation rules. Continuing with the above example, in some cases, a user living Alaska can modify
annotation rules 114 such that electronic messages including the term “Alaska” are annotated as “Home” or “Local” (associated with the search term “Home” or “Local,” or both, or their synonyms)—rather than the search term “Promotion” or “Travel” cluster, as users living in the continental U.S. may do. - In some embodiments, this example is addressed in system-defined rules by examining the geographic source or geographic destination of the electronic message, or by otherwise determining a way to associate a geographic location with the electronic message (e.g., by recognizing an address within the message) and applying a geographic dependent annotation rule to the message. In some embodiments, the geographic source or geographic destination is approximated based on an origination IP address or a destination IP address. To illustrate, if a geographic destination for a respective electronic message is within the continental U.S., the term “Alaska” within the message is used to assign the electronic message to a “Travel” cluster. If a geographic destination for a respective electronic message is within the state of Alaska, the term “Alaska” within the message is used to associate with search terms such as “Travel” or “Trip.”

FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating a method for clustering electronic messages in a computing system, e.g., implemented atdevice 102, at theannotation system 106, in accordance with some implementations. - In some implementations, the
device 102A sends (402) a first electronic message to thedevice 102B, via theannotation system 106. - In some implementations, after detecting (404) that the first message has arrived, the annotation system analyzes (406) the first message against a first set of annotation rules. In some implementations, the set of annotation rules includes one of a content based annotation, a syntax based annotation rule, and a hybrid annotation rule. In some implementations, the search term is specified by a user. In some implementations, the search term is identified automatically without user intervention.
- In some implementations, the annotation system annotates (410) the first message. In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes one of: a text item, an audio item, an image item, and a video item. In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes an audio item and analyzing content of the electronic message includes: applying a speech recognition technique to the audio item to produce a corresponding text item. In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes an image item having one or more characters and analyzing content of the electronic message includes applying an optical character recognition technique to the image item to identify the one or more characters. In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes an image item having one or more objects and analyzing content of the electronic message includes applying an object recognition technique to the image item to identify the one or more objects. In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes a video item having one or more objects and analyzing content of the electronic message includes applying an object recognition technique to the video item to identify the one or more objects.
- In some implementations, the annotation system annotates (412) a first message cluster that includes the first message. Clusters are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/139,205, filed Dec. 23, 2013, entitled “Systems and Methods for Clustering Electronic Messages,” which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Whereas conversations aggregate electronic messages based on content relatedness (e.g., header content relatedness) between messages already in the conversations and messages being considered for assignment to conversations, electronic messages are organized into clusters without regard to content relatedness between messages within the clusters and messages being considered for assignment to the clusters. For example, a string of messages from and to a first and second user or group of users are good candidates for inclusion in a conversation because of the content relatedness between the messages in the conversations and the messages being considered for the conversations. However, absent some additional criterion or factor, the relatedness in the source and destination of these messages does not serve as a basis for inclusion in the same cluster.
- In some implementations, the annotation system indexes (414) the first message, and/or the first message cluster in anticipation of a user search. This indexing makes use of the annotation (additional search term) that was used to annotate the first message. More specifically, the first message and/or the first message cluster is indexed in such a manner that the annotation (additional search term) is deemed to be in the first message and/or the first message cluster in accordance with the set of annotation rules, even when, in fact, the search term is not explicitly present in the first message and/or first message cluster.
- In some implementations, a user of the
device 102B enters a search term, textual or visual query search, and as a result thedevice 102B searches a plurality of electronic messages (e.g. a corpus of electronic messages) that includes, among other things, the annotated first message and/or first annotated first message cluster that includes the search term that the user of thedevice 102B entered because the search term entered by the user matches or is equated to the annotation added to the first message and/or first annotated message cluster. Accordingly, there is provided a search result, the first message (and/or the first message cluster), to the user of thedevice 102B. -
FIGS. 5A-5B are example flow charts illustrating methods for annotating electronic messages, in accordance with some implementations. - In some implementations, the
method 500 for annotating electronic messages is performed at a computing system, e.g., thedevice 102. In some implementations, thedevice 102 includes one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors. In some implementations, the electronic device includes what is referred to in some contexts as a client-side device. In some implementations, the electronic device includes a smartphone (e.g., a GOOGLE ANDROID phone), a mobile computer (e.g., a GOOGLE NEXUS computer, a laptop and a notebook), or a desktop computer. - In some implementations, a method for analyzing electronic messages includes, at a computing device, analyzing (502) content of a first electronic message against a set of annotation rules and, in accordance with the set of annotation rule (520) (
FIG. 5B ) a search term not included in the content of the first electronic message as associated with the first electronic message. - In some implementations, the set of annotation rules includes (504) one of: a content based annotation, a syntax based annotation rule, and a hybrid annotation rule. In some implementations, the search term is specified by a user (506). In some implementations, the search term is identified automatically without user intervention (508). In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes (510) one of: a text item, an audio item, an image item, and a video item.
- In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes (512) an audio item and analyzing content of the electronic message includes: applying a speech recognition technique to the audio item to produce a corresponding text item.
- In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes (514) an image item having one or more characters; and analyzing content of the electronic message includes: applying an optical character recognition technique to the image item to identify the one or more characters.
- In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes (516) an image item having one or more objects and analyzing content of the electronic message includes applying an object recognition technique to the image item to identify the one or more objects.
- In some implementations, the content of the electronic message includes (518) a video item having one or more objects; and analyzing content of the electronic message includes applying an object recognition technique to the video item to identify the one or more objects.
- In some implementations, the method also includes (522), in accordance with the analyzing: identifying the search term as associated with a second electronic message, where the first electronic message and the second electronic message are within a message cluster.
- In some implementations, the method also includes (524), responsive to a user query including the search term, providing one or more electronic messages within the message cluster.
