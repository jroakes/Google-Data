Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to parallel reality gaming, and more particularly, to a system and method for determining and assigning scores to virtual points of interest in a parallel reality game.
- Modern games such as games designed for a personal computer, a mobile device, or a portable or stationary gaming console, often take place in a virtual world.
- some games may be set in a fantasy world or take place in a virtual world that contains few similarities to the real world.
- some individuals may not be interested in such games because their associated virtual worlds do not parallel real life. In this sense, some individuals may hesitate to play such games because they are not attracted to participating in a world that does not exist.
- Parallel reality games offer an opportunity to play a game that is set in a virtual world that mimics, or parallels, the real world to varying degrees.
- a parallel reality game can have a virtual world that parallels at least a portion of the geography of the real world. In this case, the game has a more natural feeling and is more engaging for individuals who prefer to focus on real-world activities or places.
- parallel reality games can provide an opportunity for individuals who otherwise would not enjoy playing games to enjoy and participate in the parallel reality game.
- a challenge presented by creating and providing parallel reality games is ensuring that the virtual world realistically parallels the real world. More particularly, ensuring that game players feel that the virtual world is naturally or innately connected to the real world can improve the game playing experience. For example, game players can be provided with a sense that game actions or game developments are reflective of real world events or real world activities and vice versa.
- One response to such a challenge can be to incorporate real world data into the creation or maintenance of the virtual world associated with the parallel reality game.
- a plurality of points of interest can exist in the real world. Therefore, a plurality of parallel virtual points of interest can be provided in the virtual world so that the virtual world more accurately parallels the real world.
- a game player is presented with familiar locations and points of interest, such as businesses, buildings, parks, or other points of interest, increasing the feeling that the virtual world is connected to the real world.
- the real world points of interest can have particular characteristics or attributes. For example, different real world points of interest may have different levels of importance or popularity within the game-playing community. Reflecting such real world attributes with respect to the virtual points of interest can improve the parallel reality game play experience.
- One exemplary aspect is directed to a computer-implemented method of assigning a score to a virtual point of interest included in a virtual world associated with a parallel reality game.
- the virtual world can have a geography that parallels at least a portion of the real world and the virtual point of interest can parallel a real world point of interest.
- the method can include accessing a data source to obtain activity data concerning online activity associated with the real world point of interest.
- the method can also include determining a score for the virtual point of interest based on the activity data.
- the method can include modifying game data associated with the parallel reality game to assign the score to the virtual point of interest.
- exemplary aspects are directed to systems, apparatus, non-transitory computer-readable media, and devices for determining and assigning a score to a virtual point of interest included in a parallel reality game.

- FIG. 5 depicts a flow chart of an exemplary computer-implemented method for assigning a score to a virtual point of interest included in a virtual world associated with a parallel reality game according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure.
- the present disclosure is generally directed to a scoring metric for determining and assigning a value or score to virtual points of interest in a parallel-reality game.
- the parallel reality game can include a virtual world that parallels at least a portion of the real world such that the virtual points of interest parallel real world points of interest.
- a scoring engine can implement the scoring metric to determine and assign the score to the virtual points of interest.
- the scoring engine can determine the score based on signals incorporated from web-based technology, social media platforms, and other suitable data sources such as a location database.
- the incorporated signals can indicate a reputation, importance, or popularity that the users of such applications place upon the point of interest.
- the score of a virtual point of interest in the game can track the importance of the real-world point of interest to the game-playing community, as indicated by associated online activity.
- the scoring metric can be tailored to meet any game design or to achieve any overarching game goals.
- the scoring metric can incorporate signals in both a positive and negative fashion, such that the resulting score is tailored to the game designer's goals.
- selected signals can carry increased weight in order to incentivize player activity with the data source providing such selected signals.
- a player interested in increasing or otherwise altering a score in the game can be incentivized to interact with a selected web-based technology or social media platform.
- Exemplary signals that can be incorporated into the scoring metric by the scoring engine include a plurality of online interactions or activity.
- signals can be collected from geographic information systems, search engines, social media, or other suitable applications or services, including, but not limited to, directories, reviews, location databases, commercial databases, or other suitable data.
- the scores assigned to the points of interest using the scoring metric can be updated dynamically as game-players or other web-users interact with, discuss, or search for the point of interest.
- the scores can be provided to any game or style of game in which it would be desirable to score virtual points of interest within a virtual world having a geography that parallels at least a portion of the real-world.
- the result of using the present scoring metric is that any game that considers real world points of interest as core data becomes able to express the value of those points of interest in a way that makes sense from the perspective of a game player.
- the parallel virtual points of interest reflect the importance and popularity of points of interest in the real world, as influenced by the game-playing community.
- the user can be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location).
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location.
- certain data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored, incorporated into a signal, or otherwise used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identify can be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location can be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary scoring engine 102 and associated signals 106 - 118 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure.
- Scoring engine 102 can determine a score for a virtual point of interest included in a virtual world of a parallel reality game according to a scoring metric 104 . More particularly, scoring engine 102 can determine a score for virtual points of interest based upon the application of signals 106 - 118 to scoring metric 104 . The score can be assigned to the virtual point of interest by generating or otherwise modifying game data 120 . In particular, point of interest score data 122 can be generated or otherwise modified such that the score determined by scoring engine 102 is assigned to the virtual point of interest and stored for use by the parallel reality game.
- a virtual point of interest can be the parallel virtual counterpart to any real world point of interest.
- a “real world point of interest” refers to any feature, landmark, point of interest, or other object or event associated with a geographic location. Exemplary points of interest include, without limitation, a business, restaurant, retail outlet, coffee shop, bar, music venue, attraction, museum, theme park, arena, stadium, festival, building, monument, road crossing, clearing in a forest, topographical feature, organization, entity, or other suitable point of interest.
- real world points of interest can be defined or identified by a player and incorporated into game data based upon a player request or player-provided information. Generally, any real world feature can be represented by a parallel virtual point of interest in the virtual world.
- a score can be determined and assigned to each virtual point of interest by scoring engine 102 .
- Scoring engine 102 can be implemented using any suitable form of computing device.
- suitable computing device can include one or more processors, microprocessors, microcomputers, memory, network interface or other suitable components for implementing scoring engine 102 .
- a memory can store computer-readable instructions that when executed by the computing device cause the computing device to perform operations which implement scoring engine 102 .
- scoring engine 102 can be implemented on a server and one or more remote gaming devices can access scoring engine 102 over a network.
- scoring engine 102 can be implemented directly on the same machine providing game play to the player, including, without limitation, a mobile phone, a tablet, a desktop computer, a dedicated gaming platform, or other suitable computing devices. In such instance, the scoring engine can be accessed as a program library.
- Scoring engine can determine a score for a virtual point of interest according to scoring metric 104 .
- Scoring metric 104 can be included in hardware, firmware, and/or software controlling a general purpose processor.
- scoring metric 104 can be program code files stored on a storage device, loaded into memory and executed by a processor or can be provided from computer program products, for example, computer executable instructions that are stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium such as a RAM hard disk or optical or magnetic media.
- the score determined by scoring engine 102 according to scoring metric 104 can take many various forms, each of which can be used to satisfy the present disclosure.
- Exemplary scores can include, without limitation, a numerical score on a scale of one hundred (78/100); a numerical score without an associated ceiling or scale (10,534); a monetary score ($34.67); a tiered score (Level 5); a categorical or descriptive score (Top Performer); or any other suitable form of score.
- scores can be modified or tailored according to a particular game in which such scores are implemented. For example, scores can include bonuses, combos, or other modifiers. As another example, different scores can be provided to each player based on player customization and game play.
- signals 106 - 118 can be collected from one or more web-based technology or social media applications or services or from other information providers, such as location databases or commercial databases.
- signals 106 - 118 can be collected over a network, such as the Internet, according to known techniques.
- Signals 106 - 118 can indicate a reputation, importance, or popularity that the users of such applications place upon the real world point of interest.
- signals 106 - 118 can indicate a geographic region or location or other geographic information concerning the real world point of interest or its surroundings.
- the score of a virtual point of interest in the game can track the importance of the real-world point of interest to the game-playing community, as indicated by the associated online activity and other suitable information represented by signals 106 - 118 .
- signals 106 - 118 are exemplary in nature and that the present disclosure is not limited to such signals.
- any suitable signals can be incorporated into scoring metric 104 and used by scoring engine 102 , including any signals that provide an indication of an online reputation or popularity of a real world point of interest.
- signals 106 - 118 will be discussed with reference to virtual points of interest 204 - 212 depicted in game interface 200 of FIG. 2 , such discussion is provided only for exemplary purposes and the present disclosure is not limited to the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2 .
- scoring engine 102 can incorporate one or more signals 106 from a geographic information system.
- a geographic information system can provide for the archiving, retrieving, and manipulation of geospatial data that has been indexed and stored according to geographic coordinates, such as latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates.
- a geographic information system can combine geospatial data such as satellite imagery, photographs, maps, models, tables, and other geospatial data with Internet search capability so as to enable a user to view imagery of the planet (e.g. as a portion of a virtual globe) and related information (e.g., locales such as islands and cities; and points of interest such as local restaurants, hospitals, parks, hotels, and schools).
- data concerning the real-world point of interest can be included in the geographic information system and provided to a user of the geographic information system.
- Signal 106 can describe a popularity or frequency of interaction associated with a real world point of interest represented in a geographic information system. As an example, signal 106 can describe the number of instances in which a placemark associated with the real world point of interest has been returned as a search result in response to a user search query.
- a user of a geographic information system can input a search query into the geographic information system in an attempt to identify the location of one or more real world points of interest or to become aware of real world points of interest in a given area.
- search query can be of varying scope or specificity.
- Exemplary search queries can range from directly naming the real world point of interest, such as “Balboa Beach Bar, 123 Grand Canal St” to generally describing a location and/or category of point of interest, such as “bookstore,” “martinis,” or “coffee, Balboa Island, Calif.”
- a geographic information system can return a plurality of placemarks in response to the search query.
- Such placemarks can indicate the location of one or more real world points of interest that are relevant to the search query. For example, in the event that a user of a geographic information system entered the search query “Balboa Beach Bar, 123 Grand Canal St,” the geographic information system can return a placemark indicating the location of the real world point of interest, Balboa Beach Bar.
- the geographic information system can return a plurality of placemarks indicating the location of various coffee shops which may be relevant to the specific search query.
- the plurality of placemarks can include a placemark indicating the location of a real world point of interest, Surf's Up Coffee.
- a geographic information system can return a placemark associated with a real world point of interest as a search result in response to a user search query.
- Signal 106 can describe the number of instances in which such a placemark is returned as a search result and can be incorporated into scoring metric 104 .
- the score assigned to a virtual point of interest by scoring engine 102 is positively correlated to the number of instances in which a placemark associated with the parallel real world point of interest is returned as a search result by the geographic information system.
- a higher score will be awarded if the real world point of interest is frequently returned as a search result by the geographic information system.
- a lower score will be awarded if the real world point of interest is infrequently or never returned as a search result.
- placemark has been used herein, one of skill in the art, in light of the disclosures contained herein, will appreciate that such term is exemplary in nature.
- an exemplary geographic information system can return results in other forms than placemarks, including in a textual format.
- Signal 106 can generally describe the number of instances in which a point of interest is implicated in a search result, independent of the particular format in which the point of interest is presented to the user.
- signal 106 can describe the number of instances in which the real world point of interest is depicted in a geographic information system, regardless of whether the real world point of interest is depicted as a search result or simply during the routine display of geographic information. For example, a user that zooms in, pans to, or otherwise requests or loads a certain geographic area can be presented with indicators of some or all points of interest that are located in such geographic area, without having entered a specific search query.
- Signal 106 can reflect the number of instances in which an indicator associated with a real world point of interest is displayed in any fashion, including instances in which the indicator is presented during the routine display of geographic information. Generally, a greater number of instances in which the real world point of interest is depicted or otherwise indicated in the geographic information system can result in a higher score assigned to the parallel virtual point of interest in the game by scoring engine 102 . Likewise, a lesser number of instances in which the real world point of interest is depicted or otherwise indicated in the geographic information system can result in a lower score.
- signal 106 can describe the number of instances in which a user selects the point of interest when returned as a search result or otherwise requests more information concerning the point of interest, known in some instances as a “click through rate.”
- a point of interest can be selected by a user of a geographic information system in a number of fashions, including, for example, clicking on the placemark or requesting directions to the location of the point of interest.
- scoring metric 104 can accord more weight to click throughs or click through rates than it does to the raw number of instances in which the point of interest is depicted. However, in general, an increase in click throughs, click through rates, or number of depictions all have a positive impact on the score determined by scoring engine 102 according to scoring metric 104 .
- signal 106 can describe the number of instances in which data associated with the real world point of interest and stored in the geographic information system is generated or otherwise modified by one or more users of the geographic information system.
- scoring engine 102 can incorporate one or more signals 108 from a search engine.
- signal 108 can describe the number of instances in which a real world point of interest or an item of content associated with the real world point of interest is returned as a result by the search engine.
- a user of a search engine can enter a search query in an attempt to obtain a listing of web pages or other online content relevant to the subject of the search query.
- search query can be of varying scope or specificity.
- Exemplary search queries can range from directly naming the real world point of interest, such as “Balboa Beach Bar, 123 Grand Canal St” to generally describing a location, category of point of interest, or other identifier, such as “best bookstore in Newport,” “where can I kayak?,” or “coffee, Balboa Island, Calif.”
- a search engine can return a plurality of web pages or other online content in response to the search query.
- Such web pages can provide additional content that is relevant to the search query and can include information associated with the real world point of interest. For example, in the event that a user of a search engine entered the search query “Balboa Beach Bar, 123 Grand Canal St,” the search engine can return a web page associated with the real world point of interest, Balboa Beach Bar.
- the search engine can return a plurality of web pages or other content which may be relevant to the specific search query.
- the plurality of web pages can include a web page associated with the real world point of interest, Surfs Up Coffee.
- the search engine can return a web page that includes other relevant content, such as a web page listing and rating all coffee shops in the Balboa Island area, including Surf's Up Coffee.
- a search engine can return a web page or other content associated with a real world point of interest as a search result in response to a user search query.
- Signal 108 can describe the number of instances in which such a web page or other content is returned as a search result and can be incorporated into scoring metric 104 .
- the score assigned to a virtual point of interest by scoring engine 102 can be positively correlated to the number of instances in which a web page associated with the real world point of interest is returned as a search result by the search engine.
- a virtual point of interest can receive a higher score if a web page associated with the real world point of interest is frequently returned as a search result.
- the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if a web page associated with the real world point of interest is infrequently or never returned as a search result.
- search engines can be altered or customized to return only results that meet certain criteria.
- a search engine can be customized so that it returns only recently generated content, such as news stories.
- a search engine can be personalized according to a user's preferences and return only web pages that discuss certain selected topics or return only content provided by selected, preferred content providers.
- a search engine can be used to power a digest, compilation, or other type of aggregator such that articles, web pages, or other content are selected and provided to a user without requiring the user to enter a specific search query.
- a digest, compilation, or other type of aggregator such that articles, web pages, or other content are selected and provided to a user without requiring the user to enter a specific search query.
- such an aggregator may be included in one or more social media platforms.
- search engine includes such variations of search engines and applications that incorporate or are powered by a search engine.
- signal 108 can describe the number of instances in which an item of content or web page associated with a real world point of interest is returned or presented by any search engine, feed reader, aggregator, or other suitable content providing web resource, whether stand alone or as an element of a larger web service.
- signal 108 can describe the number of instances in which a user selects a web page or other item of content associated with the real world point of interest when it is returned as a search result or presented by a search engine or aggregator. For example, in the event that the user entered a search query that generally describes a category of point of interest, such as “coffee, Balboa Island, Calif.,” then the search engine can return a plurality of web pages that may be relevant to the specific search query, including a web page associated with the real world point of interest, Surf's Up Coffee. Signal 108 can describe the number of instances in which the web page associated with Surf's Up Coffee is selected by the user, also known as a “click through.”
- signal 108 can be expressed as a percentage and termed a “click through rate.”
- the click through rate can describe the number of times a user selects a web page associated with a point of interest divided by the number of times a web page associated with the point of interest is returned as a search result or otherwise presented to a user.
- a higher click through rate indicates that the real world point of interest is generally more popular, more sought after by the web community, or more directly satisfies a search query.
- a lower click through rate can indicate that the real world point of interest is less popular, less sought after, or fails to satisfy the search query.
- scoring metric 104 can accord more weight to click throughs or click through rates than it does to the raw number of instances in which a web page associated with a real world point of interest is returned or presented by a search engine.
- an increase in click throughs, click through rates, or number of instances in which a related web page is returned can all have a positive impact on the score determined by scoring engine 102 according to scoring metric 104 .
- scoring engine 102 can incorporate one or more signals 110 from one or more social media platforms.
- Social media platforms provide for interaction among people. For example, users can create, share, exchange, or comment on content. Such content can be textual, videographic, photographic, or other suitable formats.
- Social media platforms can include forums, weblogs, microblogging, wikis, or other social media networks for sharing photographs, videos, and/or textual commentary.
- signal 110 can describe the number of instances in which a real world point of interest is referenced in a social media network.
- social media content such as postings and other user-generated content can be analyzed to determine whether one or more real world points of interest are referenced by the content.
- signal 110 can describe a virality factor of a social media posting or other content associated with the real world point of interest.
- a social media platform can allow a second user to share, rebroadcast, or otherwise signal approval of a posting or other content provided by a first user.
- the number of times a posting or other content is shared or rebroadcasted can be indicative of whether the point of interest referenced in such posting is a popular topic of discussion or otherwise generates interest among users of the social media platform.
- a larger number of shares or rebroadcasts corresponds to a higher virality factor
- a lower number of shares or rebroadcasts corresponds to a lower virality factor.
- signal 110 can describe the virality factor associated with a social media posting or content that references a real world point of interest by indicating the number of times the posting or content is shared, rebroadcasted, or otherwise receives approval, verification, or recommendation from other users.
- Signal 110 can also describe the virality factor of a social media posting or other content associated with a real world point of interest by indicating the number of replies that the posting or other content engenders.
- a virtual point of interest will receive a higher score from scoring engine 102 if postings that reference the parallel real world point of interest receive a larger number of shares, rebroadcasts, or replies (i.e. exhibit a high virality factor).
- a virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if postings that reference the parallel real world point of interest exhibit a low virality factor.
- signal 110 can describe the number of instances in which one or more users of a social media platform has selected an indicator provided by the social media platform that indicates that the one or more users enjoys, approves, or recommends the real world point of interest.
- a social media platform can provide an indicator that users can select with respect to a person, posting, or other item, such as the real world point of interest. By selecting the indicator, users of the social media platform can signal that they approve or otherwise enjoy the real world point of interest.
- a virtual point of interest will receive a higher score from scoring engine 102 if a larger number of users have indicated that they approve of the parallel real world point of interest.
- a virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if a smaller number of users have indicated that they approve of the real world point of interest. Further, if users have indicated that they disapprove of the parallel real world point of interest, the score assigned to the virtual point of interest can be negatively affected.
- signal 110 can describe the number of friends, followers, or other connections that a social media account associated with the real world point of interest has accumulated in a social media platform.
- a social media platform can allow a user to follow or befriend another user or account. By choosing to befriend or follow the account associated with the real world point of interest, users of the social media platform are signaling that they approve of or are interested in the real world point of interest.
- a virtual point of interest will receive a higher score from scoring engine 102 if an account associated with the parallel real world point of interest has a larger number of followers, friends, or other connections.
- the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if an account associated with the parallel real world point of interest has a smaller number of followers, friends, or other connections.
- signal 110 can describe the number of instances in which one or more users of a social media platform have indicated that they are located at the real world point of interest.
- a social media platform can allow a user to notify or share with her network that she is located in a certain region, area, or real world point of interest. In some instances this action can be termed a “check-in.”
- the number of instances in which one or more users of a social media platform have indicated that they are located at a real world point of interest can be analyzed and described by a signal 110 .
- a virtual point of interest will receive a higher score according to scoring metric 104 if a larger number of users have indicated that they are located at the parallel real world point of interest.
- the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if a smaller number of users have indicated that they are located at the parallel real world point of interest.
- scoring engine 102 can incorporate one or more signals 112 from one or more directories or reviews.
- a directory service can provide a listing of real world points of interest for specified locales.
- Some directory services can include elements of social networking, allowing users to provide reviews or other feedback or commentary regarding each real world point of interest.
- signal 112 can describe the number of reviews a real world point of interest has received in a web-based directory service. If a large number of reviews are generated or submitted for a real world point of interest, then the real world point of interest is likely high profile, a topic of conversation, or interesting to more members of the web community. Thus, a virtual point of interest will receive a higher score according to scoring metric 104 if the parallel real world point of interest receives a larger number of reviews in a directory service. Likewise, the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if the parallel real world point of interest receives a smaller number of reviews.
- signal 112 can describe the relative positivity or negativity associated with each review provided to the directory service by a user, also known as a “positivity factor.”
- positivity factor the relative positivity or negativity associated with each review provided to the directory service by a user
- user-generated reviews can be analyzed to determine a positivity factor associated with such review.
- the positivity factors respectively associated with the plurality of reviews can be aggregated to determine a total positivity of all reviews available for analysis. If total positivity is high, either as a raw number or on a relative basis, then scoring metric 104 can reward the virtual point of interest with a higher score. To the contrary, if total positivity is low (i.e. high negativity) then scoring metric 104 can reward fewer points to the virtual point of interest. In some implementations, a real world point of interest that receives reviews of a high negativity (i.e. low positivity factor) can result in subtracted points or otherwise penalize the score of the parallel virtual point of interest, per scoring metric 104 .
- scoring engine 102 can incorporate one or more signals 114 from a location database.
- a location database can provide the location of each relevant real world point of interest.
- the location database can provide additional statistics, data, or other descriptive information with respect to each relevant real world point of interest or with respect to the regions or locations in which such real world points of interest are located.
- a location database can be included within a geographic information system.
- signal 114 can be considered analogous to signal 106 .
- a location database can also be independent of a geographic information system. As such, signal 114 is provided here for the purposes of clarity.
- signal 114 can provide the latitude and longitude of the point of interest. In some instances such latitude and longitude can be known as the point of interest's “geocode.” As another example, signal 114 can provide the country, state/region, zip code, neighborhood, street address, or other location information associated with the point of interest. Alternatively, such location information (i.e. state, zip code, etc.) can be determined by scoring engine 102 based upon a geocode provided by signal 114 .
- Scoring metric 104 can provide for a higher or lower score depending on the location of the real world point of interest.
- scoring metric 104 provides differing scores for virtual points of interest based on the country in which their respective real world points of interest are located. For example, points of interest located in countries with higher Internet usage can receive a higher score according to scoring metric 104 . As another example, points of interest located in countries with a higher GDP can receive a higher score according to scoring metric 104 .
- scoring metric 104 applies the same or similar analysis at the region, state, zip code, neighborhood, or street level instead of at the country level. Generally, scoring metric 104 can be tailored to incorporate any suitable geographic information. Likewise, scoring metric 104 can incorporate each of these factors in a negative fashion as well, if desirable.
- signal 114 can provide a categorical description of the real world point of interest.
- categorical description can vary in scope from a broad description, such as “commercial,” or “residential,” to more narrow descriptions, such as “gas station,” “coffee shop,” or “jewelry store.”
- Scoring metric 104 can provide for a higher or lower score depending on the category of the real world point of interest.
- more desirable categories from the perspective of the online game-playing community, can receive higher scores.
- a video game store or an electronics store can receive an increased score.
- categories that provide significant real world practical value but would otherwise not receive high scores according to the principles discussed above can receive a higher score.
- gas stations and parking garages provide a significant practical real world value. However, such categories are often not the subject of conversation in social media or otherwise highly trafficked on the Internet, and would therefore receive a lower score. As such, gas stations, parking garages, or other similar selected categories can receive a higher score to compensate for their practical value.
- signal 114 can provide categorical descriptions or other information concerning a plurality of real world points of interest which neighbor, are adjacent to, or are otherwise related to the real world point of interest under consideration. For example, a parking garage near a highly regarded shopping center in a dense city center can be assigned a higher score than an identical parking garage that is located in a remote area without neighboring points of interest, such as a “Park and Ride.” As another example, real world points of interest that are located near public resources, such as public transit stations, can receive a higher score according to scoring metric 104 . In such fashion, the score determined for a virtual point of interest can be based in part on information concerning the real world points of interest or geographic features surrounding the parallel real world point of interest.
- scoring engine 102 can incorporate one or more signals 116 from a commercial database.
- a commercial database can provide information regarding the popularity or successfulness of a real world point of interest on a deal site, deal-of-the-day website, group coupon website, or other type of social commerce website.
- a real world point of interest can offer a specific deal or offer to users of a social commerce website. If a larger number of users choose to participate or purchase the deal, then the real world point of interest is generally more sought after or popular among the web community.
- signal 116 can describe the popularity or successfulness of one or more deals offered by a real world point of interest on a social commerce website.
- a virtual point of interest can receive a higher score from scoring engine 102 if deals offered by the parallel real world point of interest are popular or purchased by a larger number of users.
- the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if deals offered by the parallel real world point of interest are unpopular or fail to be purchased by a larger number of users.
- a commercial database can also provide information regarding advertising partnerships between the real world point of interest and the game provider.
- a real world point of interest can contract with the game provider to display advertisements on the real world point of interest's behalf Such advertisements can be internal or external to the parallel reality game.
- a virtual point of interest can receive a higher score from scoring engine 102 if an advertising partnership exists between the parallel real world point of interest and the game provider.
- the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if an advertising partnership does not exist between the parallel real world point of interest and the game provider.
- scoring engine 102 can incorporate one or more signals 118 from the game data 120 .
- the scores assigned to the virtual points of interest can be adjusted or modified due to game events, game features, or other game occurrences.
- real world points of interest can participate or otherwise play a role in the game itself and the score assigned to their parallel virtual point of interest can be adjusted due to such participation.
- some or all of the features, applications, or services discussed above with respect to signals 106 - 116 can be incorporated into the parallel reality game. In such instance, any of the actions or features of scoring engine 102 and scoring metric 104 discussed above can be applied to a game data signal 118 .
- signals 106 - 116 can be limited or purged to reflect online activity associated with only a particular collection of individuals.
- signals 106 - 116 can be controlled to reflect online activity associated with only players of the parallel reality game.
- the resulting scores assigned to the virtual point of interest can more accurately reflect a popularity of the parallel real world points of interest among the game playing community.

Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to parallel reality gaming, and more particularly, to a system and method for determining and assigning scores to virtual points of interest in a parallel reality game.
- Modern games, such as games designed for a personal computer, a mobile device, or a portable or stationary gaming console, often take place in a virtual world. For example, some games may be set in a fantasy world or take place in a virtual world that contains few similarities to the real world. However, some individuals may not be interested in such games because their associated virtual worlds do not parallel real life. In this sense, some individuals may hesitate to play such games because they are not attracted to participating in a world that does not exist.
- Parallel reality games offer an opportunity to play a game that is set in a virtual world that mimics, or parallels, the real world to varying degrees. For example, a parallel reality game can have a virtual world that parallels at least a portion of the geography of the real world. In this case, the game has a more natural feeling and is more engaging for individuals who prefer to focus on real-world activities or places. As such, parallel reality games can provide an opportunity for individuals who otherwise would not enjoy playing games to enjoy and participate in the parallel reality game.
- A challenge presented by creating and providing parallel reality games is ensuring that the virtual world realistically parallels the real world. More particularly, ensuring that game players feel that the virtual world is naturally or innately connected to the real world can improve the game playing experience. For example, game players can be provided with a sense that game actions or game developments are reflective of real world events or real world activities and vice versa.
- One response to such a challenge can be to incorporate real world data into the creation or maintenance of the virtual world associated with the parallel reality game. For example, a plurality of points of interest can exist in the real world. Therefore, a plurality of parallel virtual points of interest can be provided in the virtual world so that the virtual world more accurately parallels the real world. Thus, a game player is presented with familiar locations and points of interest, such as businesses, buildings, parks, or other points of interest, increasing the feeling that the virtual world is connected to the real world.
- However, simply providing the parallel, virtual points of interest can leave the player feeling as though something is missing. In particular, the real world points of interest can have particular characteristics or attributes. For example, different real world points of interest may have different levels of importance or popularity within the game-playing community. Reflecting such real world attributes with respect to the virtual points of interest can improve the parallel reality game play experience.
- Thus, systems and methods for scoring virtual points of interest in a parallel reality game are desirable.
- Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.
- One exemplary aspect is directed to a computer-implemented method of assigning a score to a virtual point of interest included in a virtual world associated with a parallel reality game. The virtual world can have a geography that parallels at least a portion of the real world and the virtual point of interest can parallel a real world point of interest. The method can include accessing a data source to obtain activity data concerning online activity associated with the real world point of interest. The method can also include determining a score for the virtual point of interest based on the activity data. The method can include modifying game data associated with the parallel reality game to assign the score to the virtual point of interest.
- Other exemplary aspects are directed to systems, apparatus, non-transitory computer-readable media, and devices for determining and assigning a score to a virtual point of interest included in a parallel reality game.
- These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.
- A full and enabling disclosure of the present invention, including the best mode thereof, directed to one of ordinary skill in the art, is set forth in the specification, which makes reference to the appended figures, in which:
-
FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary scoring engine and associated signals according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure; -
FIG. 2 depicts an exemplary game interface according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure; -
FIG. 3 depicts an exemplary computer-based gaming system configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure; -
FIG. 4 depicts a flow chart of an exemplary computer-implemented method for assigning a score to a virtual point of interest included in a virtual world associated with a parallel reality game according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure; and -
FIG. 5 depicts a flow chart of an exemplary computer-implemented method for assigning a score to a virtual point of interest included in a virtual world associated with a parallel reality game according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. - Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
- The present disclosure is generally directed to a scoring metric for determining and assigning a value or score to virtual points of interest in a parallel-reality game. The parallel reality game can include a virtual world that parallels at least a portion of the real world such that the virtual points of interest parallel real world points of interest. A scoring engine can implement the scoring metric to determine and assign the score to the virtual points of interest. The scoring engine can determine the score based on signals incorporated from web-based technology, social media platforms, and other suitable data sources such as a location database. The incorporated signals can indicate a reputation, importance, or popularity that the users of such applications place upon the point of interest. Thus, the score of a virtual point of interest in the game can track the importance of the real-world point of interest to the game-playing community, as indicated by associated online activity.
- The scoring metric can be tailored to meet any game design or to achieve any overarching game goals. For example, the scoring metric can incorporate signals in both a positive and negative fashion, such that the resulting score is tailored to the game designer's goals. As another example, selected signals can carry increased weight in order to incentivize player activity with the data source providing such selected signals. Thus, a player interested in increasing or otherwise altering a score in the game can be incentivized to interact with a selected web-based technology or social media platform.
- Exemplary signals that can be incorporated into the scoring metric by the scoring engine include a plurality of online interactions or activity. For example, signals can be collected from geographic information systems, search engines, social media, or other suitable applications or services, including, but not limited to, directories, reviews, location databases, commercial databases, or other suitable data. The scores assigned to the points of interest using the scoring metric can be updated dynamically as game-players or other web-users interact with, discuss, or search for the point of interest.
- Further, the scores can be provided to any game or style of game in which it would be desirable to score virtual points of interest within a virtual world having a geography that parallels at least a portion of the real-world. In particular, the result of using the present scoring metric is that any game that considers real world points of interest as core data becomes able to express the value of those points of interest in a way that makes sense from the perspective of a game player. The parallel virtual points of interest reflect the importance and popularity of points of interest in the real world, as influenced by the game-playing community.
- In situations in which the incorporated signals discussed herein collect personal information about users or make use of personal information, the user can be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location). In addition, certain data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored, incorporated into a signal, or otherwise used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identify can be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location can be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user can have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the systems and methods discussed herein.

FIG. 1 depicts anexemplary scoring engine 102 and associated signals 106-118 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. Scoringengine 102 can determine a score for a virtual point of interest included in a virtual world of a parallel reality game according to ascoring metric 104. More particularly, scoringengine 102 can determine a score for virtual points of interest based upon the application of signals 106-118 to scoringmetric 104. The score can be assigned to the virtual point of interest by generating or otherwise modifyinggame data 120. In particular, point ofinterest score data 122 can be generated or otherwise modified such that the score determined by scoringengine 102 is assigned to the virtual point of interest and stored for use by the parallel reality game. - A virtual point of interest can be the parallel virtual counterpart to any real world point of interest. As used herein, a “real world point of interest” refers to any feature, landmark, point of interest, or other object or event associated with a geographic location. Exemplary points of interest include, without limitation, a business, restaurant, retail outlet, coffee shop, bar, music venue, attraction, museum, theme park, arena, stadium, festival, building, monument, road crossing, clearing in a forest, topographical feature, organization, entity, or other suitable point of interest. In addition, real world points of interest can be defined or identified by a player and incorporated into game data based upon a player request or player-provided information. Generally, any real world feature can be represented by a parallel virtual point of interest in the virtual world. A score can be determined and assigned to each virtual point of interest by scoring
engine 102. - Scoring
engine 102 can be implemented using any suitable form of computing device. Generally, such suitable computing device can include one or more processors, microprocessors, microcomputers, memory, network interface or other suitable components for implementingscoring engine 102. For example, a memory can store computer-readable instructions that when executed by the computing device cause the computing device to perform operations which implementscoring engine 102. - As an example, scoring
engine 102 can be implemented on a server and one or more remote gaming devices can accessscoring engine 102 over a network. As another example, scoringengine 102 can be implemented directly on the same machine providing game play to the player, including, without limitation, a mobile phone, a tablet, a desktop computer, a dedicated gaming platform, or other suitable computing devices. In such instance, the scoring engine can be accessed as a program library. - Scoring engine can determine a score for a virtual point of interest according to scoring
metric 104. Scoring metric 104 can be included in hardware, firmware, and/or software controlling a general purpose processor. In one embodiment, scoring metric 104 can be program code files stored on a storage device, loaded into memory and executed by a processor or can be provided from computer program products, for example, computer executable instructions that are stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium such as a RAM hard disk or optical or magnetic media. - The score determined by scoring
engine 102 according to scoring metric 104 can take many various forms, each of which can be used to satisfy the present disclosure. Exemplary scores can include, without limitation, a numerical score on a scale of one hundred (78/100); a numerical score without an associated ceiling or scale (10,534); a monetary score ($34.67); a tiered score (Level 5); a categorical or descriptive score (Top Performer); or any other suitable form of score. In addition, such scores can be modified or tailored according to a particular game in which such scores are implemented. For example, scores can include bonuses, combos, or other modifiers. As another example, different scores can be provided to each player based on player customization and game play. - Returning to
FIG. 1 , signals 106-118 can be collected from one or more web-based technology or social media applications or services or from other information providers, such as location databases or commercial databases. For example signals 106-118 can be collected over a network, such as the Internet, according to known techniques. Signals 106-118 can indicate a reputation, importance, or popularity that the users of such applications place upon the real world point of interest. As another example, signals 106-118 can indicate a geographic region or location or other geographic information concerning the real world point of interest or its surroundings. Thus, the score of a virtual point of interest in the game can track the importance of the real-world point of interest to the game-playing community, as indicated by the associated online activity and other suitable information represented by signals 106-118. - One of skill in the art, in light of the disclosures contained herein, will appreciate that signals 106-118, as shown in
FIG. 1 , are exemplary in nature and that the present disclosure is not limited to such signals. In particular, any suitable signals can be incorporated into scoring metric 104 and used by scoringengine 102, including any signals that provide an indication of an online reputation or popularity of a real world point of interest. - In addition, while signals 106-118 will be discussed with reference to virtual points of interest 204-212 depicted in
game interface 200 ofFIG. 2 , such discussion is provided only for exemplary purposes and the present disclosure is not limited to the embodiment depicted inFIG. 2 . - In one aspect of the present disclosure, scoring
engine 102 can incorporate one ormore signals 106 from a geographic information system. A geographic information system can provide for the archiving, retrieving, and manipulation of geospatial data that has been indexed and stored according to geographic coordinates, such as latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates. A geographic information system can combine geospatial data such as satellite imagery, photographs, maps, models, tables, and other geospatial data with Internet search capability so as to enable a user to view imagery of the planet (e.g. as a portion of a virtual globe) and related information (e.g., locales such as islands and cities; and points of interest such as local restaurants, hospitals, parks, hotels, and schools). As such, data concerning the real-world point of interest can be included in the geographic information system and provided to a user of the geographic information system. - Signal 106 can describe a popularity or frequency of interaction associated with a real world point of interest represented in a geographic information system. As an example, signal 106 can describe the number of instances in which a placemark associated with the real world point of interest has been returned as a search result in response to a user search query.
- A user of a geographic information system can input a search query into the geographic information system in an attempt to identify the location of one or more real world points of interest or to become aware of real world points of interest in a given area. Such search query can be of varying scope or specificity. Exemplary search queries can range from directly naming the real world point of interest, such as “Balboa Beach Bar, 123 Grand Canal St” to generally describing a location and/or category of point of interest, such as “bookstore,” “martinis,” or “coffee, Balboa Island, Calif.”
- A geographic information system can return a plurality of placemarks in response to the search query. Such placemarks can indicate the location of one or more real world points of interest that are relevant to the search query. For example, in the event that a user of a geographic information system entered the search query “Balboa Beach Bar, 123 Grand Canal St,” the geographic information system can return a placemark indicating the location of the real world point of interest, Balboa Beach Bar.
- In the event that the user entered a search query that generally describes a category of point of interest, such as “coffee, Balboa Island, Calif.,” then the geographic information system can return a plurality of placemarks indicating the location of various coffee shops which may be relevant to the specific search query. For example, the plurality of placemarks can include a placemark indicating the location of a real world point of interest, Surf's Up Coffee.
- In such fashion, a geographic information system can return a placemark associated with a real world point of interest as a search result in response to a user search query. Signal 106 can describe the number of instances in which such a placemark is returned as a search result and can be incorporated into scoring
metric 104. - Generally, the score assigned to a virtual point of interest by scoring
engine 102 is positively correlated to the number of instances in which a placemark associated with the parallel real world point of interest is returned as a search result by the geographic information system. Thus, a higher score will be awarded if the real world point of interest is frequently returned as a search result by the geographic information system. Likewise, a lower score will be awarded if the real world point of interest is infrequently or never returned as a search result. - While the term “placemark” has been used herein, one of skill in the art, in light of the disclosures contained herein, will appreciate that such term is exemplary in nature. In particular, an exemplary geographic information system can return results in other forms than placemarks, including in a textual format. Signal 106 can generally describe the number of instances in which a point of interest is implicated in a search result, independent of the particular format in which the point of interest is presented to the user.
- As another example, signal 106 can describe the number of instances in which the real world point of interest is depicted in a geographic information system, regardless of whether the real world point of interest is depicted as a search result or simply during the routine display of geographic information. For example, a user that zooms in, pans to, or otherwise requests or loads a certain geographic area can be presented with indicators of some or all points of interest that are located in such geographic area, without having entered a specific search query.
- Signal 106 can reflect the number of instances in which an indicator associated with a real world point of interest is displayed in any fashion, including instances in which the indicator is presented during the routine display of geographic information. Generally, a greater number of instances in which the real world point of interest is depicted or otherwise indicated in the geographic information system can result in a higher score assigned to the parallel virtual point of interest in the game by scoring
engine 102. Likewise, a lesser number of instances in which the real world point of interest is depicted or otherwise indicated in the geographic information system can result in a lower score. - As yet another example, signal 106 can describe the number of instances in which a user selects the point of interest when returned as a search result or otherwise requests more information concerning the point of interest, known in some instances as a “click through rate.” One of skill in the art, in light of the disclosures contained herein, will appreciate that a point of interest can be selected by a user of a geographic information system in a number of fashions, including, for example, clicking on the placemark or requesting directions to the location of the point of interest.
- In some implementations, scoring metric 104 can accord more weight to click throughs or click through rates than it does to the raw number of instances in which the point of interest is depicted. However, in general, an increase in click throughs, click through rates, or number of depictions all have a positive impact on the score determined by scoring
engine 102 according to scoringmetric 104. - As another example, signal 106 can describe the number of instances in which data associated with the real world point of interest and stored in the geographic information system is generated or otherwise modified by one or more users of the geographic information system.
- According to another aspect of the present disclosure, scoring
engine 102 can incorporate one ormore signals 108 from a search engine. As an example, signal 108 can describe the number of instances in which a real world point of interest or an item of content associated with the real world point of interest is returned as a result by the search engine. - A user of a search engine can enter a search query in an attempt to obtain a listing of web pages or other online content relevant to the subject of the search query. Such search query can be of varying scope or specificity. Exemplary search queries can range from directly naming the real world point of interest, such as “Balboa Beach Bar, 123 Grand Canal St” to generally describing a location, category of point of interest, or other identifier, such as “best bookstore in Newport,” “where can I kayak?,” or “coffee, Balboa Island, Calif.”
- A search engine can return a plurality of web pages or other online content in response to the search query. Such web pages can provide additional content that is relevant to the search query and can include information associated with the real world point of interest. For example, in the event that a user of a search engine entered the search query “Balboa Beach Bar, 123 Grand Canal St,” the search engine can return a web page associated with the real world point of interest, Balboa Beach Bar.
- In the event that the user entered a search query that generally describes a category of point of interest, such as “coffee, Balboa Island, Calif.,” then the search engine can return a plurality of web pages or other content which may be relevant to the specific search query. For example, the plurality of web pages can include a web page associated with the real world point of interest, Surfs Up Coffee. Alternatively, the search engine can return a web page that includes other relevant content, such as a web page listing and rating all coffee shops in the Balboa Island area, including Surf's Up Coffee.
- In such fashion, a search engine can return a web page or other content associated with a real world point of interest as a search result in response to a user search query. Signal 108 can describe the number of instances in which such a web page or other content is returned as a search result and can be incorporated into scoring
metric 104. - Generally, the score assigned to a virtual point of interest by scoring
engine 102 can be positively correlated to the number of instances in which a web page associated with the real world point of interest is returned as a search result by the search engine. Thus, a virtual point of interest can receive a higher score if a web page associated with the real world point of interest is frequently returned as a search result. Likewise, the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if a web page associated with the real world point of interest is infrequently or never returned as a search result. - While the general operation of a generic search engine has been described above, search engines can be altered or customized to return only results that meet certain criteria. For example, a search engine can be customized so that it returns only recently generated content, such as news stories. Alternatively, a search engine can be personalized according to a user's preferences and return only web pages that discuss certain selected topics or return only content provided by selected, preferred content providers.
- As another example, a search engine can be used to power a digest, compilation, or other type of aggregator such that articles, web pages, or other content are selected and provided to a user without requiring the user to enter a specific search query. In some instances, such an aggregator may be included in one or more social media platforms.
- One of skill in the art, in light of the disclosures contained herein, will understand that the term “search engine,” as used herein, includes such variations of search engines and applications that incorporate or are powered by a search engine. In particular, signal 108 can describe the number of instances in which an item of content or web page associated with a real world point of interest is returned or presented by any search engine, feed reader, aggregator, or other suitable content providing web resource, whether stand alone or as an element of a larger web service.
- As another example, signal 108 can describe the number of instances in which a user selects a web page or other item of content associated with the real world point of interest when it is returned as a search result or presented by a search engine or aggregator. For example, in the event that the user entered a search query that generally describes a category of point of interest, such as “coffee, Balboa Island, Calif.,” then the search engine can return a plurality of web pages that may be relevant to the specific search query, including a web page associated with the real world point of interest, Surf's Up Coffee. Signal 108 can describe the number of instances in which the web page associated with Surf's Up Coffee is selected by the user, also known as a “click through.”
- Alternatively, signal 108 can be expressed as a percentage and termed a “click through rate.” The click through rate can describe the number of times a user selects a web page associated with a point of interest divided by the number of times a web page associated with the point of interest is returned as a search result or otherwise presented to a user. As such, a higher click through rate indicates that the real world point of interest is generally more popular, more sought after by the web community, or more directly satisfies a search query. Likewise, a lower click through rate can indicate that the real world point of interest is less popular, less sought after, or fails to satisfy the search query.
- In some implementations, scoring metric 104 can accord more weight to click throughs or click through rates than it does to the raw number of instances in which a web page associated with a real world point of interest is returned or presented by a search engine. However, in general, an increase in click throughs, click through rates, or number of instances in which a related web page is returned can all have a positive impact on the score determined by scoring
engine 102 according to scoringmetric 104. - According to another aspect of the present disclosure, scoring
engine 102 can incorporate one ormore signals 110 from one or more social media platforms. Social media platforms provide for interaction among people. For example, users can create, share, exchange, or comment on content. Such content can be textual, videographic, photographic, or other suitable formats. Social media platforms can include forums, weblogs, microblogging, wikis, or other social media networks for sharing photographs, videos, and/or textual commentary. - As an example, signal 110 can describe the number of instances in which a real world point of interest is referenced in a social media network. In particular, to the extent that users of a social media platform provide affirmative consent after being informed of what data is collected, how it is collected, and how such data is used, social media content such as postings and other user-generated content can be analyzed to determine whether one or more real world points of interest are referenced by the content.
- As another example, signal 110 can describe a virality factor of a social media posting or other content associated with the real world point of interest. For example, a social media platform can allow a second user to share, rebroadcast, or otherwise signal approval of a posting or other content provided by a first user. The number of times a posting or other content is shared or rebroadcasted can be indicative of whether the point of interest referenced in such posting is a popular topic of discussion or otherwise generates interest among users of the social media platform. Thus, a larger number of shares or rebroadcasts corresponds to a higher virality factor, while a lower number of shares or rebroadcasts corresponds to a lower virality factor.
- Thus, signal 110 can describe the virality factor associated with a social media posting or content that references a real world point of interest by indicating the number of times the posting or content is shared, rebroadcasted, or otherwise receives approval, verification, or recommendation from other users. Signal 110 can also describe the virality factor of a social media posting or other content associated with a real world point of interest by indicating the number of replies that the posting or other content engenders. Generally, a virtual point of interest will receive a higher score from scoring
engine 102 if postings that reference the parallel real world point of interest receive a larger number of shares, rebroadcasts, or replies (i.e. exhibit a high virality factor). Likewise, a virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if postings that reference the parallel real world point of interest exhibit a low virality factor. - As yet another example, signal 110 can describe the number of instances in which one or more users of a social media platform has selected an indicator provided by the social media platform that indicates that the one or more users enjoys, approves, or recommends the real world point of interest. For example, a social media platform can provide an indicator that users can select with respect to a person, posting, or other item, such as the real world point of interest. By selecting the indicator, users of the social media platform can signal that they approve or otherwise enjoy the real world point of interest. Generally, a virtual point of interest will receive a higher score from scoring
engine 102 if a larger number of users have indicated that they approve of the parallel real world point of interest. Likewise, a virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if a smaller number of users have indicated that they approve of the real world point of interest. Further, if users have indicated that they disapprove of the parallel real world point of interest, the score assigned to the virtual point of interest can be negatively affected. - As another example, signal 110 can describe the number of friends, followers, or other connections that a social media account associated with the real world point of interest has accumulated in a social media platform. For example, a social media platform can allow a user to follow or befriend another user or account. By choosing to befriend or follow the account associated with the real world point of interest, users of the social media platform are signaling that they approve of or are interested in the real world point of interest. Generally, a virtual point of interest will receive a higher score from scoring
engine 102 if an account associated with the parallel real world point of interest has a larger number of followers, friends, or other connections. Likewise, the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if an account associated with the parallel real world point of interest has a smaller number of followers, friends, or other connections. - As yet another example, signal 110 can describe the number of instances in which one or more users of a social media platform have indicated that they are located at the real world point of interest. For example, a social media platform can allow a user to notify or share with her network that she is located in a certain region, area, or real world point of interest. In some instances this action can be termed a “check-in.”
- To the extent that such social media users provide affirmative consent after being informed of what data is collected, how it is collected, and how such data is used, the number of instances in which one or more users of a social media platform have indicated that they are located at a real world point of interest can be analyzed and described by a
signal 110. - If a larger number of users of a social media platform have indicated that they are located at the real world point of interest, it can be assumed that the real world point of interest is generally more popular, maintains higher traffic, or is interesting to more members of the web community. As such, a virtual point of interest will receive a higher score according to scoring metric 104 if a larger number of users have indicated that they are located at the parallel real world point of interest. Likewise, the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if a smaller number of users have indicated that they are located at the parallel real world point of interest.
- According to another aspect of the present disclosure, scoring
engine 102 can incorporate one ormore signals 112 from one or more directories or reviews. In particular, a directory service can provide a listing of real world points of interest for specified locales. Some directory services can include elements of social networking, allowing users to provide reviews or other feedback or commentary regarding each real world point of interest. - As an example, signal 112 can describe the number of reviews a real world point of interest has received in a web-based directory service. If a large number of reviews are generated or submitted for a real world point of interest, then the real world point of interest is likely high profile, a topic of conversation, or interesting to more members of the web community. Thus, a virtual point of interest will receive a higher score according to scoring metric 104 if the parallel real world point of interest receives a larger number of reviews in a directory service. Likewise, the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if the parallel real world point of interest receives a smaller number of reviews.
- As another example, signal 112 can describe the relative positivity or negativity associated with each review provided to the directory service by a user, also known as a “positivity factor.” In particular, to the extent that users of a directory service provide affirmative consent after being informed of what data is collected, how it is collected, and how such data is used, user-generated reviews can be analyzed to determine a positivity factor associated with such review. One of skill in the art, in light of the disclosures contained herein, will appreciate that there are many methods for determining a positivity factor for a review. Any of such methods can be used to satisfy the present disclosure, including any combination of those discussed above.
- The positivity factors respectively associated with the plurality of reviews can be aggregated to determine a total positivity of all reviews available for analysis. If total positivity is high, either as a raw number or on a relative basis, then scoring metric 104 can reward the virtual point of interest with a higher score. To the contrary, if total positivity is low (i.e. high negativity) then scoring metric 104 can reward fewer points to the virtual point of interest. In some implementations, a real world point of interest that receives reviews of a high negativity (i.e. low positivity factor) can result in subtracted points or otherwise penalize the score of the parallel virtual point of interest, per
scoring metric 104. - According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, scoring
engine 102 can incorporate one ormore signals 114 from a location database. In particular, a location database can provide the location of each relevant real world point of interest. In some instances, the location database can provide additional statistics, data, or other descriptive information with respect to each relevant real world point of interest or with respect to the regions or locations in which such real world points of interest are located. - One of skill in the art, in light of the disclosures provided herein, will appreciate that a location database can be included within a geographic information system. In such instance, signal 114 can be considered analogous to signal 106. However, a location database can also be independent of a geographic information system. As such, signal 114 is provided here for the purposes of clarity.
- As an example, signal 114 can provide the latitude and longitude of the point of interest. In some instances such latitude and longitude can be known as the point of interest's “geocode.” As another example, signal 114 can provide the country, state/region, zip code, neighborhood, street address, or other location information associated with the point of interest. Alternatively, such location information (i.e. state, zip code, etc.) can be determined by scoring
engine 102 based upon a geocode provided bysignal 114. - Scoring metric 104 can provide for a higher or lower score depending on the location of the real world point of interest. In one implementation, scoring
metric 104 provides differing scores for virtual points of interest based on the country in which their respective real world points of interest are located. For example, points of interest located in countries with higher Internet usage can receive a higher score according to scoringmetric 104. As another example, points of interest located in countries with a higher GDP can receive a higher score according to scoringmetric 104. In alternative implementations, scoringmetric 104 applies the same or similar analysis at the region, state, zip code, neighborhood, or street level instead of at the country level. Generally, scoring metric 104 can be tailored to incorporate any suitable geographic information. Likewise, scoring metric 104 can incorporate each of these factors in a negative fashion as well, if desirable. - As another example, signal 114 can provide a categorical description of the real world point of interest. Such categorical description can vary in scope from a broad description, such as “commercial,” or “residential,” to more narrow descriptions, such as “gas station,” “coffee shop,” or “jewelry store.”
- Scoring metric 104 can provide for a higher or lower score depending on the category of the real world point of interest. In particular, more desirable categories, from the perspective of the online game-playing community, can receive higher scores. For example, a video game store or an electronics store can receive an increased score. As another example, categories that provide significant real world practical value but would otherwise not receive high scores according to the principles discussed above can receive a higher score. For example, gas stations and parking garages provide a significant practical real world value. However, such categories are often not the subject of conversation in social media or otherwise highly trafficked on the Internet, and would therefore receive a lower score. As such, gas stations, parking garages, or other similar selected categories can receive a higher score to compensate for their practical value.
- As yet another example, signal 114 can provide categorical descriptions or other information concerning a plurality of real world points of interest which neighbor, are adjacent to, or are otherwise related to the real world point of interest under consideration. For example, a parking garage near a highly regarded shopping center in a dense city center can be assigned a higher score than an identical parking garage that is located in a remote area without neighboring points of interest, such as a “Park and Ride.” As another example, real world points of interest that are located near public resources, such as public transit stations, can receive a higher score according to scoring
metric 104. In such fashion, the score determined for a virtual point of interest can be based in part on information concerning the real world points of interest or geographic features surrounding the parallel real world point of interest. - According to another aspect of the present disclosure, scoring
engine 102 can incorporate one ormore signals 116 from a commercial database. A commercial database can provide information regarding the popularity or successfulness of a real world point of interest on a deal site, deal-of-the-day website, group coupon website, or other type of social commerce website. For example, a real world point of interest can offer a specific deal or offer to users of a social commerce website. If a larger number of users choose to participate or purchase the deal, then the real world point of interest is generally more sought after or popular among the web community. - Thus, signal 116 can describe the popularity or successfulness of one or more deals offered by a real world point of interest on a social commerce website. Generally, a virtual point of interest can receive a higher score from scoring
engine 102 if deals offered by the parallel real world point of interest are popular or purchased by a larger number of users. Likewise, the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if deals offered by the parallel real world point of interest are unpopular or fail to be purchased by a larger number of users. - A commercial database can also provide information regarding advertising partnerships between the real world point of interest and the game provider. For example, a real world point of interest can contract with the game provider to display advertisements on the real world point of interest's behalf Such advertisements can be internal or external to the parallel reality game. Generally, a virtual point of interest can receive a higher score from scoring
engine 102 if an advertising partnership exists between the parallel real world point of interest and the game provider. Likewise, the virtual point of interest can receive a lower score if an advertising partnership does not exist between the parallel real world point of interest and the game provider. - According to another aspect of the present disclosure, scoring
engine 102 can incorporate one ormore signals 118 from thegame data 120. The scores assigned to the virtual points of interest can be adjusted or modified due to game events, game features, or other game occurrences. For example, real world points of interest can participate or otherwise play a role in the game itself and the score assigned to their parallel virtual point of interest can be adjusted due to such participation. In addition, some or all of the features, applications, or services discussed above with respect to signals 106-116 can be incorporated into the parallel reality game. In such instance, any of the actions or features ofscoring engine 102 and scoring metric 104 discussed above can be applied to a game data signal 118. - Further, one of skill in the art will appreciate that signals 106-116 can be limited or purged to reflect online activity associated with only a particular collection of individuals. For example, signals 106-116 can be controlled to reflect online activity associated with only players of the parallel reality game. In such fashion, the resulting scores assigned to the virtual point of interest can more accurately reflect a popularity of the parallel real world points of interest among the game playing community.

FIG. 2 depicts anexemplary game interface 200 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure.Game interface 200 can be presented to a player of the game. For example, game interface is shown inFIG. 2 as being presented on the display of aclient device 320 as part of the interface between a player and the gaming system.Game interface 200 can be used to display thevirtual world 202 and various other aspects of the parallel reality game, such as aplayer position 230 and the location of virtual points ofinterest - The
virtual world 202 depicted inFIG. 2 is exemplary in nature, and is provided for the purposes of explanation, not limitation. Thus, while the game embodiment depicted inFIG. 2 shows aplayer position 230, the present disclosure is not limited to location-based games in which a player participates in the game by moving about in the real world. Instead, the present disclosure can be applied to or used in all games that include a virtual world that parallels at least a portion of the real world, whether such game includes location-based aspects or not. -
Game interface 200 can also displaygame information 232 such as a player name, player level, or other suitable game information. Amenu 234 can be included for accessing various game settings and other information associated with the game. One ormore game communications 236 can be presented to the player to prompt player action, change preferences, or otherwise allow the player to participate in the game. Game communications can be audio, visual, or other suitable formats. - According to aspects of the present disclosure, a scoring engine or other suitable system can be used to determine and assign a score to virtual points of
interest game interface 200, virtual point ofinterest 204 can be assigned ascore 214. Likewise, virtual point ofinterest 210 can be assigned ascore 220. - While
FIG. 2 shows virtual point ofinterest 204 with asingle score 214, such depiction is exemplary in nature and not intended to limit the disclosure to such depiction. In particular, in alternative implementations of the present disclosure, thescore 214 provided for point ofinterest 204 can be different for each player of the game. More particularly, scoringengine 102 can incorporate user customization or user preferences in order to tailorscore 214 for such player. As an example, if a player provides an indication that public transportation is her primary mode of transport and consents to the use of such data, scores can be higher for points of interest that are located within a closer proximity to public transportation centers or routes. - Generally, the present disclosure can be tailored to benefit any style of game and satisfy many different game objectives. For example, multiple scores can be determined and assigned to each point of interest based upon different game play factors, levels, teams, or player attributes. As another example, virtual point of interest game scores can be the basis for a virtual currency included in the game. As yet another example, the scores assigned to the virtual points of interest can be used as conversion factors when converting real world currency into and out of game play.
- In addition, the term “game” as used herein should be broadly construed to include both traditional and non-traditional gaming formats. For example, programs or applications that provide a parallel reality should be considered games even if they do not define clear game objectives or provide an overarching game narrative. One of skill in the art, in light of the disclosures provided herein, will appreciate that modern games define a spectrum of formats, including games that provide a second, fictional life or other styles of gameplay that include business aspects or are not strictly dedicated to providing lighthearted pleasure.
- Exemplary computer-implemented gaming systems according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure will now be set forth. The present subject matter will be discussed with reference to an embodiment of a parallel reality game, depicted in
FIG. 3 , that includes a client-server architecture and elements of location-based gaming. The present disclosure is not limited to such embodiment, but instead applies broadly to any game that includes a virtual world that parallels at least a portion of the real world. In addition, the inherent flexibility of computer-based systems allows for a great variety of possible configurations, combinations, and divisions of tasks and functionality between and among the components of the system. For instance, the systems and methods according to aspects of the present disclosure can be implemented using a single computing device or across multiple computing devices. -
FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary computer-implementedgaming system 300 configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. Thegaming system 300 provides for the interaction of a plurality of players in a virtual world having a geography that parallels at least a portion of the real world.
