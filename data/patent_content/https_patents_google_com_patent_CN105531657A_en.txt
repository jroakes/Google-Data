Window general view presents module 216 and makes when being performed processing unit 202 provide the general view of opening window 218.1-4 He opening tab 220.1-3 at computing equipment 200 place via display device 206.Below in conjunction with Fig. 3, the operation example that window general view presents module 216 is made a more detailed description.
Fig. 3 illustrates the instantiation procedure 300 that can be presented the general view of opening window and tab by it.
Process 300 starts in step 310, and wherein computing equipment (such as, computing equipment 200, presents the operation of module 216 via window general view) receives from the user of computing equipment and such as presents the request of opening window with window general view pattern.Such as, this user can select the hot key on keyboard or touch-screen or button to enter window general view pattern.In some embodiments, present the request of opening window and comprise user and three fingers to be positioned on the track pad of computing equipment or touch-screen and with predetermined direction-such as, downwards or towards user-paddling these three fingers.These three fingers of paddling can refer to and move these three fingers along track pad and do not lifted from track pad by finger.This computing equipment has multiplely opens window, and has from the plurality of first window opening window and multiplely open tab.This first window can be the window from browser application, the window from document processor application, from the window of electronic spreadsheet application or the window from arbitrarily other application.Except first window, (multiple) other window also can have multiplely opens tab.(multiple) other window can have singlely to be opened tab or can not realize tab.
In step 320, computing equipment presents multiple window indicator (such as, window indicator 110A, 120A, 130A and 140A) at the display place of this computing equipment.The processing unit of computing equipment or computing equipment can present window indicator by signal notice display device.Signal for presenting multiple window indicator can be transferred into display device via the display-device driver of this computing equipment.The content of multiple respective window opened in window at each window indicator instruction computing equipment place.In some embodiments, window indicator comprises the thumbnail of the content of respective window.
In step 330, the window indicator of computing equipment at the display place of this computing equipment in conjunction with first window presents multiple tab indicators (such as, tab indicators 132A, 134A and 136A), and continue to present multiple window indicator simultaneously.The processing unit of this computing equipment or this computing equipment can present tab indicators by signal notice display device.Signal for presenting multiple tab indicators can be transferred into display device via the display-device driver of this computing equipment.The content of multiple respective selection cards opened in tab of each tab indicators instruction first window.In some embodiments, tab indicators comprises the thumbnail of the content of respective selection card.In some cases, tab indicators in response to user cursor (such as, cursor 150C) hovered over first window window indicator above and present.As an alternative, this tab indicators can present in response to touching the window indicator of first window on the touchscreen or singly touch.In another alternative again, tab indicators can be presented automatically when window indicator is presented, without the need to asking any further user input of tab indicators.
Window indicator can present along the first straight line extended with first direction (vertical direction in the horizontal direction such as, in Figure 1A or Fig. 1 C).The tab indicators presented in conjunction with first window can present along the second straight line extended with the second direction being different from this first direction (horizontal direction in the vertical direction such as, in Figure 1A or Fig. 1 C).
In step 340, this computing equipment receives the selection in the multiple tab indicators first window from user.This user can use mouse to click selected in the plurality of tab indicators one or of using touch-screen to touch selected in the plurality of tab indicators.
In step 350, this computing equipment makes tab corresponding with selected in the plurality of tab indicators in this first window and this first window obtain focus in response to the selection of in multiple tab indicators.After step 350, process 300 terminates.
As described above, the step 310-350 of process 300 performs with predefined procedure or performs continuously.But the step 310-350 of process 300 can perform with random order.In some embodiments, two or more in the step 310-350 of process 300 can executed in parallel.And in some cases, one or more in step 310-350 can not perform.Such as, step 310-330 or step 320-330 can be implemented when not realizing step 340-350.
Here combine multiple windows with multiple tab to be described some embodiments.But in some cases, application (such as, browser) can have multiple window, and some in the multiple windows be associated with this application can have multiple tab.As an alternative, apply the window that can be considered to have multiple tab or application and can be considered to have multiple tab.Some examples of this subject technology are described as be in laptop computer here and realize.But this subject technology can realize at any computing equipment, such as desk-top computer, flat computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), electronic music player etc.
Fig. 4 conceptually illustrates and can be used for the electronic system 400 of some embodiments realizing this subject technology.Such as, computing equipment 200 can use the layout of electronic system 400 to realize.Electronic system 400 can be the electronic equipment of computing machine (such as, mobile phone, PDA) or other type arbitrarily.Such electronic system comprises the interface of various types of computer-readable medium and the computer-readable medium for other type various.Electronic system 400 comprises bus 405, (multiple) processing unit 410, system storage 415, ROM (read-only memory) (ROM) 420, permanent storage device 425, input equipment interface 430, output device interface 435 and network interface 440.
