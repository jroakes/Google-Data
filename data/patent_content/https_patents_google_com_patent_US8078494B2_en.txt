Definitions
- the present invention concerns advertising.
- the present invention concerns how ads are presented to their audience.
- Advertisers have used these types of media to reach a large audience with their advertisements (“ads”).
- advertisers have used demographic studies. For example, advertisers may use broadcast events such as football games to advertise beer and action movies to a younger male audience.
- advertisers may use magazines that reach a relatively affluent readership to advertise luxury items such as expensive watches and luxury automobiles.
- advertisers recognize that much of their ad budget is simply wasted. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to identify and eliminate such waste.
- Advertisers have developed several strategies in an attempt to maximize the value of such advertising.
- advertisers use popular presences or means for providing interactive media or services (referred to as “Web sites” in the specification without loss of generality) as conduits to reach a large audience.
- Web sites popular presences or means for providing interactive media or services
- an advertiser may place ads on the home page of the New York Times Web site, or the USA Today Web site, for example.
- an advertiser may attempt to target its ads to more narrow niche audiences, thereby increasing the likelihood of a positive response by the audience. For example, an agency promoting tourism in the Costa Rican rainforest might place ads on the ecotourism-travel subdirectory of the Yahoo Web site.
- Web site-based ads are typically presented to their advertising audience in the form “banner ads”—i.e., a rectangular box that includes graphic components.
- banner ads i.e., a rectangular box that includes graphic components.
- viewer selects one of these banner ads by clicking on it
- embedded hypertext links typically direct the viewer to the advertiser's Web site. This process, wherein the viewer selects an ad, is commonly referred to as a “click-through”.
- the ratio of the number of click-throughs to the number of impressions of the ad i.e., the number of times an ad is displayed
- click-through rate The ratio of the number of click-throughs to the number of impressions of the ad.
- Web site hosts the hosts of Web sites on which the ads are presented (referred to as “Web site hosts” or “ad consumers”) have the challenge of maximizing ad revenue without impairing their users' experience.
- Some Web site hosts have chosen to place advertising revenues over the interests of users.
- One such Web site is “GoTo.com”, which hosts a so-called “search engine” service returning “search results” in response to user queries.
- the GoTo.com web site permits advertisers to pay to position their Web site (or a target Web site) higher up on the list of search results.
- cost-per-click If such schemes are implemented such that the advertiser only pays if a user clicks on the ad (i.e., cost-per-click), the advertiser lacks incentive to target the ads effectively, since a poorly targeted ad will not be clicked and therefore will not require payment.
- high cost-per-click ads show up near or at the top, but do not necessarily translate into real revenue for the ad publisher because viewers don't click on them.
- ads that viewer would click on are further down the list, or not on the list at all, and so relevancy of ads is compromised.
- the present invention provides a more effective advertising system which orders ads an a manner that maximizes both their relevance and their economic values. Such ordering may be done based on both accepted ad price information and ad performance information.
- the price information is may be based on (a) an amount an advertiser has agreed to pay each time the ad is rendered, (b) an amount an advertiser has agreed to pay each time the ad is rendered and selected, (c) an average over time of the amount the advertiser has agreed to pay each time the ad is rendered and selected, (d) an amount the advertiser has agreed to pay each time the ad is rendered and a conversion, associated with the ad, occurs, (e) cost per selection information, (f) an average of cost per selection information over a period of time, etc.
- the performance information is a measure of user interest in the associated advertisement and may be, for example, (a) a click-through rate of the associated advertisement, (b) user ratings of the advertisement, (c) focus group ratings of the advertisement, (d) a measure of user interest for the advertisement weighted for a size of the advertisement relative to that of other advertisements, (e) a measure of user interest for the advertisement weighted for past positions of the advertisement relative to those past positions of other advertisements, (f) expected user interest in the advertisement, (g) a time needed to render the advertisement relative to that needed to render other advertisements, (h) a measure of user interest for the advertisement weighted for a media type of the advertisement, and (i) a conversion rate associated with the advertisement
- Price information and/or performance information may be weighted or otherwise adjusted. Window functions may be used to determine a relevant time frame or number of data to be considered.

- the present invention involves novel methods, apparatus, message formats and data structures for providing effective advertisements in an interactive environment.
- the following description is presented to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular applications and their requirements.
- Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles set forth below may be applied to other embodiments and applications.
- the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown and the inventors regard their invention as the following disclosed methods, apparatus, message formats and data structures and any other patentable subject matter.
- FIG. 1 is a high level diagram of an advertising environment.
- the environment may include an ad entry, maintenance and delivery system 120 .
- Advertisers 110 may directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track ad information in the system 120 .
- the ads may be in the form of graphical ads such as so-called banner ads, text only ads, audio ads, video ads, etc.
- Ad consumers 130 may submit requests for ads to, accept ads responsive to their request from, and provide historical or usage information to, the system 120 .
- an ad consumer 130 is a general content server which receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, webpage listings, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response or otherwise services the request.
- the content server may submit a request for ads to the system 120 .
- Such an ad request may include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request may also include the content request information.
- This information may include the content itself (e.g., page), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geolocation information, etc.
- the content server may combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 120 . This combined information including the content and advertisement(s) is then forwarded towards the viewer that requested the content, for presentation to the viewer. Finally, the content server may transmit information about the ads and how the ads are to be rendered (e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, etc.) back to the system 120 .
- information about the ads and how the ads are to be rendered e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, etc.
- search engine may receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine may retrieve relevant search results (e.g., from an index of Web pages).
- relevant search results e.g., from an index of Web pages.
- An exemplary search engine is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference , Brisbane, Australia (incorporated herein by reference).
- search results may include, for example, lists of Web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those Web pages, and hypertext links to those Web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search engine may submit a request for ads to the system 120 .
- the request may include a number of ads desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, etc. In one embodiment, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, and preferably from three to five.
- the request for ads may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geolocation information), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores such as dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, Page Rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and Page Rank scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., WebPages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- identifiers related to the search results e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”
- scores related to the search results e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores such as dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, Page Rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and Page Rank scores
- snippets of text extracted from identified documents e.g., WebPages
- full text of identified documents e.g., feature vectors of identified
- the search engine may combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 120 . This combined information including the search results and advertisement(s) is then forwarded towards the user that requested the content, for presentation to the user. Finally, the search engine may transmit information about the ad and how the ad was to be rendered (e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, etc.) back to the system 120 .
- FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary ad system 120 ′, consistent with the present invention.
- the exemplary ad system 120 ′ may include an inventory system 210 and may store ad information 205 and usage or historical (e.g., statistical) information 245 .
- the exemplary system 120 ′ may support ad information entry and management operation(s) 215 , campaign (e.g., targeting) assistance operation(s) 220 , accounting and billing operation(s) 225 , ad serving operation(s) 230 , relevancy determination operation(s) 235 , optimization operations 240 , presentation ordering operations 250 , and fraud detection operation(s) 255 .
- Advertisers 110 may interface with the system 120 ′ via the ad information entry and management operation(s) 215 as indicated by interface 216 .
- Ad consumers 130 may interface with the system 120 ′ via the ad serving operation(s) 230 as indicated by interface 231 .
- the present invention primarily concerns the presentation ordering operation(s) 250 , and is described more fully in section 4.2. For contextual purposes, however, a brief description of the other parts of ad system 120 ′ appears below.
- An advertising program includes information concerning accounts, campaigns, creatives, targeting, etc.
- the term “account” relates to information for a given advertiser.
- a “campaign” or “ad campaign” refers to a series of advertisements designed to achieve a larger objective, and may include a start date, an end date, keywords, prices, price limits, and one or more advertisements (i.e., “creatives”) used to market a given good, service, class of goods, or class of services.
- Honda may have one advertising campaign for its automotive line, and a separate advertising campaign for its motorcycle line.
- the campaign for its automotive line may be targeted using a variety of keywords (e.g., “accord”, “sedan”, etc.), each of which may be associated with one or more creatives.
- the ad information 205 can be entered and managed via the ad information entry and management operation(s) 215 .
- Campaign (e.g., targeting) assistance operation(s) 220 can be employed to help advertisers 110 generate effective ad campaigns.
- the campaign assistance operation(s) 220 can use information provided by the inventory system 210 , which, in the context of advertising for use with a search engine, may track all possible ad impressions, ad impressions already reserved, and ad impressions available for given keywords.
- the ad serving operation(s) 230 may service requests for ads from ad consumers 130 .
- the ad serving operation(s) 230 may use relevancy determination operation(s) 235 to determine candidate ads for a given request.
- the ad serving operation(s) 230 may then use optimization operation(s) 240 to select a final set of one or more of the candidate ads.
- the ad serving operation(s) 250 may use presentation ordering operation(s) 250 to order the presentation of the ads to be returned.
- the fraud detection operation(s) 255 can be used to reduce fraudulent use of the advertising system (e.g., by advertisers), such as through the use of stolen credit cards.
- FIG. 5 is high-level block diagram of a machine 500 that may effect one or more of the operations discussed above.
- the machine 500 basically includes a processor(s) 510 , an input/output interface unit(s) 530 , a storage device(s) 520 , and a system bus or network 540 for facilitating the communication of information among the coupled elements.
- An input device(s) 532 and an output device(s) 534 may be coupled with the input/output interface(s) 530 .
- the processor(s) 510 may execute machine-executable instructions (e.g., C or C++ running on the Solaris operating system available from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. or the Linux operating system widely available from a number of vendors such as Red Hat, Inc. of Durham, N.C.) to effect one or more aspects of the present invention. At least a portion of the machine executable instructions may be stored (temporarily or more permanently) on the storage device(s) 520 and/or may be received from an external source via an input interface unit 530 .
- machine-executable instructions e.g., C or C++ running on the Solaris operating system available from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. or the Linux operating system widely available from a number of vendors such as Red Hat, Inc. of Durham, N.C.
- the machine 500 may be one or more conventional personal computers.
- the processing unit(s) 510 may be one or more microprocessors.
- the bus 540 may include a system bus.
- the storage devices 520 may include system memory, such as read only memory (ROM) and/or random access memory (RAM).
- the storage device(s) 520 may also include a hard disk drive for reading from and writing to a hard disk, a magnetic disk drive for reading from or writing to a (e.g., removable) magnetic disk, and an optical disk drive for reading from or writing to a removable (magneto-) optical disk such as a compact disk or other (magneto-) optical media.
- a user may enter commands and information into the personal computer through input devices 532 , such as a keyboard and pointing device (e.g., a mouse) for example.
- Other input devices such as a microphone, a joystick, a game pad, a satellite dish, a scanner, or the like, may also (or alternatively) be included.
- These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit(s) 510 through an appropriate interface 530 coupled to the system bus 540 .
- no input devices other than those needed to accept queries, and possibly those for system administration and maintenance, are needed.
- the output device(s) 534 may include a monitor or other type of display device, which may also be connected to the system bus 540 via an appropriate interface.
- the personal computer may include other (peripheral) output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers for example. Again, in the context of presentation ordering operation(s), no output devices, other than those needed to communicate query results, and possibly those for system administration and maintenance, are needed.
- FIG. 6 is an abstract illustration of a display page 610 .
- the outline 620 depicted with dashed lines corresponds to a portion of the display page 610 that may be viewed on a typical personal computer display screen at a typical resolution.
- the exemplary display page 610 may include header information 612 (e.g., the name of search engine host), trailer information 616 (e.g., copyright, navigational hypertext links, etc.), a plurality of search results 614 and a plurality of ads 618 a , 618 b , and 618 c .
- the search results 614 are maintained as distinct from the ads 618 , so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- FIG. 6 shows only three ads 618 , embodiments consistent with the present invention may have more or less ads. For example, ten search results combined with ten ads has been found to be effective.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an ordering method consistent with the present invention.
- a list of candidate ads is obtained.
- this list contains four ads, called A, B, C, and D.
- one or more performance parameters (or more generally, “performance information”) for each candidate ad is identified.
- Examples of a performance parameter include a click-through count, a click-through rate (e.g., the number of times an ad is selected divided by the number of times the ad is rendered), a conversion count (e.g., the number of times a transaction, associated with an ad, is consummated, either immediately or at some later time), a conversion rate, user ratings of the ad, focus group ratings of the ad, a measure of user interest for the ad weighted for a size of the ad relative to that of other ads, a measure of user interest for the ad weighted for past positions of the ad relative to those past positions of other ads, expected user interest in the ad, a time needed to render the ad relative to that needed to render other ads, and a measure of user interest for the ad weighted for a media type of the ad, etc.
- the performance parameter may be a combination of time-weighted performance parameter data. Window functions may be applied to performance parameter
- a performance parameter of an ad may be keyword-dependent, or associated with a keyword or keywords.
- a keyword-dependent performance parameter is an ad click-through rate for a given keyword(s).
- One embodiment of the present invention can apply a threshold to such a keyword-dependent performance parameter to determine whether or not to render a candidate ad when a query includes the keyword(s) that caused the ad to be deemed relevant. For example, if the click-through rate of a particular ad is below a predetermined value (e.g., 0.5%) for a particular keyword(s), that ad could either (a) not be rendered at all for the particular keyword(s), or (b) rendered less frequently that it would be otherwise for the particular keyword(s).
- a predetermined value e.g., 0.5%
- the performance parameter is a windowed, time-weighted function of (e.g., average) click-through rate for the ad.
- the time period for a window (both how long the window is and when in time the window begins) may be adjusted. For example, a long window will better reflect historical trends but may be less sensitive to recent changes. Similarly, the starting point (in time) for the window will affect its sensitivity to recent or historical information.
- the data within the window may also be tuned. For example, rather than treating each data point within the window equally, it may be desirable to give some data points (e.g., more recent ones) greater weight than other data points.
- the window and weighting parameters By adjusting the window and weighting parameters, therefore, one can customize the performance parameter (in this case click-through rate) to achieve desired results.
- ads A, B, C, and D have the following windowed, time-weighted average click-through rates, respectively: 5.1%, 0.3%, 7.2%, and 2.9%.
- a score is determined for each candidate ad based on the one or more performance parameter(s).
- the ads may be ordered based on their scores, and the method 250 ′ may then be left via RETURN node 350 . In the present example, the order would be C, A, D, B.
- the method described by FIG. 3 is particularly well suited for an environment wherein the advertiser pays each time the ad is shown (i.e., per impression), regardless of whether a user actually clicks on the ad.
- the cost to the advertiser varies based on the order of the ad. For example, an ad that is ranked first may cost $15.00 per thousand impressions (i.e., $15 CPM) whereas an ad that is ranked second may cost $12.00 per thousand impressions, and an ad that is ranked third may cost $10.00 per thousand impressions. This reflects an assumption that the higher ranked ads will be placed more prominently (e.g., higher on a search results page) and will thereby be more effective in attracting business from the viewer.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of another ordering method consistent with the present invention.
- a list of candidate ads is obtained.
- this list contains the four ads described above in reference to FIG. 3 : A, B, C, and D.
- one or more performance parameters (or more generally, “performance information”) for each candidate ad is identified.
- the performance parameter is a windowed, time-weighted average click-through rate for the ad, as described above in reference to FIG. 3 .
- ads A, B, C, and D have the following windowed, time-weighted average click-through rates, respectively: 5.1%, 0.3%, 7.2%, and 2.9%.
- a price parameter (or more generally, “price information”) is identified for each candidate ad.
- a price parameter include cost per impression, cost per selection (e.g., click-through), cost per conversion, etc.
- this price is a cost-per-click, which may be defined in advance as a negotiated or auction-based fee, or may be determined dynamically as a function of the ad's performance. Assume that at a given point in time, ads A, B, C, and D have the following costs-per-click, respectively: $0.30 per thousand clicks, $0.20 per thousand clicks, $0.10 per thousand clicks, and $0.20 per thousand clicks.
- a score is determined for each candidate ad based on the one or more performance parameters and the price.
- this score is a product of the windowed, time-weighted average click-through rate and the cost-per-click. Accordingly, ad A has a score of 1.53 (5.1% multiplied by 0.30), ad B has a score of 0.06 (0.3% multiplied by 0.20), ad C has a score of 1.44 (7.2% multiplied by 0.20), and ad D has a score of 0.58 (2.9% multiplied by 0.20).
- the ads may be ordered based on their scores, and the method 250 ′ may then be left via RETURN node 460 . In the present example, the order would be A, C, D, B.
- a multiplier e.g., 1.3
- Statistical weighting e.g., based on a deviation such as a standard deviation
- time and/or statistical weighting may be used, for example, to desensitize the presentation ordering operation(s) to spikes or other anomalies.
- the ad consumer 130 is a search engine that requested three ads.
- the three highest scoring ads (A, C, and D) would be returned, with ad C being shown in position 618 a , ad A in position 618 b , and ad D in position 618 c .
- the three highest scoring ads (A, C, and D) would be returned, with ad A being shown in position 618 a , ad C in position 618 b , and ad D in position 618 c .
- a relative size of other prominence feature of the ad in addition to, or instead of, the placement order of the ads, may be based on the scores associated with the ads.
- One factor to consider with methods consistent with the present invention is that it may be desirable not to show only the highest ranking ads. For example, it may be that new or low ranking ads have not been shown enough to have a statistically meaningful performance parameter. In this case (or even in general), one might artificially or temporarily increase the scores for certain ads (e.g., new or low ranking ads) at random, periodic, or other intervals. Alternatively, it may be desirable never to return ads with scores below a defined threshold, so long as they have been shown a statistically sufficient number of times to discern their performance.
- a potential benefit of the organization of exemplary display page 610 is that the search results 614 are maintained as distinct from the ads 618 .
- the search results are ordered based on criteria that determines how relevant those information sources are to the search query entered by the user.
- the ads are ordered based on the methods described above. Yet by maintaining clear linear separation between the search results 614 and the ads 618 , the user is not misled into confusing search results with paid advertisements. This allows the display of multiple ads on the same page as multiple search results while maintaining separation between the two such that a viewer can clearly distinguish search results from paid ads.
- display page 610 shows the advertisements positioned to the right of (adjacent) search results, other ways to separate the content from the advertisements are also possible. For example, the advertisements could be positioned to the left of (adjacent) search results.
- the advertising techniques described above account for the interests of users (e.g., users of a search engine) by providing them with ads that are of interest and that are not easily confused with noncommercial requested content (such as search results), if any. Further, the interests of the advertisers are well served since users will presumably be more likely to click-through on ads that are of interest to them.
- presentation ordering operation(s) 250 can be distributed among various ad consumers 130 , rather than operating centrally at the ad entry, maintenance and delivery system(s) 120 .
