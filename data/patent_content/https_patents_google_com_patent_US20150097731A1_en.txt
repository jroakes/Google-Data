- GPS global positioning system
- Two notable weak points with the use of GPS are the inability to determine a position when not receiving signals from more than one satellite (due to shielding by buildings or geographic features or improper antenna orientation) and use of more power consuming electronics.
- Another method of locating a portable communication device 100 such as a mobile phone, is by using fixed cell phone towers (cell tower triangulation), provided that signals can be received by those towers.
- a third method of locating a portable communication device 100 is by using a fixed array of radio frequency transceivers (integrated receivers and transmitters) distributed over a specific area to form a WLAN to relay signals wirelessly from the portable communication device 100 to a specific point, such as to a monitoring center or a gateway to the Internet, which in turn transmits the signal to a remote monitoring center. Then, by using either time of arrival or signal strength of a portable communication device 100 reaching a distributed transceiver, the location of the portable communication device 100 can be determined. Whatever, the outdoor location service that is employed, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can still face an ambiguity of whether the device is indoor or outdoor or to what extent the device can or should attempt to receive outdoor location services.

- the dead reckoning engine 233 can provide a power saving mode or provide a fallback capability for location services.
- This power saving mode for location services can include reducing reliance upon accurate but higher power consuming location services such as GPS.
- Real-time location-detection allows for many location-based applications such as store finding, transit routing, and advertisement targeting.
- GPS and cell-tower signals are typically used for detecting the location of mobile devices.
- cell-tower signals may not provide highly accurate or precise information about location, and GPS signals may not be available when satellite signals are obstructed, such as when the mobile device is in or near a building.
- receiving and processing GPS signals may consume substantial energy and hence shorten battery duration.
- MEMS Microelectromechanical Systems
- MEMS sensors are typically very small mechanical devices which are driven by electricity.
- MEMS sensors include accelerometers, digital compasses, functional sensors, gyroscopes, and inertial modules.
- MEMS sensors can provide information about the movement of a mobile device.

It is further appreciated that in one or more alternate embodiments, the data storage device 257 can actually be remote storage and not an integral part of the portable communication device 100 itself
- the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can also derive contextual information 116 ′′ from a combination of sensor data 114 and contextual information 116 ′.
- the contextual information 116 ′ in the data storage device 257 can include personal information used by the personal assistant utility 225 , depicted as calendar/appointment data 259 .
- sunrise/sunset data 261 can be used with sensor data 114 from the chronometer 255 in conjunction with current location. Thereby, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can determine whether it should be daylight when outdoors.
- Such contextual information 116 ′′ can then be compared to sensor data 114 from the ambient light sensor 245 .
- contextual information 116 ′ can include contextual history data 263 . For example, past transitions from indoor to outdoor or outdoor to indoor at a particular location can be associated with certain sensor data 114 , as discussed below with regard to FIG. 3 . Identifying locations for such contextual history data 263 can be made with reference to a location cell data/geographic coordinate look up table (LUT) 265 .

- a state diagram 500 depicts how indoor/outdoor transition determinations can, in some instances, avoid a disruption in a data communication session by invoking a soft handover rather than a hard handover between different RANs.
- a hard handover occurs when the portable communication device has lost data service, which can interrupt an on-going data session or delay connecting to another host, as compared to a soft handover with service still available from a current host. Since transitions between indoor and outdoor can create abrupt changes in signal strength, the transition is early with regard to power thresholds currently sensed in order to ensure a soft handover.

- WiFi and dead-reckoning can be more accurate, particularly indoors when GPS is not available, as the WiFi location engine can be used to limit the growth in error of a dead-reckoning system.
- the indoor/outdoor determinations can use a GPS receiver, WiFi transceiver, sensor processor, contextual knowledge (schedule, email searches, social media interaction, etc.) in order to determine when entering/exiting home, office, coffee shop, train station, etc., and to take appropriate action.
- indoor/outdoor determinations can be made as when best to switch a portable communication device between an indoor operating state and an outdoor operating state.
- the determination can generally relate to sensing whether the portable communication device is inside of a structure or outside of a structure.
- the operating state is not necessarily co-extensive with a physical state of being indoors or outdoors.
- a small coverage area device such as a wireless access point or a femtocell can extend from an indoor space to an outdoor space. Economics of data subscription rates for service from a small coverage area device can generally encourage reverting to an indoor operating state when possible, even when technically in the outdoor space.
- determining that the portable communication device will soon transition can prompt an early switch thereby ensuring a soft handover rather than a hard handover with a resulting degradation in Quality of Service (QoS).
- Contextual information can indicate that an abrupt loss of service can occur when transitioning between indoor and outdoor whereas normal handover thresholds assume a gradual change in power levels.

Accessing GPS can depend on whether in the GPS module is in a cold start 504 , warm start 506 , or hot start 508 condition. Cold start 504 is performed every time the GPS module is turned off without a backup power supply connected. During Cold Start 504 , almanac and ephemeris data have to be downloaded first from the GPS satellites to GPS module before a position fix can be acquired.
- GPS module will perform Hot Start 508 if the GPS module is powered on any time within the two-hour time frame after GPS was previously turned off, as the ephemeris and almanac data is still stored inside the flash memory or a battery backed up Random Access Memory (RAM) of GPS module.
- Hot Start 506 is performed if the above module is started after the two-hour time frame but with almanac and ephemeris data at least partially available. In warm start 506 , part of the satellite data of the GPS module has to be refreshed.

- the device can be determined to be located outside if three or more GPS satellites can be received with C/No of at least 23 db-Hz.
- the GPS is ON since GPS signals are generally available and often used for location services when outdoors due to their accuracy and independence from terrestrial navigation aids.

- a determination can be made as to whether the number of detected SSIDs (Service Set Identification) is greater than five (5) and the SSID is repeated for multiple MAC (Medium Access Control) addresses. For example, a determination can be made whether an SSID is repeated for multiple MAC addresses on multiple frequencies because the default on many residential routers is on channel 6 with a default SSID. If the criteria for number of detected SSIDs is more than five (5) and the SSID is repeated for multiple MAC addresses, then portable communication device 100 can be deemed to be within an indoor enterprise such as a work facility.

If signal strength of the small coverage area device indicates an ambiguity of whether the device is transitioning indoor, then sensor data and contextual information is used to resolve the ambiguity. As shown by transition 524 , if the transition is determined, then indoor operating state 516 is performed. Indoor operating state 516 can entail a soft handover of a data session before service is lost, as well as selecting or configuring applications and sensors for indoor operating state 516 .
- a repeated process can be performed wherein an inference of a transition from indoor to outdoor is performed as depicted at 526 . For example, if signal strength of the small coverage area device indicates an ambiguity of whether transitioning outdoor, then sensor data and contextual information is used to resolve the ambiguity. If the device is transitioning states, as depicted at 528 , then outdoor operating state 512 is activated. This transition from indoor operating state 516 to outdoor operating state 512 can entail an early handover of a data session before service is lost, as well selecting or configuring applications and sensors for outdoor operating state 512 .

- the portable communication device 100 determines whether a power threshold is met. In response to the power threshold not being met by the monitored WLAN RSSI and SSIDs in block 1006 , then the method 1000 returns to block 1004 to continue monitoring.
- the portable communication device 100 checks dead reckoning sensors and contextual sensors/data for an inference engine (indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 ). Based upon this checking of the dead reckoning sensors and contextual sensors/data in block 1008 , the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 determines whether a confident prediction can be made that the portable communication device 100 is outside (block 1010 ). This prediction can involve, but is not necessarily limited to, comparing the amount of detected movement and direction of such movement with a threshold based upon pre-established movement data associated with the device being outdoors. Other predictive mechanisms are supported as well.
- the method 1000 returns to block 1004 to continue monitoring for WLAN RSSI and SSIDs. However, if able to predict being outside in block 1010 , then in block 1012 the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 of the portable communication device 100 checks for GPS and cellular RAN access. In response to this checking of the GPS and cellular RAN in block 1012 , the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 of the portable communication device 100 makes a determination of whether the GPS and/or cellular RAN signals meet a threshold for being outside (block 1014 ). If neither the GPS signals nor cellular RAN signals meet the threshold for being outside in block 1014 , the method 1000 returns to block 1004 to continue monitoring WLAN RSSI and SSIDs. However, if either the GPS signals or the cellular RAN signals meet the threshold for being outside in block 1014 , then in block 1016 , the portable communication device 100 performs a handover from the WLAN to a cellular data network.
- embodiments of the present innovation may be embodied as a system, device, and/or method.

Description
- 1. Technical Field
- The present disclosure generally relates to location and data services on a portable communication device, and more particularly to detecting whether the portable communication device is indoors or outdoors to appropriately configure location and data services.
- 2. Description of the Related Art
- Personal electronic devices such as smart phones are becoming ubiquitous, providing a constant source of entertainment, communication, navigation, and personal assistance. Some of these functions depend upon determining the location of a portable communication device. Outside location services such as by receiving signals from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites can give such location and motion information, although with an increase in power consumption. GNSS is generally not accessible indoors nor is there typically a need for such location services indoors. Similarly, the portable communication device in many instances is multimode with regard to accessing data service. Certain multimode portable communication devices can access small coverage area devices or systems, such as WiFi devices and cellular femtocells, when indoors and can access wireless wide area networks (WWAN), such as cellular radio access networks (RAN), when outdoors. Configuring the portable communication device for efficient power consumption, data service, and location service functionality can thus depend on accurately determining whether the device is in an indoor space or an outdoor space.

- According to one or more embodiments, a portable communication device includes at least one communication mechanism that enables communicating with at least one of a location service, a RAN, and a small coverage area device or system.

- Turning now to
FIG. 1 , there is depicted a block diagram representation of an exampleportable communication device 100 within which several of the features of the disclosure can be implemented. Theportable communication device 100 can be one of a host of different types of devices, including but not limited to, a mobile cellular phone or smart-phone, a laptop, a net-book, an ultra-book, a networked smart watch or networked sports/exercise watch, and/or a tablet computing device or similar device that can include wireless communication functionality. As a device supporting wireless communication,portable communication device 100 can be one of, and also be referred to as, a system, device, subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station (MS), mobile, mobile device, remote station, remote terminal, user terminal, terminal, communication device, user agent, user device, cellular telephone, a satellite phone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, a computing device, or other processing devices connected to a wireless modem. These various devices all provide and/or include the necessary hardware and software to support the various wireless or wired communication functions as part of acommunication system 102. - According to the general illustration, the
portable communication device 100 is a processing device having at least onecommunication mechanism 104 that enables communicating with at least one of alocation service 106, a RAN 108, and a smallcoverage area device 110. At least onesensor 112 generatessensor data 114 that can be utilized ascontextual information 116 that may be used to assist in differentiating between anindoor space 118 versus anoutdoor space 120 of theportable communication device 100. The at least onesensor 112 can be on-device, i.e., commonly housed within theportable communication device 100, or can optionally be external to (see 112′ depicted in phantom), but moving with theportable communication device 100. As an example of theexternal sensor 112′, the sensor can be an accessory device worn or carried by the user (see, for example, 100′,FIG. 2 ) and which can provide additional sensed or detected data. Theexternal sensor 112′ is not integral to the handset itself. In one alternate embodiment, sensor data can be received from a remoteexternal sensor 112′ that is completely separate fromportable communication device 100 and which communicates sensed data or information toportable communication device 100 via an external wired or wireless communication medium. For simplicity in the description of the disclosure, the various possible types of sensors can be generally referenced assensor 112 or at least onesensor 112. At least oneprocessor 122 is communicatively coupled to the at least onesensor 112 and the at least onecommunication mechanism 104. An indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 executes on the at least oneprocessor 122 and configures theportable communication device 100 to: - (a) measure a signal strength 126 of at least one of a
location service signal 128, aRAN signal 130, and a smallcoverage area signal 132 that is detectable within acurrent location 134 of theportable communication device 100, wherein signal strength 126 can be a magnitude measurement of an individual signal or of each of a minimum number ofdetectable signals 128′ from multiple source transmission system (e.g., GNSS satellites); - (b) compare the signal strength 126 to a corresponding pre-established
signal strength threshold 136 and where applicable, compare the number of signal sources to a threshold minimum number required for a clear signal (e.g., with GNSS satellites whose visibility to theportable communication device 100 can vary based on the portable communication device being indoors or outdoors); - (c) obtain
contextual information 116 by accessingsensor data 114 from at least onesensor 112 selected based on a result of the comparing; - (d) determine, utilizing the
contextual information 116, whether theportable communication device 100 is transitioning between outdoor space and indoor space, i.e. from one of (i) anoutdoor space 120 to anindoor space 118 and (ii) anindoor space 118 to anoutdoor space 120; and - (e) in response to determining that the
portable communication device 100 is transitioning from one of (a) theindoor space 118 to theoutdoor space 120 and (b) theoutdoor space 120 to theindoor space 118, configure theportable communication device 100 for operation within an end location (outdoor space 120,indoor space 118, respectively) to which theportable communication device 100 is transitioning. For example, adjustments can be made to at least one of (i) operatingparameters 144 and (ii)device settings 146. - For example, the small
coverage area device 110 provides cellular or wireless fidelity (WiFi) or wireless broadband service to asmall coverage area 140 generally intended to be limited to at least a portion of an interior space within astructure 142. Thesmall coverage area 140 can also extend into theoutdoor space 120 as well as theindoor space 118. Thus, there can be an ambiguous state in which aportable communication device 100 can be in theoutdoor space 120 yet be within thesmall coverage area 140. As such, a transition betweenindoor space 118 andoutdoor space 120 can result in an abrupt change in availability of service. Generally, the smallcoverage area device 110 has a strong signal within theindoor space 118 and a rapidly diminishing signal outside of thestructure 142 surrounding theindoor space 118, i.e., within theoutdoor space 120. Conversely, thelocation service 106 andRAN 108 each has a relatively strong signal outside of thestructure 142 in theoutdoor space 120 and have weaker signal within thestructure 142 in theindoor space 118. Strength of thelocation service 106 can also be a function of a number of visible or receivable satellite signals of a GNSS at a higher Carrier-to-Noise (C/No) ratio in theoutdoor space 120 as compared to theindoor space 118. Thecurrent location 134 is depicted in an illustrative transitional area wherein all thelocation service 106, theRAN 108, and smallcoverage area device 110 are accessible to theportable communication device 100. - In
FIG. 2 , there is depicted anexample communication system 102 that is capable of simultaneously supporting wireless multiple-access communication for multiple wireless terminals such asportable communication device 100. Theportable communication device 100 includes the hardware and software to support the various wireless or wired communication functions as part of acommunication system 102. Theportable communication device 100 can be a unitary device or an apparatus carried by an individual or vehicle having components in wired or wireless communication, such as a depicted multifunction,networked watch 100′ that performs some or all functions of communication and sensing. - The
communication mechanism 104 of theportable communication device 100 can be a Personal Access Network (PAN) or Wireless Local Access Network (WLAN)transceiver 203 that transmits and receives over anantenna 205. In addition, for purposes of the disclosure, thecommunication mechanism 104 is defined to include aGPS receiver 207 that receives GPS satellite signals over aGPS antenna 209. The process by which theGPS receiver 207 receives a GPS signal that is transmitted from a remote satellite is occasionally referenced as a “communication”, insofar as GPS signal receipt involves one form of wireless signal propagation or communication. Alternatively or in addition, thecommunication mechanism 104 can be a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)transceiver 211 that communicates data packets encoded or decoded by amodem 213 via anantenna 215 toRAN 108. For clarity, threeantennas - The
communication mechanism 104 can communicate, for example, by using the PAN/WLAN transceiver 203 with the smallcoverage area device 110 that utilizes associated communication protocols. A PAN/WLAN transceiver 203 is not necessarily limited to any particular protocol, and instead may encompass any relatively short range or limited area wireless communication link. Examples of PAN protocols which may be used in the various embodiments include Bluetooth®, IEEE 802.15.4, and Zigbee® wireless communication protocols and standards. Another exemplary low power radio technology protocol is the ANT protocol, ANT+ (or ANT Plus) protocol, etc. ANT+ protocol is an interoperability function that can be added to the base ANT protocol, which is a proprietary wireless sensor network technology. ANT+ is primarily designed for collection and transfer of sensor data, to manageable units of various types. The ANT+ protocol radio can be used for data-transfer for a number of devices such as heart rate monitors, speed sensors, cadence sensors, foot pods, power meters, activity monitors, calorimeters, body mass index measuring devices, blood pressure monitors, blood glucose meters, pulse oximeters, positions tracking, short range homing beacons (e.g., disc golf, geo-caching), weight measuring devices, control of music players, temperature sensors, etc. For example, the multifunction networked, watch 100′ can have apedometer 270 and apulse rate sensor 272. In addition to these PAN protocols, wireless proximity-limited communication links may be established using other close range communication media, including for example radio frequency identification (RFID) tag and the IrDA (Infrared Data Association) protocols. Also, other close range wireless protocols and standards may be developed and may be used in the various embodiments in the same manner as described herein. Further, longer range wireless communication protocols may be used with modifications or additions to limit their effective range to the vicinity of theportable communication device 100. For example, WiFi and WiMax wireless communication protocols could also be used in combination with range-limiting features. For example, the power of miniaturized sensor transmitters (multifunctionnetworked watch 100′) may be limited. Thus, either or both of theWWAN transceiver 211 and PAN/WLAN transceiver 203 can function at least during certain intervals as a PAN transceiver, although using a communication protocol typically capable of and used for a greater range. As another example, round-trip communication delay limits may be imposed such that the on-device or on-vehicle communication links can only be established if the round trip of such signals is less than a threshold set to reject signals sent from more than a dozen feet or so, which may be as short as two to three feet separation. - Alternatively or in addition, the
communication mechanism 104 can communicate by using theWWAN transceiver 203 with the smallcoverage area device 110, such as a cellular femtocell. To supplement conventional mobile phone network base stations (commonly referred to as macrocell base stations, NodeBs, etc.), additional small-coverage base stations may be deployed to provide more robust wireless coverage for the wireless terminals. These small-coverage base stations may be commonly referred to as access point base stations, Home NodeBs, femto access points, femtocells, etc., and may be deployed for incremental capacity growth, richer user experience, in-building coverage, or the like. Typically, such small-coverage base stations are connected to the Internet and the mobile operator's network via a broadband connection, such as a digital subscriber line (DSL) router, cable or other modem, etc. Small-coverage base stations may also provide additional or enhanced services (e.g., increased bandwidth, unlimited access, access to other devices, etc.) to one or more wireless terminals. - The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication networks that operate according to, but not limited to, any one or more of the OMA (Open Mobile Alliance), 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), 3GPP2 (3rd Generation Partnership Project 2), IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.xx, and WiMAX Forum standards. The terms “networks” and “systems” are often used interchangeably. Such communication networks can be Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) networks, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) networks, Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) networks, Single-Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) networks, etc. A CDMA network may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), CDMA 2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA). CDMA2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA network may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA network may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM, etc. UTRA, E-UTRA, and GSM are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a recent release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA. UTRA, E-UTRA, GSM, UMTS and LTE are described in documents from the 3GPP organization. CDMA2000 is described in documents from the 3GPP2 organization. These various radio technologies and standards are known in the art.
- Location service 106 (
FIG. 1 ) can be provided by a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Globalnaya navigatsionnaya sputnikovaya sistema (GLONASS), GALILEO or BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). In the exampleportable device 100,location service 106 is provided byGPS 106 a. Alternatively or in addition,location service 106 can be provided by triangulating from one ormore RANs 108. Alternatively or in addition,location service 106 can be provided by “sniffing” of smallcoverage area devices 110 such as one or more wireless access points, femtocells, relays, etc. Thelocation service 106, such asGPS 106 a, can be more accurate when in theoutdoor space 120. However, in some instances thelocation service 106 can be less accurate or even unavailable when in theoutdoor space 120, such as when in an urban canyon or anobstruction 217 creates a multipath error. - Referring now to the specific component makeup and the associated functionality of the presented components,
portable communication device 100 can include anapplication processor 122 a, which connects via a plurality of bus interconnects (illustrated by the bi-directional arrows) to a plurality of functional components ofportable communication device 100. Theapplication processor 122 a controls the communication, image capture, user interface, and other functions and/or operations ofportable communication device 100. These functions and/or operations thus include, but are not limited to, application data processing. Asensor processor 122 b performs digital signal processing and provides signal interfaces tosensors 112. The present innovation can be implemented using hardware component equivalents such as special purpose hardware, dedicated processors, general purpose computers, microprocessor-based computers, micro-controllers, optical computers, analog computers, dedicated processors and/or dedicated hard wired logic.Application processor 122 a andsensor processor 122 b can include separate programmable microprocessors or can both be integrated into a single processing device, in some embodiments. - Connected to
application processor 122 a ismemory 219, which can include volatile memory and/or non-volatile memory. Moreover, an embodiment can be implemented as a computer-readable storage device having computer readable code stored thereon for programming a computer (e.g., comprising a processor) to perform a method as described and claimed herein. - One or more executable applications can be stored within memory for execution by
application processor 122 a. For example,memory 219 is illustrated as containing the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124.Memory 219 also can contain anindoor application 221, anoutdoor application 223, apersonal assistant utility 225, acell mapping utility 227, and ageographic map utility 229. The indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can assist the other applications and utilities inmemory 219 by detecting being indoor or outdoor and by responding with appropriate location services. For example, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can include alocation tracking component 231 that can use indoor and outdoor location services. An example of indoor location services can be adead reckoning engine 233. Yet another example of indoor location services that can be utilized is WiFi tri-lateration. The indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can utilize anapplication interface 235 to selectively provide indoor location service or outdoor location service to the indoor andoutdoor applications - The indoor/
outdoor detection utility 124 can also utilize outdoor location services such as GPS, which allows the location ofportable communication device 100 to be pin-pointed when signals from multiple GPS satellites are received by theGPS receiver 207. Two notable weak points with the use of GPS are the inability to determine a position when not receiving signals from more than one satellite (due to shielding by buildings or geographic features or improper antenna orientation) and use of more power consuming electronics. Another method of locating aportable communication device 100, such as a mobile phone, is by using fixed cell phone towers (cell tower triangulation), provided that signals can be received by those towers. A third method of locating aportable communication device 100 is by using a fixed array of radio frequency transceivers (integrated receivers and transmitters) distributed over a specific area to form a WLAN to relay signals wirelessly from theportable communication device 100 to a specific point, such as to a monitoring center or a gateway to the Internet, which in turn transmits the signal to a remote monitoring center. Then, by using either time of arrival or signal strength of aportable communication device 100 reaching a distributed transceiver, the location of theportable communication device 100 can be determined. Whatever, the outdoor location service that is employed, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can still face an ambiguity of whether the device is indoor or outdoor or to what extent the device can or should attempt to receive outdoor location services. - The
portable communication device 100 also comprises one or more input/output devices, depicted as auser interface device 239. For example, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 viaapplication interface 235 can effect when or if an indoor oroutdoor application application user interface device 239 respectively at 221′, 223′. It should be appreciated that theuser interface device 239 can include one or more integral or distinct input devices, such ascamera 241,microphone 243, touch screen and/or touch pad, keypad, and/or one or more integral or distinct output devices, such as display, speaker and others (not shown). Some input devices can also be used, or have a dedicated purpose, ascontextual sensors 112 a rather than for theuser interface 239. Examples of other contextual sensors can be an ambientlight sensor 245 andtemperature sensor 247. - Indoor location services can be provided by
dead reckoning engine 233 of indoor/outdoor detection utility 124. For instance, thesensor processor 122 b can accesssensor data 114 fromdead reckoning sensors 112 b depicted asgyroscope 249,accelerometers 251,magnetometer 253,chronometer 255,barometer 267, andaltimeter 269. Whether indoor or outdoor, thedead reckoning engine 233 can provide a power saving mode or provide a fallback capability for location services. - This power saving mode for location services can include reducing reliance upon accurate but higher power consuming location services such as GPS. Real-time location-detection allows for many location-based applications such as store finding, transit routing, and advertisement targeting. In outdoor environments, GPS and cell-tower signals are typically used for detecting the location of mobile devices. However, cell-tower signals may not provide highly accurate or precise information about location, and GPS signals may not be available when satellite signals are obstructed, such as when the mobile device is in or near a building. Moreover, receiving and processing GPS signals may consume substantial energy and hence shorten battery duration. In addition to GPS sensors, some mobile devices are equipped with MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems) sensors. MEMS sensors are typically very small mechanical devices which are driven by electricity. Various types of MEMS sensors include accelerometers, digital compasses, functional sensors, gyroscopes, and inertial modules. MEMS sensors can provide information about the movement of a mobile device. For example, they provide information about acceleration or the orientation of an object by generating electrical signals that correspond with dynamic forces, such as user movement of the device, or static forces such as gravity that act on the device.
- Current technology may use either GPS, WiFi, such as Google® Location Services, or cell-tower signals to determine location. However, GPS signal receiving and processing consumes significant power, and cell-tower signals can provide prediction with only about 300-meter accuracy, on average, or 50-meter accuracy at best. Position information of a
portable communication device 100 can be obtained with increased accuracy and reduced power consumption, such as by combining information from a GPS location sensor (GPS receiver 207) with information from MEMS devices such as an acceleration detectors (accelerometers 251) and agyroscope 249 using statistical analysis techniques such as a Kalman filter to estimate the location of the device with greater accuracy, while using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson Method to minimize power consumption. Minimizing power consumption is possible because GPS signals sampled at a lower rate can conserve power, while GPS sampled at a lower rate and working together with MEMS devices can achieve the same level of location prediction accuracy as a GPS alone sampled at a higher rate. Alternatively or in addition, when the strength of the GPS signal is below a threshold (e.g., less than four (4) satellites can be successfully received and decoded,) the portable communication device can rely entirely upon on-device location services such as MEMS sensors or WiFi trilateration (dead reckoning sensors 112 b). - To reduce the ambiguity of being indoor or outdoor, the indoor/
outdoor detection utility 124 can accesscontextual information 116 from the at least onesensor 112 orcontextual information 116′ contained in adata storage device 257.Data storage device 257 can be any type of available storage device capable of storing one or more application software and data. It is further appreciated that in one or more alternate embodiments, thedata storage device 257 can actually be remote storage and not an integral part of theportable communication device 100 itself The indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can also derivecontextual information 116″ from a combination ofsensor data 114 andcontextual information 116′. For example, thecontextual information 116′ in thedata storage device 257 can include personal information used by thepersonal assistant utility 225, depicted as calendar/appointment data 259. As another example, sunrise/sunset data 261 can be used withsensor data 114 from thechronometer 255 in conjunction with current location. Thereby, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can determine whether it should be daylight when outdoors. Suchcontextual information 116″ can then be compared tosensor data 114 from the ambientlight sensor 245. As an additional example,contextual information 116′ can includecontextual history data 263. For example, past transitions from indoor to outdoor or outdoor to indoor at a particular location can be associated withcertain sensor data 114, as discussed below with regard toFIG. 3 . Identifying locations for suchcontextual history data 263 can be made with reference to a location cell data/geographic coordinate look up table (LUT) 265. - The associated functionality and/or usage of each of the software modules of the indoor/
outdoor detection utility 124 will be described in greater detail within the descriptions which follow. In particular, the functionality associated with and/or provided by indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 is described in greater details with the description ofFIGS. 4-10 and corresponding flow charts and other figures. - In
FIG. 3 , aportable communication device 100 associated with auser 301 traverses through anexample communication system 302 with geographically and behaviorally distinct Contexts A-H that benefit from indoor/outdoor detection. In Context A, a current location 134 a of theportable communication device 100 is within astructure 142 a that is a residence of theuser 301. A smallcoverage area device 110 a is positioned within thestructure 142 a and services asmall coverage area 140 a within anindoor space 118 a and a portion of anoutdoor space 120 a near thestructure 142 a. Theportable communication device 100 that is augmented by the multifunction,networked watch 100′ can determine that no transition from indoor to outdoor is occurring based on one or more factors, such as the signal strength of the smallcoverage area device 110 a being strong (e.g., not below a pre-established signal strength threshold). As another example, theportable communication device 100 can detect that it is stationary. - In Context B, the
portable communication device 100 is in acurrent location 134 b that is also within thestructure 142 a in theindoor space 118 a but is being carried byuser 301. Theportable communication device 100 can respond to determining that thedevice 100 is in theindoor space 118 a by implementing a power saving mode with respect to accessing outside location services, depicted asGPS 106 a. - In Context C, the
portable communication device 100 is in a current location 134 c that is inoutdoor space 120 a outside of thestructure 142 a and is being carried byuser 301. Theportable communication device 100 can receive signals form another smallcoverage area device 110 b in structure 142 b,RAN 108 andGPS 106 a; however, theportable communication device 100 can determine that theuser 301 is not transitioning from indoors to outdoors. Rather, theportable communication device 100 is remaining within relative proximity to the smallcoverage area device 110 a. For purposes of power savings and/or avoiding subscription costs to cellular services fromRAN 108, theportable communication device 100 can remain in a power savings mode with respect to such outside services. - In Context D, the
portable communication device 100 is in acurrent location 134 d that is outside of thestructure 142 a, in theoutdoor space 120 a and is being carried byuser 301. Sensor data from a multifunction,networked watch 100′ can indicate that motion or cardiovascular indications are that theuser 301 is walking or running at a rate that indicates a transition from indoor to outdoor. The timing of a handover or of accessing more accurate outside location services can be based upon a determined rate of movement of theuser 301. - In Context E, the
portable communication device 100 is in acurrent location 134 e that is outside of thestructure 142 a and is being carried byuser 301 within a vehicle in theoutdoor space 120 a. Theportable communication device 100 can detect being in a vehicle, can detect moving at rate indicative of a transition from indoor to outdoor, or can correlate a typical departure time for work, etc. - In Context F, the
portable communication device 100 that is augmented by the multifunction,networked watch 100′ is in acurrent location 134 f that is outside of thestructure 142 c and is being carried byuser 301 leaving the vehicle within theoutdoor space 120 b. Thecurrent location 134 f can be correlated with a known location for work based on historical contextual information or appointment data. - In Context G, the
portable communication device 100 is in a current location 134 g that is inside of thestructure 142 c and is being carried byuser 301 in theinside space 118 b. Thestructure 142 c has portions serviced by respective smallcoverage area devices 110 c each providing a respective smallcoverage area device 140 b. Theportable communication device 100 can detect being in anindoor space 118 b confirmed by contextual information such as proximity to the smallcoverage area devices 110 c or relative position to some subset of the smallcoverage area devices 110 c, use of dead reckoning within the structure 142 b, and/or reliance on time of day as compared to historical contextual information, etc. - In Context H, the
portable communication device 100 is in acurrent location 134 h that is inside of thestructure 142 d and is being carried byuser 301 in theinside space 118 d. This space can be one in which any smallcoverage area device 110 is unknown or unavailable. Theportable communication device 100 can detect being indoor based upon inability to accessGPS 106 a due to lower signal strength and fewer visible satellites orRANs 108. Location services can enter a power saving mode based on relative movement within thestructure 142 d or upon lack of access toGPS 106 a orRANs 108. Theportable communication device 100 can learn new historical contextual information based upon any events sensed upon a transition between outdoor space and indoor space. - In
FIG. 4 , adata structure 400 for historical contextual information can be updated and maintained for the Contexts A-H (FIG. 3 ) with fields including, but not limited to, description, cellular RAN signal strength, GPS, small coverage area device (“wireless”) signal strength, dead reckoning sensor data, contextual sensor data, and derived contextual information. Withindata structure 400, context A has a description of in home and stationary. This conclusion of the state of the device can be derived from the information in fields such as Cellular RAN that indicate that a signal from cellular RAN is moderate and steady. GPS can have a lower strength with a steady, fewer number of visible/receivable signals from satellite vehicles (SV). The small coverage area device signal (e.g., IEEE 802.11 protocol wireless or WiFi) is strong since the small coverage area device is close by. The structure blocks in the signal to a degree and the signal is steady since the device is not moving. Information in a field for a dead reckoning sensor or other location service can corroborate a stationary condition. In Context A, there is not another contextual sensor in use since the device may largely be in a power saving mode. Contextual information derived from time of day, day of week, and personal assistant utilities can indicate that there are no indications of a planned transition from the home location. - Context B can be described in the
data structure 400 as at home with the device in use. Corroborating this conclusion is that again the cellular RAN signal is moderate and steady and the small coverage area signal is strong but varying as distance and indoor structures change reception. GPS can have a lower strength with changing, fewer number of visible/receivable signals from SVs. A dead reckoning sensor can indicate small movements in speed and direction. A contextual sensor for ambient lighting can indicate low lighting, indicative of being indoor. Contextual information can correlate with the physical sensors where the time of day is after sunset on a weekend, and the sensors indicate the device is at a home location with no appointments scheduled that would suggest a transition between indoor and outdoor. - Context C can be described in the
data structure 400 as in home backyard and stationary. The cellular RAN signal can be steady and strong. GPS can have a higher strength with a steady, greater number of visible/receivable signals from SVs. The small coverage area signal is moderate and steady. The dead reckoning sensor or other location service indicates small movements that do not indicate a trajectory away from the house or into the house. A contextual sensor can detect dim sunlight that is corroborated by contextual information for time of day. In addition, the contextual information can provide no indications of appointments or work hours that would suggest departure. - In the
data structure 400, context D can be described as walking outside of home. This conclusion can be corroborated by a cellular RAN signal increasing or remaining consistently strong whereas a small coverage area signal is weakening. GPS can have a higher strength with a changing, greater number of visible/receivable signals from SVs. A dead reckoning sensor or other location service can indicate pedestrian speed movement with a trajectory away from the home. Appointment information can confirm that the user is scheduled to be away from the home. - Context E can be described as driving away from home. This conclusion can be bolstered in the
data structure 400 by a cellular RAN signal that is strong and a small coverage area signal that is weakening quickly. GPS can have a higher strength with a changing, quickly greater number of visible/receivable signals from SVs. A dead reckoning sensor or other location service can indicate that the device is moving quickly away from the home. Contextual information can corroborate a planned departure from a home location. - Context F can be described as walking away from the office parking lot. The
data structure 400 supports this determination based on last location service indicating proximity to a work location, with dead reckoning sensors indicate movement toward the work location. GPS can have a higher strength with a steady, greater number of visible/receivable signals from SVs. The cellular RAN signal is strong. Small coverage area signals are detectable for known office WiFi signals. Contextual sensors can sense other transmitters such as a near field transmission for a badge-activated door lock. Another contextual sensor can be a change in ambient light consistent with moving indoor. Contextual information can further confirm approximate work hours. - Context G can be described as in the office building. In the specific example, the
data structure 400 can support this determination based upon cellular RAN being a weak, steady signal with little reception inside of a multi-floor building. Alternatively, some indoor spaces can include internal antennas or repeaters that compensate for attenuation of cellular signals by building materials which the portable communication device can learn for a particular location. GPS can have a very low strength with a steady/fading number of visible/receivable signals from SVs. The presence of multiple MAC addresses and the same SSID can indicate a work space. Dead reckoning sensor can confirm walking and sitting within a space corresponding to the work location. Contextual sensors could confirm temperature and lighting consistent with a work space. Contextual information can further confirm work hours and work location. - Context H can be described as in a facility without small coverage area access, such as lacking IEEE 802.11 signal access. The
data structure 400 can support this determination by tracking a cellular RAN signal that is moderate and steady, consistent with a small structure providing moderate interference with a cellular signal. GPS can have a very low strength with a steady/fading fewer number of visible/receivable signals from SVs. The wireless data can indicate no accessible small coverage area device. The dead reckoning sensor can indicate walking or sitting within the location without any trajectory away from the location. Contextual sensors can confirm indoor temperature and lighting. Contextual information can indicate that this location is new. Learning can occur for this new location, especially if the user enables connection to a small coverage area device. - In
FIG. 5 , a state diagram 500 depicts how indoor/outdoor transition determinations can, in some instances, avoid a disruption in a data communication session by invoking a soft handover rather than a hard handover between different RANs. A hard handover occurs when the portable communication device has lost data service, which can interrupt an on-going data session or delay connecting to another host, as compared to a soft handover with service still available from a current host. Since transitions between indoor and outdoor can create abrupt changes in signal strength, the transition is early with regard to power thresholds currently sensed in order to ensure a soft handover. Alternatively or in addition, the indoor/outdoor determinations can, in some instances, invoke an appropriate indoor mode for power saving on location services usage. Thereby, portable communication device 100 (FIG. 1 or 2) can know when it is indoor versus outdoor and what the best network is in terms of accuracy and current consumption to update location. In addition, transitioning from an outside mode to an indoor mode can prompt seeding a dead-reckoning engine with a previously determined outside location. Alternatively, location determination when in an indoor location can be based upon WiFi RSSI/SSID tri-lateration or Google Location Service. In an exemplary embodiment, WiFi and dead-reckoning can be more accurate, particularly indoors when GPS is not available, as the WiFi location engine can be used to limit the growth in error of a dead-reckoning system. The indoor/outdoor determinations can use a GPS receiver, WiFi transceiver, sensor processor, contextual knowledge (schedule, email searches, social media interaction, etc.) in order to determine when entering/exiting home, office, coffee shop, train station, etc., and to take appropriate action. - For these and other reasons, indoor/outdoor determinations can be made as when best to switch a portable communication device between an indoor operating state and an outdoor operating state. The determination can generally relate to sensing whether the portable communication device is inside of a structure or outside of a structure. However, the operating state is not necessarily co-extensive with a physical state of being indoors or outdoors. For example, a small coverage area device such as a wireless access point or a femtocell can extend from an indoor space to an outdoor space. Economics of data subscription rates for service from a small coverage area device can generally encourage reverting to an indoor operating state when possible, even when technically in the outdoor space. However, determining that the portable communication device will soon transition can prompt an early switch thereby ensuring a soft handover rather than a hard handover with a resulting degradation in Quality of Service (QoS). Contextual information can indicate that an abrupt loss of service can occur when transitioning between indoor and outdoor whereas normal handover thresholds assume a gradual change in power levels.
- An
initial start state 502 is activated with power-up or wake-up ofdevice 100. Accessing GPS can depend on whether in the GPS module is in acold start 504,warm start 506, orhot start 508 condition.Cold start 504 is performed every time the GPS module is turned off without a backup power supply connected. DuringCold Start 504, almanac and ephemeris data have to be downloaded first from the GPS satellites to GPS module before a position fix can be acquired. Assuming that a proper backup power source is provided, GPS module will performHot Start 508 if the GPS module is powered on any time within the two-hour time frame after GPS was previously turned off, as the ephemeris and almanac data is still stored inside the flash memory or a battery backed up Random Access Memory (RAM) of GPS module.Warm Start 506 is performed if the above module is started after the two-hour time frame but with almanac and ephemeris data at least partially available. Inwarm start 506, part of the satellite data of the GPS module has to be refreshed. - For example, a determination of whether the
device 100 is in an outside or an indoor space instart state 502 is made, based upon the signal strength of the GPS signals and the number of visible satellites. As depicted bystate transition 510, if the GPS module is activated fromCold Start 504, the device is determined to be located outside if one GPS satellite can be received with a carrier to noise ratio (C/No) of at least 26 db-Hz with at least three other GPS satellites being received with at least 23 dB-Hz. As further depicted bystate transition 510, if the GPS module is activated fromWarm Start 506, the device is determined to be located outside for the same conditions. As further depicted bystate transition 510, if the GPS module is activated fromHot Start 508, the device can be determined to be located outside if three or more GPS satellites can be received with C/No of at least 23 db-Hz. In theoutdoor operating state 512, the GPS is ON since GPS signals are generally available and often used for location services when outdoors due to their accuracy and independence from terrestrial navigation aids. It should be appreciated with benefit of the present disclosure that alternatively radio triangulation for location services can be performed when in theoutdoor operating state 512. Alternatively, location services may not be required in theoutdoor operating state 512. In an illustrative scenario, theportable communication device 100 is camped on or connected to a cellular RAN for data service. Otherwise if the criteria were not satisfied for determining anoutdoor operating state 512, an inside state determination is found as depicted at 514. Being in theindoor operating state 516 in an illustrative scenario can entail turning off GPS for duration of a timer and connecting to a small coverage area device (e.g., WiFi). - Alternatively or in addition to determining signal strength for GPS signals, indoor/outdoor determination can commence with measuring signal strength for a small coverage area device 110 (
FIG. 1 ) and comparing the measured signal strength to a signal strength threshold. A state transition, as depicted at 514, to theindoor operating state 516 can occur when RSSI Max (maximum Received Signal Strength Indication) is at least −60 dBm. Theportable communication device 100 can be deemed to be indoors based upon an assumption regarding signal strength inside of a structure versus outside of the structure. It should be appreciated that this threshold is illustrative. In one or more embodiments, a determination can be made as to whether the number of detected SSIDs (Service Set Identification) is greater than five (5) and the SSID is repeated for multiple MAC (Medium Access Control) addresses. For example, a determination can be made whether an SSID is repeated for multiple MAC addresses on multiple frequencies because the default on many residential routers is on channel 6 with a default SSID. If the criteria for number of detected SSIDs is more than five (5) and the SSID is repeated for multiple MAC addresses, thenportable communication device 100 can be deemed to be within an indoor enterprise such as a work facility. - The present disclosure addresses predicting a transition between an indoor space and an outdoor space. However, in certain instances a usage pattern is not well established for a particular user, a particular
portable communication device 100, or a particular location. As such, learning opportunities occur when theportable communication device 100 fails to predict a transition with sufficient time to perform an early handover to ensure a soft handover for an on-going data session or incurs additional power consumption for remaining in a certain operating state inappropriate for the actual context. With an initial or preliminary determination of being in either anindoor operating state 516 or anoutdoor operating state 512, theportable communication device 100 can utilize contextual information to resolve any ambiguity. For example, as depicted at 518, theportable communication device 100 encounters a hard handover fromoutdoor operating state 512 toindoor operating state 516 by going from cellular RAN to a small coverage area device. Any connected data session can be interrupted without the benefit of a contextual prediction of the transition to effect a soft handover. Instead, the hard handover can also entail loss of outside location service (GPS). In response, theportable communication device 100 can capture sensor data and contextual information associated with the hard handover for future opportunities at the current location. Theportable communication device 100 can also seed a dead reckoning engine with the last location determined from the outside location service. Similarly, as depicted at 520 theportable communication device 100 can encounter a hard handover fromindoor operating state 516 to theoutdoor operating state 512 going from a small coverage area device to a cellular RAN. - By contrast, if the device is in
outdoor operating state 512 then a repeated process can be performed, as depicted at 522, wherein an inference of a transition from outdoor to indoor is performed. If signal strength of the small coverage area device indicates an ambiguity of whether the device is transitioning indoor, then sensor data and contextual information is used to resolve the ambiguity. As shown bytransition 524, if the transition is determined, thenindoor operating state 516 is performed.Indoor operating state 516 can entail a soft handover of a data session before service is lost, as well as selecting or configuring applications and sensors forindoor operating state 516. If the device is inindoor operating state 516, then a repeated process can be performed wherein an inference of a transition from indoor to outdoor is performed as depicted at 526. For example, if signal strength of the small coverage area device indicates an ambiguity of whether transitioning outdoor, then sensor data and contextual information is used to resolve the ambiguity. If the device is transitioning states, as depicted at 528, thenoutdoor operating state 512 is activated. This transition fromindoor operating state 516 tooutdoor operating state 512 can entail an early handover of a data session before service is lost, as well selecting or configuring applications and sensors foroutdoor operating state 512. -
FIG. 6 illustrates amethod 600 for determining indoor or outdoor location of a portable communication device 100 (FIG. 1 ). Thecommunication mechanism 104 measures signal strength 126 of at least one of alocation service signal 128, aRAN signal 130, and a smallcoverage area signal 132 that is detectable within a current 134 location of the portable communication device 100 (block 602). In an exemplary aspect for a location service, measuring signal strength includes determining a number of sources that are receivable or visible based on a respective magnitude of each detectable location service signal (block 603). The indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 compares the signal strength 126 to a corresponding pre-established signal strength threshold 136 (block 604). The indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 obtainscontextual information 116 by accessingsensor data 114 from at least onesensor 112 selected based on a result of the comparing (block 606). A determination is made as to whether thecontextual information 116 confirms a transition that is suggested by the comparison of the signal strength 126 to the pre-established signal strength threshold 136 (block 608). If a transition that is suggested by the comparison of the signal strength 126 to the pre-establishedsignal strength threshold 136 is not confirmed utilizing thecontextual information 116 inblock 608, themethod 600 exits. If a transition that is suggested by the comparison of the signal strength 126 to the pre-establishedsignal strength threshold 136 is confirmed utilizing thecontextual information 116 inblock 608, then the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 determines that theportable communication device 100 is transitioning from one of (i) anoutdoor space 120 to anindoor space 118 and (ii) anindoor space 118 to an outdoor space 120 (block 610). In response to determining that theportable communication device 100 is transitioning from one of (a) theindoor space 118 to theoutdoor space 120 and (b) theoutdoor space 120 to theindoor space 118, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 configures theportable communication device 100 for operation within an end location (outdoor space 120,indoor space 118, respectively) to which theportable communication device 100 is transitioning (block 612). - For example, the indoor/
outdoor detection utility 124 configures theportable communication device 100 by adjusting at least one of (i) one or more operating parameters and (ii) the one or more device settings. In a particular aspect, themethod 600 includes performing at least one of: (a) performing a handoff between the small coverage area device and the radio access network; and (b) setting at least one signal transceiver of the portable communication device to a power saving mode. - As another example, the indoor/
outdoor detection utility 124 configures theportable communication device 100 to access thesensor data 114 that includes motion data from an on-device sensor. The indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 determines that theportable communication device 100 is transitioning based upon identifying using pre-established transition data analysis that a trajectory of the motion data indicates one of transitioning from indoor-to-outdoor and outdoor-to-indoor. In a particular embodiment, themethod 600 includes receiving location information of theportable communication device 100 from the location service supported by the portable communication device and which provides additional location information while the portable communication device is not located in an interior space. The additional location information can be substantially more accurate. The indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 seeds adead reckoning engine 233 with the location information received. Alternatively or in addition, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 performs location service by an on-device location component by detecting one or more small coverage area devices. - According to one or more embodiments, the
method 600 can further include accessing the sensor data by sensing an ambient condition comprising a change in an amount of illumination that is greater than pre-set illumination amount and that correlates to one of a daylight timeframe and a natural sunlight. - According to at least one embodiment, the
method 600 can further include obtaining the contextual information by communicating with an accessory device connected to the portable communication device by a personal access network; and receiving the contextual information from a sensor of the accessory device via the personal access network. In at least one embodiment, theportable communication device 100 that can assist in resolving an ambiguity of being indoor or outdoor. Themethod 600 can include triggering a first sensor associated with the portable communication device to activate and provide first contextual information; receiving the first contextual information from the first sensor; and determining whether the first contextual information from the first sensor satisfies at least one inference rule indicating that the portable communication device is transitioning between indoor space and outdoor space. In response to the first contextual information not satisfying the at least one inference rule, themethod 600 can further include triggering a second sensor to activate and provide second contextual information; receiving the second contextual information from the second sensor; and evaluating whether the second contextual information from the second sensor satisfies the at least one inference rule. Themethod 600 can then include sequentially activating subsequent sensors as necessary until a combination of contextual information supports a determination of one of: (a) a first state of remaining in an outdoor space; (b) a second state of remaining in an indoor space; (c) a third state of moving from an outdoor space to an indoor space; (d) a fourth state of moving from an indoor space to an outdoor space; and (e) an inconclusive result wherein available sensors comprising the first and second sensors have all been triggered without confirming a state. - In
FIG. 7 , anexample method 700 illustrates the portable communication device 100 (FIG. 1 ) using indoor and outdoor determinations according to at least one embodiment. Inblock 702, theportable communication device 100 receives GPS signal. Inblock 704, in response to receiving a GPS signal from an on-device GPS receiver, theportable communication device 100 records the initial location data obtained by performing a decoding and analysis of the received GPS signal. Indecision block 706, theportable communication device 100 determines whether a device location as likely being outdoors based upon one or more factors including contextual sensors, signal strength readings, and historical contextual information. Inblock 708, theportable communication device 100 routes data session connections via a cellular radio access network. -
Method 700 also includes determining atblock 710 whether a small coverage area signal such as an IEEE 802.11 signal from a wireless access point is being received, and if so, determining atblock 712 whether a clear GPS signal is being received. Determining that a clear GPS signal is being received can include receiving a sufficient number of signals from GNSS satellite vehicles that are above a threshold C/No level. In response to determining that a small coverage area signal such as an IEEE 802.11 signal from a wireless access point is received inblock 710 and further in response to determining that a clear GPS signal is not being received inblock 712, then theportable communication device 100 can evaluate whether a transition from outdoor to indoor is imminent. In particular, inblock 714 theportable communication device 100 measures received signal strength of the wireless signal. Inblock 716, theportable communication device 100 compares the received signal strength for the wireless access point to a pre-established signal strength threshold above which the portable communication device is assumed to be indoors. Inblock 718, theportable communication device 100 determines whether the received signal strength is greater than the pre-established signal strength threshold. Inblock 720, theportable communication device 100, in response to received signal strength being above the pre-established signal strength threshold inblock 718, routes data session connections and performing location determination via the wireless access point. Inblock 722, theportable communication device 100 powers down the on-device GPS receiver, which can entail reducing a rate or intervals of activation or being off for a substantial period. If inblock 718 the signal strength threshold was not exceeded, then themethod 700 exits at exit block. - Returning to block 710, if no wireless signal is received, the
method 700 returns to block 702. However, in response to the determinations that a wireless signal is received and that sufficient GPS signals above a preset threshold C/No are also being received in block 712 (i.e., a clear GPS signal), then inblock 724, theportable communication device 100 triggers an accumulation of secondary sensor data from at least one additional sensor that is communicatively coupled to a location processing component of the portable communication device. Inblock 726, theportable communication device 100 compares contextual data received from at least one additional sensor to at least one inference rule corresponding to location determination metrics, wherein the at least one inference rule resolves an ambiguity of whether theportable communication device 100 is indoor or outdoors. Inblock 728, theportable communication device 100 confirms that the portable communication device is indoors or outdoors based on the comparing. If not confirmed inblock 728, thenmethod 700 exits. In response to confirming inblock 728, then theportable communication device 100 adjusts at least one of (i) one or more operating parameters and (ii) one or more device settings based on a transition of the portable communication device from one of outdoors-to-indoor and indoors-to-outdoors (block 730). - In
FIG. 8 , anotherexample method 800 illustrates the portable communication device 100 (FIG. 1 ) using indoor and outdoor determinations according to at least one embodiment. Inblock 802, theportable communication device 100 configures dead reckoning and contextual sensors. For example, the last location update received from a location service can be seeded to the dead reckoning engine. Accessory devices can include contextual sensors. Inblock 804, theportable communication device 100 is in an illustrative state in which a data session is connected to a cellular RAN, the GPS receiver is active, and an indoor timer is reset. - In
block 806, theportable communication device 100 waits for the indoor timer to expire. When the indoor timer expires inblock 806 then inblock 808, theportable communication device 100 scans for small coverage area device access (wireless access). A determination is made inblock 810 whether RSSI max is at least a pre-established strength level, L1 (e.g., −60 dBm). If the RSSI max does not meet or exceed the pre-established strength level, L1, inblock 810, then the indoor timer is reset inblock 812 and themethod 800 returns to block 806 to wait for the indoor timer to expire. If the RSSI Max is at least −60 dBm inblock 810, then a further determination is made as to whether the number of SSIDs is greater than a pre-established number of SSIDs, N1, (e.g., five 5), inblock 814. If the number of SSIDs is not greater than the pre-established number of SSID, N1, inblock 814, then the mode is set to indoor inblock 816. If the number of SSIDs is more than the pre-established number of SSIDs inblock 814, then the mode is set to indoor/enterprise inblock 818. Inblock 820, theportable communication device 100 hands over any data session to the wireless access. Inblock 822, theportable communication device 100 places the GPS in a low power state or suspends the receiver function of the GPS and resets an outside acquisition timer. Inblock 824, theportable communication device 100 seeds the dead reckoning engine with the last GPS location. Inblock 826, theportable communication device 100 prevents applications from attempting to turn on GPS receiver. Then, inblock 828, theportable communication device 100 waits until the outside timer expires. - Following the timer expiring, in
block 830, theportable communication device 100 estimates location or motion vector based on the dead reckoning engine (DRE) sensors or by WiFi sensing. Inblock 832, theportable communication device 100 correlates contextual data and/or sensors for determining a measure of certainty or uncertainty about whether now outside and departing. Inblock 834, theportable communication device 100 determines whether the uncertainty or ambiguity has been resolved that is outside and departing. If the uncertainty or ambiguity is not resolved inblock 834, then the outside timer is reset inblock 835 and themethod 800 returns to block 828 to wait for the outside timer to expire. - If, in
block 834, the device is determined to be outside and is leaving from the small coverage area device, then theportable communication device 100 selects the appropriate cold, warm, or hot start C/No thresholds inblock 836. Inblock 838, theportable communication device 100 scans for GPS satellites and cellular RANs. Inblock 840, theportable communication device 100 determines whether the GPS number of satellites received and their corresponding signal strength exceeds the C/No thresholds. If the GPS number of satellites received is less than a threshold number “N” (e.g., 5) and their corresponding signal strength does not exceed the C/No threshold inblock 840, then the outdoor timer is reset inblock 842 and themethod 800 returns to block 828 to wait for the outside timer to expire. If the GPS number of satellites received equal or greater to the threshold number “N” and their corresponding signal strength does exceed the C/No threshold inblock 840, then theportable communication device 100 sets the mode as outdoor inblock 844. Inblock 846, theportable communication device 100 hands over any active data sessions for wireless to cellular RAN. Inblock 848, theportable communication device 100 turns off the WLAN radio and resets the WLAN timer. Inblock 850, theportable communication device 100 updates contextual data withsensor data 114 that was detected up to the time of the transition. - In
FIG. 9 , anadditional example method 900 illustrates the portable communication device 100 (FIG. 1 ) using indoor and outdoor determinations according to at least one embodiment. As provided at block 902, theportable communication device 100 is in an indoor state with WiFi connected and GPS off. Inblock 904, theportable communication device 100 determines whether a small coverage area device (wireless access point) is recognized. If recognized inblock 904, then inblock 906 theportable communication device 100 accesses contextual data from past connections to the recognized wireless access point to assist in determining any transitions from indoor to outdoor or outdoor to indoor. For example, historical contextual information can be accessed such as the date, day of the week, and time of past departures/arrivals, outside ambient conditions, outside electromagnetic (EM) profile (e.g., nearby devices or broadcasts), and past motion/distance profiles. - For example, a departure path from a certain known small coverage area device can include a certain period of walking in a particular direction for a pre-set distance followed by driving in another particular direction at a greater rate than walking. When this pattern was encountered by the portable communication device in the past, the portable communication device departed from the small coverage area device. Thus, an inference can be created that future reoccurrences of this pattern indicate a likelihood of a necessary transition from an indoor operating state to an outdoor operating state. By contrast, the portable communication device can have had past occasions of staying in close proximity to a structure in an outdoor space and then returning to an inside space all the while remaining within the small coverage area device. Contextual data based upon motion data, time of day, etc., can reinforce an inference that a necessary transition from the indoor operating state to the outdoor operating state is not occurring when the pattern reoccurs.
- In
block 908, theportable communication device 100 determines what contextual sensors are available. This determination can be made with or without historical contextual information. Examples of sensors that can provide contextual information include inertial devices such as accelerometers, microphones, ambient light sensor, magnetometer, user interface devices, etc. For example, theportable communication device 100 can communicate with an electronically tethered wireless device that increases functionality. In addition, certain sensors may be available in certain models ofportable communication device 100 but not others. Furthermore, certain sensors may be inoperative at a given time, like a magnetometer affected by an interfering object, an ambient light sensor obscured by a case, etc. In addition, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can initially utilize sensors that are already activated for other purposes, reserving additional sensors for activation until needed to resolve an ambiguous indoor/outdoor situation. - With available sensors configured for the
portable communication device 100 inblock 908, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 monitors received signal strength for the wireless access point (block 910). The indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 compares the received signal strength against two thresholds first to see if the device is still receiving service and second to see if the device is in an ambiguous situation of receiving service but potentially transitioning out of the small coverage area. To that end, in block 912 a determination is made as to whether the received signal strength is below a minimum threshold (TMIN). In response to the received signal strength being below TMIN inblock 912, a hard handover for any data session is required and the portable communication device scans for cellular RAN service (block 914). In the illustrative scenario, theportable communication device 100 is outside, following the device's departure from the small coverage area, and thus theportable communication device 100 also initiates scanning for outside location services such as GPS inblock 914. Since the hard handover occurs prior to detecting an ambiguous indoor/outdoor situation, theportable communication device 100 can store contextual information/sensor data that preceded the hard handover inblock 916 in order to enhance future operation of the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124. Then,method 900 exits. - Returning to block 912, in response to the received signal strength being at or above TMIN, then a further determination is performed in
block 918 as to whether the received signal strength is below a threshold for outside ambiguity (TOA). If the received signal strength is not below the threshold for outside ambiguity inblock 918, then theportable communication device 100 can be deemed to still be in an indoor space with the small coverage area device. Themethod 900 returns to block 910 to continue monitoring the received signal strength for the wireless access point. However, in response to determining that the received signal strength is less than the threshold for outside ambiguity inblock 918, then the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 of theportable communication device 100 senses contextual information regarding the current connection to the wireless access point by accessing an enabled sensor or by accessing contextual information and data (block 920). The indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 makes a determination as to whether the additional contextual information confirms a necessary transition from an indoor operating state to an outdoor operating state (block 922). The contextual data from the enabled sensor can indicate being outside of a structure in an outdoor state. Furthermore, the context data can further indicate that the portable communication device is not only departing from the inside space but is likely to depart from the small coverage area device (the wireless access point). In response to the contextual data providing confirmation of being outside and departing the small coverage area device inblock 922, theportable communication device 100 scans for a cellular RAN for a soft handover, such as by performing an early handover wherein a source device and a target device coordinate to maintain a data session or connection via a backbone connection (block 924). Then, the contextual information or data that preceded the handover can be stored as inblock 916 to enhance future indoor/outdoor detections. However, in response to not confirming being outside and departing inblock 922, then the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 can enable an additional contextual sensor in order to resolve the ambiguity (block 926). Themethod 900 then returns to block 910 to continue monitoring with the benefit of the additional sensor. - In
FIG. 10 , afurther example method 1000 illustrates the portable communication device 100 (FIG. 1 ) using indoor and outdoor determinations according to at least one embodiment. In an illustrative scenario in block 1002, theportable communication device 100 is in an indoor state with WiFi connected and GPS off. Inblock 1004, theportable communication device 100 monitors power levels for WLAN RSSI and SSIDs. Inblock 1006, theportable communication device 100 determines whether a power threshold is met. In response to the power threshold not being met by the monitored WLAN RSSI and SSIDs inblock 1006, then themethod 1000 returns to block 1004 to continue monitoring. In response to the power threshold being met by the monitored WLAN RSSI and SSIDs inblock 1006, then inblock 1008 theportable communication device 100 checks dead reckoning sensors and contextual sensors/data for an inference engine (indoor/outdoor detection utility 124). Based upon this checking of the dead reckoning sensors and contextual sensors/data inblock 1008, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 determines whether a confident prediction can be made that theportable communication device 100 is outside (block 1010). This prediction can involve, but is not necessarily limited to, comparing the amount of detected movement and direction of such movement with a threshold based upon pre-established movement data associated with the device being outdoors. Other predictive mechanisms are supported as well. If not able to predict being outside inblock 1010, then themethod 1000 returns to block 1004 to continue monitoring for WLAN RSSI and SSIDs. However, if able to predict being outside inblock 1010, then inblock 1012 the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 of theportable communication device 100 checks for GPS and cellular RAN access. In response to this checking of the GPS and cellular RAN inblock 1012, the indoor/outdoor detection utility 124 of theportable communication device 100 makes a determination of whether the GPS and/or cellular RAN signals meet a threshold for being outside (block 1014). If neither the GPS signals nor cellular RAN signals meet the threshold for being outside inblock 1014, themethod 1000 returns to block 1004 to continue monitoring WLAN RSSI and SSIDs. However, if either the GPS signals or the cellular RAN signals meet the threshold for being outside inblock 1014, then inblock 1016, theportable communication device 100 performs a handover from the WLAN to a cellular data network. - In each of the flow charts of
