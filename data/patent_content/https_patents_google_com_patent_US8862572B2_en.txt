- implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
- users generating content may easily incorporate search results and/or advertisements into their content creation workflow. Incorporation of search results and/or advertisements in the manner described herein will be referred to as user distributed search (UDS).
- UDS user distributed search
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary operations consistent with UDS.
- a user may begin by opening a content creation application for the type of content that the user desires to create (act 401 ).
- a content creation application for the type of content that the user desires to create (act 401 ).
- the user is composing an email using a web-based email application. That is, assume content creation component 235 provides web-based email services to the user via a browser 215 .
- FIG. 5 is a diagram of an exemplary email interface 500 .
- Email interface 500 may include fields such as “To:” field 502 , “Subject:” field 504 , and message field 506 in which the user may compose an email message in a typical manner.
- interface 500 includes a UDS sidebar 510 .
- UDS sidebar 510 may be presented as a graphical window, toolbar, or other element of interface 500 that the user can selectably display or hide from view.
- UDS sidebar 510 includes a search query field 520 and a number of search result sections 522 - 528 .
- search result sections 522 - 528 include: image result section 522 , local search result section 524 , general web search result section 526 , and advertisement result section 528 .
- a selectable graphical button, such as arrows 530 may allow the user to hide or view each of search result sections 522 - 528 .
- results in local search result section 524 (“local results”) are hidden while search result sections 522 , 526 , and 528 are selected to show search results.
- the user of the email application may be able to customize which of the search results sections are shown in UDS sidebar 510 .
- search queries may be automatically generated and/or executed, such as by generating search queries based on content entered by the user, or semi-automatically generated and/or executed, such as by allowing searches to be performed when a user “hovers” over a word or selection with a graphical pointing device (act 403 ).
- content creation component 235 may transmit the search query to each of the appropriate network service components 235 .
- content creation component 235 may transmit the search query to three network service components 235 , respectively implementing an image search engine, a local web search engine, and a general web search engine.
- Content creation component 235 may also transmit the search query to another network search component 235 that implements an advertisement server.
- the search results returned from each of these four “search objects” may then be shown to the user (act 404 ).
- the user may select one of the search results to view the underlying document in a separate browser window.
- the returned search results include a number of images 540 related to this search, a number of relevant web sites 542 related to the search, and an advertisement 544 related to the search.
- Each of the returned search results may include a link or other graphical selection object that allows the user to select the search result for inclusion in to the message being composed.
- a “save” link 550 is shown below each of the search results.
- the user may decide to include one or more of the search results in the email (act 405 ).
- the user may do so by simply selecting the appropriate save link 550 , which causes content creation component 235 to copy the corresponding search result into the email.
- content creation component 235 may write the selected results to the email, such as to the message field 506 of the email (act 406 ).
- the user has selected two images 560 , two general web results 561 , an advertisement 562 , and a local search result 563 , for inclusion in the email being composed.
- the results may be automatically placed below message field 506 in the email.
- content creation component 235 may allow the user to control the placement of the results in the email, such as by graphically dragging different results to different positions in the email.
- Content creation component 235 may allow the user to implement other editorial controls, such as providing the user with the ability to annotate search results or to add an indication of the search query that was used to generate the search result.
- the user may continue to edit the content, enter or refine search queries, and select results for the content until the user is ready to send or post the content (acts 407 and 408 ).
- the user may enter a “send email” command when the user is ready to send the email.
- the email when received by the recipient, may appear as email 130 ( FIG. 1C ).
- the recipient of the email may be able to conveniently view the web pages corresponding to the links by selecting the links.
- the links underlying the image search results in particular, may take the user to the web page at which the image is hosted.
- the selected results 560 - 563 in contrast to links that are typically pasted into emails between users, such as link 125 ( FIG. 1B ), are formatted in a visually appealing manner and thus provide a higher quality content than typical links that a user would normally paste into content (e.g., such as link 125 of FIG. 1B ).
- the links relating to the search results may, as shown in FIGS. 1C and 5 , include the actual link to the search result, a short snippet of text that may be selected based on terms in the search query, and the domain corresponding to the returned result.
- the user may select chosen results via a simple process, such as by a single mouse click on a link 550 or by a “drag and drop” selection operation associated with link 550 , thus providing even relatively unsophisticated computer users with the ability to enhance their content with search results.
- FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary email message that was annotated using UDS to include a search result to a local search engine.
- email message 600 is an email message relating to a book club meeting.
- the sender of the email message is informing the other members of the book club that the meeting location has changed to a local restaurant (“Café Del Sol.”)
- the sender has added two search results from a local search engine.
- the first, result 602 refers to a web page that discusses the restaurant.
- the second, result 604 links to a local search engine result web page 610 that includes a map 615 showing the location of the restaurant.
- a user can quickly add links to valuable information to an email, such as a link to a map of a location referred to in the email.
- the search result may be a map image that is sent inline with the email message, another type of image, an address, a phone number, or a price of a product that is sent inline with the email message.
- content creators that place advertisement links in their content may be given some form of credit if the reader of the advertisement selects the advertisement link.
- the credit can be monetary or take some other form. Because of the high likelihood that an advertisement incorporated by a content creator into their content is relevant and/or likely to be viewed by the reader, a number of different business models are possible. For example, advertisers may be charged a premium or charged based on a different rate scale for advertisements distributed via UDS.
- UDS was primarily in the context of sending email content. As previously mentioned, UDS can be applied equally well to other forms of content creation. FIGS. 7-9 illustrate other additional applications of UDS.
- FIG. 7 is an exemplary interface illustrating application of UDS to a message board environment.
- a web message board can generally be defined as a facility on the web for holding discussions. Message boards are typically organized into topics in which users post messages relating to the appropriate topic.
- an exemplary message board interface 700 is presented to a user, such as an interface presented through a browser 215 .
- a first user has posted a message 710 asking for advice relating to a crank for a bicycle.
- a second user responds with a message 715 .
- the poster supplements message 715 with a number of search results 720 .
- the search results 720 include images 725 of the cranks under discussion, an advertisement 730 for a bicycle store mentioned in message 715 , a link 735 to a web site of the company that produces the cranks, and a link 740 pointing to a local distributor of the cranks.
- the user responding to message 710 was able to effectively supplement the text of message 715 with links that he specifically selected as being relevant to the topic under discussion.
- FIG. 8 is an exemplary interface illustrating application of UDS to an instant messaging conversation.
- Instant messaging can generally be defined as the act of instantly communicating between two or more people over a network such as the Internet.
- an exemplary instant messaging interface 800 is presented to a user, such as an interface presented by a local content creation component 218 (e.g., an IM client) executing at a client 210 .
- Instant messaging interface 800 includes a message display portion 810 through which transmitted instant messages are displayed, a messaging area 820 in which users may enter messages that they are going to transmit, and UDS interface 830 .
- the two participants in the conversation (Mark and Cindy) are discussing possible vineyards to visit.
- UDS interface 830 can enhance the quality of the instant messaging conversation by, for example, allowing users to both search from within IM interface 800 and easily share selected links from the search with other users.
- FIG. 9 is an exemplary interface illustrating application of UDS to a blog authoring tool.
- a blog shortened form of weblog or web log
- a blog is a website in which items are posted on a regular basis and generally displayed in reverse chronological order.
- an exemplary interface 900 of a blog authoring tool presented to a user such as a web based blog authoring tool implemented by content creation component 235 or a locally executed blog authoring tool implemented by local content creation component 218 .
- Interface 900 may include a blog authoring section 910 in which a blogger may enter and edit blog posts.
- UDS interface 920 allows the blogger to enter search queries and receive search results in a manner similar to UDS sidebar 510 ( FIG. 5 ). Search results selected by the blogger may be displayed in result section 930 of interface 900 .
- “publish post” button 940 may cause the text entered by the blogger in section 910 and the search results selected by the blogger in result section 930 to both be published as a single blog post to the blogger's blog.
- FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating exemplary components in a UDS system.
- a client 210 communicates with UDS engine 1037 at application server 230 , which may in turn communicate with search services 1040 -A through 1040 -N at one or more servers 220 .
- portions of the content application such as an email application, may be a web-based application that is transmitted to browser 215 on an on-demand basis.
- the email application may include, for example, a JavaScript object 1016 that interfaces with a user interface portion 1017 to provide the final user interface that is displayed in browser 215 based on, for example, HTML (hyper-text markup language) and CSS (cascading style sheets) data supplied from JavaScript application 1016 .
- a JavaScript object 1016 that interfaces with a user interface portion 1017 to provide the final user interface that is displayed in browser 215 based on, for example, HTML (hyper-text markup language) and CSS (cascading style sheets) data supplied from JavaScript application 1016 .
- User interface portion 1017 and JavaScript object 1016 together act to reduce the start-stop start-stop nature of traditional browser-based web applications, as JavaScript object 1016 adds a client-side layer that can handle many of the user interactions with user interface portion 1017 .
- browser 215 may load JavaScript application 1016 from server 230 (or, alternatively, from a local cache).
- JavaScript object 1016 may be responsible for both rendering the interface the user sees and communicating with content creation component of server 230 on the user's behalf.
- JavaScript object 1016 may be a dynamically configured object that allows for dynamic selection of which network services, such as which search services 1040 , to use.
- JavaScript object 1016 may implement a number of different functions at client 210 .
- JavaScript object 1016 may allow the interface to be positioned where desired in the client display.
- JavaScript object 1016 may implement a search control object that limits search results to a small number of highly relevant results per search. The search control object may annotate each search result with an element that, when clicked, allows the user to save the search result to the content creation interface.
- JavaScript object 1016 may be an object that is designed to be easily integrated into existing web-based JavaScript applications, thus providing a convenient application programming interface (API) through which programmers can incorporate UDS into their programs.
- API application programming interface
- UDS engine 1037 may provide an interface with JavaScript object 1016 .
- UDS interface may annotate search requests, perform searches through appropriate search services 1040 -A through 1040 -N, and serialize results of the searches.
- Search services 1040 -A through 1040 -N may return search results, such as general web-based search results, image results, etc., or return relevant advertisements, in response to requests from UDS engine 1037 .
- the user selection of search results when creating content may provide an indication that the selected search results are relevant to the search query.
- the search results selected by a user may be used as part of a reputation network.
- a reputation network in some way quantifies the reputation or score of users as to their expertise in certain categories or topics.
- This may be an indication that the user is an “expert” in the topic relating to the content, and his reputation score for the topic may be increased.
- This application may be particularly relevant to content applications such as message boards, where the message boards are typically categorized by topic.
