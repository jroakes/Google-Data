While the menu 504 is shown to be not visible in the view region 502 , in some embodiments the menu 504 may be partially visible in the view region 502 . In general, however, when the wearable computing device is in the first position, the menu 504 may not be fully visible in the view region.
- the wearable computing device may be configured to receive movement data corresponding to, for example, an upward movement of the wearable computing device to a second position above the first position.
- the wearable computing device may, in response to receiving the movement data corresponding to the upward movement, cause one or both of the view region 502 and the menu 504 to move such that the menu 504 becomes more visible in the view region 502 .
- the wearable computing device may cause the view region 502 to move upward and/or may cause the menu 504 to move downward.
- the view region 502 and the menu 504 may move the same amount, or may move different amounts.
- the menu 504 may move further than the view region 502 .
- the wearable computing device may cause only the menu 504 to move. Other examples are possible as well.
- the view region 502 when the view region 502 moves, the view region 502 may appear to a user of the wearable computing device as if mapped onto the inside of a static sphere centered at the wearable computing device, and a scrolling or panning movement of the view region 502 may map onto movement of the real-world environment relative to the wearable computing device.
- the view region 502 may move in other manners as well.
- the upward movement may encompass any movement having any combination of moving, tilting, rotating, shifting, sliding, or other movement that results in a generally upward movement. Further, in some embodiments “upward” may refer to an upward movement in the reference frame of a user of the wearable computing device. Other reference frames are possible as well. In embodiments where the wearable computing device is a head-mounted device, the upward movement of the wearable computing device may also be an upward movement of a user's head such as, for example, the user looking upward.
- the movement data corresponding to the upward movement may take several forms.

For example, as the view region 502 moves upward, the menu 504 may scroll or pan into view. In some embodiments, when the view region 502 moves back downward, the menu 504 may be “pulled” downward as well, and may remain in the view region 502 . As another example, as the view region 502 moves upward, the menu 504 may appear to a user of the wearable computing device to slide or drop downward into the view region 502 . Other examples are possible as well.
- a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the scrolling, panning, sliding, and/or dropping may be based at least in part on a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the upward movement.
- the view region 502 and/or the menu 504 may be moved only when the upward movement exceeds a threshold speed, acceleration, and/or magnitude. In response to receiving data corresponding to an upward movement that exceeds such a threshold or thresholds, the view region 502 and/or the menu 504 may pan, scroll, slide, drop, and/or jump to a new field of view, as described above.
- the view region 502 and/or the menu 504 may be moved in other manners as well.
- the wearable computing device could be configured to receive data corresponding to other directional movement (e.g., downward, leftward, rightward, etc.) as well, and that the view region 502 may be moved in response to receiving such data in a manner similar to that described above in connection with upward movement.
- other directional movement e.g., downward, leftward, rightward, etc.
- a user of the wearable computing device need not keep the wearable computing device at the second position to keep the menu 504 at least partially visible in the view region 502 . Rather, the user may return the wearable computing device to a more comfortable position (e.g., at or near the first position), and the wearable computing device may move the menu 504 and the view region 502 substantially together, thereby keeping the menu 504 at least partially visible in the view region 502 . In this manner, the user may continue to interact with the menu 504 even after moving the wearable computing device to what may be a more comfortable position.

view region 502 may be, for example, the viewable area between (or encompassing) the upper, lower, left, and right boundaries of a display on the wearable computing device. Theview region 502 may thus be said to substantially fill a field of view of the wearable computing device. - As shown, when the wearable computing device is in the first position, the
view region 502 is substantially empty (e.g., completely empty) of user-interface elements, such that the user's view of the user's real-world environment is generally uncluttered, and objects in the user's environment are not obscured. - In some embodiments, the
view region 502 may correspond to a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and an area outside theview region 502 may correspond to an area outside the field of view of the user. In other embodiments, theview region 502 may correspond to a non-peripheral portion of a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and an area outside theview region 502 may correspond to a peripheral portion of the field of view of the user. In still other embodiments, the user-interface 500 may be larger than or substantially the same as a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device, and the field of view of the user may be larger than or substantially the same size as theview region 502. Theview region 502 may take other forms as well. - Accordingly, the portions of the user-
interface 500 outside of theview region 502 may be outside of or in a peripheral portion of a field of view of a user of the wearable computing device. For example, as shown, amenu 504 may be outside of or in a peripheral portion of the field of view of the user in the user-interface 500. In particular, themenu 504 is shown to be located above the view region. While themenu 504 is shown to be not visible in theview region 502, in some embodiments themenu 504 may be partially visible in theview region 502. In general, however, when the wearable computing device is in the first position, themenu 504 may not be fully visible in the view region. - In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be configured to receive movement data corresponding to, for example, an upward movement of the wearable computing device to a second position above the first position. In these embodiments, the wearable computing device may, in response to receiving the movement data corresponding to the upward movement, cause one or both of the
view region 502 and themenu 504 to move such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. For example, the wearable computing device may cause theview region 502 to move upward and/or may cause themenu 504 to move downward. Theview region 502 and themenu 504 may move the same amount, or may move different amounts. In one embodiment, themenu 504 may move further than theview region 502. As another example, the wearable computing device may cause only themenu 504 to move. Other examples are possible as well. - In some embodiments, when the
view region 502 moves, theview region 502 may appear to a user of the wearable computing device as if mapped onto the inside of a static sphere centered at the wearable computing device, and a scrolling or panning movement of theview region 502 may map onto movement of the real-world environment relative to the wearable computing device. Theview region 502 may move in other manners as well. - While the term “upward” is used, it is to be understood that the upward movement may encompass any movement having any combination of moving, tilting, rotating, shifting, sliding, or other movement that results in a generally upward movement. Further, in some embodiments “upward” may refer to an upward movement in the reference frame of a user of the wearable computing device. Other reference frames are possible as well. In embodiments where the wearable computing device is a head-mounted device, the upward movement of the wearable computing device may also be an upward movement of a user's head such as, for example, the user looking upward.
- The movement data corresponding to the upward movement may take several forms. For example, the movement data may be (or may be derived from) data received from one or more movement sensors, accelerometers, magnetometers, and/or gyroscopes configured to detect the upward movement, such as the
sensor 122 described above in connection withFIG. 1A . In some embodiments, the movement data may comprise a binary indication corresponding to the upward movement. In other embodiments, the movement data may comprise an indication corresponding to the upward movement as well as an extent of the upward movement, such as a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the upward movement. The movement data may take other forms as well. -
FIG. 5B shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving movement data corresponding to an upward movement, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown, the user-interface 500 includes theview region 502 and themenu 504. - As noted above, in response to receiving the movement data corresponding to an upward movement of the wearable computing device, the wearable computing device may move one or both of the
view region 502 and themenu 504 such that themenu 504 becomes more visible in theview region 502. The view region and/or themenu 504 may be moved in several manners. - In some embodiments, the
view region 502 and/or themenu 504 may be moved in a scrolling, panning, sliding, dropping, and/or jumping motion. For example, as theview region 502 moves upward, themenu 504 may scroll or pan into view. In some embodiments, when theview region 502 moves back downward, themenu 504 may be “pulled” downward as well, and may remain in theview region 502. As another example, as theview region 502 moves upward, themenu 504 may appear to a user of the wearable computing device to slide or drop downward into theview region 502. Other examples are possible as well. - In some embodiments, a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the scrolling, panning, sliding, and/or dropping may be based at least in part on a magnitude, speed, acceleration, and/or direction of the upward movement. Further, in some embodiments, the
view region 502 and/or themenu 504 may be moved only when the upward movement exceeds a threshold speed, acceleration, and/or magnitude. In response to receiving data corresponding to an upward movement that exceeds such a threshold or thresholds, theview region 502 and/or themenu 504 may pan, scroll, slide, drop, and/or jump to a new field of view, as described above. - The
view region 502 and/or themenu 504 may be moved in other manners as well. - While the foregoing description focused on upward movement, it is to be understood that the wearable computing device could be configured to receive data corresponding to other directional movement (e.g., downward, leftward, rightward, etc.) as well, and that the
view region 502 may be moved in response to receiving such data in a manner similar to that described above in connection with upward movement. - In some embodiments, a user of the wearable computing device need not keep the wearable computing device at the second position to keep the
menu 504 at least partially visible in theview region 502. Rather, the user may return the wearable computing device to a more comfortable position (e.g., at or near the first position), and the wearable computing device may move themenu 504 and theview region 502 substantially together, thereby keeping themenu 504 at least partially visible in theview region 502. In this manner, the user may continue to interact with themenu 504 even after moving the wearable computing device to what may be a more comfortable position. - As shown, the
menu 504 includes a number of menu objects 506. In some embodiments, the menu objects 506 may be arranged in a ring (or partial ring) around and above the head of a user of the wearable computing device. In other embodiments, the menu objects 506 may be arranged in a dome-shape above the user's head. The ring or dome may be centered above the wearable computing device and/or the user's head. In other embodiments, the menu objects 506 may be arranged in other ways as well. - The number of menu objects 506 in the
menu 504 may be fixed or may be variable. In embodiments where the number is variable, the menu objects 506 may vary in size according to the number of menu objects 506 in themenu 504. - Depending on the application of the wearable computing device, the menu objects 506 may take several forms. For example, the menu objects 506 may include one or more of people, contacts, groups of people and/or contacts, calendar items, lists, notifications, alarms, reminders, status updates, incoming messages, recorded media, audio recordings, video recordings, photographs, digital collages, previously-saved states, webpages, and applications, as well as tools for controlling or accessing one or more devices, such as a still camera, a video camera, and/or an audio recorder. Menu objects 506 may take other forms as well.
- In embodiments where the menu objects 506 include tools, the tools may be located in a particular region of the
menu 504, such as the center. In some embodiments, the tools may remain in the center of themenu 504, even if the other menu objects 506 rotate, as described above. Tool menu objects may be located in other regions of themenu 504 as well. - The particular menu objects 506 that are included in
menu 504 may be fixed or variable. For example, the menu objects 506 may be preselected by a user of the wearable computing device. In another embodiment, the menu objects 506 may be automatically assembled by the wearable computing device from one or more physical or digital contexts including, for example, people, places, and/or objects surrounding the wearable computing device, address books, calendars, social-networking web services or applications, photo sharing web services or applications, search histories, and/or other contexts. Further, some menu objects 506 may fixed, while other menu objects 506 may be variable. The menu objects 506 may be selected in other manners as well. - Similarly, an order or configuration in which the menu objects 506 are displayed may be fixed or variable. In one embodiment, the menu objects 506 may be pre-ordered by a user of the wearable computing device. In another embodiment, the menu objects 506 may be automatically ordered based on, for example, how often each
menu object 506 is used (on the wearable computing device only or in other contexts as well), how recently eachmenu object 506 was used (on the wearable computing device only or in other contexts as well), an explicit or implicit importance or priority ranking of the menu objects 506, and/or other criteria. - As shown in
FIG. 5B , only a portion of themenu 504 is visible in theview region 502. In particular, while themenu 504 is vertically inside theview region 502, themenu 504 extends horizontally beyond theview region 502 such that a portion of themenu 504 is outside theview region 502. As a result, one or more menu objects 506 may be only partially visible in theview region 502, or may not be visible in theview region 502 at all. In particular, in embodiments where the menu objects 506 extend circularly around a user's head, like a ring (or partial ring), a number of the menu objects 506 may be outside theview region 502. - In order to view menu objects 506 located outside the
view region 506, a user of the wearable computing device may interact with the wearable computing device to, for example, pan or rotate the menu objects 506 along a path (e.g., left or right, clockwise or counterclockwise) around the user's head. To this end, the wearable computing device may, in some embodiments, be configured to receive panning data indicating a direction. - The panning data may take several forms. For example, the panning data may be (or may be derived from) data received from one or more movement sensors, accelerometers, magnetometers, gyroscopes, and/or detectors configured to detect one or more predetermined movements. The one or more movement sensors may be included in the wearable computing device, like the
sensor 122, or may be included in a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device. As another example, the panning data may be (or may be derived from) data received from a touch pad, such as the finger-operable touch pad 124 described above in connection withFIG. 1A , or other input device included in or coupled to the wearable computing device and configured to detect one or more predetermined movements. In some embodiments, the panning data may take the form of a binary indication corresponding to the predetermined movement. In other embodiments, the panning data may comprise an indication corresponding to the predetermined movement as well as an extent of the predetermined movement, such as a magnitude, speed, and/or acceleration of the predetermined movement. The panning data may take other forms as well. - The predetermined movements may take several forms. In some embodiments, the predetermined movements may be certain movements or sequence of movements of the wearable computing device or peripheral device. In some embodiments, the predetermined movements may include one or more predetermined movements defined as no or substantially no movement, such as no or substantially no movement for a predetermined period of time. In embodiments where the wearable computing device is a head-mounted device, one or more predetermined movements may involve a predetermined movement of the user's head that moves the wearable computing device in a corresponding manner. Alternatively or additionally, the predetermined movements may involve a predetermined movement of a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device. The peripheral device may similarly be wearable by a user of the wearable computing device, such that the movement of the peripheral device may follow a movement of the user, such as, for example, a movement of the user's hand. Still alternatively or additionally, one or more predetermined movements may be, for example, a movement across a finger-operable touch pad or other input device. Other predetermined movements are possible as well.
- In these embodiments, in response to receiving the panning data, the wearable computing device may move the menu based on the direction, such that the portion of the menu moves insides the view region.
-
FIG. 5C shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving panning data indicating a direction, in accordance with an embodiment. As indicated by the dotted arrow, themenu 504 has been moved. To this end, the panning data may have indicated, for example, that the user turned the user's head to the right, and the wearable computing device may have responsively panned themenu 504 to the left. Alternately, the panning data may have indicated, for example, that the user tilted the user's head to the left, and the wearable computing device may have responsively rotated themenu 504 in a counterclockwise direction. Other examples are possible as well. - While the
menu 504 is shown to extend horizontally beyond theview region 502, in some embodiments themenu 504 may be fully visible in theview region 502. -
FIG. 5D shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving movement data corresponding to an upward movement, in accordance with an embodiment. In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive from the user a selection of amenu object 506 from themenu 504. To this end, the user-interface 500 may include acursor 508, shown inFIG. 5D as a reticle, which may navigated around theview region 502 to select menu objects 506 from themenu 504. Alternatively, thecursor 508 may be “locked” in the center of theview region 502, and themenu 504 may be static. Then, theview region 502, along with the lockedcursor 508, may be navigated over thestatic menu 504 to select menu objects 506 from themenu 504. In some embodiments, thecursor 508 may be controlled by a user of the wearable computing device through one or more predetermined movements. Accordingly, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive selection data corresponding to the one or more predetermined movements. - As shown, a user of the wearable computing device has navigated the
cursor 508 to themenu object 506 using one or more predetermined movements. In order to select themenu object 506, the user may perform an additional predetermined movement. For example, the selection data may be (or may be derived from) data received from one or more movement sensors, accelerometers, magnetometers, gyroscopes, and/or detectors configured to detect one or more predetermined movements. The one or more movement sensors may be included in the wearable computing device, like thesensor 122, or may be included in a peripheral device communicatively coupled to the wearable computing device. - In some example embodiments, the additional predetermined movement made by a user to select the
menu object 506 may be a movement of a part of the user's body. A sensor as described above may be present to detect the movement of the designated body part and may then send an indication of the movement to a processor on the wearable computing device. - In one example embodiment, the additional pre-determined movement may be the movement of a user's jaw in a vertical direction such that the lower row of teeth hit the upper row of teeth, making a “clack.” The sensor may detect the movement comprising the clack to signal the selection of the
menu object 506. The detection may be made upon the movement of one or more of the teeth of the lower row of teeth hitting one or more of the upper row of teeth. - In another embodiment, a sniffing motion, a sniffing noise, or a sniffing motion in combination with a sniffing noise made by a user's nose may trigger the selection of the
menu object 506. The sniffing motion and the sniffing noise may include the nose rapidly inhaling air through the nostrils. Thus, a sensor as described above may detect a sniff or other inhalation to signal the selection of themenu object 506. - In yet another embodiment, a pre-determined number of blinks of a user's eyelid may trigger the selection of the
menu object 506. A sensor as described above may detect the pre-determined number of blinks of one or both of a user's eyes to signal the selection of themenu object 506. - In yet another example embodiment, the wearable computing device may include a sensor on a frame. The frame may be one of the frames comprising frame elements as described above with reference to
FIGS. 1A-3 . A user may tap or slide a finger against the frame to make a selection of amenu object 506. The sensor may then detect the pressure applied to the frame to select themenu object 506. -
FIGS. 5E and 5F show aspects of an example user-interface displaying an indicator to determine whether a menu object is to be selected, in accordance with an embodiment. In this example embodiment, the additional predetermined movement to select themenu object 506 may include holding thecursor 508 over themenu object 506 for a predetermined period of time. For example, thecursor 508 may move in response to the user's gaze, which may be detected by a sensor such as an eye-tracking system. In this approach, the user may hold thecursor 508 over themenu object 506 for a predetermined period of time by staring at themenu object 506 for a predetermined period of time. - A visual indication of the passage of time may be provided by a
dwell time clock 510 that is visually displayed on the view region. As thecursor 508 hovers over themenu object 506, thedwell time clock 510 appears on the view region. As shown inFIG. 5E , the dwell time clock is a circulardwell time clock 510. Initially, the circulardwell time clock 510 only comprises a visible perimeter, andinterior 512 of the circulardwell time clock 510 is “empty,” and is see-through to the background of the screen. As time passes and thecursor 508 continues to hover over thesame menu object 506, theinterior 512 of thedwell time clock 510 begins to “fill,” such that acolor 514 becomes visible on thescreen 502. In the example shown inFIG. 5F , thecolor 514 is indicated by shading. Thecolor 514 extends from the center of the circle to the perimeter and moves radially to fill the circle in a clockwise direction. When the color has moved radially to a certain location on thedwell time clock 510, the circle is deemed to be sufficiently “filled.” At the point where the circle is sufficiently filled, themenu object 506 is deemed to be selected by the user. - The circular
dwell time clock 510 may include a pre-determined time to fill thecolor 514 in theinterior 512. Thus, thedwell time clock 510 visually indicates the time remaining before the selection of amenu object 506. - In another example, the color may stop at another location on the circle, such as at 180 degrees or 90 degrees, to indicate the selection of a
menu object 506. - In another example, instead of a circular dwell time clock, another shape may be used. For example, a square or rectangular bar that fills with a color may be used. In this example, the dwell time bar also visually indicates the time remaining before the selection of a
menu object 506 by filling the dwell time bar with a color. Still other shapes of a visual dwell indicator may be used. - As another example of an incremental indication of time passing prior to a selection, the edges of the
menu object 506 or the screen of the visual display may begin to glow, wherein the glow increases in intensity as time passes. A flash of light may then indicate that a selection has been made. Alternatively, the glow may incrementally trace around the edges of themenu object 506 as time passes, and once the full outline has been traced, themenu object 506 may be deemed to be selected. In yet another example, themenu object 506 may become visually separate from theview region 502. In this example, themenu object 506 may comprise a color that remains while the background fades to black and white, or themenu object 506 may remain opaque while theview region 502 becomes increasingly transparent. In another example, themenu object 506 may increase in size or “swell” as time passes, and then pop to indicate a selection. In yet another example, theview region 502 may be dark except where the user's gaze is focused, which may appear on theview region 502 as a beam of light, such as a flashlight in a dark area. Focusing on amenu object 506 may result in an incremental increase in intensity of the beam of light until themenu object 506 is selected. - Once a
menu object 506 is selected, the wearable computing device may cause themenu object 506 to be displayed in theview region 502 as a selected menu object.FIG. 5G shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving selection data indicating selection of a selectedmenu object 510, in accordance with an embodiment. - As indicated by the dotted arrow, the
menu object 506 is displayed in theview region 502 as a selectedmenu object 510. As shown, the selectedmenu object 510 is displayed larger and in more detail in theview region 502 than in themenu 504. In other embodiments, however, the selectedmenu object 510 could be displayed in theview region 502 smaller than or the same size as, and in less detail than or the same detail as, themenu 504. In some embodiments, additional content (e.g., actions to be applied to, with, or based on the selectedmenu object 510, information related to the selectedmenu object 510, and/or modifiable options, preferences, or parameters for the selectedmenu object 510, etc.) may be showed adjacent to or nearby the selectedmenu object 510 in theview region 502. - Once the selected
menu object 510 is displayed in theview region 502, a user of the wearable computing device may interact with the selectedmenu object 510. For example, as the selectedmenu object 510 is shown as an email inbox, the user may select one of the emails in the email inbox to read. Depending on the selected menu object, the user may interact with the selected menu object in other ways as well (e.g., the user may locate additional information related to the selectedmenu object 510, modify, augment, and/or delete the selectedmenu object 510, etc.). To this end, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive input data corresponding to one or more predetermined movements indicating interactions with the user-interface 500. The input data may take any of the forms described above in connection with the movement data and/or the selection data. -
FIG. 5G shows aspects of an example user-interface 500 after receiving input data corresponding to a user input, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown, a user of the wearable computing device has navigated thecursor 508 to a particular subject line in the email inbox and selected the subject line. As a result, theemail 512 is displayed in the view region, so that the user may read theemail 512. The user may interact with the user-interface 500 in other manners as well, depending on, for example, the selected menu object. - While provided in the
view region 502, the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selected menu object 510 (e.g., the email 512) may be “locked” to the center of theview region 502. That is, if theview region 502 moves for any reason (e.g., in response to movement of the wearable computing device), the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selectedmenu object 510 may remain locked in the center of theview region 502, such that the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selectedmenu object 510 appear to a user of the wearable computing device not to move. This may make it easier for a user of the wearable computing device to interact with the selectedmenu object 510 and any objects associated with the selectedmenu object 510, even while the wearer and/or the wearable computing device are moving. - In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive from the user a request to remove the
menu 504 from theview region 502. To this end, the wearable computing device may be further configured to receive removal data corresponding to the one or more predetermined movements. Once themenu 504 is removed from theview region 502, the user-interface 500 may again appear as shown inFIG. 5A . - The removal data may take any of the forms described above in connection with the movement data and/or panning data. In some embodiments, the wearable computing device may be configured to receive movement data corresponding to, for example, another upward movement. For example, the wearable computing device may move the
menu 504 and/orview region 502 to make themenu 504 more visible in theview region 502 in response to a first upward movement, as described above, and may move themenu 504 and/orview region 502 to make themenu 504 less visible (e.g., not visible) in theview region 502 in response to a second upward movement. As another example, the wearable computing device may make themenu 504 disappear in response to a predetermined movement across a touch pad. Other examples are possible as well. - Several example user-interfaces have been described. It is to be understood that each of the above-described user-interfaces is merely an exemplary state of the disclosed user-interface, and that the user-interface may move between the above-described and other states according to one or more types of user input to the wearable computing device and/or the user-interface. That is, the disclosed user-interface is not a static user-interface, but rather is a dynamic user-interface configured to move between several states. Movement between states of the user-interface is described in connection with
FIGS. 6A and 6B , which show an example implementation of an example user-interface, in accordance with an embodiment. -
FIG. 6A shows an example implementation of an example user-interface on an examplewearable computing device 610 when thewearable computing device 610 is at a first position, in accordance with an embodiment. As shown inFIG. 6A , auser 608 wears awearable computing device 610. In response to receiving data corresponding to a first position of the wearable computing device 610 (e.g., a position of thewearable computing device 610 when theuser 608 is looking in a direction that is generally parallel to the ground, or another comfortable position), thewearable computing device 610 provides afirst state 600 of a user-interface, which includes aview region 602 and amenu 604. - Example boundaries of the
view region 602 are shown by the dottedlines 606A through 606D. Theview region 602 may substantially fill a field of view of thewearable computing device 610 and/or theuser 608. - As shown, in the
first state 600, theview region 602 is substantially empty. Further, in thefirst state 600, themenu 604 is not fully visible in theview region 602 because some or all of themenu 604 is above theview region 602. As a result, themenu 604 is thus not fully visible to theuser 608. For example, themenu 604 may be visible only in a periphery of theuser 608, or may not be visible at all. Other examples are possible as well. - The
menu 604 is shown to be arranged in a partial ring located above theview region 602. In some embodiments, themenu 604 may extend further around theuser 608, forming a full ring. The (partial or full) ring of themenu 604 may be substantially centered over thewearable computing device 610 and/or theuser 608. - At some point, the
user 608 may cause an upward movement of thewearable computing device 610 by, for example, looking upward. As a result of the upward movement, thewearable computing device 610 may move from a first position to a second position above the first position.FIG. 6B shows an example implementation of an example user-interface on an examplewearable computing device 610 when thewearable computing device 610 is at a second position above the first position, in accordance with an embodiment. - In response to detecting the
upward movement 614, thewearable computing device 610 may provide asecond state 612 of the user-interface. As shown, in thesecond state 612, themenu 604 is more visible in theview region 602, as compared with thefirst state 600. As shown, themenu 604 is substantially fully visible in theview region 602. In other embodiments, however, themenu 604 may be only partially visible in theview region 602. - As shown, the
wearable computing device 610 provides thesecond state 612 by moving theview region 602 upward. In other embodiments, however, thewearable computing device 610 may provide thesecond state 612 by moving themenu 604 downward. In still other embodiments, thewearable computing device 610 may provide thesecond state 612 by moving theview region 602 upward and moving themenu 604 downwards. - While the
menu 604 is visible in theview region 602, as shown in thestate 612, theuser 608 may interact with themenu 604, as described above. - It will be understood that movement between states of the user-interface may involve a movement of the
view region 602 over astatic menu 604 or, equivalently, a movement of themenu 604 and within astatic view region 602. Alternately, movement between states of the user-interface may involve movement of both theview region 602 and themenu 604. - In some embodiments, movement between the states of the user-interface may be gradual and/or continuous. Alternately, movement between the states of the user-interface may be substantially instantaneous. In some embodiments, the user-interface may move between states only in response to movements of the wearable computing device that exceed a certain threshold of magnitude. Further, in some embodiments, movement between states may have a speed, acceleration, magnitude, and/or direction that corresponds to the movements of the wearable computing device. Movement between the states may take other forms as well.
