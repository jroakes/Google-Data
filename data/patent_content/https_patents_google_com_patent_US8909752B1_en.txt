Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to associating data with advertisements, and more particularly, to improving relevancy of advertisements.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of content. For instance, images, audio, video, and web pages for many different topics are accessible through the Internet.
- the accessible content provides an opportunity to present advertisements to users. Advertisements may be placed within content, such as a web page, image or video, or the content may trigger the display of one or more advertisements, such as presenting an advertisement in an advertisement slot within the content and/or in an advertisement slot of a pop-up window or other overlay. Advertisements may also be identified and provided through interest data selected by users.
- a user may identify user data for a second user.
- the user data from the first user may be assigned as interest data to a second user.
- the interest data may be associated with advertisements, and display data, representing the advertisements, may be provided to the second user.
- One implementation is a method including a processing circuit configured to store a relationship between a first user and a second user in a memory.
- the method may also include a processing circuit configured to receive an identification of user data from a first user of a website.
- the method may further include a processing circuit configured to assign interest data for the second user based on the identified user data from the first user.
- the method may also include a processing circuit configured to associate the interest data with advertisements provided by an advertiser.
- the method may include a processing circuit configured to provide display data representing the advertisements associated with the interest data to the second user.
- Another implementation is a system including a processing circuit configured to store a user profile for a second user, the user profile comprising user profile data.
- the system may also include a processing circuit configured to store a relationship between a first user and the second user.
- the system may further include a processing circuit configured to receive from the first user user profile data for the second user and storing the received user profile data in the user profile for the second user.
- the system may also include a processing circuit configured to select an advertisement from an advertisement database based on the user profile data received from the first user.
- the system may include a processing circuit configured to provide display data comprising the selected advertisement to the second user.
- Another implementation is a method for advertising over a computer network that may include receiving, by an advertisement server computer, an advertisement request requesting an advertisement for delivery to a second user. The method may also include selecting by the advertisement server computer, an advertisement from an advertisement database to provide to a second user in response to the advertising request based on a second user user profile data, wherein the second user user profile data is based on preferences of the second user and data received from a first user.

- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of a method for providing display data related to a selected advertisement in accordance with a described implementation.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of a method for advertising in accordance with a described implementation.
- Advertisers are concerned with relevancy, performance parameters (e.g., click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, etc.), price parameters, and other factors.
- CTR click-through rate
- a more relevant advertisement may be provided to enhance web experiences by the users.
- the more relevant advertisement leads to better performance for the advertisers using their respective factors.
- the interactivity and engaging nature of allowing users to take part in the advertising selection leads to a better overall internet experience for users and for advertisers.
- first user and second user are used for simplification and clarity and are not intended to be limiting. It is understood that multiple users may be identified as a first user and/or a second user.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , advertisers 108 , and an advertisement management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , and advertisers 108 .
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that may contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- a resource 105 is any data that may be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 , such as a uniform resource locator (URL).
- Resources 105 may include web pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, programming elements, interactive content, and feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources 105 may include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions.
- Embedded instructions may include code that is executed at a user's device, such as in a web browser. Code may be written in languages, such as, JavaScript® or ECMAScript®.
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that may send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 may request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 may be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 may include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which advertisements may be presented. These specified portions of the resource 105 or user display are referred to as advertisement slots.
- the environment 100 may include a search system 112 that identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources 105 may be indexed based on the resource 105 with which the data is associated.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 are stored in a search index (not shown).
- User devices 106 may submit search queries to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 accesses the search index to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query.
- a search query includes one or more keywords.
- the search system 112 identifies the resources 105 that are responsive to the query, provides information about the resources 105 in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result may include data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query, and may include a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result may include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page 104 , a rendering of the resource 105 , and the URL of the web page 104 .
- Search results pages may also include one or more advertisement slots in which advertisements may be presented.
- a search result page may be sent with a request from the search system 112 for the web browser of the user device 106 to set an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) cookie.
- a cookie may represent, for example, a particular user device 106 and a particular web browser.
- the search system 112 includes a server that replies to the query by sending the search results page in an HTTP response.
- This HTTP response includes instructions (e.g., a set cookie instruction) that cause the browser to store a cookie for the site hosted by the server or for the domain of the server. If the browser supports cookies and cookies are enabled, every subsequent page request to the same server or a server within the domain of the server will include the cookie.
- the cookie may store a variety of data, including a unique or semi-unique identifier.
- the unique or semi-unique identifier may be anonymized and is not connected with user names. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, the use of cookies allows an external service, such as the search system 112 or other system, to track particular actions and status of a user over multiple sessions. A user may opt out of tracking user actions, for example, by disabling cookies in the browser's settings.
- the advertisement management system 110 receives a request for advertisements to be provided with the resource 105 or search results.
- the request for advertisements may include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results page, and may be provided to the advertisement management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the advertisement slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the advertisement slot may be provided to the advertisement management system 110 .
- keywords i.e., one or more words that are associated with content
- source keywords i.e., one or more words that are associated with content
- search query for which search results are requested may also be provided to the advertisement management system 110 to facilitate identification of advertisements that are relevant to the resource 105 or search query.
- the request for advertisement(s) may include an identification of user data from a first user of a website, which may be provided to the advertisement management system 110 .
- the first user may be part of an online community and/or have an online presence or account (e.g., social media sites such as Google+, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc.).
- the first user may identify user data for a second user, e.g., that the second user enjoys soccer.
- the advertisement management system 110 may assign interest data to the second user based on the first user's identification of user data and associate the interest data with advertisements provided by an advertiser.
- the advertisement management system 110 may associate content (e.g., keywords, pictures, videos, etc.) with the interest data to provide advertisements that are relevant to the second user.
- the advertisement management system 110 may provide advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible advertisements”).
- eligible advertisements may include advertisements having characteristics matching the user data identified by the first user.
- eligible advertisements may include advertisements that match the characteristics of the second user.
- eligible advertisements may include advertisements deemed relevant by the second user, etc.
- the advertisement management system 110 selects an eligible advertisement for each advertisement slot of a resource 105 (e.g., profile of a user on a website) or of a search results page.
- the advertisement management system 110 may select the eligible advertisement from an advertisement database.
- the advertisement database may be a cloud database in communication with the advertisement management system.
- the resource 105 or search results page is received by the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- User interaction data representing user interactions with presented advertisements may be stored in a historical data store 119 . For example, when an advertisement is presented to the user via an ad server 114 , data may be stored in a log file 116 . This log file 116 , as more fully described below, may be aggregated with other data in the historical data store 119 .
- the historical data store 119 contains data representing the advertisement impression.
- the presentation of an advertisement is stored in response to a request for the advertisement that is presented.
- the ad request may include data identifying a particular cookie, such that data identifying the cookie may be stored in association with data that identifies the advertisement(s) that were presented in response to the request.
- the data may be stored directly to the historical data store 119 .
- data representing the selection of the advertisement may be stored in the log file 116 , a cookie, or the historical data store 119 .
- the data is stored in response to a request for a web page that is linked to by the advertisement.
- the user selection of the advertisement may initiate a request for presentation of a web page that is provided by (or for) the advertiser.
- the request may include data identifying the particular cookie for the user device, and this data may be stored in the advertisement data store.
- User interaction data may be associated with unique identifiers that represent a corresponding user device with which the user interactions were performed.
- user interaction data may be associated with one or more cookies.
- Each cookie may include content which specifies an initialization time that indicates a time at which the cookie was initially set on the particular user device 106 .
- the log files 116 also store references to advertisements and data representing conditions under which each advertisement was selected for presentation to a user.
- the historical data store 119 may store targeting keywords, bids, and other criteria with which eligible advertisements are selected for presentation.
- the historical data store 119 may include data that specifies a number of impressions for each advertisement and the number of impressions for each advertisement may be tracked, for example, using the keywords that caused the advertisement impressions and/or the cookies that are associated with the impressions.
- Data for each impression may also be stored so that each impression and user selection may be associated with (i.e., stored with references to and/or indexed according to) the advertisement that was selected and/or the targeting keyword that caused the advertisement to be selected for presentation.
- the user interaction data may be used to identify something of value for the first user based on the interaction. For example, when the second user interacts with an advertisement(s) (highlights, clicks, saves, etc.), the interaction with the advertisement(s) is stored in the log file 116 , a cookie, the historical data store 119 , etc. In some implementations, the data may be stored in the first user's user profile data, first user's user device, etc. Based on the interaction by the second user, the first user may be provided with a credit.
- FIG. 2 a flow diagram of a method for providing display data representing advertisements associated with interest data is shown in accordance with a described implementation.
- the method 200 is provided by way of example, as there are a number of ways to carry out the methods according to the present disclosure.
- the method 200 shown in FIG. 2 may be executed or otherwise performed by one of a combination of various systems.
- the method may be implemented by a computer, a computer program product, a computer program, a client, a server, a client-server relationship, etc.
- the method 200 is described herein as carried out by the system 100 of FIG. 1 , by way of example.
- the example method begins at block 202 , in which a relationship is stored between a first user and a second user in memory.
- a first user may be defined to include multiple users.
- the relationship may be a group relationship, a content-based relationship, a social relationship, combinations thereof, etc.
- the relationship may be defined by an online community, e.g., circles, friends, followers, connections, etc.
- an identification of user data is received from a first user of a website.
- the website may be a social networking website, e.g., Google+, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
- the identification of user data may comprise reading or scanning a message sent by a user using a social networking website.
- the message may be viewable by a second user.
- a user may send a message to the second user (e.g., newsfeed, private message, etc.), to the website (e.g., Google+, Facebook, etc.).
- the message may include directions that the second user should see advertisements related to golf.
- the message may direct the second user to like golf, to follow a hyperlink to a golf site, etc.
- the identification of user data may include an interest in a user profile of the first user stored in memory.
- the user may identify golf for a second user, which may be stored in the user profile of the first user as an interest, possible interest, metadata, etc.
- the interest may also be stored as a credit to the first user for identifying data that the second user may be interested in.
- the first user may receive a credit based on identifying user data for a second user.
- the credit may be stored in the user profile of the first user as a way of tracking and/or logging the interests that have been assigned to a second user based on the identification of user data by a first user.
- FIG. 3 The identification of user data for a user is shown in illustrative form in FIG. 3 .
- a user profile via a webpage 300 of a website is depicted.
- the website may be a social media site.
- “Social media site” is may include any website in which an online community may communicate or network using electronic message, posts, etc. (e.g., Blogger, Huffington Post, Google+, etc.).
- a first user is viewing a second user's profile (John Doe) via Jane Doe's profile page 306 via a user interface on web page 300 .
- User Jane Doe may view a second user (John Doe) user data 302 by clicking, highlighting, hovering, etc. near his user name.
- John Doe's user data 302 is displayed to Jane Doe.
- Jane Doe may view user data that has already been identified for John Doe by other users 302 .
- user data 302 for John Doe that has been identified includes interests such as cycling, fashion, movies, recipes, soccer and cars.
- the system may show to the first user an indication of who identified user data for the second user.
- Jane Doe may identify user data 302 for John Doe.
- Jane Doe may identify user data 302 as shown in FIG. 3 by using a search tool 304 .
- the first user may identify user data by manipulating the second user user data via the first user's profile (e.g., using a drag and drop from an interest icon or field). For example, the first user may add a soccer icon next to the second user's name within the first user's profile 306 .
- the first user may group the second user by user data.
- the first user may create a soccer circle and place the second user within that circle.
- the identification of user data may include providing user data, uploading user data, and sharing user data as shown in FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 4 illustrates shared user data in accordance with a described implementation.
- a first user Jane Doe
- Jane Doe may have the ability to share user data with a second user (John Doe).
- Jane Doe accesses her profile via a user interface 400 .
- the user interface may be implemented at a client device.
- user interface 400 is implemented with a toolbar integrated into a browser.
- the first user may enter a second user or other users to share the post with by using the box 404 .
- a set of dialog boxes or dropdown boxes may also be displayed where a user can type into the fields or select from the dropdown boxes to share the post.
- the first user may select box 408 to share the post with the second user.
- the first user may add more users with box 406 .
- the user may finalize the share with box 410 .
- the first user may cancel the share with box 412 .
- User data 402 may include any content that may be shared between a first user and a second user (e.g., videos, messages, documents, hyperlinks, etc.).
- a first user e.g., videos, messages, documents, hyperlinks, etc.
- Jane Doe is going to share a news article with John Doe and/or other people.
- the user data 402 becomes assigned interest data for the second user.
- interest data for the second user is assigned based on the identified user data from the first user.
- a weight of the interest data may be determined based on (1) identifying user data, (2) sharing user data, and/or (3) the input from a second user.
- the weight of the interest data may be stored in a memory in association with a second user user profile data.
- the weight of the interest data is used to determine whether the system associates the interest data with advertisements.
- the weight of the interest data may be used to determine whether to provide a credit to the first user.
- (1) may be weighted according to a plurality of users identifying identical user data and (2) may be weighted according to a plurality of users that a first user shares content with.
- the weight of the interest data may be stored in an appropriate storage site (e.g., first user's user profile, second user's user profile, memory, mobile computing device, etc.). The weight may be determined in the following way:
- the number of users may be the total number of users that identified user data.
- the number of users may be defined by the system, defined by the second user, etc.
- the number of users may be multiplied by a factor.
- the factor may be multiplied by the number of users that identify user data.
- the factor may be a parameter that is set by the system. For example, the system may determine that the relationship between the first user and the second user (e.g., spouse, sister, etc.), may warrant a higher factor that is multiplied by the number of users that identified user data.
- Another example may be a factor related to input by the second user. For example, if the second user agrees with first user's identification of user data 80% of the time, then the factor may be higher by 0.8.
- a factor may be decreased. For example, if the relationship between the first and the second user is defined by the system, the user(s), etc. as an “acquaintance”, then the factor may be lower.
- the input by the second user may increase the factor by a certain amount.
- the input by the second user (3) may increase the weight of (1).
- the input by the second user (3) may be an addend in the above equation.
- the input by the second user may negate the product of the # of users that identified user data * factor, thereby making the weight of (1) equal to zero.
- (2) may be determined by the number of users that a first user shares user data with.
- the factor may be determined by the system. For example, the system may determine that the relationship between the first user and the second user (e.g., spouse, sister, etc.), may warrant a higher factor that is multiplied by the number of users that identified user data.
- Another example may be a factor related to input by the second user. For example, if the second user agrees with first user's identification of user data 80% of the time, then the factor may be higher by 0.8.
- a factor may be decreased. For example, if the relationship between the first and the second user is defined by the system, the user(s), etc. as an “acquaintance”, then the factor may be lower.
- the number of users that the first user shares content may be a divisor in the above equation.
- the weight of (2) will be greater. If the first user shares identical data to multiple users, e.g., 10 users, then the weight of (2) will be x/10.
- the weight of the interest data may also be based on (3) the input from a second user, as shown in FIG. 5 .
- an input from a second user regarding assigned interest data is shown according to a described implementation.
- an input from the second user of a website may be received.
- the system may determine whether to associate the interest data with advertisements based on an input from a second user.
- a weight of the interest data may be determined based on the input from the second user.
- the second user may receive display data 302 relating to user data that has been identified by a first user (Jane Doe) or users that may be assigned as interest data for the second user (John Doe).
- the display data 302 may also include shared user data.
- the shared user data 302 is a news article related to soccer.
- the system may receive an input from a second user.
- the input received from the second user may be input that the second user agrees 504 with the interest data 502 that may be assigned.
- the second user may agree by selecting box 504 , by viewing the data, by inputting text, or by any other appropriate interaction (e.g., +1'ing, liking, etc.)
- the interest data may be associated with advertisements provided by an advertiser, the interest data may be stored (e.g., memory, first user's user profile, second user's user profile, any other appropriate storage site), the interest data may be displayed, the interest data may update the weight of the interest data, the interest data may be used to provide other relevant content to the user, and any other appropriate actions.
- the second user may decide what advertisements he/she wants to view after agreeing with the interest data 502 .
- the second user may agree with the interest data 502 and identify the interest data 502 as user data for the first user, thereby creating a similar advertisement system for the first user.
- the input received from the second user may be input that the second user disagrees 506 with the interest data 502 .
- the interest data and/or interest (if the interest data had initially been agreed to) may then be removed from the second user's profile data.
- the second user's decision may be integrated with existing advertisement preferences.
- the second user may have control over the specifics of what a first user may or may not do regarding identifying user data.
- the system may determine what a first user may or may not do regarding identifying user data.

- the display data may be provided to the second user in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, on the second user's profile, a message (e.g., SMS, MMS, email, etc.) to the second user, etc.
- the display data may be presented in a number of formats, including, but limited to, streaming content (e.g., video, picture, etc.), interactive content (e.g., games, applications, etc.) and any other appropriate content.
- the second user may interact with the advertisement. For example, the second user may click, view, highlight etc. the advertisement. In some implementations, something of value may be identified for the first user based on the interaction. For example, a credit may be provided to the first user. “Providing” a credit may include, in various implementations, calculating a credit, applying a credit to an account, transmitting a credit to an account on a server to applied at the server, etc.
- the first user may receive additional features on a website. In some implementations, the first user may received free access to another website. In other implementations, the first user may allocate a credit to another user.
- the first user is paid by a percentage of the CPC (cost-per-click) that relates to how much the first user contributed to the relevance of the advertisement for the second user.

Abstract
Description
-
- then (input by the second user)
-
- then (1+2)
(1)=# of users that identified user data*factor+(3)
(2)=factor/# of users that a first user shares content with
The factor may be determined by the system. For example, the system may determine that the relationship between the first user and the second user (e.g., spouse, sister, etc.), may warrant a higher factor that is multiplied by the number of users that identified user data. Another example may be a factor related to input by the second user. For example, if the second user agrees with first user's identification of user data 80% of the time, then the factor may be higher by 0.8. Alternatively, a factor may be decreased. For example, if the relationship between the first and the second user is defined by the system, the user(s), etc. as an “acquaintance”, then the factor may be lower.
