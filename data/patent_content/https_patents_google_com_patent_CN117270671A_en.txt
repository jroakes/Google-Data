The data processing system 110 may include at least one content request module 130, at least one content selection module 135, at least one script provider module 140, at least one battery usage analysis module 150, and at least one database 145. The content request module 130, the content selection module 135, the script provider module 140, and the battery usage analysis module 150 may each comprise at least one processing unit, server, virtual server, circuit, engine, agent, appliance, or other logic device (such as a programmable logic array configured to communicate with the database 145 and other computing devices (e.g., the content provider computing device 115, the content publisher computing device 120, or the client computing device 125) via the network 105.
The content request module 130, the content selection module 135, the script provider module 140, and the battery usage analysis module 150 may include or execute at least one computer program or at least one script. The content request module 130, the content selection module 135, the script provider module 140, and the battery usage analysis module 150 may be separate components, a single component, or a portion of the data processing system 110. The content request module 130, the content selection module 135, the script provider module 140, and the battery usage analysis module 150 may comprise a combination of software and hardware (such as one or more processors configured to execute one or more scripts).
The data processing system 110 may also include one or more content repositories or databases 145. Database 145 may be local to data processing system 110. In some implementations, database 145 may be remote from data processing system 110, but may be in communication with data processing system 110 via network 105. Database 145 may include web pages, portions of web pages, third party content items, and battery balance scripts, among others, to serve client computing device 125. In some implementations, the database 145 can include a list of content item identifications corresponding to content items, one or more of which can potentially be selected by the content selection module 135 for transmission to one or more client computing devices 125. Database 145 may also include battery usage information corresponding to one or more identifications in the list of content item identifications. Database 145 may also include correlations between one or more performance parameters associated with client computing device 125 and battery usage information corresponding to the identification of one or more content items. Examples of performance parameters associated with the client computing device 125 may include a frame rate of content display and a delay in displaying the content. The generation of battery usage information and the correlation between one or more performance parameters associated with the client computing device 125 and the battery usage information is discussed further below.
The content request module 130 may receive a request for content from the client computing device 125. The request for content may include a request for an information resource, a request for third-party content, a request for a script, or a combination thereof. In some implementations, the request for third-party content can include a request for an address or identifier of an information resource on which the third-party content is to be displayed. The request for third-party content may also include or identify one or more device parameters that the data processing system 110 may use to determine content to provide in response to the request for content. For example, the device parameter may identify a size of a content slot into which the requested content is to be inserted. The device parameters may identify a type of content associated with the information resource, a type of third-party content (e.g., text, image, video, etc.) requested, client device information, size information of the third-party content item requested, or a combination thereof. In some implementations, the device parameter can identify a property of the device, such as a device type, an operating system, or any other property of the device. In some implementations, the content selection module 125 can generate content items in real-time that can include the requested content in addition to the battery usage script discussed below.
The script provider module 140 provides a battery usage script or computer program, etc., that when executed at the client computing device 125, allows battery usage to be measured at the client computing device 125. In addition to the requested content item, the content selection module 135 may also transmit the battery usage script provided by the script provider module 140 to the requesting client computing device 125. The battery usage script may be configured to execute when the client computing device 125 displays or renders the requested content item. For example, a web browser or application running on the client computing device 125 may execute a battery usage script when displaying the requested content item. The battery usage script may be configured to utilize an application programming interface (application programmable interface, API), such as a battery status API, provided by a web browser or application to gain access to the battery balance of the client computing device 125. In some implementations, the battery usage script may be further configured to utilize the API to gain access to additional information about the battery of the client computing device, where the additional information may include whether the battery is being charged by an external power source, a type of battery used, and the like. The battery usage script may be configured to call a battery status API to retrieve battery balance information at one or more moments before, during, or after the duration of the client computing device 125 displaying or rendering the content item. In some implementations, the data processing system 110 can maintain a list of content item identifiers or an appropriate data structure that indicates content items for which battery usage scripts have been transmitted. The data processing system 110 may update the list or data structure with battery balance information corresponding to the respective content items received from the client computing device 125.
The battery usage script may also be configured to send battery balance information to the data processing system 110. The battery usage script may also be configured to send additional information related to the battery balance information, where the additional information may include an identifier of a content item that uniquely identifies the content item being displayed or rendered corresponding to the battery balance information, an identification of a browser or computing application, an identification of an operating system, an identification of a manufacturer or model of the client computing device 125, an indication of whether the battery is being charged by an external power source, and the like.
In some implementations, the battery usage script can include additional scripts or computer programs that can be sent to the client computing device 125 in conjunction with the requested content item. These additional scripts or computer programs may determine additional performance parameters of the client computing device 125 related to displaying or rendering the requested content item. For example, the script provider module 140 may provide a frame rate script that, when executed at the client computing device 125, may determine a frame rate (e.g., measured in frames per second) at which the client computing device 125 displays or renders the content item. The script provider module 140 may also provide a delay script that, when executed at the client computing device 125, may determine a delay (e.g., in milliseconds) in displaying or rendering the content item on the client computing device 125. The script provider module 140 may also provide scripts that monitor and record user behavior during display of the content item or rendering of the content item. For example, the script may monitor and record items clicked on by the user or user actions that result in termination of display or rendering of the content item, such as requesting a different web page or terminating an application. The battery usage script may send the recorded information to the data processing system 110. Battery usage scenarios will be discussed in more detail below with reference to fig. 3.
The battery usage analysis module 150 may be configured to process and analyze battery usage information received from battery usage scripts running on one or more client computing devices 125. The battery usage analysis module 150 may aggregate battery usage information received from one or more client computing devices 125 and determine a relationship between content items and corresponding battery usage when the content items are displayed or rendered. The battery usage analysis module 150 may utilize statistical tools, such as regression models, to determine the relationship. In some implementations, the battery usage analysis module 150 can determine a battery usage value associated with each content item for which battery usage information is received. In some implementations, the battery usage analysis module 150 may also analyze additional information related to performance parameters, such as frame rate, delay, and user behavior received from the client computing device 125. Based on this information, the battery usage analysis module 150 may determine a correlation between battery usage and the performance parameters mentioned above. The battery usage information and the relevance associated with each content item generated by the battery usage analysis module 150 may be stored in the data processing system 110, such as in the database 145. Additional details of the battery usage analysis module 150 are discussed below in connection with fig. 4-6.
The content selection module 135 may be configured to determine content to send to the client computing device 125 in response to a received request for content. The content selection module 135 may determine content to send to the client computing device 125 based on information included in the request for content and battery usage information generated by the battery usage analysis module 150.
In some implementations, the content selection module 135 can also access the database 145 to determine battery information corresponding to the requested content item. The content selection module 135 may compare the battery usage information corresponding to the requested content item to a threshold. Based on the comparison, the content selection module 135 may modify a policy for selecting content items for transmission to the requesting client computing device 125. Additional details of the content selection module 135 are discussed further below.
FIG. 2 depicts a representation of a portion of an example user interface 200 of a computing application displayed at a client computing device. The example user interface 200 includes a web browser window 202 that in turn includes an address bar 204 and a view box 206. The address bar 204 accepts addresses of desired web pages, where the addresses may include universal resource locators (universal resource locator, URLs). View frame 206 displays the content retrieved from the specified URL in address bar 204. For example, in some implementations, the view frame 206 may display content of a web page corresponding to a URL retrieved from a publisher, such as the content publisher computing device 120.
Content received by the computing application may include subframes, such as a publisher content subframe 208 and a content item subframe 210. The publisher content subframe 208 may include content provided by the content publisher computing device 120. The content item subframe 210 may include pointers, IP addresses, or URLs for computing devices or servers that may provide one or more content items. The computing application may send a request over the network to the computing device corresponding to the address specified in the content item sub-box 210. In some implementations, the address specified in the content item subframe 210 can correspond to an address of a digital processing system (such as the data processing system 110 shown in FIG. 1). In addition to sending a request for one or more content items, the computing application may also communicate device parameters pertaining to the computing application or client computing device to the digital processing system. For example, the computing application may communicate its identification (e.g., XYZ web browser, JKL application, etc.). In response to the request, the computing application may receive one or more content items from the digital processing system or from a content provider computing device (such as content provider computing device 115 shown in fig. 1).
FIG. 3 illustrates a representation of an example content item 300 received by the client computing device 125. As described above, the content items received by the client computing device 125 may include content to be displayed or rendered on the client computing device 125 and one or more scripts provided by the script provider module 140 (fig. 1). The content item 300 includes at least a content portion 302 and a battery usage script 352. Content portion 302 may include content to be displayed or rendered on a client computing device. For example, as shown in fig. 3, content portion 302 may include one or more of image 304, video 306, audio 308, and other content 310. The battery usage script 352 may include one or more scripts to be executed by a computing application, such as the computing application discussed above in connection with fig. 2. For example, as shown in fig. 3, the battery usage script 352 may include one or more scripts, such as a first battery balance script 312, a second battery balance script 314, a frame rate script 316, and one or more other suitable scripts 320.
The first battery balance script 312 may include instructions to obtain battery usage at a first time when the content item is displayed or rendered on the client computing device 125. The second battery balance script 314 may include instructions to obtain battery usage at a second time when the content item is displayed or rendered on the client computing device 125. In some implementations, the first time may correspond to a time at which the content item was first displayed or rendered on the client computing device 125. In some embodiments, the second time may correspond to a few milliseconds or seconds after the first time. For example, the second instant may be between about 5 seconds and about 25 seconds after the first instant. In some other examples, the second time may be a few milliseconds to about a few seconds or tens of seconds from the first time. In other examples, the duration between the first time and the second time may be some percentage of the duration that the content item is displayed or rendered on the client computing device 125. In some implementations, the second time may be the time when the display or rendering of the content on the client computing device 125 has been completed. Both the first battery level script 312 and the second battery level script 314 may obtain battery level at a first time and a second time, respectively, by communicating with an API, such as a battery level API, provided by a web browser or computing application in which the content item 300 is displayed or rendered.
In some implementations, the battery usage script 352 may include a script configured to obtain a battery margin at two times corresponding to the first time and the second time discussed above. One example pseudo code representing a battery margin script is as follows:
another example pseudo code representing a battery headroom script is as follows:
in the above example pseudo code of the example battery level script, the secs_to_report variable specifies a time difference (15 seconds) between two times when the battery level is acquired, wherein a first of the two times corresponds TO a time when display or rendering of the content item begins. The sample_to_report variable may specify the number of times (here five) that the battery margin is taken. Further, the script is configured to report the battery remaining only if the battery remaining measured at the first time is greater than the battery remaining at the second time.
The battery usage script 352 may also include a frame rate script 316 that determines the time interval between frames displayed by a web browser or computing application. Under typical operation, a web browser or computing application may display image frames on the client computing device 125 display at a predetermined frame rate, such as 60 frames per second. However, in some example implementations, if an operation performed on the client computing device 125 would cause an overload on the processing resources of the web browser or computing application, the frame rate would decrease. That is, under overload conditions, the time interval between subsequent frames increases. The decrease in frame rate or the increase in the interval between displaying subsequent frames may be used as an indicator of overload, if any, caused by the display or rendering of the content item. Similar to the battery margin script discussed above, the frame rate script 316 can also determine a frame rate at one or more moments in time, such as a first moment in time at which the content item is first displayed or rendered on the client computing device and another moment in time a predetermined period of time after the first moment in time. In some example implementations, the frame rate script 316 may use APIs such as requestanimation frame and requestIdleCallback to determine the frame rate or time interval between subsequent frames.
The battery usage script portion 352 may also include other scripts 320, which may include scripts such as a delay script that determines a delay in displaying or rendering a content item. Other scripts 320 may also include scripts that monitor user behavior as content items are displayed or rendered on client computing device 125. For example, the other scripts 320 may include scripts for determining whether the user clicked on the content item. Other scripts 320 may also include scripts for determining whether a user is moving to a different web page or terminating a computing application while a content item is being displayed or rendered.
Each of the scripts discussed above may also be configured to send information obtained at the client computing device 125 to the battery usage analysis module 150. In some implementations, one or more scripts may be configured to communicate the acquired information to the battery usage analysis module 150 whenever it is acquired. In some other example implementations, one or more scripts may be configured to temporarily store information locally at the client computing device 125 and send the stored information to the battery usage analysis module 150 at predetermined intervals or after the size of the stored data reaches a certain threshold.
In some implementations, the battery margin script may be configured to send the battery margin information to the battery usage analysis module 150 only if there is a drop in battery margin after the first time. In some implementations, the battery margin script may be configured to send an indication (e.g., battery_drop=true/FALSE) to the battery usage analysis module 150 without sending the magnitude of the battery margin drop if there is a battery margin drop. In some implementations, the battery margin script may be configured to send the magnitude of the battery margin drop to the battery usage analysis module 150. In some implementations, the battery margin script can be configured to register with the event listener script to detect battery margin changes and report the changes to the battery usage analysis module 150. In some implementations, the battery script may be configured to obtain values or levels of performance parameters that have been discussed above with respect to the frame rate script 316 and other scripts 320 and send the obtained information to the battery usage analysis module 150.
In some implementations, one or more of the scripts discussed above may be located in a web browser or computing application, rather than being sent in the content item 300. In particular, one or more scripts may be executed by a web browser or computing application when the received content item is displayed or rendered on the client computing device 125. In some implementations, the data processing system 110 can provide one or more scripts to a web browser or computing application on the client computing device 125 at a time, with instructions to store the one or more scripts locally at the client computing device 125, and execute the scripts when the content item is displayed or rendered. Storing one or more scripts at the client computing device 125 may reduce the amount of data transferred from the data processing system 110, thereby reducing the impact on the data bandwidth between the data processing system 110 and the client computing device 125.
Fig. 4 shows a representation of example information 400 sent by a content item script to a battery usage analysis module. In particular, information 400 may include a content ID, a battery level-1, a battery level-2, a device ID, and an OS ID. The content ID may specify an identification corresponding to the content item displayed or rendered on the client computing device 125. The battery level-1 may specify the battery level obtained at the first time, and the battery level-2 may specify the battery level obtained at the second time. In some embodiments, additional battery residuals may also be included, such as battery residuals at additional times, differences in battery residuals measured at the first and second times, differences in battery residuals measured at any two times from all times received, indications of whether there is a decrease in battery residuals, indications that the battery is charging, and the like. The information 400 may also include a timestamp associated with each time that the battery margin is measured or transmitted. The device ID may specify the type of client computing device 125. For example, the device ID may include a name or reference associated with a device type such as a mobile device, tablet, laptop, desktop, digital personal assistant, or the like. The OS ID may provide information about the operating system running on the client computing device 125.
In some implementations, the information 400 sent to the battery usage analysis module 150 may also include values for additional performance parameters, such as frame rate, frame interval duration, and user behavior obtained by one or more of the scripts discussed above.
FIG. 5 depicts a representation of example battery usage aggregate data 500 at the data processing system 110. In some implementations, the battery usage aggregate data 500 may be stored in the database 145. The battery usage aggregate data 500 may be generated by the battery usage analysis module 150 based on information received from scripts executing at one or more client computing devices 125, such as the information 400 shown in fig. 3. For example, the battery usage aggregation data 500 may include a content ID, a change in battery margin, a device ID, an OS ID, and a frame rate. As described above, the content ID specifies a unique identifier associated with the content item. The battery usage aggregate data 500 includes several entries associated with content ID "1234" and content ID "9876". Although fig. 5 shows entries associated with only two content items, it should be understood that the battery usage aggregate data 500 may include additional entries associated with other content IDs corresponding to other content items. Each entry associated with the same content ID includes information received from the client computing device 125 regarding displaying or rendering the content item corresponding to the content ID. For example, for a content item having a content ID of "1234," the battery usage aggregate data 500 may include a battery margin of 0.5 received from the client computing device 125 having a device ID of "0001," running an "iOS" operating system, with a frame rate recorded as 60 frames per second.
The change in battery balance may indicate a difference between two battery balances received from the client computing device 125. The battery margin taken at the client computing device 125 may correspond to the cumulative effect of all processes currently running on the client computing device. One or more of these processes may correspond to a displayed or rendered content item based on the time at which the battery level is measured. The difference between the two battery residuals may be positive or negative because the occurrence of other processes on the client computing device is unpredictable. For example, a negative number may indicate a decrease in battery margin, while a positive number may indicate an increase in battery margin. These numbers may indicate the magnitude of the battery margin change or the scaling magnitude. In some other implementations, the change in battery balance may represent a ratio of battery balance taken at a first time to battery balance taken at a second time during display or rendering of the content item.
In some implementations, the battery usage aggregate data 500 can include additional columns specifying information about other metrics or performance parameters corresponding to the content items. For example, the battery usage aggregate data 500 may include a delay column that specifies a delay in loading the content item. The battery usage aggregate data 500 may include data associated with other performance parameters whose values have been received by the battery usage analysis module 150.
In some implementations, the battery usage aggregate data 500 may include tens, hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands, or more entries associated with each content ID. That is, the battery usage analysis module 150 may receive data associated with displaying or rendering the same content item at tens, hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands, or more client computing devices 125. In general, the battery usage analysis module 150 may utilize a large number of data points associated with each content item to determine battery usage for displaying or rendering the content item. As discussed below, the content selection module 135 may maintain a list of content items that can potentially be sent to the client computing device and may modify policies for selecting content items based on the determined battery usage. In some implementations, the battery usage analysis module 150 may process the battery usage aggregate data 500 using a statistical tool to generate statistical data, such as an average battery margin for each content item, an average change in battery margin, an average frame rate, and the like. In some other implementations, the battery usage analysis module 150 may utilize a regression model to determine correlations between battery residuals and other performance parameters (such as frame rate, delay, or user behavior).
The battery usage aggregate data 500 may be stored in the database 145 and may be indexed based on one or more columns such that the battery usage analysis module 150 may search and retrieve data associated with each column. In some implementations, the battery usage aggregate data 500 may be arranged in a different manner than that shown in fig. 5. For example, the battery usage aggregate data 500 may be stored in the database 145 as a plurality of tables of only two columns, wherein one of the columns includes a content ID and the other column includes one of a change in battery margin, a device ID, an OS ID, a frame rate, and other performance parameters. Such a data arrangement may facilitate determining battery usage of the content ID based on one or a combination of aspects such as the device ID and the OS ID. For example, the battery usage analysis module 150 may determine to display or render an estimate of the content item associated with the content ID "1234" on the client computing device 125 running the same operating system (identified by the same OS ID) to determine an estimate of battery usage for the particular operating system. Additionally or alternatively, the battery usage analysis module may determine a battery usage estimate associated with a particular device type. Thus, the battery usage analysis module may be used to determine battery usage estimates associated with displaying or rendering content items, taking into account other attributes of the client device associated with battery usage, and may be used, for example, to determine battery usage for particular device attributes. The determined battery usage may be used, for example, to provide content items to the device based on the attributes of the device.
Fig. 6 depicts a representation of battery usage estimation data 600. The battery usage estimation data 600 may be generated by the battery usage analysis module 150 based on the battery usage aggregate data 500 shown in fig. 5. In particular, the battery usage estimation data 600 may be the result of processing the battery usage aggregate data 500 using one or more statistical tools. The battery usage estimation data may include two columns: a content ID column and a battery usage estimation column. The content ID may specify a unique identifier of the content item and the battery usage estimate specifies an estimate of battery usage (or battery usage value) when the content item is displayed or rendered. In some implementations, the battery usage estimation data 600 can include battery usage estimates for groups of content items for which the battery usage analysis module 150 receives battery usage information from one or more client computing devices 125. The battery usage estimate may be based on the change in battery margin discussed above in connection with fig. 5. In one or more examples, a battery usage estimate associated with a content item may be determined based on an average of all battery remaining changes received for the content item. In some examples, other statistical estimation tools may also be utilized to determine battery usage estimates. In some implementations, rather than estimating the actual battery usage, the battery usage analysis module 150 may utilize the battery usage aggregate data 500 and any additional data received from the client computing device 125 to determine the relative power consumption of the content item. The battery usage analysis module 150 may periodically update the battery usage estimation data 600 based on new or updated entries received in the battery usage aggregation data 500.
In some implementations, the battery usage analysis module 150 can generate a correlation between the estimated battery consumption and additional performance parameters (such as frame rate, delay, user behavior, etc.) of the content item. For example, the battery usage analysis module 150 may determine a correlation between the battery margin and the frame rate of a content item or several content items. If there is a strong correlation between battery margin and frame rate, the battery usage analysis module 150 may establish that content items with low frame rates also exhibit high power consumption. Determining a strong correlation may allow the battery usage analysis module 150 to estimate the power consumption of the content item even if no battery balance data (or unreliable battery balance data) is available for the content item. That is, the battery usage analysis module 150 may analyze the relevant performance parameters to estimate the power consumption of the content item.
Referring to fig. 1, the content selection module 135 may utilize the battery usage estimation data 600 in enforcing policies for selecting and transmitting content items requested by one or more client computing devices 125. In some implementations, the content selection module 135 can implement a policy that limits the sending of requested content items whose display or rendering may consume undesirable battery power. The content selection module 135 may set a predetermined threshold battery margin and compare the battery usage estimates corresponding to each requested content item. The content selection module 135 may reject the request for the particular content item if the battery usage estimate for the requested content item is less than a predetermined threshold. For example, referring to FIG. 6, the content selection module 135 may set the threshold battery level to-0.4. If the content selection module 135 receives a request for a content item with a content ID of "9876," the content selection module 135 may search the battery usage estimation data 600 for an entry with a content ID of "9876. When the entry exists in the battery usage estimation data 600, the content selection module 135 determines whether the battery usage estimate-0.5 for content ID "9876" is less than a threshold battery margin-0.4. Because the battery usage estimate is less than the threshold battery margin, the content selection module 135 may reject the request for the content item by the client computing device 125. In some implementations, battery usage associated with a content item and a particular client device attribute can be stored, and the content selection module can select the content item based on the attribute associated with the requesting client device and the battery usage estimate for the client device and the attribute. In some implementations, the content selection module 135 can maintain a list of content items that can potentially be delivered to the client computing device 125. If the content selection module 135 determines that a content item on the list of content items has an undesirable battery usage estimate, the content selection module 135 may remove the content item from the list. In some implementations, the content selection module 135 can tag content items in the list that have an undesired estimate of battery usage.
In some implementations, the content selection module 135 can implement a policy that modifies content items determined to have an undesirable battery usage estimate. For example, the content selection module 135 may modify the quality of the content item (such as by reducing the size of the displayed image, reducing the number of frames displayed in a video or animation, etc.) to reduce the amount of power consumed in displaying or rendering the content item at the client computing device 125. In some implementations, the stored content items may be modified to improve battery usage estimates associated with the content items. For example, when multiple content items are displayed, analysis of the content items and associated battery usage by the client device may identify particular content item attributes associated with relatively high battery usage estimates. The content item may be modified by modifying the content item attribute to a content item attribute associated with a relatively low battery usage estimate to generate a modified content item. For example, it may be determined that video with a relatively high frame rate uses a relatively high amount of battery, and content items with relatively high frame rates may be modified to reduce their frame rate, thereby improving battery usage. As described above, the effect of modification to the content item attribute may be determined by providing the modified content item to a plurality of client devices to display the modified content item and analyzing the battery usage of the client devices while the modified content item is displayed, thereby determining the content item attribute associated with relatively low battery usage.
In addition to rejecting the request for the content item, in some implementations, the content selection module 135 can send a message to the content provider computing device 115 (which can be the source of the rejected content item) that the power consumption associated with the content item is unacceptable. In response, the content provider computing device 115 may notify the entity generating the content item about unacceptable power consumption of the content item or provide an alternative content item that consumes relatively less battery power to the content selection module 135.
In some implementations, it may be desirable to determine an estimate of the power consumption of a new content item received by the content selection module 135 before transmitting the content item to the client computing device 125. In some implementations, the content selection module 135 can compare aspects of the content item in the battery usage estimation data 600 that have high power consumption to corresponding aspects of the new content item. For example, the content selection module 135 may compare aspects such as size and type of content (image, video, audio). If the new content item is substantially similar to the high power consumption content item in these aspects, the content selection module 135 may determine that the new content item may also consume high battery power. Based on this determination, the content selection module 135 may limit the inclusion of new content items in the list of content items. In some implementations, the content selection module 135 can use a machine learning algorithm to analyze the attributes of the high power consumption content items and, based on the analysis, provide a prediction of whether the new content item will consume more than a predetermined threshold of battery power. The content selection module 135 may use the predictions provided by the machine learning algorithm to determine whether a new content item may be included in the content item list.
Fig. 7 shows a flow chart depicting an example method 700 for managing transmission of content items to a client computing device. The method 700 includes receiving a content item request from a mobile device (block 702). The method 700 further includes, in response to each content item request, transmitting a respective content item selected from a group of content items to a respective mobile device (block 704). The method 700 further includes receiving battery state information for a battery powering the respective mobile device from each of the mobile devices to which the respective content item is transmitted (block 706). The method 700 also includes determining, from each content item, an estimate of an amount of power consumed to display or render the content item (block 708). The method 700 further includes modifying a content selection policy for selecting a content item from a group of content items based on the estimate of power consumption (block 710).
As described above, the method 700 includes receiving a content item request from a mobile device (block 702). As discussed above in connection with fig. 1 and 2, the data processing system 110 may receive requests from the client computing devices 125 for content items to be displayed or rendered on the respective client computing devices 125. Also as described above, the client computing device 125 may include a mobile device, such as a phone, smart phone, laptop, tablet, or any other device powered by a battery. As shown in fig. 2, the content item subframe 210 includes an address or reference that the client computing device 125 may use to request a content item to be displayed in the content item subframe 210. The request may be communicated to the data processing system 110, and in particular to the content selection module 135. The request may include an identification of the requested content item.
The method 700 further includes, in response to each content item request, transmitting a respective content item selected from a group of content items to a respective mobile device (block 704). As discussed above in connection with fig. 1 and 6, the content selection module 135 maintains a list of content items that may be provided to the client computing device 125. The content selection module 135 may select a content item from the list of content items and transmit the selected content item to the requesting client computing device.
The method further includes receiving, from each of the mobile devices to which the respective content item was transmitted, battery state information for a battery powering the respective mobile device (block 706). As discussed above in connection with fig. 1, 4, and 5, the battery usage analysis module 150 receives battery status information for batteries powering the respective client computing devices 125. In particular, the battery usage analysis module 150 receives battery residuals obtained at the client computing device at one or more times during the display or rendering of the content items on the client computing device 125. In addition to transmitting an identifier that identifies the content item associated with the battery balance, the client computing device 125 may also transmit the battery balance.
The method further includes determining an estimate of an amount of power consumed to display or render each content item based on the content item (block 708). At least one example of the method block has been discussed above in connection with fig. 1-6. For example, as discussed above in connection with fig. 6, the battery usage analysis module 150 may determine a battery usage estimate or battery usage value for each content item based on battery balance information received from the client computing device 125. For example, the battery usage analysis module 150 may analyze the received battery residuals using statistical analysis and estimate battery usage values associated with displaying or rendering the content items on the client computing device 125 based on the analysis.
The method 700 includes modifying a content selection policy for selecting a content item from a group of content items based on an estimate of power consumption (block 710). As discussed above in connection with fig. 1 and 6, the content selection module 135 may modify the policy of selecting content items from the list of content items based on the battery usage estimate determined by the battery usage analysis module 150. For example, the content selection module may modify the content selection policy by limiting selection of only those content items for which the battery consumption for display and rendering is less than a predetermined threshold.
Fig. 8 shows a flow chart depicting another example method 800 for managing transmission of content items to a client computing device. The method 800 includes receiving a plurality of battery change indications, each battery change indication indicating a change in a battery balance of a respective one of a plurality of mobile devices while the respective one of the mobile devices is displayed on the respective mobile device (block 802). The method 800 further includes receiving mobile device attribute data indicating one or more mobile device attributes of respective mobile devices of the plurality of mobile devices (block 804). The method further includes determining a relationship between the change in battery remaining and a content item of the plurality of content items based on the plurality of battery change indications and the mobile device attribute data (block 806). The method 800 further includes modifying the plurality of content items based on the determined relationship to generate a modified plurality of content items (block 808).
As described above, the method 800 includes receiving a plurality of battery change indications, each battery change indication indicating a change in a battery balance of a respective one of a plurality of mobile devices while the respective one of the mobile devices is displayed on the respective mobile device (block 802). As discussed above in connection with fig. 1, 4, and 5, while the content item is displayed or rendered on the client computing device 125, the battery usage analysis module 150 may receive a battery residual indicating any change in the battery residual at the client computing device 125. The received battery residuals may correspond to battery residuals obtained at the respective client computing device 125 at least two times. The difference in battery level may indicate a change in battery level while the corresponding content item is displayed or rendered.
The method 800 also includes receiving mobile device attribute data indicating one or more mobile device attributes of a respective mobile device of the plurality of mobile devices (block 804). As discussed above in connection with fig. 1, 4, and 5, in addition to receiving battery residuals, the battery usage analysis module 150 may also receive data related to the client computing device 125. For example, the battery usage analysis module 150 may receive information regarding frame rate and delay at the client computing device 125, an operating system of the client computing device, a device type associated with the client computing device, or any other information that may affect battery usage of the client computing device while the content is displayed at the client computing device.
The method 800 further includes determining a relationship between the change in battery remaining and a content item of the plurality of content items based on the plurality of battery change indications and the mobile device attribute data (block 806). As discussed above in connection with fig. 1-6, the battery usage analysis module 150 may determine a battery usage amount when displaying or rendering the content item. The battery usage analysis module 150 may determine such a relationship based on battery balance information received from the client computing device 125.
The method further includes modifying the plurality of content items based on the determined relationship to generate a modified plurality of content items (block 808). As discussed above in connection with fig. 1 and 6, the content selection module 135 may modify the groups of content items based on an estimate of battery consumption when each of the groups of content items is displayed or rendered. For example, if the estimate of battery consumption when displaying or rendering the content item is above a threshold, the content selection module 135 may remove the content item from the group in the content item. Additionally or alternatively, the attribute of one or more of the plurality of content items may be modified based on determining that the attribute adversely affects battery consumption. In some embodiments, for example, where it is determined that battery usage associated with a content item is different due to different client device attributes, a plurality of groups of content items may be generated, where each group of content items is associated with a client device attribute.
