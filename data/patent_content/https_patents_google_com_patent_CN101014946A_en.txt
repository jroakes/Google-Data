Description
Technical field
The present invention relates to advertise.Specifically, the present invention relates to enlarge the chance of directed its advertisement of advertiser.
Background technology
Interactive advertisement provides the chance of its advertisement orientation to receivable spectators for advertiser.That is to say, because advertisement can be relevant with the demand of deriving from some User Activities (for example relevant to the search inquiry of search engine with the user, with relevant etc. by the content the document of user's request), therefore the advertisement of orientation might be useful to the terminal user.Key word of the inquiry is by such as Mountain View, and the search engine of the AdWords ad system of the Google of CA uses.Similarly, the content-relevant ad system has been proposed.For example, with JeffreyA.Dean, Georges R.Harik and Paul Bucheit classify as the inventor on Dec 6th, 2002 submit to be entitled as " METHODS AND APPARATUS FORSERVING RELEVANT ADVERTISEMENTS " the 10/314th, (it is hereby incorporated by No. 427 U.S. Patent applications, be called ' 427 applications), and with DarrellAnderson, Paul Bucheit, Alex Carobus, Clarire Cui, Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik, Deepak Jindal and Narayanan Shivakumar classify as the inventor on February 26th, 2003 submit to be entitled as " SERVINGADVERTISEMENTS BASED ON CONTENT " the 10/375th, (it is hereby incorporated by in No. 900 applications, be called ' 900 applications), described application has been described and has been used for supply (serve) and method and apparatus such as the relevant advertisement of the content of the document of Webpage.
The Sprinks service that is provided by " About " in New York allows advertiser to use the image that dynamically generates with client-side image mapped and cookie will be directed to from the advertisement of the topic of predetermined tabulation to insert in the Email.With Alexander Paul Carobus, Alex Roetter and Ben Davenport classify as the inventor on October 31st, 2003 submit to be entitled as " SERVING CONTENT TARGETED ADS IN E-MAIL; SUCH ASE-MAIL NEWS LETTERS " the 10/699th, No. 607 U.S. Patent applications (it is hereby incorporated by, and is called ' 607 applications) have been described the method and apparatus that is used for supplying with such as the information-related advertisement of the email documents of Email news report.
With Jeffrey A.Dean, Georges R.Harik and Paul Bucheit classify as the inventor on June 2nd, 2003 submit to be entitled as " SERVINGADVERTISEMENTS USING INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITHE-MAIL " the 10/452nd, No. 830 U.S. Patent applications (it is hereby incorporated by, and is called ' 830 applications) have been described the method and apparatus that is used for supplying with the information-related advertisement of email documents.Optional mode with the Email serving advertisements has been described in ' 830 applications, comprise use transmit leg client device, take over party's client device, based on the application on the e-mail server of webpage etc.In any case, advertisement is oriented to (for example notion, the topic etc.) for information about that can extract from the content of Email (the maybe out of Memory that can obtain from Email).
Hotmail and Yahoo have the E-mail service based on webpage, and it is shown as the part of Email content self with advertisement, or the display position place of nearby electron mail shows on user's web browser screen.For example, in the main body of Email, embed advertisement and bother the user usually, if especially this advertisement is of no use to the user.Such advertisement has not only been shifted notice from the Email content of reality, and in fact they reduced the value of whole E-mail service, comprises advertisement because be difficult to send the Email that (maybe can not send) be not modified as yet.The user seldom might receive when reading Email and the irrelevant advertising theme content of their current idea.Regrettably, Hotmail and Yahoo e-mail advertisement are not oriented to the content of Email.In addition, the webpage mail show the next door show the mode of banner be one have entirely otherwise completely without proposal; Advertisement Server is just being worked and advertisement is illustrated, and perhaps Advertisement Server does not have work and advertisement not to be illustrated.In addition, if Advertisement Server overload and response are very slow, then it becomes the slack-off bottleneck of demonstration that makes all Email contents.
Consider above content, it is useful improving the advertisement of presenting with Email.For example, regardless of the system that is used for the Email serving advertisements,, can expect that therefore advertisement is correlated with because the user more likely ignores irrelevant advertisement.Therefore for example, the Email that the fresh flower layout is discussed should trigger the advertisement relevant with the fresh flower layout.In addition, because Email content is highly individualized usually, therefore compare with simply browsing the situation that discloses available web page contents, the user more may want fast it to be read and without disturbance.Can expect to make presenting of Email content to be independent of the supply of advertisement and present, thereby advertisement is a non-interfering type.But also expectation minimization or minimizing or supervisory communications and/or computation bandwidth at least.

§ 4.2 exemplary embodiments
§ 4.2.1 general introduction
According to the present invention, e-mail server (is called " based on the e-mail server of webpage " in instructions, and can loss of generality) can present to use with content by supply document (in instructions, be called " Webpage ", and not loss of generality) in two stages (" content " stage and " advertisement " stage) and carry out alternately.Some part of in these stages each is independent of the implementation of the part in other stage and carries out.Each example in these stages is described below.
The content stage can begin with the request from web browser traditionally, thereby shows the Webpage that comprises one or more e-mail body.Can carry out two threads based on the e-mail server of webpage: Content supply thread and advertisement obtain thread.Before generating response, afterwards or during this period, the e-mail body that can (i) sign may comprise the source contents that is used to select relevant advertisements based on the e-mail server of webpage (for example, theme and main body, but be not user's signature or transmission/receiver address); (ii) generate the unique identifier (in instructions, be called " fingerprint ", and can loss of generality) of this specific request of sign; (iii) fingerprint and source contents are offered advertisement acquisition thread; (iv) start advertisement and obtain thread; And (v) under the content thread, continue the page of supply request, it comprises the copy of fingerprint.
Obtain under the thread in advertisement, but provide the advertisement that is suitable for source contents (for example it can carry out the remote procedure call (RPC) to CAS) based on the relevant Advertisement Server (CAS) of the e-mail server request content of webpage.Can spend the hundreds of millisecond and finish this RPC, perhaps this RPC may fall flat.If request takes a long time, then it can be stopped, and can withdraw from advertisement acquisition thread by empty result.If the request failure then can be withdrawed from advertisement by empty result and obtain thread.If ask successfully, then advertisement obtains thread and can obtain the result, and it can comprise the content of one or more targeted ads.Based on the e-mail server of webpage the one or more advertisements that obtain can be converted to the form of the web browser of being convenient to be sent to the user thereafter.Based on the e-mail server of webpage can store one or more advertisements (thereby for example in look-up table fingerprint be used as major key, can use fingerprint come the one or more advertisements of retrieve stored) thereafter.At last, withdraw from advertisement and obtain thread.
