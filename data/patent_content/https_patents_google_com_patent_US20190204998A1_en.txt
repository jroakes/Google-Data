- An electronic text that corresponds with an audio book may be an eBook, electronic transcript, or other text document in electronic form that contains textual content which corresponds to the spoken content of the audio book. For example, if the audio book is a spoken version of a book, then the electronic text that corresponds with the audio book may be a written version of the same book. In another example, if the audio book is an audio version of the performance of a play, then the electronic text that corresponds with the audio book may be the script of the play.
- an electronic text that corresponds with the audio book may not necessarily be a word-by-word transcription of the audio book.
- the electronic text may be a different version of the book, an unabridged version of an abridged audio book, and the like, or the electronic book may include a preface or acknowledgements that are not in the audio book.
- Audio book module 12 may query and/or search electronic text source 13 for electronic text that corresponds with the audio book.

For example, an audio book may include or be associated with metadata that identifies the electronic text that corresponds with the audio book, or an electronic text may include or be associated with metadata that identifies the audio book with which the electronic text corresponds. In another example, a human can identify an electronic text in electronic text source 13 that corresponds with the audio book.
- Audio book module 12 may also perform automated detection of an electronic text that corresponds with the audio book.
- audio book module 12 may perform speech recognition on the audio book to generate a text transcript of the audio book, and may determine an electronic text that most closely matches the text transcript of the audio book out of the electronic texts in electronic text source 13 .
- audio book module 12 may compare electronic texts, or selected portions of the electronic texts, word-by-word with the text transcript of the audio book or portions thereof to determine the electronic text that has the closest word-by-word similarity with the text transcript of the audio book out of the electronic texts in electronic text source 13 .
- audio book module 12 may perform automated detection of an electronic text that corresponds with the audio book by breaking an electronic text up into shingles and using MinHash to determine an electronic text that is most similar to the text transcript of the audio book.
- audio book module 12 may extract the text from the electronic text, key features of the text, such as words, sentences, chapters, and paragraphs, as well as the position of such key features in the text. For example, audio book module 12 may extract the table of contents of the electronic text and may determine the locations within the electronic text to which the table of contents point, such as the positions in the electronic text of each of the chapters.
- the electronic text that corresponds with the audio book may not necessarily be a word-by-word match with the text transcript of the audio book due to many reasons.
- the electronic text may be a different edition or version of the book than the audio book, or the audio book may contain rhetorical flourishes by the narrator that is not present in the electronic text.
- one or more portions of the electronic text may match one or more corresponding portions of the text transcript, while one or more portions of the electronic text may not match one or more corresponding portions of the text transcript.
- Audio book module 12 may align the electronic text with the text transcript of the audio book to determine one or more portions of the audio book that are aligned with one or more portions of the electronic text.
- a portion of the electronic text may be aligned with a corresponding portion of the audio book if there is a close match between the portion of the electronic text and the text transcript of the portion of the audio book.
- a portion of the electronic text may not be aligned with a corresponding portion of the audio book if there is not a close match between the portion of the electronic text and the text transcript of the portion of the audio book.
- Aligning the electronic text with the text transcript may include determining a correspondence between textual strings (e.g., words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and the like) of the electronic text and the text transcript.
- audio book module 12 may determine a correspondence between locations in the electronic text with locations in the text transcript, so that audio book module 12 may determine a mapping of locations in the electronic text to locations in the text transcript.
- audio book module 12 may, by aligning the electronic text with the text transcript, determining a mapping of locations in the electronic text to locations (e.g., timestamps) of the audio book. In this way, audio book module 12 may map organizational data such as key features of the electronic text (e.g., words, paragraphs, and chapters) and as other information to specific locations in the audio book.
- Audio book module 12 may align the electronic text with the text transcript via any suitable techniques.
- audio book module 12 may first perform a coarse alignment and subsequently may perform a fine alignment. To perform the coarse alignment, audio book module 12 may use Hirschberg's algorithm that finds an optimal sequence alignment between strings. Audio book module 12 may use a customized word-to-word match scoring scheme with Hirschberg's algorithm to produce a globally optimal alignment. In other words, audio book module 12 may determine portions of electronic text that match portions of the text transcript. Audio book module 12 may perform post processing to group nearby alignments into clusters of audio intervals that strongly align, and may fill in alignment gaps by smoothing between known alignment points.
- audio book module 12 may perform a forced alignment pass that aligns clusters of text and audio that audio book module 12 had previously determined as to strongly align during the coarse pass. For portions of electronic text that align well with corresponding portions of the text transcript, audio book module 12 may map key features in those portions of electronic text to the corresponding portions of the text transcript. Audio book module 12 may refrain from mapping to the text transcript key features in portions of electronic text that do not align well with portions of the text transcript.
- audio book module 12 may map the position of the chapters and key features of the electronic text to corresponding positions of the text transcript based on aligning the electronic text with the text transcript. Because the text transcript is a speech-to-text transcript of the audio book, positions in the text transcript may be associated with timestamps of the audio book. In this way, audio book module 12 may map the positions of chapters as well as other extracted key features of the electronic text to corresponding timestamps of the audio book.
- Audio book module 12 may perform further adjusting of such mappings of key features to the audio book via heuristics such as snapping to file boundaries or to detected large silence boundaries. For example, audio book module 12 may determine that a large silence boundary is associated with a chapter boundary, and may align a chapter boundary in the electronic text with the large silence boundary. Audio book module 12 may also determine which key features are not mapped to locations within the audio book, such as when the key features are associated with misaligned or poorly aligned portions of the electronic text. By aligning the electronic text with the text transcript of the audio book, audio book module 12 may determine portions of the audio book that are aligned with portions of the electronic text, and portions of the audio book that are not aligned with portions of the electronic text.
- heuristics such as snapping to file boundaries or to detected large silence boundaries. For example, audio book module 12 may determine that a large silence boundary is associated with a chapter boundary, and may align a chapter boundary in the electronic text with the large silence boundary. Audio book module 12 may also determine which key features are
- Audio book module 12 may determine organizational data associated with the audio book based at least in part on aligning the electronic text with the text transcript of the audio book.
- the organizational data may include linguistic events and silence events, as well as other information such as the textual transcript of what is being spoken in the audio book, the number of works spoken in the audio book, and the like.
- Linguistic events may include key features as discussed above, including chapter boundaries, paragraph boundaries, sentence boundaries, word boundaries, the table of contents, and the like.
- audio book module 12 may determine those linguistic events from the electronic text and their associated locations within the aligned portions of the electronic book, and may map those locations within the electronic book to timestamps within the audio book.
- audio book module 12 may determine those linguistic events from the text transcript of the audio book or from the audio of the audio book.
- audio book module 12 may, based at least in part on analyzing word utterances, common phrases, voice characteristics and the like in the audio of the audio book, determine linguistic events such as an introduction, a change in characters speaking, the beginning or end of a chapter, and the like.
- Silence events may be events associated with silence in the audio of the audio book.
- Audio book module 12 may analyze the audio of the audio book to find gaps in the audio, which may be silences in the audio that may be as short as 50 milliseconds, and may associate the timestamps of those silences with silence events.
- Silence events may denote the nature of the silence, such as sentence-delimiting silence, intra-sentence silence, word-delimiting silence, intra-word silence, paragraph-delimiting silence, chapter-delimiting silence, and the like.
- audio book module 12 may infer the nature of the silence from the electronic text, create silence events in associated locations within the aligned portions of the electronic book, and map those locations within the electronic book to the timestamps of silences detected within the audio book.
- audio book module 12 may infer the nature of the silence from the text transcript of the audio book or from the audio of the audio book, and may create silence events associated with the timestamps of silences within those portions of the audio book.

Upon receiving a request fromcomputing device 2 for an audio book,audio book server 4 may transmit to computingdevice 2 the audio book as well as organizational data associated with the audio book. - Organizational data associated with the audio book may be contextual data associated with the audio book. For example, organizational data may indicate the intended written structure of the spoken words in the audio book, including but not limited to sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and the like. Organizational data may also indicate information associated with particular locations within the audio book. Examples of such information associated with locations within the audio book may include the character that is currently speaking at a particular location in the audio book, a definition of the word being spoken at a particular location in the audio book, and the like. By determining the organizational data associated with the audio book, and by transmitting the organizational data associated with an audio book along with the audio book to
computing device 2,audio book server 4 may enablecomputing device 2 to improve the navigation of the audio book as well as to improve the user experience of interacting withcomputing device 2 to listen to the audio book. - In the example of
FIG. 1 ,audio book server 4 includesaudio book module 12.Audio module 12 may perform operations described herein using software, hardware, firmware, or a mixture of hardware, software, and firmware residing in and/or executing ataudio book server 4.Audio book server 4 may executeaudio book module 4 with multiple processors or multiple devices.Audio book server 4 may executeaudio book module 12 as virtual machines executing on underlying hardware, as one or more services of an operating system or computing platform, and/or as one or more executable programs at an application layer of a computing platform. -
Audio book module 12 may be configured to receive audio books fromaudio book source 6 and to determine organizational data associated with each of the receive audio books. For example,audio book module 12 may maintain a library of available audio books that may be accessed by computingdevice 2, and may update the library of available audio books when ingesting audio books fromaudio book source 6.Audio book module 12 may transmit an indication of the available audio books in its library tocomputing device 2 so thatcomputing device 2 is able to access the audio books in the library. - When
audio book module 12 receives an audio book fromaudio book source 6,audio book module 12 may determine organizational data associated with the audio book. As part of determining the organizational data associated with the audio book,audio book module 12 may perform speech recognition (e.g., speech-to-text conversion) on the speech contents of the audio book to generate a text transcript of the audio book. For example,audio book module 12 may transcode the audio data of the audio book and extract the raw audio of the audio book.Audio book module 12 may perform speech recognition (e.g., speech-to-text) on the extracted raw audio of the audio book to extract a text transcript of the audio book. - In some examples,
audio book module 12 may divide the raw audio into a plurality of portions, such as by cutting the raw audio within inferred silence intervals.Audio book module 12 may perform speech recognition of each of the plurality of portions of the raw audio in parallel (e.g., at about the same time) to generate a plurality of recognized portions of the raw audio.Audio book module 12 may concatenate the plurality of recognized portions of the raw audio into a text transcript of the audio book. - In some examples,
audio book module 12 may use metadata associated with or contained in the audio book in performing speech recognition of the audio book. For example, the audio book may contain or may otherwise be associated with metadata that indicates the language of the speech contents of the audio book.Audio book module 12 may utilize the indication of the language of the speech contents of the audio book to select an appropriate language model to be used in performing speech recognition of the audio book. - In addition to, or as an alternative to performing speech recognition to extract a text transcript of the audio book,
audio book module 12 may determine whether electronic text that corresponds with the audio book is available. An electronic text that corresponds with an audio book may be an eBook, electronic transcript, or other text document in electronic form that contains textual content which corresponds to the spoken content of the audio book. For example, if the audio book is a spoken version of a book, then the electronic text that corresponds with the audio book may be a written version of the same book. In another example, if the audio book is an audio version of the performance of a play, then the electronic text that corresponds with the audio book may be the script of the play. As discussed above, an electronic text that corresponds with the audio book may not necessarily be a word-by-word transcription of the audio book. For example, the electronic text may be a different version of the book, an unabridged version of an abridged audio book, and the like, or the electronic book may include a preface or acknowledgements that are not in the audio book. -
Audio book module 12 may query and/or searchelectronic text source 13 for electronic text that corresponds with the audio book.Audio book module 12 may identify an electronic text that corresponds with the audio book based at least in part on one or more of: metadata, human curation, and/or automated detection. For example, an audio book may include or be associated with metadata that identifies the electronic text that corresponds with the audio book, or an electronic text may include or be associated with metadata that identifies the audio book with which the electronic text corresponds. In another example, a human can identify an electronic text inelectronic text source 13 that corresponds with the audio book. -
Audio book module 12 may also perform automated detection of an electronic text that corresponds with the audio book. In particular,audio book module 12 may perform speech recognition on the audio book to generate a text transcript of the audio book, and may determine an electronic text that most closely matches the text transcript of the audio book out of the electronic texts inelectronic text source 13. In one example,audio book module 12 may compare electronic texts, or selected portions of the electronic texts, word-by-word with the text transcript of the audio book or portions thereof to determine the electronic text that has the closest word-by-word similarity with the text transcript of the audio book out of the electronic texts inelectronic text source 13. In another example,audio book module 12 may perform automated detection of an electronic text that corresponds with the audio book by breaking an electronic text up into shingles and using MinHash to determine an electronic text that is most similar to the text transcript of the audio book. - Upon determining an electronic text that corresponds with the audio book,
audio book module 12 may extract the text from the electronic text, key features of the text, such as words, sentences, chapters, and paragraphs, as well as the position of such key features in the text. For example,audio book module 12 may extract the table of contents of the electronic text and may determine the locations within the electronic text to which the table of contents point, such as the positions in the electronic text of each of the chapters. - The electronic text that corresponds with the audio book may not necessarily be a word-by-word match with the text transcript of the audio book due to many reasons. For example, the electronic text may be a different edition or version of the book than the audio book, or the audio book may contain rhetorical flourishes by the narrator that is not present in the electronic text. Thus, one or more portions of the electronic text may match one or more corresponding portions of the text transcript, while one or more portions of the electronic text may not match one or more corresponding portions of the text transcript.
-
Audio book module 12 may align the electronic text with the text transcript of the audio book to determine one or more portions of the audio book that are aligned with one or more portions of the electronic text. A portion of the electronic text may be aligned with a corresponding portion of the audio book if there is a close match between the portion of the electronic text and the text transcript of the portion of the audio book. Conversely, a portion of the electronic text may not be aligned with a corresponding portion of the audio book if there is not a close match between the portion of the electronic text and the text transcript of the portion of the audio book. - Aligning the electronic text with the text transcript may include determining a correspondence between textual strings (e.g., words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and the like) of the electronic text and the text transcript. By aligning the electronic text with the text transcript,
audio book module 12 may determine a correspondence between locations in the electronic text with locations in the text transcript, so thataudio book module 12 may determine a mapping of locations in the electronic text to locations in the text transcript. Because the text transcript is produced via speech-to-text recognition of the speech contents of the audio book,audio book module 12 may, by aligning the electronic text with the text transcript, determining a mapping of locations in the electronic text to locations (e.g., timestamps) of the audio book. In this way,audio book module 12 may map organizational data such as key features of the electronic text (e.g., words, paragraphs, and chapters) and as other information to specific locations in the audio book. -
Audio book module 12 may align the electronic text with the text transcript via any suitable techniques. In one example,audio book module 12 may first perform a coarse alignment and subsequently may perform a fine alignment. To perform the coarse alignment,audio book module 12 may use Hirschberg's algorithm that finds an optimal sequence alignment between strings.Audio book module 12 may use a customized word-to-word match scoring scheme with Hirschberg's algorithm to produce a globally optimal alignment. In other words,audio book module 12 may determine portions of electronic text that match portions of the text transcript.Audio book module 12 may perform post processing to group nearby alignments into clusters of audio intervals that strongly align, and may fill in alignment gaps by smoothing between known alignment points. - To perform the fine alignment,
audio book module 12 may perform a forced alignment pass that aligns clusters of text and audio thataudio book module 12 had previously determined as to strongly align during the coarse pass. For portions of electronic text that align well with corresponding portions of the text transcript,audio book module 12 may map key features in those portions of electronic text to the corresponding portions of the text transcript.Audio book module 12 may refrain from mapping to the text transcript key features in portions of electronic text that do not align well with portions of the text transcript. - For example, if
audio book module 12 had extracted the table of contents and other key features from the electronic text,audio book module 12 may map the position of the chapters and key features of the electronic text to corresponding positions of the text transcript based on aligning the electronic text with the text transcript. Because the text transcript is a speech-to-text transcript of the audio book, positions in the text transcript may be associated with timestamps of the audio book. In this way,audio book module 12 may map the positions of chapters as well as other extracted key features of the electronic text to corresponding timestamps of the audio book. -
Audio book module 12 may perform further adjusting of such mappings of key features to the audio book via heuristics such as snapping to file boundaries or to detected large silence boundaries. For example,audio book module 12 may determine that a large silence boundary is associated with a chapter boundary, and may align a chapter boundary in the electronic text with the large silence boundary.Audio book module 12 may also determine which key features are not mapped to locations within the audio book, such as when the key features are associated with misaligned or poorly aligned portions of the electronic text. By aligning the electronic text with the text transcript of the audio book,audio book module 12 may determine portions of the audio book that are aligned with portions of the electronic text, and portions of the audio book that are not aligned with portions of the electronic text. -
Audio book module 12 may determine organizational data associated with the audio book based at least in part on aligning the electronic text with the text transcript of the audio book. The organizational data may include linguistic events and silence events, as well as other information such as the textual transcript of what is being spoken in the audio book, the number of works spoken in the audio book, and the like. - Linguistic events may include key features as discussed above, including chapter boundaries, paragraph boundaries, sentence boundaries, word boundaries, the table of contents, and the like. For portions of the audio book that are aligned with portions of the electronic text,
audio book module 12 may determine those linguistic events from the electronic text and their associated locations within the aligned portions of the electronic book, and may map those locations within the electronic book to timestamps within the audio book. For portions of the audio book that are not aligned with portions of the electronic text,audio book module 12 may determine those linguistic events from the text transcript of the audio book or from the audio of the audio book. For example,audio book module 12 may, based at least in part on analyzing word utterances, common phrases, voice characteristics and the like in the audio of the audio book, determine linguistic events such as an introduction, a change in characters speaking, the beginning or end of a chapter, and the like. - Silence events may be events associated with silence in the audio of the audio book.
Audio book module 12 may analyze the audio of the audio book to find gaps in the audio, which may be silences in the audio that may be as short as 50 milliseconds, and may associate the timestamps of those silences with silence events. Silence events may denote the nature of the silence, such as sentence-delimiting silence, intra-sentence silence, word-delimiting silence, intra-word silence, paragraph-delimiting silence, chapter-delimiting silence, and the like. - For portions of the audio book that are aligned with portions of the electronic text,
audio book module 12 may infer the nature of the silence from the electronic text, create silence events in associated locations within the aligned portions of the electronic book, and map those locations within the electronic book to the timestamps of silences detected within the audio book. For portions of the audio book that are not aligned with portions of the electronic text,audio book module 12 may infer the nature of the silence from the text transcript of the audio book or from the audio of the audio book, and may create silence events associated with the timestamps of silences within those portions of the audio book. -

UI module 16 may causeUIC 14 to output, display, or otherwise present a user interface while a user ofcomputing device 2 views output and/or provides input atUIC 14. For example, as shown inFIG. 1 ,UI module 16 may send instructions toUIC 14 that causeUIC 14 to displayuser interface 20, which is a graphical user interface (GUI), at a display screen ofUIC 14. In other examples,UI module 16 may also causeUIC 14 to output a user interface in non-visual form, such as audio output. For example, if computingdevice 2 is an audio player device,UI module 16 may send instructions toUIC 14 that causeUIC 14 to output audio. -
UI module 16 andUIC 14 may receive one or more indications of input (e.g., voice input, touch input, non-touch or presence-sensitive input, video input, audio input, etc.) from a user as the user interacts withuser interface 20, at different times and when the user andcomputing device 2 are at different locations.UI module 16 andUIC 14 may interpret inputs detected atUIC 14 and may relay information about the inputs detected atUIC 14 toaudio book player 18 and/or one or more other associated platforms, operating systems, applications, and/or services executing atcomputing device 2, for example, to causecomputing device 2 to perform functions. -
