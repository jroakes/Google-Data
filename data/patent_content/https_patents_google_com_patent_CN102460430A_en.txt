Abstract
Short POI titles are generated by removing unnecessary administrative area prefixes from existing POI titles and replacing necessary administrative area prefixes with shorter aliases. Administrative area prefixes are identified and analyzed to determine whether they are necessary. The analysis includes determining (1) whether the remainders with the prefixes excluded include a common suffix as a prefix, and (2) whether the remainders are unique in an applicable metropolis area. If a remainder does not include as a prefix a common suffix and is unique in the applicable metropolis area, the corresponding prefix is determined unnecessary and removed from the existing POI title to generate a short POI title. Otherwise, the corresponding prefix is determined necessary and replaced with a shorter alias to generate a short POI title.
Description
Technical field
Present disclosure relates generally to the word processing field that is used for map, and particularly, relates to the geographic position title that shortens on the map.
Background technology
The grade that is in various administrative regions (perhaps unit) not at the same level is divided and is subdivided in geographical and politics zone usually.For example China is divided into province's (perhaps autonomous region, county borough), and each province is subdivided into city (perhaps area under one's jurisdiction), and each city is subdivided into district (perhaps county).
Geographical point of interest or title POI often fall in some administrative regions not at the same level of grade.For example the 5th middle school, Fuzhou City is positioned at China's (national level), Fujian Province (provincial), Fuzhou City (city-level) and Gulou District (district's level).Thereby POI title (perhaps title, mark) often comprises related POI is belonged to the administrative region prefix that a plurality of administrative regions identify.For example the 5th middle school, Fuzhou City can have any title in the following English title: " Fuzhou City, Fujian Province Gulou District the 5th middle school ", " Fujian Province's Gulou District the 5th middle school ", " Fuzhou City's Gulou District the 5th middle school " and " Gulou District the 5th middle school ".The POI title of other language (for example Chinese) often comprises such administrative region prefix similarly.
The administrative region prefix of POI title possibly be unnecessary, and makes title unnecessarily tediously long.For example in the city of Fuzhou City map, the prefix " Fuzhou City, Fujian Province " in title " the 5th middle school, Fuzhou City, Fujian Province " is unnecessary, because the person of checking can infer that school is positioned at Fujian Province and this fact of Fuzhou City by context according to the map.
It briefly is useful keeping the POI title, because tediously long PIO title is difficult to read, and occupies exceptional space on being shown in map the time, reduces the POI number that shows in can the given area on map thus.Because the administrative region prefix causes tediously long POI title, so hope to remove unnecessary administrative region prefix from the POI title.Yet the administrative region prefix is necessary for the appropriate sign POI of lower floor (for example " Peking University ") sometimes.Therefore, the given administrative region prefix that is difficult to determine whether to remove the POI title is to shorten the POI title.
Traditionally, the POI title of shortening is generated by editor person, therefore influenced by mistake.In addition, this mode is expensive and labour-intensive, and is not suitable for extensive POI title generation.
Summary of the invention
The embodiment of present disclosure comprises a kind of method (and corresponding system and computer program) that is used to generate brief POI title.
One embodiment of the present of invention are computer-implemented methods of the short title of a kind of geographical point of interest of generation (POI).The tabulation of POI suffix commonly used is stored, and wherein the POI suffix appears in the title of a plurality of POI.The another name in a plurality of districts of province and incity at storage city, place, city.Identify in a plurality of districts the POI in the district.POI has the title that comprises prefix and suffix.The another name of at least one in the prefix of the title of POI and province, city and the district is mated.Then the remainder (just removing the part of having mated outside the prefix) of title and the tabulation of POI suffix commonly used are compared, to find the coupling suffix.If remainder does not comprise that any suffix of using always in the POI suffix list as prefix, then removes prefix from the title of POI, keep remainder.This part can be included in the demonstration on the map then, perhaps is included in some other expressions (for example, driving guide).
The feature and advantage of in instructions, describing not are exhaustive, and particularly, many technical characterictics and advantage will be clear for those of ordinary skills institute according to accompanying drawing, instructions and claims.Should be noted that in addition mainly and to select used language in the instructions from the purpose of readable and instruction and possibly not be to select these language to be used for describing or to limit disclosed subject content.

The exemplary architecture overview of brief POI title generation module
Fig. 3 is the high level block diagram that illustrates according to the concrete view of the module in the brief POI title generation module 111 of an embodiment.Some embodiment of brief POI title generation module 111 have different with module described herein and/or attached module.Similarly, can be according to other embodiment with mode module between the distributed function different with mode described herein.As shown in the figure, brief POI title generation module 111 comprises that suffix generation module 310 commonly used, administrative region another name generation module 320, POI title shorten module 330 and data storage 340.
The brief POI title generation module 111 employed data of data storage 340 storages.The example of such data comprises information (for example, position, type and existing title) about POI, suffix list 342 commonly used, about the information (for example, official name, another name tabulation 344, boundary information) of administrative region and the brief POI title that has generated.Data storage 340 can be the database of relational database or any other type.
As indicated above, the associating information of each POI and for example position (for example longitude and latitude, address), type (for example government organs, College of Education, retail company etc.), description (for example amenities, grading, comment, price etc.) and so on.The set of POI and related information thereof is stored in the data storage 340 and (for example, is positioned at the POI in an area).
Suffix commonly used is the phrase (perhaps word) that in the POI title, occurs as suffix with upper frequency.For example, phrase " middle school " is a suffix commonly used, because it is used as suffix in the POI title of being everlasting to the middle school.Other examples of suffix commonly used comprise " university ", " people's court ", " government " and " hotel ", and this only is several examples.Owing to suffix commonly used occurs as suffix in a plurality of POI titles, so suffix commonly used possibly be the common phrases that does not identify concrete POI.Therefore, the appropriate POI title that forms can not comprise in title that generally suffix commonly used is as prefix.Thereby, when determining whether appropriately to remove the administrative region prefix, can consider suffix commonly used.For example, if the remainder of removing in POI title outside the prefix of administrative region comprises that suffix commonly used as prefix, then can not remove the administrative region prefix.For example, if remove administrative region prefix " Beijing " from POI title " Peking University's inlet ", then remaining " university's inlet " comprises suffix commonly used " university " as prefix, is not appropriate POI title (and not knowing which university of institute POI refers to).Therefore, should not remove administrative region prefix " Beijing " from the POI title.
Each administrative region has official name.Yet except official name, can also use some " another names " always and refer to the administrative region.For example Xinjiang province is also referred to as Xinjiang and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions.These of administrative region another name commonly used common storage is in the another name tabulation of administrative region.Each administrative region also has the boundary information of its geographic zone of definition.
Suffix generation module 310 commonly used generates the tabulation of suffix commonly used and in data storage 340, deposits this storage and tabulate, and is an example that is used to carry out the means of this function.Suffix generation module 310 commonly used obtains the high-frequency suffix generating suffix commonly used through analyzing existing POI title, and the suffix commonly used that storage is generated in data storage 340.Hereinafter will more specifically be described the process that is used to generate suffix commonly used with reference to Fig. 5.
Administrative region another name generation module 320 generates the administrative region another name of relevant administrative region, and is an example that is used to carry out the means of this function.Depend on how administrative region another name generation module 320 is disposed; Relevant administrative region can be administrative region (for example, all districts, city), POI (the perhaps POI set) place in the given area different stage the administrative region or dynamically confirmed based on context.For example, if the short title of POI in the brief POI title generation module 111 generation Fuzhou Cities, then another name generation module 320 in administrative region can confirm that all districts (Gulou District) are relevant administrative region in Fujian Province (place, Fuzhou City province), Fuzhou City and the Fuzhou City.Administrative region another name generation module 320 can identify relevant administrative region through the position of analysis POI and the border of administrative region.For each relevant administrative region, administrative region another name generation module 320 generates the tabulation of the another name that often is used to refer to the administrative region.Administrative region another name generation module 320 can be through generating the another name of administrative region to the official name application rule of administrative region.Hereinafter will more specifically be described the process that is used to generate the administrative region another name with reference to Fig. 6.
The module 330 that shortens the POI title shortens existing POI title to generate brief POI title and to be an example that is used to carry out the means of this function.Generally speaking, module uses two kinds of different modes to shorten title.A kind of mode is the nonessential part that removes title.Second mode is must partly replace with than short " another name " title.In order to shorten the title of POI, the POI title shortens module 330 and confirms whether POI is positioned at metropolitan area (for example city, county borough), if then identify the metropolitan area that is used for POI.The POI title shortens module 330 can make this definite and sign with the urban border in the zone based on the position of POI.The POI title shortens module 330 and identifies the administrative region prefix in the POI title through coupling POI title with the another name of relevant metropolitan area, and whether definite metropolitan area prefix is that sign POI is necessary.That is to say that the POI title shortens module 330 and confirms whether the remainder of removing outside the prefix of administrative region in the title has identified the POI in the suitable metropolitan area rightly.POI is necessary if the administrative region prefix is sign, and then POI title shortening module 330 replaces with short another name with it.Otherwise POI is necessary if the administrative region prefix is not sign, and then the POI title shortens module 330 it is removed from title.As shown in the figure, the POI title shortens module 330 and comprises administrative region prefix analysis and remove module 332 and administrative region prefix replacement module 334.
Administrative region prefix analysis and remove module 332 whether analyze the POI titles be essential with sign administrative region prefix and definite prefix (perhaps its part), and be an example that is used to carry out the means of this function.Administrative region prefix analysis with remove module 332 and mate through another name to the another name tabulation (promptly being used for the another name tabulation of administrative region, POI place) of POI title and relevant administrative region, come the administrative region prefix in the identification caption.For example, the 5th middle school, Fuzhou City is positioned at Fujian Province's (provincial), Fuzhou City (city-level) and Gulou District (district's level).Administrative region prefix analysis and remove 332 pairs of modules and represent title and the another name in Fujian Province, the another name of Fuzhou City and the another name of Gulou District of the POI of school to mate.If another name (perhaps another name combination) is complementary with the prefix of POI title, then this coupling prefix is the administrative region prefix.Administrative region prefix analysis and remove module 332 is following confirms whether the prefixs of sign are essential: (1) is confirmed to remove in the title institute and identify remainder outside the prefix and whether comprise suffix in the suffix list commonly used of storage in the data storage 340 as prefix, and (2) confirm whether remainder is the interior unique brief POI title of suitable metropolitan area.If prefix commonly used is complementary with remainder as the prefix part of remainder; If perhaps remainder is not the unique brief POI title that is suitable in the metropolitan area, then administrative region prefix analysis and remove module 332 and confirm that the prefixs of sign are essential.Otherwise, be the unique brief POI title that is suitable in the metropolitan area if remainder does not comprise any suffix commonly used as prefix and remainder, then administrative region prefix analysis and remove module 332 and confirm that the prefixs of sign are nonessential.If it is nonessential confirming prefix, then administrative region prefix analysis and remove module 332 and remove this nonessential administrative region prefix from the POI title is to generate brief POI title.Hereinafter is more specifically described administrative region prefix analysis with reference to Fig. 7, Fig. 8 A-Fig. 8 B and is removed the operation of module 332.
Yet if administrative region prefix analysis and remove module 332 and confirm that the prefixs that identified are essential, administrative region prefix replacement module 334 generates brief POI title through the administrative region prefix being replaced with short another name.Prefix replacement module 334 in administrative region selects to be used for the short another name of this prefix from the another name tabulation of corresponding administrative region, and the administrative region prefix is replaced with this short another name to generate brief POI title.
Be used to generate the overview of the method for brief POI title
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram that brief POI title generation module 111 generates the method 400 of brief POI title that is used for that illustrates according to an embodiment.Other embodiment are according to the step of different order manner of execution 400.In addition, other embodiment comprise the step different and/or additional with step described herein.Brief POI title generation module 111 can be simultaneously and/or a plurality of instances of the step of executed in parallel method 400.
At first, brief POI title generation module 111 generates (410) POI suffix commonly used, and these suffix are stored in the suffix list commonly used in the data storage 340.Hereinafter is more specifically described the process that is used to generate POI suffix commonly used with reference to Fig. 5.
Brief POI title generation module 111 generates the administrative region another name tabulation that (420) are used for administrative region, specific POI place, and it is stored in the data storage 340.Hereinafter is more specifically described the process that is used to generate the administrative region another name tabulation that is used for the administrative region with reference to Fig. 6.
Brief POI title generation module 111 generates (430) brief POI title through the existing title that shortens specific POI.The relatively more existing title of brief POI title generation module 111 and with based on the position of POI and definite pairing another name tabulation in the administrative region to this POI.Be complementary as prefix and title if another name is perhaps called combination, then brief POI title generation module 111 is through relatively the remainder (just removing the part outside the prefix in the title) and the suffix list commonly used searching coupling of title confirm whether prefix (perhaps its part) is essential.If suffix commonly used is as prefix and remainder does not all match and remainder is the unique shortening POI title in the suitable metropolitan area, confirm that then prefix is optional.Brief POI title generation module 111 removes nonessential prefix (perhaps part) and must prefix (perhaps part) replace with short another name.Hereinafter is more specifically described the process that is used to shorten existing title with reference to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 A-figure B.
After generating (430) brief POI title, server 110 can be stored in it in the data storage 340 and makes it can supply follow-up use (for example will be embedded in the map).
Suffix commonly used generates
Fig. 5 illustrates to be used for the process flow diagram that brief POI title generation module 111 generates an embodiment of the method 500 of using suffix list always.As preceding text were discussed with reference to Fig. 3, the POI of similar type used similar suffix (for example " university ", " people's court ", " government ", " hotel ").These suffix itself only describe the POI type, but be enough to identify specific POI.Thereby they can be used for identifying administrative region prefix essential in the POI title.
Thereby in order to generate suffix list, brief POI title generation module 111 is fetched the set of (510) existing POI title.This set can be the title of all known POI or POI subclass (the POI set in for example sampling set, the geographic zone).Typical case's set will have about 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 POI title.
Brief POI title generation module 111 is through handling the tabulation of the unique tail string of the incompatible compiling of title set (520).Brief POI title generation module 111 is created unique tail tandem table of POI title, and the instance number of each unique tail string in the tabulation is counted.Particularly, whether the brief POI title generation module 111 tail string handling each POI title and confirm it is in tabulation.If not, then brief POI title generation module 111 adds the tail string and is directed against it since 1 counting to suffix list.If in tabulation, comprised the tail string, then brief POI title generation module 111 increases progressively the counting that is used for this tail string.Repeat this process until handling all POI titles.Unique tail tandem table that the POI head stack will be arranged when finishing.
Brief POI title generation module 111 sign (530) high-frequency tail strings are as suffix commonly used.Brief POI title generation module 111 can be according to frequency to the tail string sorting, and the tail string that sign (530) frequency is higher than threshold value (for example, threshold count, threshold percentage, threshold criteria mark) is as suffix commonly used.According to 5,000,000 to 10,000, typical case's set of the suffix commonly used of 000 POI title generation comprises approximate 1,200 suffix commonly used.
Brief POI title generation module 111 is stored gained suffix list commonly used in data storage 340.The system manager then can look back suffix list if desired.
In addition, brief POI title generation module 111 can also generate and safeguard a plurality of suffix list commonly used.Can separate a plurality of tabulations according to country, area or other standards.For example, brief POI title generation module 111 can compile the suffix list that is used for all POI in the People's Republic of China (PRC).Alternatively or additionally, suffix generation module 310 commonly used can also compile the independent tabulation that is used for domestic each concrete administrative region (for example economizing).
The administrative region another name generates
Fig. 6 illustrates to be used for brief POI title generation module 111 generates an embodiment of the method 600 of calling tabulation for the administrative region relevant with POI process flow diagram.As preceding text were discussed with reference to Fig. 3, POI was usually located in a plurality of administrative regions that in administrative hierarchy, are in different stage.Each administrative region in these administrative regions can have some another names.
Brief POI title generation module 111 signs (610) and POI are (promptly; Brief POI title generation module 111 is handled to generate the POI of short title to it) relevant administrative region, and (for example from data storage 340) fetched the official name of the administrative region that (620) identified.Brief POI title generation module 111 can identify (610) administrative region based on the position of POI and the border of administrative region.
For the administrative region of each sign, brief POI title generation module 111 is applicable to that through application the regular collection of administrative region generates the tabulation of (630) another name.Two rule-likes are arranged in set, that is, append rule and exception rule.Append the official name of rule and append phrase to generate another name to other administrative region of a specific order.The example of appending rule comprises that the official name to provincial geographic area appends province's rule of word " province "; Append city's rule of word " city " to the official name of city-level geographic area; And it is regular to append the district of word " district " to the official name of district level geographic area, and this only is several examples.Exception rule is to be only applicable to concrete Administrative zones and the rule that can not be applied to other administrative regions at the same level.For example, exception rule is only applicable to Xinjiang province administrative region and appends phrase " autonomous region of Uygur " to its official name.Hereinafter is enumerated some example rules that module 110 usefulness generate the another name that is used for the administrative region.
(1) official name that comprises the administrative region is as another name.
(2) remove the official name of any ethnic group in 55 ethnic groups that comprises in official name/another name.For example, through application rule (2), the another name that is used for title " Beichuanqiangzu Autonomous County " is " Beichuan autonomous county ".
(3) if comprising official name and (2) of 55 any ethnic groups in the ethnic group, official name/another name (1) (for example do not comprise " autonomy "; Autonomous county), the official name that then inserts each ethnic group in 55 ethnic groups in " autonomy " front is used for the another name of each ethnic group of 55 ethnic groups with establishment.For example through application rule (3), one of 55 another names that generate for title " Beichuan autonomous county " are " Beichuanqiangzu Autonomous County ".(4) gather (" province ", " city ", " county ", " autonomy ", " state ", " autonomous prefecture ", " autonomous county ", " district ") if exist then remove suffix from official name/another name.For example through application rule (4), the another name that is used for title " Beichuan autonomous county " is " Beichuan ".
(5) if official name/other places do not comprise any suffix in the suffix set of enumerating in the rule (4), each suffix that then adds in the set is called set to generate.For example through application rule (5), one of another name that generates for title " Beichuan " is " a Beichuan autonomous county ".
(6) if official name/another name comprises " autonomous prefecture " perhaps " autonomous county ", then only remove " autonomy " from title.For example through application rule (6), the another name that is used for title " Beichuan autonomous county " is " Beichuan county ".
(7) remove repeat the another name.
Brief POI title generation module 111 also generates (640) another name Assembly Listing (being also referred to as the combination another name).Particularly, brief POI title generation module 111 generates following two another name Assembly Listings: " province-city " another name Assembly Listing and " city-district " another name Assembly Listing.With urban district another name Assembly Listing is example, and brief POI title generation module 111 each another name through making up relevant city generates (640) Assembly Listing with each another name of relevant area.Brief POI title generation module 111 is through being cascaded into the combination that single combination string generates (640) two another names with two another names.Two another names are separated by space symbol in the combination string.
For example, suppose that city's another name tabulation comprises two another names (" Beijing ", " Beijing ") and distinguishes list of file names and comprise two another names (" Haidian District " and " Haidian ").The Assembly Listing that generates comprises four combinations (" Haidian District, Beijing City ", " Haidian District Beijing ", " Haidian, Beijing " and " Haidian, Beijing ").
Brief POI title generation module 111 is stored another name tabulation and the Assembly Listing that generates in data storage 340.In one embodiment, the tabulation of the another name of administrative region is related with the administrative region in data storage 340.
Brief POI title generation module 111 generates the another name tabulation in advance.For example, brief POI title generation module 111 can generate nationwide provincial another name tabulation to all provinces of particular country (the for example People's Republic of China (PRC)), to each inside the province all cities the tabulation of city-level another name and to district's rank list of file names in each all district, city.The pass that can be based between the corresponding administrative region ties up to these tabulations of arrangement in the hierarchical tree.Subsequently, brief POI title generation module 111 can be fetched corresponding lists from tree as required.
Brief POI title generates
Fig. 7 illustrates to be used for brief POI title generation module 111 generates the method 700 of brief POI title according to existing POI title the process flow diagram of an embodiment.That kind as discussed above, POI title often comprise that a plurality of administrative regions name is referred to as prefix.For example POI title " Fuzhou City's Gulou District the 5th middle school " comprises that following two administrative region names are referred to as prefix: " Fuzhou City " and " Gulou District ".In order to consider the common combinations of the administrative region in the POI prefix, brief POI title generation module 111 is checked four situations (only difference name, " city-district successively " combination, only city's another name and " province-city " combination) and use two rules as will be detailed later (single prefix rule, two prefix regular) to check the administrative region prefix that often is present in the given POI title.
Brief POI title generation module 111 is fetched each existing POI title of POI from data storage 340.Brief POI title generation module 111 is used (710) single prefix rule with the another name in the another name tabulation of test zone to existing POI title earlier.Hereinafter specifically describes single prefix rule with reference to Fig. 8 A.Single prefix rule attempts shortening the POI title as follows: confirm whether the POI title comprises single administrative region another name as prefix, and if confirm then whether prefix is essential.
Brief POI title generation module 111 then to step 710 gained the POI title use (720) two prefixs rules, with the combination of the another name in the another name in the another name tabulation of inspection city and the difference list of file names.Hereinafter specifically describes two prefix rules with reference to Fig. 8 B.Two prefix rules attempt shortening the POI title like this: confirm whether the POI title comprises the combination of calling the administrative region as prefix, and if confirm whether prefix is essential.
Brief POI title generation module 111 then to step 720 gained the POI title use (730) single prefix rule with the another name in the another name tabulation of inspection city, use the combination of the another name of (740) two prefix rules in tabulating with the another name in the another name tabulation of inspection province and city's another name then to the POI of step 730 gained title.
As hereinafter with reference to Fig. 8 A and 8B specifically described; In each step of method 700; Single through using/two prefix rules; Brief POI title generation module 111 confirms whether (1) corresponding administrative region prefix is present in the POI title, and (2) are if confirm whether prefix (perhaps its part) is essential.If prefix (perhaps its part) is essential, then brief POI title generation module 111 is attempted prefix (perhaps part) is replaced with short another name; If prefix is nonessential, then brief POI title generation module 111 removes prefix (perhaps its part) and generates brief POI title thus from the POI title.Single prefix rule
Fig. 8 A illustrates according to the brief POI title generation module 111 that is used for of an embodiment to use the process flow diagram that single prefix rule shortens the method 800 of POI title.As indicated above, brief POI title generation module 111111 is used single prefix rule to following two situations: the situation that the situation of only difference name and city only call.Hereinafter specifically describes as is applied to only distinguish single prefix rule of the situation of name.Single prefix rule application is similar in the situation of city's another name only.
Brief POI title generation module 111 identifies the relevant area of (810) specific POI like preceding text as described in Fig. 6, and generates (815) difference list of file names.The difference list of file names can generate in advance and be stored in the data storage 340, and when needing subsequently, is fetched.Brief POI title generation module 111 matees POI title and the difference name in the difference list of file names, and confirms whether (820) any another name is present in the POI title as prefix.Brief POI title generation module 111 can sort (the longest another name is first another name) to the another name in the difference list of file names according to length, and matees another name and POI title according to the order of ordering.If brief POI title generation module 111 is confirmed the another name in the tabulation of (820) another name and all is not present in the POI title as prefix that then brief POI title generation module 111 is accomplished to current situation and used single prefix rule.
Otherwise; If brief POI title generation module 111 is confirmed (820) difference name and is present in the POI title as prefix whether the remainder that then brief POI title generation module 111 is confirmed to remove in (825) POI titles outside the prefix comprises that suffix commonly used is as prefix." remainder " of POI title is that part of mating prefix that do not comprise of title.
In other words, brief POI title generation module 111 is confirmed whether one of suffix commonly used come across in the remainder of title and is served as prefix.For example, removing prefix " Beijing " afterwards, the prefix that suffix " university " commonly used has served as remainder " university's inlet " from POI title " Peking University's inlet ".
Brief POI title generation module 111 is made definite (825) through the suffix commonly used in remainder and the suffix list commonly used is compared.
If remainder comprises suffix commonly used as prefix, then brief POI title generation module 111 will mate prefix replacement (840) and be short another name.
If suffix commonly used does not all come across in the remainder as prefix, then brief POI title generation module 111 confirms that (825) remainder does not comprise that suffix commonly used is as prefix.
Under this situation, module 111 confirms whether (830) remainder is the unique shortening POI title (if POI is arranged in metropolitan area) that is suitable in the metropolitan area.Brief POI title generation module 111 is made judgement (830) through search remainder in the existing POI title of all POI in being suitable for metropolitan area and the shortest difference name (that is, in corresponding another name tabulation).Hit (the POI title of processing) if only there is one, then brief POI title generation module 111 confirms that (830) remainder is to be unique, otherwise is not unique.
If confirm that (830) remainder is unique in the metropolitan area of POI, then brief POI title generation module 111 confirms that district's prefix is nonessential.Therefore this is because remainder has identified POI uniquely, distinguishes prefix further not identify POI.Under this situation, module 111 removes (835) coupling prefix from the POI title.
On the other hand, if confirm that (830) remainder is not unique, then prefix still can be used for identifying POI.Under this situation, brief POI title generation module 111 will mate prefix replacement (840) and be short another name.
In one embodiment, if POI does not belong to metropolitan area (for example mating the another name that prefix is not the district of metropolitan area), then just remove (835) and/or replacement (840) coupling prefix so that read.In addition, when replacement (840) coupling prefix, brief POI title generation module 111 can keep word " district " and not keep " county " in prefix.In addition, when using single prefix rule to the situation of the another name of city only, if brief POI title generation module 111 can be arranged to prefix matching in the shortest city another name then remove the coupling prefix.
Two prefix rules
Fig. 8 B illustrates according to the brief POI title generation module 111 that is used for of an embodiment to use the process flow diagram that two prefix rules shorten the method 850 of POI title.As indicated above, brief POI title generation module 111 is used two prefix rules to following two situations: " city-district " combination and " province-city " combination.Hereinafter specifically describes as is applied to two prefix rules of " city-district " situation.Two prefix rule application in " province-city " and the combination situation similar.
Brief POI title generation module 111 identifies relevant city and the district of (860) specific POI like preceding text as described in Fig. 6, and generates (865) Assembly Listing.Assembly Listing can generate in advance and be stored in the data storage 340, and when needing subsequently, is fetched.Combination string in brief 111 pairs of POI titles of POI title generation module and the Assembly Listing matees, and confirms whether (870) any combination string is present in the POI title as prefix.Brief POI title generation module 111 can be according to length to combination string sorting (the longest combination string be the first combination string), and according to the order coupling combination string of ordering.If the combination string all is not present in the POI title as prefix, then brief POI title generation module 111 is accomplished to current situation and is used two prefix rules.
Otherwise string is the prefix of POI title if brief POI title generation module 111 is confirmed (870) combination, and whether the remainder that then brief POI title generation module 111 is confirmed to remove in (875) POI title outside this prefix comprises that suffix commonly used is as prefix.Brief POI title generation module 111 is made these definite (875) through the suffix commonly used in remainder and the suffix list commonly used is compared.If suffix commonly used all not as prefix matching in remainder; Then brief POI title generation module 111 confirms that (875) remainder does not comprise suffix commonly used as prefix, and confirms whether (880) remainder is the unique shortening POI title (if POI is arranged in metropolitan area) that is suitable in the metropolitan area.Brief POI title generation module 111 is made definite (880) through search remainder and the shortest city another name (for example " Beijing ") in the existing POI title of all POI in being suitable for metropolitan area.Hit (the POI title of processing) if only there is one, then brief POI title generation module 111 confirms that (880) remainder is unique, otherwise is not unique.
If confirm that (880) remainder is unique in the metropolitan area of POI, then brief POI title generation module 111 confirms that " city-district " combination prefix is nonessential, and removes (885) this combination prefix from the POI title.On the other hand; Comprise that suffix commonly used is as prefix if confirm (875) remainder; If confirm that perhaps (880) remainder is not unique; Then brief POI title generation module 111 removes first administrative region another name (890) coupling prefix from the POI title, and (for the urban district situation is city's another name; Call for economizing for provinces and cities' situation), and second administrative region another name (is city's another name for the difference name for provinces and cities' situation for the urban district situation) that will mate in the prefix is replaced (895) for lacking (for example the shortest) another name.
In one embodiment, be that short another name is so that read just if POI does not belong to metropolitan area (for example another name is not the another name in the district of metropolitan area) with second administrative region another name replacement (895).
Example
Fig. 9 A comprises that like following table these tables illustrate two examples according to existing POI title with the corresponding brief POI title of brief POI title generation module 111 generations of an embodiment.As shown in the figure, two existing POI titles are " Beijing City Haidian District Shuangyushu Elementary School (Haidian District, Beijing City Shuangyushu primary school) " and " Beijing University (Peking University) ".The suffix list commonly used 940 that generates comprises following suffix: " (University) university ", " Middle School (middle school) " and " Elementary School (primary school) ".The city-level another name tabulation 920 that generates comprises following another name: " Beijing City (Beijing) " and " Beijing (Beijing) ".The district's rank list of file names 930 that generates comprises following another name: " Haidian District (Haidian District) " and " Haidian (Haidian) "." city-district " Assembly Listing that generates comprises following combination string: " Beijing City Haidian District (Haidian District, Beijing City) ", " Beijing Haidian District (Haidian District Beijing) ", " Beijing City Haidian (Haidian, Beijing) " and " Beijing Haidian (Haidian, Beijing) ".
Brief POI title generation module 111 is used (710) single prefix rule to POI title " Beijing City Haidian District Shuangyushu Elementary School "; And do not navigate to the coupling suffix, because prefix " Beijing City " is not the difference name.Brief POI title generation module 111 is used (720) two prefix rules and confirm that (1) title comprises prefix " Beijing City Haidian District ", (2) remainder " Shuangyushu Elementary School " is variable is unique as prefix and (3) remainder with suffix in suitable metropolitan area (Beijing) to the POI title.Thereby two prefix rules are output as brief POI title " Shuangyushu Elementary School ".Brief POI title generation module 111 is used (730 and 740) list/two prefix rules and no-fix arrives and matees prefix.Therefore brief POI title generation module 111 comes correctly to generate brief POI title " Shuangyushu Elementary School " through removing nonessential administrative region prefix from existing title " Beijing City Haidian District Shuangyushu Elementary School ".
Brief POI title generation module 111 to POI title " Beijing University " use (710) single prefix rule and no-fix to the coupling prefix, because prefix " Beijing " is not the difference name.Brief POI title generation module 111 to the POI title use (720) two prefix rules and no-fix to the coupling prefix, because the POI title comprises district's level another name.Brief POI title generation module 111 is used (730) single prefix rule and confirms to comprise coupling prefix (Beijing), (2) remainder " University " by (1) title that to have suffix commonly used " University " be not unique as prefix and (3) remainder in suitable metropolitan area (Beijing) to the POI title.Brief POI title generation module 111 attempts shortening prefix " Beijing " failure, because it does not have short another name.Thereby single prefix rule is output as former POI title " Beijing University ".Brief POI title generation module 111 use (740) two prefix rules and no-fix to the coupling prefix.Therefore, through confirming that prefix " Beijing " can not be removed or replace, brief POI title generation module 111 has correctly generated POI title " Beijing University ".
Fig. 9 B comprises that corresponding Chinese POI title, suffix list commonly used, another name/Assembly Listing can be used for appropriately generating the brief POI title of other language (for example, Chinese) with the diagram present disclosure.
