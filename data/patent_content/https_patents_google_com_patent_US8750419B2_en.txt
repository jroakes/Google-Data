Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems, and in particular, to a method and apparatus for providing codebook-based feedback in a closed loop wireless communication system.
- Wireless communication system transmission methods have evolved to include multiple transmit antennas and multiple receive antennas in order to greatly increase the link capacity of wireless communication systems and/or to better focus the transmitted energy at the receiver for greater efficiency and less interference.
- An antenna array is a group of spaced apart antenna elements that each transmits an antenna signal that has a specific gain and phase relationship with the other antenna signals. When the antenna elements work together transmitting the antenna signals, they produce an antenna pattern that is more focused on the receiver than a pattern produced by a single antenna element.
- the process of changing the gain and phase of a signal to produce antenna signals may be referred to as “weighting” the signal using a set of “antenna array weights.” Because antenna arrays may similarly be used at a receiver to improve signal quality, use of antenna arrays at both the transmitter and receiver has been proposed. When multiple antenna elements are used at each of the transmitter and receiver, the wireless channel between them may be referred to as a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) channel. Determining how to feed signals to the multiple transmit antenna elements and receive signals from the multiple receive antenna elements becomes quite complicated.
- MIMO multiple-input, multiple-output
- TDD Time Division Duplexing
- FDD Frequency Division Duplexing
- Limited feedback methods such as fixed beam selection or codebook-based beamforming weight selection, can reduce the amount of feedback as opposed to full channel feedback, which would require a significant amount channel resources thereby reducing the link capacity.
- Codebook-based beamforming weight selection involves selection, by a base station based on feedback from a mobile station, of a set of pre-coding matrices, that is, predetermined beamforming weights that are agreed upon between a transmitter and receiver.
- the weights are selected from a set, or codebook, of predetermined and agreed upon matrices of beamforming weights.
- Each matrix in the codebook can be identified by an index, and a mobile station identifies the weights to be applied by feeding back an index to a matrix and rank of the matrix. In this way, only an index and a rank need be used in feedback to the transmitter in order for the transmitter to know the proper weights to use.
- a base station conveys a midamble, that is, a predetermined signal, to a mobile station (MS).
- the midamble is not weighted, that is, no beamforming weights are applied to the midamble prior to transmission to the MS.
- the MS Based on the received midamble, the MS computes a channel response for the air interface between the mobile station and the base station and, based on the channel response, determines a matrix and rank of weights for application to downlink transmissions.
- existing codebooks are quite complex, with weights for each index comprising a matrix of a rank of up to the number of antenna elements (the rank means the number of data streams that are to be transmitted).

- BS 302 and MS 330 communicate via an air interface 320 that includes a downlink comprising multiple downlink traffic and downlink control channels and an uplink comprising multiple uplink traffic and uplink control channels.
- BS 302 transmits a measurement signal, that is, a midamble comprising precoded pilot signals, to MS 330 via multiple antennas 308 , 310 and a downlink channel 322 of air interface 320 .
- channel estimator 332 of MS 330 estimates the composite downlink channel 322 , that is, determines a frequency response H corresponding to the channel, and uses H to select a matrix from codebook 334 , that is, to select one of matrices W 1 , W 2 , . . . , W N included in the codebook.

- base station 302 also may be referred to herein as “the transmitter” and MS 330 also may be referred to herein as “the receiver” unless specifically mentioned otherwise.
- Base station 302 comprises a multiple-stream, multiple-antenna closed-loop transceiver that receives user data 402 and transmits the processed user data using an antenna array 432 that comprises the multiple antenna elements 308 , 310 .
- User data 402 enters a data splitter 404 , which separates the user data stream into a plurality of data streams, such as data stream 406 and data stream 408 . While two data streams are shown in FIG. 4 , data splitter 404 may produce any number of data streams. Data splitter 404 splits data 402 in proportion to a control signal 442 , which is produced by a controller 440 . For example, control signal 442 may specify a ratio of 2-to-1, wherein two bits are sent to data stream 406 and one bit is sent to data stream 408 . This splitting ratio may specify an equal number of bits on both streams, or all data bits may be sent to one stream.
- Data streams 406 and 408 output by data splitter 404 are input into multiple forward error correction encoders (FEC) 410 and 412 .
- FEC forward error correction encoders
- These error correction encoders may be implemented with a convolutional encoder, a turbo encoder, a block encoder, or the like.

- MQAM M-ary quadrature amplitude modulators
- Controller 440 further produces a control signal 446 that is used to select a type of modulation used in modulators 414 and 416 .
- the modulation schemes in the data streams may be the same, or different.
- the output of modulators 414 and 416 are coupled to inputs of optional spreaders 420 and 422 , respectively.
- Spreaders 420 and 422 each spreads the signal using a spreading code 418 , such as a Walsh code, that is assigned to user data 402 .
- Outputs of optional spreaders 420 and 422 are coupled to inputs of a power allocator 424 .
- Power allocator 424 sets a power ratio between data streams 406 and 408 in response to a control signal 448 from controller 440 .
- Power allocator 424 may allocate all power to one data stream, equal powers on data streams, or other ratios of unequal power allocations.
- Outputs of power allocator 424 are coupled to inputs of antenna array signal processor 426 , which further processes the data streams by applying antenna array weight sets to each data stream.
- These antenna array weight sets come from controller 440 via a control signal 450 .
- antenna array signal processor 426 enables the transmission of each data stream with a different antenna array beamforming pattern.
- the outputs of antenna array signal processor 426 include weighted components of the input data streams.
- output 428 may include a phase-and-gain weighted portion of data stream 406 added together with a phase-and-gain weighted portion of data stream 408 .
- the number of weighted outputs 428 , 430 from antenna array signal processor 426 is equal to the number of transmit antennas 308 , 310 . While the number of outputs of antenna array signal processor 426 may be greater than the number of data streams input, the number of data streams transmitted remains the same.
- FIG. 5 there is depicted a block diagram of antenna array signal processor 426 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- data streams 406 and 408 enter antenna array signal processor 426 , wherein a copy of each data stream is sent to a gain multiplier corresponding to an antenna element that will be used in an antenna array.
- a gain multiplier corresponding to an antenna element that will be used in an antenna array.
- two antennas will be used in the antenna array, therefore copies of each data stream are sent to two gain multipliers 502 .
- a phase shifter 508 Following each gain multiplier 502 is a phase shifter 508 , which rotates the phase of the signal according to the control signal 450 received from controller 440 .
- Outputs of phase shifters 508 are coupled to summers 510 , which add the weighted data streams to produce output signals 428 and 430 .
- Output signals 428 and 430 then may be up-converted, amplified, and coupled to the corresponding antenna elements 308 , 310 .
- Control signal 450 includes multiple antenna array weight sets, wherein one antenna array weight set is associated with each data stream.
- control signal 450 includes weight set signals 504 and 506 .

- gain multipliers 502 associated with a data stream may have different gain values and phase shifters 508 associated with a data stream may have different phase shift values, whereby producing antenna signals that work together to form a particular transmission pattern.
- Controller 440 outputs control signals 442 , 444 , 446 , 448 , and 450 based upon information received from a feedback receiver 434 and data stored in a memory 460 .
- Feedback receiver 434 is shown coupled to a separate antenna for receiving feedback data from a remote receiver, such as MS 330 ; however, one of ordinary skill in the art realizes that one of the antenna elements of antenna array 432 may be used to receive the feedback data.
- Feedback data from feedback receiver 434 includes a codebook index and may further include a rank index, as described below, which are used by controller 440 to lookup transmission weightings in codebook 306 pre-stored within memory 460 .
- Controller 440 also may be used to calculate, or derive, additional control signals or transmission parameters based upon feedback data. Therefore, it should be understood that feedback data may include measurements upon which calculations may be based, or data that indicates parameters to be used by base station 302 .
- MS 330 comprises a multiple-stream, multiple-antenna transceiver that includes an antenna array 602 having multiple antenna elements 336 , 338 that receive radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted by base station 302 .
- the received RF signals are most likely different signals because antenna elements 336 , 338 are spaced apart, and propagation paths taken by received RF signals from antenna elements 308 , 310 of base station 302 are most likely different in a multi-path fading environment.
- multiple data streams are transmitted to increase the data throughput between the base station and MS.
- Base station 302 is able to simultaneously transmit multiple data streams, and MS 330 is able to keep the multiple streams separate by exploiting the differences in the channel characteristics between the multiple antennas at the base station and MS.
- user data 402 in base station 302 is received by MS 330 and output as estimated user data 640 .
- the received RF signals are input into an RF receiver front end 604 , wherein the RF signals are down converted and digitized.
- the output of RF receiver front end 604 is a stream of complex baseband digital samples that represent the received RF signals.
- receiver signal processor 606 may be implemented by multiplying the input signals by the complex conjugate transpose of a unitary matrix T, which is the left singular vectors of the singular value decomposition of the composite channel matrix H.
- receiver signal processor 606 may be implemented by multiplying the input signals by the pseudo-inverse of the product of the composite channel matrix H with the matrix V.
- receiver signal processor 606 may be implemented by multiplying the input signals by MMSE combining weights calculated from the product of the composite channel matrix H with the matrix V.
- Receiver signal processor 606 is controlled by a control signal 622 from a controller 620 .
- the data streams output by receiver signal processor 606 are input to optional despreaders 610 and 612 , which despread the signals using the same spreading code 608 used in base station 302 .
- the outputs of despreaders 610 and 612 are coupled, respectively, to the inputs of demodulator and decoders 614 and 616 .
- Each demodulator and decoder 614 and 616 demodulates the signal and decodes the signal using demodulation and error correction decoding techniques that correspond to those selected for each data stream in the transmitter.
- the outputs from demodulator and decoders 614 and 616 are input into a combiner 618 , which combines the multiple streams received back into a single stream for output as estimated user data 640 .
- Combiner 618 operates under the control of controller 620 , as directed by control signal 626 . Because the received data streams may have different data rates, and because one data stream may have a data rate equal to zero, combiner 618 must reconstruct the user data in accordance with the way data was originally split by data splitter 404 in base station 302 .
- MS 330 In order to control the transmission of multiple data streams via multiple antennas at base station 302 , MS 330 must measure the composite channel and send feedback data to the base station. As shown, outputs of radio frequency front end 604 are also coupled to composite channel estimator 332 , which uses the pilot signals transmitted from each antenna element 310 , 312 in base station 302 to measure the composite channel between the multiple transmit antenna elements and the multiple receive antenna elements. In practice, MS 330 receives the downlink pilot signals and measures the downlink channel estimates from each of the base station's (transmit) antenna elements to each of the (receive) antenna elements 336 , 338 of the MS.
- composite channel estimator 332 which is represented by the H matrix, is input into signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computer and power allocator 630 and feedback transmitter 634 .
- SNR computer and power allocator 630 computes an SNR for each data stream hypothetically transmitted. Based upon the SNR computations, the power allocation function of block 630 allocates power to each data stream. Once power has been allocated to each data stream, final SNR calculations may be performed using the selected power allocation.
- a modulator and coder 632 receives information from SNR computer and power allocator 630 and uses the information to select an encoding scheme and a modulation scheme to be used in base station 302 .
- higher order modulators are selected for data streams having high signal-to-noise ratios.
- Feedback transmitter 634 receives information from composite channel estimator 332 , SNR computer and power allocator 632 , and modulator and coder selector 630 . This information represents calculations and selections made in MS 330 that will be used to control the transmission modes of base station 302 .
- feedback transmitter 634 analyzes the data and selects a codebook value (index and rank) and associated transmitter parameters that most closely match the transmitter parameters represented by the input data. Therefore, feedback transmitter 634 includes, or is coupled to, a memory that stores a codebook 334 for producing a codebook index that is transmitted to base station 302 via one or more transmit antennas.
- the transmit antenna is shown separate from receive antenna array 602 , the transmit antenna may be one of the antenna elements 308 , 310 in antenna array 602 . Data transmitted by feedback transmitter 634 is received in base station 302 by feedback receiver 434 .
- codebook-based feedback of channel information enables linear pre-coding (including beamforming) in MIMO systems, in a TDD or a FDD scenario.
- Base station 302 as well as MS 330 have prior knowledge of a fixed, predetermined set of pre-coding matrices, that is, a codebook.
- Base station 302 transmits a known signal precoded with a precoding matrix, that is, a midamble comprising precoded pilot signals, to MS 330 .
- MS 330 estimates the downlink channel 322 and, based on the estimate, selects a particular codebook entry, that is, a codebook matrix and rank.
- the present invention provides for a pre-coding of the pilot signal that is received by, and measured by, MS 330 and used by the MS to select the codebook entry that is fed back to base station 302 . Further, the pre-coding of the pilot signal is such that MS 330 does not need to be informed, in advance of receiving the midamble, of the particular matrix that is used to pre-code of the midamble in order for the pre-coding to be useful to the MS.
- Logic flow diagram 700 begins ( 702 ) when base station 302 generates ( 704 ) a predetermined codeword, preferably a pilot pattern, that is, a predetermined pattern of bits that is known to both the base station and MS 330 and that is used for channel estimation.
- a pilot pattern is used as a training sequence for channel estimation, power measurements, and/or synchronization.
- Base station 302 applies the pilot pattern to splitter 404 to produce ( 706 ) multiple parallel pilot patterns and proceeds to process the pilot patterns in accordance with known techniques, as described above with respect to FIG.
- Antenna array signal processor 426 then pre-codes ( 710 ) the multiple pilot patterns by applying antenna array weight sets to each pilot pattern of the multiple pilot patterns to produce a pre-coded pilot signal comprising multiple parallel, pre-coded multiple pilot patterns.
- antenna array weight sets come from controller 440 via a control signal 450 ; however, unlike transmitted user data where the weight sets are selected based on feedback from the MS, controller 440 may select ( 708 ) a unitary matrix for weighting, or pre-coding, of the pilot signal without the use of feedback from the MS. Any unitary matrix may be used; the unitary matrix may or may not be contained in the codebooks 306 , 334 and base station 302 may arbitrarily determine the unitary matrix used to weight the predetermined codeword. Further, MS 330 may or may not know in advance, or be informed by the base station, of the particular unitary matrix selected by the base station. Base station 302 then transmits ( 712 ) the pre-coded pilot signal to MS 330 via the multiple antenna elements 308 , 310 of antenna array 432 and downlink channel 322 .
- MS 330 receives ( 714 ) the pre-coded pilot signal via the multiple antenna elements 336 , 338 of antenna array 602 and estimates ( 716 ) channel 322 based on the received pre-coded pilot signal. Based on the estimated channel, MS 330 then determines an effective channel for each of one or more matrices of codebook 334 . MS 330 then selects ( 718 ) a preferred codebook matrix and rank for use by base station 302 in a subsequent transmission of user data based on the effective channel determinations, and in particular by choosing a preferred codebook matrix corresponding to the best effective channel.
- MS 330 then informs ( 720 ) base station 302 of the selected codebook matrix and rank, preferably by conveying a codebook index to the preferred codebook matrix, and a rank index, back to the base station.
- Base station 302 uses ( 722 ) the selected codebook matrix and rank to weight a subsequent transmission of user data to MS 330 , and logic flow diagram 700 then ends ( 724 ).
- H(k) represent the M r ⁇ M t channel matrix for the k-th subcarrier in frequency.
- W represent a pre-coding matrix of dimension M t ⁇ M s which is an element of the codebook as defined herein (note that this W is different from the W 404 , 608 used in spreaders 420 and 422 and despreaders 610 and 612 ).
- the criteria for selecting a codeword by a receiver is non-unique but usually the selection criteria involve multiplications of the form H(k)W.
- a formula for selecting an element of a codebook by a receiver may be expressed as
- the matrix norm is the Frobenius norm ( ⁇ A ⁇ F 2 means the sum of the squared magnitude of the entries of A)
- H(k) represents the M r ⁇ M t channel matrix for a k-th subcarrier in frequency
- K denotes the size of the cluster consisting of K adjacent subcarriers
- W is a precoding matrix of dimension M t ⁇ M s
- V is the selected element from ⁇ that represents the quantized precoding matrix for the cluster.
- the present invention provides for the construction of ⁇ from a set of unitary matrices.
- a codebook having a larger d min, k is considered to be better than a competitor codebook.
- the equivalence relations for certain selection criteria are as follows:
- An index of the selected pre-coded set of weights is then sent back to the base station, whereupon the base station checks that index against the codebook stored in memory to select the indicated set of weights in subsequent transmissions.
- the base station uses the first n columns of selected matrices as the beamforming weights.
- unitary matrices are used to construct codebooks 306 and 334 , starting with a unitary matrix U that is used as a building block for the codebook.
- Unitary matrix U may be any unitary matrix; however, whatever matrix serves as U is used to precode the midamble.
- the following describes a scheme for codebook construction for four transmit (Tx) antenna elements using a unitary matrix U.
- This scheme then may be extended to a scheme for codebook construction for eight transmit antenna elements, and so on.
- U can be an arbitrary 4 ⁇ 4 unitary matrix
- matrices A 1 , A 2 , A 3 are defined in equations (2), (3) and (4).
- a 1 ( 1 2 ) ⁇ [ 0 1 0 i i 0 1 0 0 i 0 1 1 0 i 0 ] ( 2 )
- a 2 ( 1 2 ) ⁇ [ 0 1 0 i 0 i 0 1 i 0 1 0 1 0 i 0 ] ( 3 )
- a 3 ( 1 2 ) ⁇ [ 0 1 0 i i 0 1 0 1 0 i 0 1 ] ( 4 )
- matrices A 1 , A 2 and A 3 have only two non-zero entries (1 or i) in each column. So the columns of matrices B, C and D are linear combinations of two columns of U.
- the codebook ⁇ is designed as a common codebook for rank-1, rank-2, rank-3 and rank-4 precoding matrices. In the case of rank-1, the first column of each of the matrices constitute a codebook, in the case of rank-2 the first two columns of each matrix constitute the codebook and so on.
- Table 1 The distance properties of such a codebook are given in Table 1:
- the matrices A 1 , . . . , A 7 defined in equations (7)-(13) and the matrices A 1 , A 2 , A 3 as defined in equations (2), (3) and (4) are non-unique and there exist multiple choices for such matrices with the property that the entries are limited to a restricted alphabet.
- Restricted alphabet refers to an alphabet that consists of 0 and integer powers of i (sqrt( ⁇ 1)) or half integer powers of i. Restricted alphabet also refers to an alphabet that consists of integer powers of i (sqrt( ⁇ 1)) or half integer powers of i.
- the alphabets comprise the values ⁇ 0, 1, ⁇ 1, i, ⁇ i, (1+i)/sqrt(2), (1 ⁇ i)/sqrt(2), ( ⁇ 1+i)/sqrt(2), ( ⁇ 1 ⁇ i)/sqrt(2) ⁇ where sqrt(2) means the square root of 2.
- the set contains 0 and the following integer and half integer powers of i: ⁇ 0, 2, 1, 3, 1/2, 7/2, 3/2, and 5/2 ⁇ .
- the alphabets comprise the values ⁇ 0, 1, ⁇ 1, i, ⁇ i ⁇ .
- the alphabets comprise the values ⁇ 1, ⁇ 1, i, ⁇ i ⁇ .
- the alphabets comprise the values ⁇ 1, ⁇ 1, i, ⁇ i, (1+i)/sqrt(2), (1 ⁇ i)/sqrt(2), ( ⁇ 1+i)/sqrt(2), ( ⁇ 1 ⁇ i)/sqrt(2) ⁇ . It may also be noted that the matrices A 1 , A 2 , A 3 may be scaled by a constant factor.
- a 1 ( 1 2 ) ⁇ [ 0 0 0 i 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 i 0
- rank-1 the first column of each of the matrices constitute a codebook, in the case of rank-2 the first two columns of each matrix constitute the codebook and so on.
- Table 2 The distance properties of such a codebook are given in Table 2:
- FIG. 8 shows error rate results from simulations comparing the performances of various codebooks. The results show that the unitary matrix-based codebooks described herein have very similar error rate performance as the LTE codebooks.
- the use of the above described codebook design and precoding of a pilot pattern using the unitary matrix U can enable two types of feedback strategies—(i) conventional codebook-based feedback strategy based on midamble or broadcast pilots, and (ii) mix of beam selection and codebook feedback.
- a logic flow diagram 900 is provided that illustrates a method performed by MS 330 in determining an effective channel for the matrices of codebook 334 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Let codebooks ⁇ and ⁇ have 8-PSK entries. Logic flow diagram 900 then begins ( 902 ) when MS 330 determines ( 904 ) an effective channel for a subset ‘S’ of rank-1 codebook indices to produce ‘S’ effective channels.
- H w to be a rank-1 codeword chosen from a codebook and H to be a M r ⁇ M t channel matrix, where M t is the number of transmit antenna elements (that is, at base station 302 ) and M r is the number of receive antenna elements (that is, at MS 330 ). Then the computation for Hw can be considered as a basic unit of computation.
- MS 330 determines ( 906 ) an effective channel for the remaining codebook indices as a function of the ‘S’ effective channels. That is, codebook ⁇ has 16 unique vectors and ⁇ has 64 unique vectors for all ranks. Once the rank-1 Hw computations are performed for all the indices there is no need for any additional Hw computations for the remaining ranks.
- the codebook search for ⁇ and ⁇ then can be simplified by ordering the computations. For codebook ⁇ , assume that the Hw computations are completed for the first 4 indices (all the columns of U). Each of the Hw computations for the remaining 12 indices can be obtained by a complex addition using the Hw results obtained for the first 4 indices.
- each of the Hw computations for the remaining 56 indices can be obtained by a complex addition using the Hw results obtained for the first 8 indices.
- Logic flow diagram 900 then ends ( 908 ). This mode of feedback may provide modest gains in computation compared to the LTE codebook in the case of four Tx antennas; however, in the case of eight Tx antennas the computational savings will be significant.
- the pilots for the midamble may be precoded by a unitary matrix U that is determined by base station 302 . Then, the Hw computations for the first 4 indices of ⁇ and the first 8 indices of ⁇ can be eliminated because they are multiplied by the downlink channel naturally. This would also mean that U need not be standardized or known by MS 330 . As a result, U can be controlled by base station 302 and set according to antenna polarizations or long-term antenna correlations, or randomized between cell sites and the codebook is no longer restricted to an 8-PSK alphabet. This mode of operation will also provide maximum savings in terms of computation.
- a base station such as base station 302 may employ a precoding matrix U to modify the codebook that is already built into mobile stations, such as MS 330 , as necessitated by the standard specifications.
- This precoding matrix U may be optimized to improve the cell throughput by matching the modified codebook to a particular antenna configuration at the base station or multi-path fading environment or traffic type or to reduce interference.
- the choice of U may change with time or frequency or both.
- multiple base stations or multiple sectors may coordinate the choice of the precoding matrix U that is used by each base station, such as base station 302 , or sector to precode the mid-amble.
- the choice of U may be optimized to minimize inter-cell or inter-sector interference.
- an MS such as MS 330 may estimate the interference from the precoded mid-amble (or precoded pilots) received from a non-serving base station. This estimate may be used by the MS to feed back a codebook index to a serving base station, such as base station 302 .
- an MS such as MS 330 may estimate the interference from the precoded midamble (or precoded pilots) received from a serving base station, such as base station 302 . The MS then may use this interference estimate to determined, and feed back, a codebook index to the serving base station.
- the present invention provides for a less computationally intensive scheme of codebook-based feedback of channel information, enabling linear pre-coding (including beamforming) in MIMO systems, in a TDD or a FDD scenario.
- Base station 302 transmits a known signal, precoded with a precoding matrix, that is, a midamble comprising precoded pilot signals, to MS 330 .
- MS 330 estimates the downlink channel 322 and, based on the estimate, selects a particular codebook entry, that is, a codebook matrix and rank. An index of this entry is sent back to base station 302 using a low-rate feedback channel 324 .
- the present invention provides for a pre-coding of the pilot signal that is received by, and measured by, MS 330 and used by the MS to select the codebook entry that is fed back to base station 302 . Further, the pre-coding of the pilot signal is such that MS 330 does not need to be informed, in advance of receiving the midamble, of the particular matrix that is used to pre-code of the midamble in order for the pre-coding to be useful to the MS.
- the invention can be implemented in any suitable form including hardware, software, firmware or any combination of these.
- the invention may optionally be implemented partly as computer software running on one or more data processors and/or digital signal processors.
- the elements and components of an embodiment of the invention may be physically, functionally and logically implemented in any suitable way. Indeed the functionality may be implemented in a single unit, in a plurality of units or as part of other functional units. As such, the invention may be implemented in a single unit or may be physically and functionally distributed between different units and processors.
Abstract
Description
where hmn, m=1, 2, and n=1, 2, are complex channel values. Note that the term “composite channel” as used herein refers to a complete measurement or description of a channel, wherein the effects of all combinations of transmit antennas and receive antennas are considered. The composite channel may be thought of as the aggregation of all channels and precoding weights between arrays of antennas, defined by all pair-wise combinations of transmit and receive antennas.
r=Hz=HVx
where x=[x1 x2]T is the vector of transmitted data streams, and noise is not considered. Note that in a noise free channel, both streams can be recovered perfectly if channel matrix HV is full rank. That is, two equations and two unknowns can be solved to recover the unknowns x=[x1 x2]T. When x=(HV)−1r, both data streams can be recovered and link, or channel, efficiency can be doubled.
where the matrix norm is the Frobenius norm (∥A∥F 2 means the sum of the squared magnitude of the entries of A), H(k) represents the Mr×Mt channel matrix for a k-th subcarrier in frequency, K denotes the size of the cluster consisting of K adjacent subcarriers, W is a precoding matrix of dimension Mt×Ms, Φ={W1, W2, . . . , WN} denotes the codebook of precoding matrices, and V is the selected element from Φ that represents the quantized precoding matrix for the cluster. The present invention provides for the construction of Φ from a set of unitary matrices.
where the subscript k denotes the number of streams (or rank). This distance is used for 1≦k<Mt. The following distance is used for k=Mt.
where w⊥ is of rank (Mt−r) and denotes the orthogonal complement of w, where r denotes the rank or the number of streams (interchangeably denoted by Ms). Thus, in case a simple codebook exists for w⊥ and not for w, it is beneficial to search over codebooks consisting of w⊥. Note that other distances can be used. One such alternative is to use the square root of one minus minimum squared singular value of W1 HW2.
A=U,B=UA 1 ,C=UA 2 ,D=UA 3 (1)
where U can be an arbitrary 4×4 unitary matrix and matrices A1, A2, A3 are defined in equations (2), (3) and (4).
Note that matrices A1, A2 and A3 have only two non-zero entries (1 or i) in each column. So the columns of matrices B, C and D are linear combinations of two columns of U. From matrices A, B, C, D, a codebook Φ of cardinality 16 may be constructed, that is, Φ={A0, A1, A2, A3, B0, B1, B2, B3, C0, C1, C2, C3, D0, D1, D2, D3}, where Aj represents matrix A with the columns shifted circularly to the left by j places. The codebook Φ is designed as a common codebook for rank-1, rank-2, rank-3 and rank-4 precoding matrices. In the case of rank-1, the first column of each of the matrices constitute a codebook, in the case of rank-2 the first two columns of each matrix constitute the codebook and so on. The distance properties of such a codebook are given in Table 1:
