For blog documents is determined quality score
Fig. 6 be with the corresponding to embodiment of the principle of the invention in be used for blog documents is determined the process flow diagram of the example process of quality score.Processing can be by obtaining to begin (action 610) about the information of the blog documents that will give a mark.Described information can comprise blog self, model, from the metadata of described blog and/or one or more the feeding (feeds) that is associated with described blog documents.
Can discern positive designator (action 620) at the quality of blog documents.These designators can comprise the popularity of blog documents, the implicit popularity of blog documents, the existence of blog documents in blogroll (blogroll), the existence of blog documents in high quality blogroll, the label of blog documents, other resource is quoted and the page rank (pagerank) of blog documents blog documents.Can will be appreciated that, also can use other designator.
The popularity of blog documents can be the direct index of the quality of this blog documents.A plurality of news polymerizers (aggregator) website (so-called " NEWSERADER " or " reader of feeding ") is present in individuality and can (feeds by it) and subscribe to the place of blog documents.Such aggregators store is described for how much individual information of having subscribed to given blog documents.Blog documents with high subscription means that described blog documents quality is higher.And, unique user that can subscribe to by checking, perhaps by unique Internet protocol (IP) address of filtering the subscriber come at " subscribing to spam (subscriptions spam) " (wherein spammers (spammer) subscribe to themselves blog documents to attempt to make its " more welcome ") the checking subscription.
Can discern the implicit popularity of blog documents.For example, can discern this implicit popularity by the click steam of test Search Results.For example, if in appearing at result set the time, particular blog document is clicked more than other blog documents, and this just can be used as this blog documents is welcome indication, and thus as the positive designator of the quality of this blog documents.
Blog documents is present in the direct index of the quality that can be used as described blog documents in the blogroll.Can will be appreciated that, blog documents not only comprises nearest journal entry (promptly usually, model), and comprise " blogroll ", described blogroll be author/blog author the intensive collection of link of interested external site (normally other blog).The blogroll that is linked to blog documents is the index of the popularity of this blog documents, thus can calculating linking to the polymerization blogroll of blog documents and use it for the popularity magnitude of inferring described blog documents.
Blog documents is present in the direct index of the quality that can be used as described blog documents in the high quality blogroll.High quality blogroll is the blogroll that is linked to famous or believable blog author.Therefore, the high quality blogroll that also is linked to blog documents is the positive designator of the quality of described blog documents.
Similarly, blog documents is present in the direct index that blogroll famous or believable blog author also can be used as the quality of described blog documents.In this case, suppose that described famous or believable blog author can not be linked to the blog author of spam.
The label of blog documents can be used as the direct index of the quality of blog documents.Some existing websites allow the user to add " label " (that is, carrying out " classification ") to blog documents.These customization classification are individual designators of having assessed the blog documents content and having determined one or more classification of suitable its content of description, and can be used as the positive designator of described blog documents equally.
Other sources can be used as the direct index of the quality of described blog documents to quoting of blog documents.For example, the interior perhaps chat record of Email can comprise the URL of blog documents.Comprise that Email of quoting or chat discussion to described blog documents are the positive designators of the quality of described blog documents.
The page rank of blog documents can be used as the positive designator of the quality of described blog documents.High page rank (signal that calculates for conventional webpage usually) is high-quality designator, and can be applied to the direct index of blog documents as the quality of described blog documents thus.In some embodiments, blog documents (for example, model) can not be associated when being new (for example, when model) with page rank.Under those situations, new model can be inherited the page rank of its associated blog, until this new model has been determined independently page rank.The page rank of this succession can be used as the direct index of the quality of described new model.
Can discern negative indicator (action 630) at the quality of blog documents.Such designator can comprise on the blog documents frequency of new model, the content of the model in the blog documents, the size of model in the blog documents, the link distribution of blog documents and appear at advertisement in the blog documents.Can will be appreciated that, also can use other designators.
The frequency that new model adds blog documents to can be used as the negative indicator of the quality of this blog documents.Typically, feed and only comprise nearest model from blog documents.Spammers often suddenly generates a large amount of new models (that is, occurring many new models in short-term) or with the interval that can estimate (sent out models in per 10 minutes, and perhaps per hour pass by to send out 32 minutes the time a new model in per 3 hours).These two kinds of behaviors are all relevant with malicious intent, and can be used in the possible spammers of identification.Therefore, if new model adds the frequency in the blog documents to and can the expectation pattern be complementary.Then this can be used as the negative index of the quality of described blog documents.
The content of model can be used as the negative index of the quality of this blog documents in the blog documents.Typically, feed and comprise part or all of content from a plurality of models of given blog documents.Itself also comprises the content of these models described blog documents.Spammers can be put into the content of a version to feed and improve their rank at Search Results, places different versions (for example, the link of uncorrelated advertisement) simultaneously on their blog documents.Therefore, this not matching (feed and blog documents between) can be used as the negative index of the quality of described blog documents.
And, in some instances, can in a plurality of models of blog documents, duplicate specific content, cause a plurality of feeding to comprise identical content.It is low quality/spam that duplicating like this indicates described feeding, and thus can be as the negative index of the quality of described blog documents.
The term/phrase of using in the model of blog documents also can be used as the negative index of the quality of this blog documents.For example, can think to extract the feeding of spam the tabulation (for example, double word repeats, three words repeat etc.) of frequent occurring words and phrase in spam from the set of blog documents and evaluator.If blog documents comprises a high proportion of word or phrase from described tabulation, then this can be used as the negative index of the quality of described blog documents.
The size of model can be used as the negative index of the quality of this blog documents in the blog documents.Many automatic model makers generate the model of a plurality of identical or closely similar length.As a result, the distribution of post sizes can be as the reliable measure of spam behavior.When blog documents comprised the identical or closely similar model of a plurality of length, this can be used as the negative index of the quality of described blog documents.
The link distribution of blog documents can be used as the negative index of the quality of this blog documents.As mentioned above, some models are created the page rank that increases particular blog document.In some cases, all point to single webpage or single external site from the major part in the all-links of these models or blog documents.If the number of links to any single external site exceeds threshold value, then this can be used as the negative index of the quality of described blog documents.
The appearance of advertisement in blog documents can be used as the negative index of the quality of described blog documents.If blog documents comprises mass advertising, then this can be used as the negative index of the quality of described blog documents.
In addition, typically, blog documents comprises three types content: the nearest content of model, blogroll and blog metadata (for example, author's profile information and/or about other information of described blog documents or its author).If there is advertisement, typically appear in the blog metadata section or near blogroll.The existence of advertisement in the nearest model part of blog documents can be used as the negative index of the quality of described blog documents.
Can determine the quality score (action 640) of blog documents based on these designators.For example, in one embodiment, can be by assigning weight to different designators and making up these weights and determine the quality score of blog documents to obtain quality score.Can make up and/or be provided with weight to these designators in mode arbitrarily.For example, with the corresponding to a kind of embodiment of the principle of the invention in, can give the plus or minus value for each index.These numerical value can be added in the quality score of coming together to determine blog documents.Perhaps, each indicator value can be multiply by corresponding factor (or weight) and end value added the incompatible quality score that provides blog documents.Also can use the other technologies that are used for determining quality score.
In case determined the quality score of blog documents, just it can be associated with described blog documents.For example, described quality score can be associated with the information that the blog documents of determining score value is discerned in such as the database of database 500.By this way, database 500 can have the quality score of blog documents.Described quality score can regular update.
Present Search Results
Fig. 7 is the process flow diagram that is used to present the example process of Search Results.In one embodiment, the processing of Fig. 7 can be carried out by one or more softwares and/or hardware component in the server 220.In another embodiment, described processing can be carried out by one or more softwares and/or hardware component in another equipment or the one group of equipment, and described one group of equipment separates or comprise server 220 with server 220.
Processing can be from the search inquiry (action 710) that is receiving.For example, the user can to search box that search engine is associated in search inquiry (for example, to search engine interface or add inputted search term in the search box of toolbar) is provided.Web browser (or adding toolbar) can send to search engine with described search inquiry, such as the search engine 225 that is associated with server 220.
Can determine the relevance score (action 720) of one group of document based on described search inquiry.For example, server 220 can be determined information retrieval (IR) score value of these documents.Can determine the IR score value of described document based on the coupling of the search term of search inquiry and document content.Multiple known technology can be used for determining document IR score value.For example, can determine the IR score value based on the quantity that the search term occurs in document.Alternatively or additionally, can based on described search term in document where (for example, title, content etc.) occur or the feature (for example, font, size, color etc.) of described search term is determined described IR score value.Alternatively or additionally, when having a plurality of search term, a search term is provided with weight can be different from another search term.Alternatively or additionally, when having a plurality of search term, the degree of approximation of search term can influence the IR score value.To those skilled in the art, other the technology that is used for determining the IR score value of document is known.
Can determine the overall score (action 730) of described document based on the quality of document.For example, the IR score value of each document and the quality score of described document can be made up to determine overall score.Make up these score values and make the IR score value of described document to adjust, improve or reduce score value thus, perhaps in some cases, keep the constant overall score that obtains of score value based on quality score.Perhaps, can not generating the IR score value based on quality score separately comes document is marked.In any case, can determine its overall score to document by the service property (quality) score value.
Can one group of document through rank be offered user's (action 740) based on the overall score of document.By this way, the quality of document can be used to improve the Search Results that offers the user.
Example
Following example has illustrated above processing.Suppose that the user is interested in the blog about fantasy football.Described user may submit search inquiry " fantasy football " to the search engine such as search engine 225.In response, suppose that search engine 225 retrieves (for example, using the IR technology) based on the degree of correlation of one group of blog documents and described search inquiry to them.
Fig. 8 is in response to search inquiry and the diagrammatic sketch of the exemplary blog document sets that receives.As shown in the figure, search engine 225 retrieves five blog documents (blog documents 1-5) with the following degree of correlation (or IR) score value: the blog documents 1 with IR score value 1.0, blog documents 2 with IR score value 0.9, blog documents 3 with IR score value 0.8 has the blog documents 4 of IR score value 0.7 and has the blog documents 5 of IR score value 0.6.For illustrative purposes, suppose that these five blog documents have following quality score: blog documents 1 has positive mass score value 0.4, blog documents 2 has negative mass score value-0.4, blog documents 3 has positive mass score value 0.8, blog documents 4 has positive mass score value 0.3, and blog documents 5 has positive mass score value 0.3.
Search engine 225 can be by adding degree of correlation score value to the overall score that quality score is determined blog documents.In this case, blog documents 1 will have overall score 1.4, and blog documents 2 will have overall score 0.5, and blog documents 3 will have overall score 1.6, and blog documents 4 will have overall score 1.0, and blog documents 5 will have overall score 0.9.Therefore, search engine can provide blog documents 1-5 to the user in the following order: blog documents 3, blog documents 1, blog documents 4, blog documents 5 and blog documents 2.
As what obviously see from the example of Fig. 8, the quality of blog documents may cause the rank of those documents to improve or reduce.By this way, provide higher-quality result to the user.
