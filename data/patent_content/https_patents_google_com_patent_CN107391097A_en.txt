In some instances, RPM 226 can determine the respective relevancy score value each applied based on context information.Context is believed
Breath may include the context of activity application, contexts of two or more applications, the context of vehicle or related to vehicle driver
The context information of connection.In some instances, context information can be stored at computer equipment 210 or remote equipment is (for example, remote
Journey server or user mobile phone) place.
When computing device stores associated with personal user context information or when information between multiple users it is general
When, information is connected back into all personal of individual and can recognize that information (such as, name, address.Phone number and/or Email
Location) it can be removed before storing.Computing device 210 and/or remote equipment can also encrypt the information to be stored with preventing from accessing
Any information wherein.In addition, if these users agree to the collection of this information for certain, computing device can be stored only
The information associated with the user of computing device.Computing device may also provide user and cancel the chance agreed to, and in this feelings
Under condition, computing device can stop collecting or otherwise retain the information associated with specific user.
As used in entire disclosure, term " context information " can be by computing system and/or computing device for description
The information that (such as, computing device 210) uses, to limit one associated with the user of computing device and/or computing device
Or multiple environmental characteristics.In other words, context information expression can be by the arbitrary data that computing device and/or computing system use with true
Fixed " user's context ", it indicates stroke user in special time for ad-hoc location experience (such as virtual and/or reality undergoes)
Experience situation.
In some instances, the context of activity application may include and application, work current having shown or be presently displaying
How long dynamic application activity waits associated information.For example, if activity application is traffic and navigation application and activity
10 miles should be kept again on identical road using current display driver, then RPM 226 can determine that the field of activity application
It is interested that border instruction activity application is unlikely to be driver so that RPM 226 can be that navigation application specifies low correlation point
It is worth (such as 20 of hundred-mark system).In another example, if activity application is traffic and navigation application and activity application is current
Upcoming steering is shown, then RPM 226 can determine that the context instruction driver of activity application would be possible to navigation information
It is interested and will be navigation application specify high correlation score value (such as 95 of hundred-mark system).In some instances, RPM 226 can
Context based on activity application determines the relevance score of one or more additional applications.For example, RPM 226 can be with correlation
Higher relevance score is specified in the application for joining context.For example, if activity application is navigation application and worked as by navigation application
The information of preceding display includes the map to driver office, then RPM 226 can be work associated application (for example, working day
Journey) relatively high relevance score is specified, and specify relatively low relevance score for unrelated application.Similarly, if
The information currently shown by navigation application is included to the map at amusement and recreation region (for example, seabeach), then RPM 226 can be leisure
Entertain related application (for example, weather application) and specify relatively high relevance score.
In some instances, the context of vehicle may include that the past of vehicle, the physical location of present or future, vehicle are to move
Dynamic or static, speed, the acceleration of vehicle, traffic, date-time etc..For example, if vehicle quickly accelerates,
It is that driver loses interest in that RPM 226, which can determine that the context instruction driver of vehicle wants to focus on traveling and other information,
's.In other words, if vehicle quickly accelerates (for example, more than threshold acceleration), RPM 226 can determine that user's notice is wide
Degree reduces.Therefore, RPM 226 can determine that the relevance score associated with the application in addition to activity application is low, and RPM
226 can prevent from making PSD 212 export the special pattern user interface that can make driver distraction.In another example, if vehicle
Do not moved positioned at other lane for driver and vehicle, then RPM 226 can determine that the context instruction driver of vehicle to additional
Information is interested and can be that relatively high relevance score is specified in one or more additional applications.
Described above, RPM 226 can be based on sensor cluster 252 and/or input module 244 determines user's notice
Range reduces.For example, Vehicle Information System 200 may include to detect the microphone of audio input, monitoring driver (for example, monitoring
Body kinematics or eye motion) camera, monitor vehicle periphery traffic (for example, the image by capturing du vehicule
And/or traffic sign) camera, radar and/or laser radar sensor for detecting other vehicles, it is or above-mentioned any
Combination.In some instances, if sensor cluster 252 detects traffic congestion, fast speed, high acceleration etc., RPM
226 can determine that the reduction of user's notice range.In some instances, if input module 244 detects unusual body
Or eye motion (for example, the harmonic motion amount of eyes, it may indicate that driver is tired) or if input module 244 detects greatly
Audio input amount (for example, a large amount of audio inputs may indicate that user converses), then RPM 226 can determine that user's notice range
Reduce.In some instances, if RPM226 determines the reduction of user's notice range, RPM 226 can be one or more attached
Low correlation score value (for example, 0 of hundred-mark system) is specified in the application added.
In some instances, the context of other application may include that information, driver and spy is how frequently presented in application-specific
How long is fixed application interaction, or driver how frequently interacts with application-specific.For example, if the context of application-specific refers to
Show using continually offer motion renewal but user persistently ignores the renewal, then RPM 226 can determine that user is less likely to this
Information is interested, and can be that sports applications specify low correlation score value (for example, 10 of hundred-mark system).However, if specific should
The transport information applied from traffic of context instruction driver's frequent requests, then RPM 226 can determine that user is possible to pair
Traffic application is very interested, and can be that high associated score value (for example, 90 of hundred-mark system) is specified in traffic application.
