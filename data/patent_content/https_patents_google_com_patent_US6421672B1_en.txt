Definitions
- the invention relates to systems and methods for retrieving information from databases and more particularly to autoattendant systems and methods for routing incoming calls based on a telephone directory.
- Forward searchable telephone directory listings and databases are conventionally ordered and keyed to the names of the listed parties, i.e., an alphabetically arranged listing of names with associated telephone numbers. It is not unusual to have several parties with (i) the same name or (ii) names that might be similarly pronounced by someone requesting a telephone listing or otherwise needing to designate a particular person by name.
- VRUs automatic voice response units
- VRUs may inform the caller that the system has more than one person having the particular name requested, play back the names and respective telephone numbers of the parties, and ask the caller to designate which of the parties is being requested. The caller would then be prompted to select from among the identified parties.
- a VRU may be used in voice dialing systems to provide speech activated dialing.
- a calling party speaks the name of the party to be called and the system attempts to recognize the speech as corresponding to a previously stored speech pattern.
- Similar systems may also be used to provide automated directory assistance functions, including traditional “411” services, which may include provisions for call completion to the directory number identified.
- autoattendant In contrast to traditional auto-dialers used to initiate outgoing calls, automated attendant (autoattendant) systems are used to automatically answer and handle incoming telephone calls. Traditionally, autoattendants play an announcement to the caller and provide for various selections using a VRU. Thus, the caller may be prompted to dial the extension of the party being called and/or given other options, such as leaving a voice message or accessing a directory of names if the extension of the called party is not known. While early directories required the caller to spell the name of the called party using a telephone DTMF keypad, later systems provided for speech recognition of a spoken name. This improvement has been made possible by the commercial availability of reliable speaker-independent voice recognition.
- the autoattendant answers an incoming call, asks the caller to speak the name of the party or department being called, uses a speaker-independent voice recognition engine to identify and translate a received speech signal into name data, uses the name data to access a telephone directory, and routes or extends the call to the corresponding telephone number.
- the present invention addresses the disadvantages in the prior art by providing an intelligent database search engine which, when finding multiple listings satisfying a primary or initial search request, provides a series of prompts soliciting further information relative to the ambiguous results.
- the prompts are dynamically composed to quickly minimize the group of qualifying candidate listings until only one listing remains or until no further information distinguishing between or among the candidate listings would be helpful or is available.
- a database retrieval system includes a searchable database in which the primary key, such a name associated with a telephone directory listing, may be duplicated, i.e., is not unique.
- the user is prompted to supply additional information determined to be helpful in selecting from among candidate records having the same key. For example, if multiple listings are identified for the telephone listing “John Smith”, the system will examine secondary data fields to identify information unique among the listings, such as the addresses of the listings. The system will then prompt the caller to identify which of the listings is desired, using the address information to distinguish among and select the desired listing(s).
- the present adaptive disambiguation system and method dynamically selects additional listing information most useful in resolving the search ambiguity and caller selection process. Using either a fixed or entry specific prioritization, listings with identical or similar name key information are compared to identify distinguishing secondary information (e.g., employee location department, etc.) that might be given to the caller to complete the selection.
- distinguishing secondary information e.g., employee location department, etc.
- candidate parties might be identified by a corporate automated attendant system in response to a caller asking to be connected to a “Robert Cook”:
- conventional VRUs may not include the capability of matching a spoken name with variations in pronunciation possible for names of a directory listing.
- the listing “Koch” may be pronounced as “Koch”, “Cook”, “Coke”, etc.
- the present system accommodates these variations and alternative pronunciations used by both (i) the named party and (ii) the caller by providing generalized and/or listing specific alterative pronunciations and nicknames corresponding to particular names and/or listings. While this feature provides enhanced search capabilities, it also tends to exacerbate the disambiguation problem.
- the system uses a hierarchical search pattern to identify distinguishing information about the parties for presentation to the caller.
- conventional systems typically provide the caller with the names and telephone numbers of all of the candidate entries. Instead, the present system may first look to the Department field of the candidate entries to determine if they are unique. In this example, two of the candidate parties work in engineering, so that this category of information may not be useful to help select the correct party to be called. The system may next look to the location field and, as in the example above, determine that this information is unique among the candidates.
- the system would then provide the caller with both the name and location of the identified listings and ask the caller to select among the parties, typically by saying or using a keypad to input the number of the selection, e.g., “Say or push ‘1’ to dial Robert Cook in Arlington, Virginia; ‘2’ for the Robert Cook in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and ‘3’ for Mr. Cook in Silver Spring, Maryland.”
- the system is adaptable to provide an interactive colloquy with the caller in an effort to resolve the ambiguity.
- the system may attempt to limit the set of candidates by asking a series of questions such as: “We have [specify number found][“multiple”] listings for employees named ‘Robert Cook’, do you know if your Mr. Cook is in Engineering or Legal?” The system would then use any new information to select one or more potential candidates and/or to solicit additional information to resolve or minimize the ambiguity.
- the system may prompt the caller using the name pronunciation used by the caller.
- the system may respond to the name “Robert Cook” with “We have multiple listings for ‘Robert Cook’, including spellings C-O-O-K, C-O-O-K-E, and K-O-C-H. Do you know which spelling is correct?”
- the system would repeat the caller's pronunciation in future prompts during the call, although using standard or party specified pronunciations when providing alternative listings.
- the system might respond “We have multiple listings for ‘Robert Koch’, including a ‘Robert Koch’ in Engineering, a ‘Bob Cook’ spelled K-O-C-H in sales, and a ‘Rob Koch’ in Legal. Do you know which department Mr. Koch is in?”
- the system may also use a fuzzy logic method in selecting candidates. Criteria may include, for example, the frequency of calls routed to a particular party through the system, party specific nicknames, origin of the caller in comparison to candidate locations, etc. The order of presentation of the candidate names may also be affected by such considerations so that most likely candidates are announced before others.
- the system may further consider and eliminate unlikely pronunciations. For example, while the name spelled “K-O-C-H” may be a potential candidate listing for the spoken name “Cook”, the converse is unlikely, i.e., a name pronounced “Koch” would not be spelled “C-O-O-K.” As another feature of the invention, the system may additionally resolve ambiguities based on spelling, providing the spelling of a name to the caller or asking the caller to spell the name of the party being called, the method chosen possibly being dependent on the number of candidate listings identified.

- Autoattendant system 10 includes central processing unit (CPU) 12 programmed to coordinate and control system operations according to a program stored in memory (not shown).
- CPU 12 controls network interface 14 , speech recognition engine 16 , dialer 18 , announcement unit 20 and database management system 22 .
- individual lines are shown for transmission of control and information signals between the elements of autoattendant 10 , typically control and data will be supported by one or more system address and data buses.
- Network interface 14 is connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) for answering incoming telephone calls from the PSTN.
- PSTN public switched telephone network
- This interface may be in the form of single or multiple POTS or ISDN lines or may be a trunk group such as a PBX trunk with associated signaling.
- Network interface 14 provides an audio output to speech recognition engine 16 which includes a speaker independent recognition capability to convert speech signals in the form of audio to a digital data stream.
- This digital data stream may be in the form of ASCII text and, preferably, includes the phonetic equivalent of the spoken speech.
- English language speech may be represented by a set of 39 phonemes, for which the vowels may carry lexical stress, 0 meaning no stress, 1 primary stress, and 2 secondary stress. These phonemes are shown in the following table including examples:
- the digital phoneme string from speech recognition engine 16 is provided to database management system 22 which, in turn, is connected to telephone directory database 24 .
- the structure of database 24 is shown in the lower portion of FIG. 1, comprising a plurality of records 30 .
- Each record 30 includes name information, some of which, depending on the specific input provided by the caller, would constitute first identification or primary key information, typically the last and probably first names 38 a , 38 b , of the party being called. To the extent the caller does not give certain name information, it might be considered secondary information to be used in later disambiguation processing to distinguish between listings, as necessary. Further, some of the name information may be alternate primary key information, i.e., nickname 38 e . Thus, middle name 38 c and suffix or title information 38 d may be either primary or secondary information depending on its use.
- secondary fields store other information about the listing which may be available to distinguish between and among others of the listings.
- the secondary information includes fields containing pronunciation rules for speaking the name of the listed party such as the phonetic equivalent for the name as spelled, or, alternatively, the pronunciation preferred by the particular listing as designated by the listing party and at his or her request.
- field 34 a may include an audio file which may be played by appropriate software, e.g., a WAV or MP 3 format file.
- Other information which may be used as secondary keys in distinguishing between and among the listings include address/location data field 34 b , business unit/department field 34 c , professional information field 34 d , and terminal type 34 e .
- each of the records includes a telephone number field 36 which is the target information being requested.
- any target information might be included or referenced, such as Internet address, e-mail, medical information, or any other information typically stored in a database or accessible by a directory type listing.
- database management system 22 searches telephone directory database 24 and identifies an initial candidate listing of records satisfying the primary search criteria, i.e., the name information provided by speech recognition engine 16 .
- the results of the search are then used to select an appropriate announcement to be played to the caller by announcement unit 20 through network interface 14 .
- the autoattendant 10 would announce to the caller that the call was being forwarded to the named party.
- the network interface would then provide appropriate signaling to the PSTN to transfer the call to the appropriate telephone number for the named party.
- network interface 14 would provide a flash-hook signal to the PSTN by momentarily going “on hook” so that, in response, the corresponding PSTN switch would place the calling party on hold and provide autoattendant 10 with a second dial tone.
- network interface 14 Upon detecting a second dial tone, network interface 14 would notify CPU 12 , which, in response, would cause dialer 18 to outdial the telephone number corresponding to the party being called, initiate a second “flash-hook” signal to bridge the calls, and, subsequently, go back on hook to drop out of the bridge so that the calling party would be connected directly to the requested listing.
- central processing unit 12 in combination with announcement unit 20 would provide a series of prompts soliciting additional information from the calling party in an attempt to resolve the ambiguity, i.e., disambiguate the listings.
- autoattendant 10 may be embodied as an intelligent peripheral (IP) within a telephone network.
- IP intelligent peripheral
- multiple parties 40 a , 40 b , and 40 c are connected to an originating telephone switch 42 which, in turn, is connected to voice network 46 .
- Voice network 46 connects to destination telephone switch 48 and parties 52 a , 54 b and 52 c as listed in telephone directory database 24 .
- each switch is interfaced to a switching control network, typically in the form of SS 7 , for providing signaling between and among switches including signal switching points (SSP) 44 and 50 connected to a service transfer point (STP) 54 .
- STP 54 may be connected directly to IP 58 and/or to an integrated signaling control point (ISCP) 56 providing additional processing and database facilities.
- ISCP integrated signaling control point
- the autoattendant functionality may be initiated either by and at origination telephone switch 42 in response to a dialed number trigger, or at destination telephone switch 48 in response to a termination trigger.
- call originating terminal 40 a may dial a telephone number, such as “411” initiating a dialed number trigger at originating telephone switch 42 causing call processing to be suspended by the switch and an appropriate message sent by SSP 44 to STP 54 .
- STP 54 alone or via ISCP 56 , would cause IP 58 to initiate processing and provide services to telephone switch 42 , either directly or via an intermediary switch of voice network 46 , including prompts generated by the autoattendant function.
- IP 58 Upon identification of an appropriate telephone number, IP 58 would then communicate the telephone number to STP 54 for transmission to SSP 44 and telephone switch 42 whereupon the call would be completed through voice network 46 to telephone switch 48 and the appropriate called party 52 a , 52 b or 52 c .
- this functionality when incorporated into a network, particularly using a dedicated, abbreviated 3-digit number such as “411,” would typically be provided as a universal directory assistance service, available network-wide.
- FIG. 3 An alternative embodiment is shown in FIG. 3, wherein autoattendant 10 is incorporated as customer premises equipment (CPE) as part of or augmenting a local private automatic branch exchange (PBX) 60 .
- CPE customer premises equipment
- PBX local private automatic branch exchange
- listed parties 62 a - 62 b and 62 c are serviced by autoattendant 10 for connecting incoming calls.
- calls to a main telephone number are extended to and answered by PBX 60 using autoattendant 10 to provide an appropriate greeting.
- the calling party or caller is. greeted and prompted to speak the name of the desired person or department so that the call can be completed to that person.
- PBX 60 Upon identification of the appropriate telephone number or extension, PBX 60 forwards or extends the call to the appropriate party.
- FIG. 4 shows the logic flow of the interactive directory search method according to an embodiment of the invention including intelligent secondary search facilities used to resolve ambiguities resulting from duplicate primary keys.
- an initial greeting is played at step 102 .
- the initial greeting may include a variety of options available to the caller and/or may include a general greeting such as identification of the associated business or facility name.
- the caller is prompted to say the name of the party being called, the speech signal being received at step 106 and processed at step 108 to extract phoneme information.
- the phoneme information may then be used to identify spellings of names to be searched for and, as will be described later, to identify specific listings having exceptional pronunciations.
- the phoneme information may also be used by the system in prompt generation so that the system uses the same name pronunciation as that used by the caller to “parrot back” the requested name.
- the database is searched at step 112 to identify all spellings of names and listings corresponding to exceptional pronunciations of names so as to create a candidate list. Processing then continues at step 114 to determine if more than one listing is contained in the candidate list. Step 114 is also the top of a “do while” loop which repeatedly attempts to resolve ambiguities due to multiple listings by using secondary information about each of the listings to disambiguate the search process. Thus, if the candidate list includes a single record, processing continues out the right side of step 114 to provide listing information and any other appropriate processing, e.g., initiate dialing of the corresponding telephone number. Alternatively, if the candidate list includes two or more listings, then processing continues out the left side of step 114 to step 120 where secondary information is searched in an attempt to distinguish the listings from and among each other.
- step 122 the relevant secondary information is examined to see if it has already been considered in a previous iteration. Thus, if there are still multiple listings in the candidate list and all secondary information useful in distinguishing listings from and among each other have been considered, then processing continues at step 124 where the user is prompted to select a listing by telephone number. If, however, there exists secondary information which has not been considered, processing continues at step 126 which sequentially considers information contained in the secondary information fields. Alternatively, step 126 may prioritize consideration of particularly relevant secondary fields more likely to result in disambiguation of listings or include information more likely to be known by the average caller, e.g., the location or department of a particular party. Another method of categorizing and prioritizing secondary key information will be described below.
- step 128 Upon identification of a secondary field, processing continues at step 128 where a determination of how many groupings are created by the secondary information is made. This check is performed to avoid enumerating a large number of secondary information categories to a caller when the caller (1) may be able to quickly provide the appropriate secondary information to be matched, or (2) may not know the secondary information to be solicited. For example, if “m” equals 3 , then groupings of four or more would result in processing continuing at step 130 where the caller would be prompted to input the appropriate secondary information, e.g, “We have seventeen listings for a Mr. John Smith at fourteen locations, do you know the location of the Mr.
- processing continues at step 132 where the caller is prompted to select from among the categories, e.g., “We have listings for a Jane Jones in three of our facilities. Do you want the Jane Jones in Arlington, Silver Spring, or Washington, D.C.?” [pause] “If you like, press or say 1 for Arlington, 2 for Silver Spring, or 3 for Washington, D.C.” Note that in this latter processing, the caller is given the options of saying the name of the desired location, entering the information by DTMF, or saying the number corresponding to the category.
- categories e.g., “We have listings for a Jane Jones in three of our facilities. Do you want the Jane Jones in Arlington, Silver Spring, or Washington, D.C.?” [pause] “If you like, press or say 1 for Arlington, 2 for Silver Spring, or 3 for Washington, D.C.” Note that in this latter processing, the caller is given the options of saying the name of the desired location, entering the information by DTMF, or saying the number corresponding to the category.
- step 134 the input is checked at step 134 to determine if valid secondary information has been received. For example, the caller may have been unable to identify the location of the called party so that processing continues back at the top of the while loop represented by step 114 .
- processing continues at step 136 where listings of the non-selected categories are eliminated from the candidate list and processing will then continue at decision step 114 .
- the method determines if there are still multiple entries in the candidate list or if the conflict has been resolved. If multiple entries still exist, the process will loop through, considering other secondary information not previously looked at in an attempt to resolve the ambiguity.
- a method of identifying usable secondary information fields, providing prioritization information for use of the fields, and identifying a number of categories into which each of the secondary information fields divides the listings, is implemented by the steps of FIG. 5 .
- the processing begins at the top of an outer “FOR” loop which sequentially examines each of the secondary information fields for distinguishing information.
- step 200 considers only those secondary information fields not previously used during the processing described in connection with FIG. 4 .
- the candidate listing is sorted based on the indexed secondary information field.
- a variable “count” is set equal to 1 and a variable “secondary data” is set equal to the secondary data contained in the first listing of the sorted list.
- step 206 the top of an inner “FOR” loop indexing to the second entry of the list to sequentially examine the secondary data contained therein.
- decision step 208 the secondary data of the two listings are examined to see if they match or if they are different. If there is no match, i.e., the secondary information is useful in distinguishing between the two listings, the variable “count” is incremented at step 210 and then variable “secondary data” is set equal to the secondary data of the listing under consideration.
- the “listing index” is incremented to point to the next listing and processing loops back to the top step 206 .
- variable “count” is examined to see if it is equal to the number of listings. If it is, i.e., all listings have unique secondary information, then a boolean flag indicating such is set equal to TRUE at step 218 . Otherwise, the flag would either default to FALSE, or be set to FALSE upon exiting under the “NO” condition of decision box 216 .
- the number of categories are then stored at step 220 for later reference and, at step 222 , the next secondary information field is indexed for consideration and processing back at step 200 .
- FIGS. 6 and 7 of the drawings A method of identifying an initial list of candidate listings and tailoring prompts to a caller is shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 of the drawings.
- an input speech signal is converted to its phonetic equivalent which is then associated with common spellings for that name.
- Listings containing those spellings are then identified.
- listings having exceptional pronunciations of names are identified and added to the previously identified spelling-based listings to create an initial list of candidate listings.
- an audio file is created using the phonetic equivalent so as to mimic back to the caller his or her particular pronunciation of the requested name.
- FIG. 7 An example of creation of a list of candidate listings is shown in connection with FIG. 7 in response to the spoken name “C-O-O-K.”
- the name “C-O-O-K” is represented as “K UH K” as shown in the upper lefthand portion of FIG. 7 .
- the sequence of phonemes would correspond to the name spelled “C-O-O-K” and “C-O-O-K-E.”
- the spellings would be added to the candidate listings.
- listings in which the listed party is known to or has requested a particular pronunciation corresponding to the pronunciation spoken by the caller is identified. In the example of FIG. 7, a Mr.
- unused secondary instruction is sequentially considered in and by the method shown and described with reference to FIG. 5, various criteria may be used to select which category of information will be used as a basis of requesting further information from a caller.
- candidate lists having a small number of listings to be resolved and unique secondary information distinguishing the listings, it may be best to solicit the distinguishing information directly.
- the candidate list is large, it may be more efficient to first request information eliminating a large portion of the listing prior to prompting for distinguishing information. For example, if the candidate list contains more than ten names, it may be more efficient to prompt the caller to provide information not distinguishing individual entries from each other but instead grouping the entries so that a large number may be eliminated from consideration, leaving a manageable list of candidate listings remaining.
- the selection of secondary information may also take into consideration the probable availability of such information. For example, if not otherwise supplied, a default first prompt may be to solicit the first name of the called party if not initially supplied.
- the system may also take into consideration and use secondary information contained in the initial listing request, such as nicknames used in specifying the desired party, particularly where the nickname is not common to the first names under consideration.
- nicknames used in specifying the desired party
- the nickname “Bub” may be commonly used to refer to people names “Robert” and therefore not particularly useful in distinguishing listings
- the nickname “Bub” is less common and might result in a search for that nickname in the corresponding field.
- the embodiment described is in the context of a telephone directory lookup system as implemented by either a call origination or answering system, the invention is applicable to other database search methods, systems and engines to resolve ambiguities between and among entries after an initial primary key search has resulted in the identification of multiple records.
- a search engine may initiate a series of questions to the user requesting further information so as to further limit and, hopefully, identify a specific web address.
