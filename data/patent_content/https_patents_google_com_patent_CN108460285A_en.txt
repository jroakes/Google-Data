Description
Background technology
The message exchange topic (thread) of chat, email exchange, text message transmission etc. can include can
It can be to the information of one or more of participant sensitivity (for example, secret).Participant in message exchange topic may expect
At least some contents of message exchange topic are not preserved (for example, in daily record) or at least can be with its original sensitive shapes
Formula obtains.If participating user is considered as sensitive activity by user, many Internet, applications allow users to the application
Be transformed into secret state (for example, " Off the Record (being not recorded in case) ", " Incognito mode (stealthy pattern) ",
" InPrivate " etc.) however, in most cases-especially such as chat client, text messaging clients,
Under the message exchange client case of email client, this transformation must manually be started by user.In addition, user also must
It must make using disengaging secret state；This usually will not automatically occur, especially in message exchange client.Therefore, user
Originally the information for preferring that secret is kept not retain either unexpectedly may be retained or be stored (for example, in message
Transcription (transcript) in switch log, as message exchange topic etc.) because user forgets to make to apply to be converted to secret
State.This information retained may potentially be exposed to unauthorized party.Similarly, make such as to chat if user forgets
The application of its client is detached from secret state, then the user may unexpectedly lose the user and will prefer originally in reservation
Hold.
Invention content
This specification is usually dedicated to a kind of technology, which is used for based on related to message and/or participant itself
Connection various signals come automatically make using (in particular so that can user (for example, such as chat application, Email visitor
Family end, the web page etc. for promoting message exchange topic) between exchange the application of those of message) be transformed into secret state (and
Under some cases, it is detached from secret state).Once under secret state, so that it may so as to be considered as the information of sensitive (for example, secret)
Fuzzy (for example, the word or expression of name or other sensitivities can be scrambled), or application can be to avoid storage (example
Such as, in daily record or the transcription of message exchange topic) sensitive information.
To automatically apply be transformed into secret state (in some cases, from secret state be detached from) can have it is multiple excellent
Point.This may include reducing interactive quantity required between user and their equipment, thus reduces and handles needed for this information
Processing etc..In addition, in some cases, the safety of user data can get a promotion, for example, because data do not stored or
Person thickens.
It in various embodiments, can be for example in the individual message exchange client operated by individual participant
And/or it is intensively checked at the one or more servers for promoting message exchange topic between one or more participants just
In the message exchange topic of progress.Based on inspection, it may be determined that (for example, calculating) is used as ongoing message exchange topic
Another the one or more message being oriented in participant by one in participant of a part can be by least given ginseng
It is considered as the possibility of secret with person.This possibility can be determined in various ways based on various signals.
In some embodiments, can the content of message based on one or more itself determine possibility.For example,
In some embodiments, certain phrases can be classified as " privacy trigger phrases (privacy triggering phrase) ", institute
It states " privacy trigger phrases " when detected, makes to be grasped by the participant of ongoing message exchange topic
One or more message exchange clients of work are transformed into secret state.It may include such as " off that these privacies, which trigger phrase,
The record (being not recorded in case) ", " let ' s keep this between us (let us is kept secret) ", " can you
Promise to not tell anyone (you, which can guarantee, does not tell anyone)" etc. phrase.In some such embodiment party
In formula, one or more message that phrase is triggered immediately following privacy as (and in some instances, prior to) can not be retained,
For example, until user manually makes message exchange client be detached from secret state or until detecting that discussion topic has changed
Until becoming less sensitive theme.
In other embodiments, the combination of specific n-gram (n-grams) or n-gram can be used (no matter they are
It is no adjacent) to trigger it is converted to secret state.For example, it is assumed that user is by sentence " I heard Bill is getting fired
Because he was caught stealing money (I hears that Bill is unemployed because he is caught money steathily) " are provided
Into message exchange topic.The n-gram of such as " fired (unemployed) ", " caught (by catching) " and " stealing (stealing) "
It can individually or in conjunction trigger and be transformed into secret state.In some embodiments, one or more of n-gram is tied
It closes entity name (for example, " Bill ") and can trigger and change this secret state.In some such embodiments, when in secret shape
When under state, the sentence is blurred (example when can be retained (for example, part of the transcription as message exchange topic) at it
Such as, " (I hears * because of * quilts to I heard*is getting fired because*was caught stealing money
Catch money steathily and be unemployed)) so that potentially the n-gram of user identifier is no longer available.In other embodiments, whole
A sentence by edit and proof or can be simply not stored in message exchange topic.
Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, associated with one or more message exchange participants
One or more of the other signal is determined for the one or more message exchanged in message exchange topic can be by least one
A participant is considered as the possibility of secret.In some embodiments, it may be considered that with one in message exchange topic participant
It is a or multiple associated or in some cases usually with message exchange topic participant (that is, other message exchange topics
In participant) associated historical behavior.Historical behavior may include for example one or more participants browsing history, by
One or more participants utilize, by one or more participants couple and message exchange client the history of browser secret state
The history of associated secret state is held to utilize.For example, it is assumed that one or more in the message exchange topic that employer facilitates
A employee then manually makes them when being discussed a part for the message exchange topic that some theme is facilitated as the employer
Corresponding message exchange client is converted to secret state.In various embodiments, " can learn " related to these employees
This historical behavior of connection so that similar behavior can be detected and trigger later is automatically transitioned to secret state.
In some embodiments, machine learning model (such as convolutional Neural net of one or more training may be used
Network model and/or recurrent neural networks model) determine that message exchange content can be considered as secret by one or more participants
Possibility.It is, for example, possible to use manually making message exchange client be transformed into secret state with message exchange topic participant
Example associated label training example machine learning model is trained.The feature of these training examples may include
Such as the n-gram included in message exchange topic, the phrase included in message exchange topic are (for example, " can you
Keep this between us (you can keep secret between us) "), context clue (for example, the identity of participant,
The position etc. of participant), historical user's behavior associated with one or more participants etc..Once machine learning model is instructed
Practice, so that it may with for example operation information exchange client individual computing device at or in promoting message exchange topic
The machine learning model is applied across multiple input at the node of centre, to determine one or more message exchange topics of given input

Paint) how can be in response to there is at least one of ongoing message exchange topic participant can be by the message exchange topic
Content be considered as sensitive abundant determining for possibility and be transformed into one or more examples of secret state.Fig. 4 A and Fig. 4 B
Client terminal device 1061Including showing screen 140.Show that screen 140 further includes system interface components 481,482,483, it is described
System interface components 481,482,483 can be interacted by user so that client terminal device 1061Execute one or more actions.
In Figure 4 A, client terminal device 106 is operated1First message exchange topic the participant (" You in Fig. 4 A
(you) ") first message of " I want to tell you something (I wants to tell you thing) ... " is provided
Into ongoing message exchange topic.Another participant Sally replies " What is it (what)" first participant
Then " Can you keep this between us are said (you can keep secret between us)" in various embodiments
In, such sentence can be considered as " privacy triggers phrase (privacy trigger phrase) ", and described " privacy triggering is short
Language " when detected, makes the message exchange client 107 (not describing in Fig. 4 A) operated by first participant be transformed into secret
State (or whether be ready to be transformed into secret state at least with them and prompt first participant).As noted above,
It may include other similar phrases that privacy, which triggers phrase, such as " off the record (being not recorded in case) ", " let ' s
Keep this between us (let us is kept secret) ", " can you promise to not tell anyone (you
It can guarantee and do not tell anyone)" etc..In some such embodiments, it can not retain immediately following (or in some cases
Under, prior to) as privacy trigger phrase one or more message, for example, until first participant manually makes message hand over
Change client be detached from secret state until or until detect discussion topic have changed for less sensitive theme until.Cause
This, for example, in the transcription or daily record of ongoing message exchange topic, " Ok (good) " that can not retain Sally replies
And the message content (that is, the content impaled by frame 480) hereafter provided by first participant.Additionally or alternatively, exist
In some embodiments, the message exchanged later immediately following transformation can be blurred (example before being stored in transcription or daily record
Such as, it is replaced with meaningless text or symbol, or by edit and proof).
Privacy triggering phrase can be configured or learnt over time and manually.For example, privacy triggers phrase
Can be simply that message exchange topic is determined by machine learning model (together with one or more of the other input) application
Message exchange topic can be considered as a component of the topic content 212 (referring to Fig. 2) of sensitive possibility by participant.At some
It, can be in message exchange topic participant immediately in manually making message exchange client 107 be transformed into secret in embodiment
Study privacy triggering phrase when certain phrases are provided before or after state.Thus, for example, when more message exchange topics are joined
With person in statement as " Can we keep this on the down low (we can keep a low profile)" the same something it
Preceding or when their message exchange client 107 being made to be transformed into secret state later, such phrase is used as to engineering
Practise a part for more and more training examples that model is trained.Certainly, message exchange topic can be in response to other institutes
Meaning " non-privacy triggering phrase " and be detached from secret state.For example, such as " on a lighter note (saying a little easily) ... "
Or the phrase of " let ' s go back on the record (let us, which returns to, places on record) " can trigger one or more
Message exchange client 107 is converted to non-secret state from secret state.
In addition to privacy triggers phrase or privacy is replaced to trigger phrase, in some embodiments, individually or in conjunction
The one or more n-gram for forming a part for message exchange topic content are used as signal.In figure 4b, for example, behaviour
Make client terminal device 1061First message exchange that topic participant will " Guess what (guess what occurs)"
One message is provided into ongoing message exchange topic.Another participant Sally replies " What (what)" the first ginseng
" Bob got fired for stealing $ are then declared with person (Bob is unemployed because stealing money)！" in various embodiments
In, the various n-gram of such sentence (name (" Bob ") of such as specific known entities or other n-gram (such as
" fired (unemployed) ", " steal (stealing) ")) it can individually or in conjunction trigger the message exchange operated by first participant
Client 107 (not describing in Fig. 4 B) is transformed into whether secret state (or is ready to be transformed into secret state at least with them
And prompt first participant).Additionally, although all triggering n-gram in Fig. 4 B are comprised in and are carried out by first participant
In single statement, but this be not intended to it is restrictive.In various embodiments, carry out freely different participants to provide not
The n-gram of same message can also be conveniently used in combination is transformed into secret state to trigger message exchange client.
The example of a part for the transcription of the preservation of discribed message exchange topic in Fig. 4 C depictions 4B.In this example
In, the message of the statement " Bot got fired for stealing $ (Bob is unemployed because stealing money) " from first participant
It is obscured at least partly so that name " Bob " and n-gram " stealing (stealing) " have been scrambled.In various embodiments
In, other people check the sentence of potential sensitivity in order to prevent, can retain this content, rather than uncensored content.
In addition to it can trigger message exchange client and be converted to the signal of the upper surface of secret state mark or instead of the letter
Number, in some embodiments, the general topic of discussion (individually or in combination with the various aspects of historical user's behavior) can be with
Triggering is transformed into secret state.For example, in some embodiments, to such as health problem, vulgar language, politics, personal letter
The discussion of the topic of the potential sensitivity of breath, financial information etc. can make message exchange client (or participate in message exchange topic
All message exchange clients) it is converted to secret state.Certainly, the triggering of which topic be transformed into secret state can be with the time
Passage and change and/or develop.For example, and as set forth above, it is possible to over time continuously to various engineerings
Model is practised to be trained to identify when discussing the topic of potential sensitivity.For example, can be with indicating in message exchange topic
Middle discussion specific topics and one or more message exchange topic participant manually makes their corresponding message exchange clients
End is converted to the training example of the example of secret state to be trained to one or more machine learning models.
It additionally or alternatively, can be with indicating that specific topics and one or more are discussed in message exchange topic
Message exchange client is automatically transitioned to secret state, and (and corresponding participant does not provide negative-feedback or provides positive and negative
Feedback) the training example of example one or more machine learning models are trained.It can be come from using similar technology
Message exchange client is set to be detached from secret state dynamicly.For example, it is assumed that one or more of message exchange topic participant is just
Sensitive topic is being discussed, this makes one or more of their corresponding message exchange clients 107 be transformed into secret state.
It is also supposed that discussion topic is changed to less sensitive topic by participant.In various embodiments, the change of topic can trigger
One or more message exchange clients 107 transform back into non-secret state (wherein message exchange topic content from secret state
It is not blurred and is retained in the form of the machine).
Various technologies may be used to determine the discussion topic in message exchange topic.It in some embodiments, can be with
Such as it is marked using one or more topic classifiers on the basis of using the progress of the sliding window of message exchange topic content
Know the one or more actualites discussed.Topic classifier can take machine learning model or the shape of rule-based model
Formula.Using the topic classifier based on machine learning, in some embodiments, topic classifier can be trained to carry
For indicating whether to discuss the output (for example, binary system output or probability) of specific topics.It in other embodiments, can be with
Topic classifier is trained to provide the output for indicating whether discussing multiple and different topics.For example, topic classification
Device may be configured to provide the output of possibility or confidence level that instruction is discussing multiple and different topics.In some implementations
In mode, only there is those of the possibility/confidence level for meeting one or more threshold values topic can be identified as discussion topic.
In other embodiments, only n highest possibility/confidence level topic can be identified as discussion topic.
As described above, in addition to the content of message exchange topic, ongoing message exchange topic can also be being determined
Content be likely to consider other signals when being considered as sensitive possibility by least one message exchange topic participant.One
In a little embodiments, it can analyze related to the one or more client terminal devices 106 operated by message exchange topic participant
The context signal or clue (for example, sensing data 204 in Fig. 2) of connection.Assuming that particular message exchanges topic participant tendency
In being manually converted to message exchange client during particular moment and/or while participant is in specific position
Secret state.In various embodiments, it is in identical specific position during at the time of those are identical and/or in participant
While middle, the message exchange client of participant can automatically be made to be transformed into secret state.
In some embodiments, the state of the one or more application operated on client terminal device 106 can also be used
In determining that it is quick that the content of ongoing message exchange topic is likely to be considered as by least one message exchange topic participant
The possibility of sense.Assuming that operation information exchanges the particular message exchange topic participant of client 107 on client terminal device 106
Also web browser is made to open client terminal device 106, and the web browser is manually converted to secret state.In some realities
It applies in mode, especially if participant's (or participant is usually) tends to make message while browsing under secret state
Exchange client 107 and be transformed into secret state, then the fact that web browser is currently at secret state can (individually or with this
In combination with other signals described in text) triggering message exchange client be also converted to secret state.More generally, one
In a little embodiments, when message exchange client 107 be transformed into secret state (by message exchange participant manually or
When in the case of no negative-feedback automatically), what is operated on the client terminal device 106 of participant one or more of the other answers
One or more states are used as the feature of vector, and the vector is used as training example and comes (further) to machine
Learning model is trained.
Message exchange topic content can also be considered as sensitivity determining one or more message exchange topic participants
Possibility when consider document (for example, 208 in Fig. 2) various aspects.Assuming that user makes document be stored in his client
On end device 106 (and/or in cloud storage portion), and the document is configured with stringent safeguard protection (for example, by close
Code protection, finite population be able to access that user, be encrypted etc.).In some embodiments, with the document and/or its yuan of number
Sensitivity can be marked as based on stringent safeguard protection according to associated topic.In some embodiments, it is handed in message
The message exchange client operated by the owner can be triggered to the discussion of such topic by changing the owner in topic by document
107 are transformed into secret state.Additionally or alternatively, if document owner or another message exchange topic are in message exchange
Document (for example, license etc. that the link to document is provided, accesses document) is specifically quoted in topic, then can make to be handed over by message
The one or more message exchange clients 107 for changing participant's operation of topic are transformed into secret state.
Although example described herein has usually included multiple mankind's message exchange topic participants, this is unexpectedly
It is being restrictive.As noted above, in some embodiments, message exchange topic can reside in single mankind's ginseng
Between person and non-human participant (such as automating assistant).In some such embodiments, institute herein may be used
The technology of description automatically makes the message exchange client used by mankind participant be transformed into secret state, for example, to keep away
Exempt to retain or keeps the message exchanged with automation assistant fuzzy.
In some embodiments, it is possible to which technology described herein can be used for fuzzy or keep away in other ways
Exempt to remain in the message exchanged between pure non-human participant.For example, from different applications, domain (for example, and food delivering
Automation assistant exchanges the personal automation assistant of message) etc. the message energy base that exchanges between associated multiple automation assistants
In comprising being likely to be considered as to one or more mankind (for example, one or more of automation assistant just represents its action
User and/or the user by automating one or more of assistant service) message of sensitive content is blurred and/or not
Storage.
Assuming that first man is buying the birthday gift of second people.It is also supposed that two individual propensities in for example by residence
In independent interactive speaker operation same automation assistant interaction.If first man participates in utilizing automation assistant's
People searches for computer dialog suitable birthday gift, then first man is likely to exchange with automation assistant any
Message is considered as sensitivity, because first man will be not intended to second people and learn (consume) content.Therefore, assistant is automated
Identity that can for example in response to such as n-gram and second said the people of " birthday present (birthday gift) "
Or in response to as " (what life I should buy to What should I got Alice for her birthday to Alice
Day present)" the same speech and be transformed into automation assistant and stop retaining first man and automate people between assistant to meter
The secret state of the content of calculation machine dialogue.Additionally or alternatively, if first man uses such as message exchange client
107 graphic user interface talks with automation assistant, then message exchange client 107 can be transformed into secret state.When
Such as the mankind are when discussing topic (such as financial, healthy or known or study is sensitive other topics) of potential sensitivity, it can
It can be in people to becoming the similar transformation of secret state during computer dialog.
Fig. 5 be illustrate according to the content of the determination message exchange topic of embodiment disclosed herein can by one or
Multiple participants are considered as sensitive and one or more message exchange clients or other components are made to be transformed into secret state
The flow chart of the exemplary method 500 of possibility.For convenience, the operation of flow chart is retouched with reference to the system for executing operation
It states.This system may include the various assemblies of various computer systems, one or more groups of such as privacy state system 120
Part.In addition, while showing the operation of method 500 with certain order, this is not intended to restrictive.It can be to one or more
A operation is resequenced, omitted or is added.
At block 502, the content of the ongoing message exchange topic of systems inspection.As noted above, at some
In embodiment, system can check the specific part of ongoing message exchange topic using sliding window.Various
In embodiment, the size of sliding window can in time and/or be spatially determined.For example, being examined the sliding of content
Window can only include from last x minutes of content, last y message etc. (wherein x be nonzero integer with y).In other realities
It applies in mode, can check each section of each message being incorporated into message exchange topic or even each message.Various
In embodiment, message exchange participant, which can have, disables this inspection (remaining operation of prevention method 500 is performed by this)
Option.
At block 504, system can be based at least partially on the inspection of block 502 to determine the content meeting of message exchange topic
It is considered as sensitive possibility by one or more message exchange topic participants.In some embodiments, it can be based solely on
The content (for example, the various combinations of privacy triggering phrase, n-gram, sensitive discussion topic etc.) of message exchange topic determines
This possibility.In other embodiments, additionally it can determine that this possibility, the other signals are all based on other signals
The sensing data of one or more client terminal devices of Tathagata free message exchange topic participant operation, by one or more
The history of message exchange participant storage or the document controlled in other ways, one or more message exchange topic participants
Behavior (is transformed into secret state or does not oppose to be automatically transitioned to private for example, participant when is made manually to trigger
Close state) etc..As noted above, in some embodiments, various inputs can be derived from message exchange topic content and/
Or it is derived from these other signals and is applied to machine learning model as input.Machine learning model can be trained
To provide the output of instruction possibility.
At block 506, system can determine whether the possibility determined at block 504 meets first threshold.If answered
For no (for example, the possibility that message exchange topic content can be considered as sensitivity by any participant is relatively low), then method 500 can
To continue back at block 502, and the inspection of message exchange topic content can be restarted.However, such as returning at fruit block 506
It is yes to answer, then method 500 may proceed to block 508.At block 508, system can determine that the possibility determined at block 504 is
No to meet second threshold, the second threshold in many cases can be higher than first threshold associated with block 506.Such as fruit block
Answer at 508 be (for example, message exchange content, which is very likely to, is considered as quick to one or message exchange topic participant
Sense), then method 500 may proceed to block 510.At block 510, it can automatically make to be joined by one or more message exchange topics
It is blurred with one or more message exchange clients content for being converted to message exchange topic of person's operation or does not retain
Secret state.
On the other hand, if the answer at fruit block 508 is no (for example, there are message exchange topic participants to hand over message
Change topic content and be considered as sensitive possibility but the uncertain so height of the possibility), then method 500 may proceed to block 512.
At block 512, message exchange client is set to be transformed into being permitted for secret state from one or more message exchange topic participants request
Can prompt can for example be provided as audible output or visual output by a message exchange client.At block 514, such as
Fruit participant authorizes requested license, then method 500 may proceed to previously described piece 510.Such as returning at fruit block 514
It is no to answer, then method 500 can continue back at block 502, and can not trigger the transformation for becoming secret state.
Block 510 is returned to, in some embodiments, system can participate in the other of message exchange topic to being being used
Message exchange client (or more generally, client terminal device) sends or one or more message exchange clients is made to send one
A or multiple privacy orders.These privacy orders can make recipient's message exchange client (or more generally, recipient client
End device) change (for example, be automatically, or in response to user provides license in prompt) into secret state.Although in Figure 5
Do not describe, but in some embodiments, the transmission of privacy order to various message exchange clients can be with 504 place of block
