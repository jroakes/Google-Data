Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to online advertising systems.
- the present disclosure more specifically relates to evaluating keyword performance for an online advertiser.
- Websites and other online sources may provide content to client devices relating to any number of different topics. For example, a first website may be devoted to the latest golf equipment and a second website may be devoted to automobiles. Users having an interest in a particular topic may navigate to an online content source related to that topic.
- a user may utilize a search engine to find online content of interest to the user. For example, a user may search the Internet for reviews of the latest golf equipment and the search engine may return a listing of websites devoted to reviewing golf equipment. The user may navigate between the various websites in the listing to receive content of relevance to the user.
- One implementation is a computerized method for evaluating keyword performance.

- online content such as an advertisement
- a search engine may receive advertising revenue by allowing an advertiser to place an advertisement with the search results, when certain keywords or phrases are queried.
- an online retailer of golf equipment may pay for the ability to place an advertisement whenever a user searches for the phrase “best golf clubs.”
- a provider of a website devoted to a particular topic may receive advertising revenue by allowing an advertiser to place an advertisement in conjunction with the website (e.g., embedded in a webpage, as a popup advertisement, etc.).
- An advertiser may opt to place an advertisement on such a website based on keywords or phrases found on the website.
- the online retailer of golf clubs may choose to place an advertisement on webpages that contain the phrase “golf clubs.”
- advertisers may compete for the ability to place an advertisement with search results or on a content provider's webpage.
- advertisers may participate in an advertising auction conducted by an advertising system, to determine which advertisement is served.
- the advertising system may user various factors to determine which advertisement is provided with the search results or a provider's webpage.
- the results of the auction may be based in part on an advertiser's bid or how well the advertiser's advertisement has previously performed.
- An advertising system may include various utilities to facilitate the purchasing of advertisement space on a search result webpage or a content provider's webpage.
- the advertising system may place bids in an auction on behalf of an advertiser, based on various parameters set by the advertiser.
- Such parameter may include, for example, the advertiser's budget (e.g., daily budget, monthly budget, total budget, etc.), the keywords or phrases on which the advertiser wishes to bid, whether the advertisement is to appear with search results from a search engine, and whether the advertisement is to appear on a content provider's webpage.
- the advertising system may be configured to adjust an advertiser's bids based on a target goal for the advertiser, such as the average amount of money the advertiser wishes to spend per advertisement that leads to a user making a purchase from the advertiser.
- an advertising system may be configured to report on various performance metrics for an advertiser's advertisements.
- Performance metrics may include, but are not limited to, how many times an advertiser's advertisement was provided to a user, a click through rate (“CTR”), a cost per click (“CPC”), a conversion rate (“CVR”), and a cost per action (“CPA”).
- CTR click through rate
- CPC cost per click
- CVR conversion rate
- CPA cost per action
- a conversion refers to a user performing a certain type of action associated with an advertisement. For example, a conversion may be the user clicking on the advertisement and making a purchase at the advertiser's website, downloading software from the advertiser's website, adding his or her contact information to a contact list, etc.
- a CPC or CVR value may be calculated by dividing the amount of money spent by the advertiser by the number of clicks or conversions for the advertisement.
- Performance metrics may be associated with a particular keyword or set of keywords used to determine whether the advertiser is to participate in an advertising auction.
- the advertiser may specify different sets of words or phrases to the advertising system, as part of an advertising campaign. Whenever a user searches for the corresponding words or phrases, a bid may be generated on behalf of the advertiser in an advertising auction.
- an advertiser may specify that they wish to advertise whenever a user searches for the phrases “best golf clubs” or “golf club ratings.”
- the different sets of words may have different performance metrics. For example, assume that an advertisement has a CTR of 6% when the phrase “best golf clubs” is searched and a CTR of 11% when the phrase “golf club ratings” is searched. In such a case, the advertiser may choose to stop using the phrase “best golf clubs,” to devote more of the advertiser's budget to the higher performing phrase.
- a performance metric for a set of one or more keywords associated with an advertisement may not be a reliable predictor of future user interactions with the advertisement. For example, assume that an advertisement is presented to users that search for “best golf clubs” a total of two times. Also, assume that one of the two users clicks on the advertisement. In such a case, the CTR associated with “best golf clubs” would be 50%. However, this performance metric is not a reliable predictor of how future users will react to the advertisement, due to its low sample size. For example, the CTR may drop to 5% after the advertisement is presented two hundred times to users. Thus, a performance metric for a set of keywords may be more or less reliable based on how many times its associated advertisements are presented to users.
- the reliability of a performance metric may be quantified and presented to an advertiser.
- the advertising system may present an advertiser with a report that lists the performance metrics for different sets of keywords and a measure of the reliability of the performance metrics.
- the reliability of a performance metric may be based on a confidence interval.
- a confidence interval provides a range of values in which the actual performance metric may exist. For example, an advertisement that was presented twice and clicked once may have a CTR of 50% and a confidence interval for its CTR of 0.0945-0.9055, using a 95% confidence interval. In other words, there is a 95% confidence that a subsequent CTR for the advertisement after further impressions lies somewhere between 0.0945-0.9055.
- an advertisement that was presented one hundred times and clicked fifty times may have the same CTR of 50%, but a confidence interval for its CTR of 0.4038-0.5962. Since the second example has many more data points than the first example, the confidence interval for its CTR is much smaller, indicating a higher degree of reliability than in the first example.
- the confidence intervals across multiple sets of keywords may be sorted. Sorting the confidence intervals may allow an advertiser or other interested party to identify the highest or lowest performing sets of keywords, as well as how reliable their corresponding performance metrics are.

- webpage 206 may include an input field 208 configured to receive a search query.
- Input field 208 may be part of a search results webpage to allow a user to dynamically change a search query or may be on a separate webpage.
- the search results may be displayed on webpage 206 automatically (i.e., without further input from a user), or in response to a request to perform the search. For example, a user may press the Enter key on a keyboard to perform the search or select icon 210 using a pointing device.
- webpage 206 may be generated to include one or more hotlinks 212 - 216 .
- Hotlinks 212 - 216 may link to various webpages related to the topic of the query, car insurance.
- hotlink 212 may link to a webpage that provides consumer tips regarding car insurance.
- webpage 206 may also include an advertisement 218 which is selected in part on the search query entered via input field 208 .
- “car insurance” may be part of a set of keywords used within an advertising auction.
- an auction server such as auction server 104 , may generate bids on behalf of advertisers and conduct an advertisement auction.
- a particular advertiser that has selected the set of keywords as part of his or her auction parameters may place an automatically generated bid in an advertisement auction. If the advertiser is the winning bidder, advertisement 218 may be selected from the winner and provided to client 102 for presentation with webpage 206 .
- Bids in the advertisement auction may be based in part on predicted user behaviors regarding the selected advertisements. For example, an impression for advertisement 218 may correspond to advertisement 218 simply being presented to the user of client 102 . If advertisement 218 includes a hotlink to a website of the advertiser, another user action for advertisement 218 may correspond to the user of client 102 clicking on advertisement 218 . A further user action may correspond a conversion, where the user of client 102 performs a desired action while on the advertiser's website (e.g., making a purchase, downloading software, registering for a user account or marketing promotions, etc.).

- the history data may be indicative of the number of times an advertisement was selected in an advertising auction and provided to a client device, the bid amount or other financial cost for the advertiser to provide the advertisement to the client device, whether the advertisement was clicked or otherwise selected at the client device (e.g., via an input device such as a mouse, touch screen display, etc.), and/or user actions performed at the client device subsequent to the advertisement being clicked (e.g., making a purchase at the advertiser's website, registering for a user account, etc.).
- a client identifier such as a cookie, may be set on the client device that is provided the advertisement.
- Such a cookie may be used, for example, to gather history data regarding whether the client device is redirected to the advertiser's website in response to the advertisement being clicked.
- the history data may be from any period of time or a specific period of time (e.g., the past n-number of days).
- the history data may be aggregated for multiple advertisers that use the same or similar sets of keywords as auction parameters.
- the received history data may be associated with a set of one or more keywords.
- an advertiser may specify a set of one or more keywords to control when advertisements from the advertiser are to be provided to a client device. For example, a user's search query at a search engine may be compared to the set of one or more keywords. If the keywords in the set match the search query, the advertiser may participate in an advertisement auction to compete for the ability to provide an advertisement with the search results. Similarly, a set of keywords may be used to determine whether a website being visited by a client device contains text that matches the keywords. If so, the advertiser may compete in an advertisement auction to place an advertisement on the visited webpage.
- the order in which the keywords appear in a search query or on a webpage may or may not be exact for there to be a match, according to some implementations.
- an advertiser may specify that an exact phrase must be entered as a search query if the advertiser is to compete for the ability to place an advertisement with the search results.
- a set of keywords may have an associated advertisement or multiple advertisements.
- an online retailer running a sale on golf clubs may have multiple advertisements to notify users about the sale.
- the advertiser may associate one or more of the advertisements with a particular set of keywords.
- the advertiser may associate two advertisements with a first set of keywords and three advertisements with a second set of keywords.
- a quality score e.g., how well the content of the advertisement matches the topic of the search or website.
- various grouping techniques may be used to categorize sets of keywords.
- sets of keywords having similar concepts may be grouped and evaluated together. For example, assume that a first and second set of keywords both relate to shopping. In such a case, the history data for both sets may be aggregated, to evaluate the general concept of shopping.
- concepts may belong to a preexisting hierarchy of concepts or product categories. For example, a sets of keywords related to mobile telephones may be grouped in the category/Shopping/Electronic Devices/Mobile Telephones.
- sets of keywords may be grouped as n-grams, e.g., sets that contain the same word or words, or grouped based on user-defined words or phrases.
- Process 400 optionally includes removing low-impression data from consideration (block 404 ).
- an advertisement having an impression count below a threshold value may be ignored from consideration when evaluating the performance of its set of keywords.
- the set itself may be removed from further evaluation if the impression count for its associated advertisements is below the threshold value.
- a set of one or more keywords may be excluded from performance comparisons with other sets, if the set has less than ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, or any number of impressions.
- the threshold value may be set to a value between one hundred and one thousand impressions.
- Process 400 includes determining one or more performance metrics using the history data (block 406 ).
- the history data may be analyzed to determine a performance metric for an advertisement associated with a set of one or more keywords. For example, assume that an advertiser has specified that an advertisement is to be provided with search results, whenever a user searches using the phrase “parking near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.” In such a case, performance metrics regarding the performance of the advertisement may be determined using the history data.
- a performance metric may be a CTR, CPC, CVR, or CPA.
- the advertisement associated with the phrase “parking near the Leaning Tower of Pisa” is provided one hundred times with search results and the advertisement was clicked ten times, the advertisement may have a CTR of 10%. Therefore, this CTR may also be used as a performance metric for the phrase itself.
- Process 400 includes determining a confidence for the one or more performance metrics (block 408 ).
- a confidence interval provides a measure of reliability for a statistical value, such as a performance metric.
- a confidence interval includes upper and lower limit values in which the true performance metric may be found, to a certain degree of confidence. Any number of different calculations may be used to determine the confidence interval, according to various implementations.
- the confidence interval may be a binomial proportion confidence interval based on the number of impressions and the performance metric.
- Such a binomial proportion confidence interval may be calculated as a normal approximation interval, a Wilson interval, a Clopper-Pearson interval, or any other form of binomial proportion confidence interval.
- a Wilson interval may be calculated as follows:
- z 1- ⁇ /2 is the 1- ⁇ /2 percentile of the standard distribution.
- z 1- ⁇ /2 may be set to a value of 1.96, to obtain a 95% confidence interval.
- the calculated CTR for the set will be 0.054. Based on this CTR, it may be assumed that 5.4% of users that are presented the advertisement based on the set of one or more keyword will also click on the advertisement. However, a 95% Wilson confidence interval gives a confidence interval of 0.038-0.076. Therefore, there is a 95% degree of confidence that the long-term CTR for the set will be somewhere between 0.038-0.076. In contrast, now assume that the advertisement was presented 5,555 times and clicked by users three hundred times. In such a case, the CTR will still be 0.054, but the 95% Wilson confidence interval will shrink to the range of 0.048-0.060.
- Process 400 includes sorting the confidence intervals (block 410 ).
- the confidence intervals for the performance metrics may be sorted based on their upper or lower bounds. The sort may be performed optimistically or pessimistically, depending on whether the intervals are sorted by their upper or lower bounds. For example, sorting confidence intervals for CTRs or CVRs by their upper bounds may be viewed as an optimistic sort, since an advertiser may want a higher CTR or CVR than the currently calculated performance metric. Conversely, sorting confidence intervals for CPCs or CPAs by their lower bounds may also be viewed as an optimistic sort, since an advertiser may want a lower CPC or CPA.
- the confidence intervals may be sorted in ascending or descending order. For example, a descending, pessimistic sort of confidence intervals for CTRs may be quickly analyzed to determine the best performing sets of keywords. In another example, an ascending, optimistic sort may be quickly analyzed to determine the worst performing sets of keywords.
- the system may be configured to notify an advertiser of the best or worst performing sets of keywords, based on their sorted confidence intervals. For example, the worst performing sets of keywords may be suggested to an advertiser as negative keywords, e.g., keywords that do not trigger an advertisement from the advertiser. In some cases, the negative keywords may be automatically set for the advertiser, e.g., without further action from the advertiser. In another example, variations of any well performing sets of keywords may be suggested to the advertiser or automatically added as another set of keywords for the advertiser.
- Process 400 includes providing the sorted intervals (block 412 ). After the confidence intervals have been sorted, they may be provided to an electronic display or to a remote device for display. For example, the sorted intervals may be part of a generated performance report and presented on a display to an advertiser.
- the report may be an interactive report that allows an advertiser or other such party to specify report parameters. For example, an advertiser or other interested party may specify which performance metrics are to be presented in the interactive report, how the data in the report is to be sorted (e.g., ascending or descending), or which sets of keywords are to be compared in the report.
- performance report 500 may be an interactive report or a static report.
- performance report 500 include calculated performance information regarding the performance of different sets of keywords 516 - 526 .
- Which performance information is presented in performance report 500 may be specified by an advertiser. For example, an advertiser or other interested party may specify that performance report is to report on the CTR, CVR, CPC, CPA, or similar advertising-related performance metric of sets 516 - 526 .
- performance report 500 may be provided to an electronic display 502 in communication with a processing circuit.
- Example electronic displays include, but are not limited to, computer monitors, smart television sets, a display of a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, etc.), other displays for electronic devices.
- electronic display 502 may be a touch-screen display and configured to receive input and provide the input to its associated processing circuit.
- the processing circuit associated with electronic display 502 may generate performance report 500 .
- performance report 500 may be provided to the processing circuit from a remote device, such as an auction server or other electronic device that stores history data regarding online advertisements.
- Performance report 500 may include any number of columns and rows (e.g., as part of a grid of performance data).
- performance report 500 may include a keyword group column 504 , a performance column 506 , an average CTR column 510 , an impression count column 512 , and a click count column 514 .
- Other example columns include a CVR column, a CPC column, a CPA column, and columns regarding raw confidence intervals for the CTR, CVR, CPC, and CPA values.
- Rows in performance report 500 may include any number of sets 516 - 526 of keywords. Sets 516 - 526 may correspond to various phrases grouped by their common keywords, in some implementations.
- set 516 may include the query “parking for the Leaning Tower of Pisa” and set 518 may include the query “parking near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.”
- sets 516 , 518 may include search phrases that vary by one or more keywords.
- performance report 500 may be represented using other graphical techniques, such as charts, graphs, and the like.
- Average CTR column 510 may include performance metrics for sets 516 - 526 based on the raw data contained in impression count column 512 and click count column 514 .
- the value for a set of keywords in average CTR column 510 may be determined by dividing the corresponding impression count in column 512 by the click count in column 514 .
- Other data values and performance metrics may also be calculated and displayed in performance report 500 in a similar manner. For example, a conversion count may be included as another column in performance report 500 and a conversion rate may be calculated and displayed by dividing the conversion count by the impression count for a given set of keywords.
- a raw confidence interval may be generated and displayed as part of performance report 500 .
- each value in average CTR column 510 may have an associated CTR confidence interval (e.g., a raw CTR range).
- CTR confidence interval e.g., a raw CTR range
- Such information may be displayed numerically or graphically.
- a confidence interval may be displayed in performance report 500 as an icon having a larger or smaller width, depending on its range of values.
- confidence intervals may be sorted by their upper or lower bounds. For example, the confidence intervals for the average CTRs may be sorted in descending order, to order the confidence intervals optimistically (e.g., those CTRs having the highest potential true CTRs may be shown at the top of performance report 500 .
- performance column 506 may include data regarding a performance metric the advertiser wishes to optimize.
- performance column 506 may include normalized confidence ranges for a CPC performance metric.
- the normalized ranges in performance column 506 may be sorted via input to sort button 508 (e.g., to sort the entries in performance column 506 in ascending or descending order). The sort may be done optimistically or pessimistically (e.g., based on their upper or lower bounds). As shown, performance column 506 has been sorted optimistically in descending order.
- Entries further to the right in performance column 506 may be considered to be better performing than entries further to the left in performance column 506 .
- the more narrow the entry in performance column 506 the more confidence its corresponding performance metric has.
- the normalized values may be inverted, allowing performance column 506 to be shown consistently for all performance metrics.

Abstract
Systems and methods for evaluating keyword performance include receiving history data indicative of online actions performed regarding one or more advertisements. A set of one or more keywords may be associated with the one or more advertisements. A performance metric for the set of one or more keywords may be determined using the history data, as well as a confidence interval for the performance metric. Confidence intervals for the performance metrics of different sets of keywords may be sorted and provided.
Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to online advertising systems. The present disclosure more specifically relates to evaluating keyword performance for an online advertiser.
- Websites and other online sources may provide content to client devices relating to any number of different topics. For example, a first website may be devoted to the latest golf equipment and a second website may be devoted to automobiles. Users having an interest in a particular topic may navigate to an online content source related to that topic. In some cases, a user may utilize a search engine to find online content of interest to the user. For example, a user may search the Internet for reviews of the latest golf equipment and the search engine may return a listing of websites devoted to reviewing golf equipment. The user may navigate between the various websites in the listing to receive content of relevance to the user.
- Implementations of the systems and methods for evaluating keyword performance are described herein. One implementation is a computerized method for evaluating keyword performance. The method includes receiving, at a processing circuit, history data indicative of online actions performed regarding one or more advertisements, the one or more advertisements being associated with a set of one or more keywords used to select the one or more advertisements for presentation at client devices. The method also includes determining, by the processing circuit, a performance metric for the set of one or more keywords using the history data. The method yet further includes generating, by the processing circuit, a confidence interval for the performance metric for the set of one or more keywords. The method also includes sorting, by the processing circuit, a plurality of confidence intervals, each confidence interval being associated with a performance metric for a set of one or more keywords. The method further includes providing, by the processing circuit, the sorted confidence intervals.
- Another implementation is a system for evaluating keyword performance. The system includes a processing circuit operable to receive history data indicative of online actions performed regarding one or more advertisements, the one or more advertisements being associated with a set of one or more keywords used to select the one or more advertisements for presentation at client devices. The processing circuits is also operable to determine a performance metric for the set of one or more keywords using the history data and to generate a confidence interval for the performance metric for the set of one or more keywords. The processing circuit is further operable to sort a plurality of confidence intervals, each confidence interval being associated with a performance metric for a set of one or more keywords. The processing circuit is further operable to provide the sorted confidence intervals.
- A further implementation is a computer-readable storage medium having instructions therein, the instructions being executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform operations. The operations include receiving history data indicative of online actions performed regarding one or more advertisements, the one or more advertisements being associated with a set of one or more keywords used to select the one or more advertisements for presentation at client devices. The operations also include determining a performance metric for the set of one or more keywords using the history data. The operations further include generating a confidence interval for the performance metric for the set of one or more keywords and sorting a plurality of confidence intervals, each confidence interval being associated with a performance metric for a set of one or more keywords. The operations also include providing the sorted confidence intervals.
- These implementations are mentioned not to limit or define the scope of this disclosure, but to provide examples of implementations to aid in understanding thereof.
- The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims, in which:
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system; -
FIG. 2 is an illustration of an electronic display showing an example search result webpage; -
FIG. 3 is an illustration of an electronic display showing an example webpage; -
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process for evaluating keyword performance; and -
FIG. 5 is an illustration of an indication of keyword performance being provided to an electronic display. - Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
- According to some aspects of the present disclosure, online content, such as an advertisement, may be selected for a user and presented in conjunction with other online content. In some cases, a search engine may receive advertising revenue by allowing an advertiser to place an advertisement with the search results, when certain keywords or phrases are queried. For example, an online retailer of golf equipment may pay for the ability to place an advertisement whenever a user searches for the phrase “best golf clubs.” Similarly, a provider of a website devoted to a particular topic may receive advertising revenue by allowing an advertiser to place an advertisement in conjunction with the website (e.g., embedded in a webpage, as a popup advertisement, etc.). An advertiser may opt to place an advertisement on such a website based on keywords or phrases found on the website. For example, the online retailer of golf clubs may choose to place an advertisement on webpages that contain the phrase “golf clubs.”
- In some cases, advertisers may compete for the ability to place an advertisement with search results or on a content provider's webpage. For example, advertisers may participate in an advertising auction conducted by an advertising system, to determine which advertisement is served. The advertising system may user various factors to determine which advertisement is provided with the search results or a provider's webpage. For example, the results of the auction may be based in part on an advertiser's bid or how well the advertiser's advertisement has previously performed.
- An advertising system may include various utilities to facilitate the purchasing of advertisement space on a search result webpage or a content provider's webpage. In some implementations, the advertising system may place bids in an auction on behalf of an advertiser, based on various parameters set by the advertiser. Such parameter may include, for example, the advertiser's budget (e.g., daily budget, monthly budget, total budget, etc.), the keywords or phrases on which the advertiser wishes to bid, whether the advertisement is to appear with search results from a search engine, and whether the advertisement is to appear on a content provider's webpage. In some implementations, the advertising system may be configured to adjust an advertiser's bids based on a target goal for the advertiser, such as the average amount of money the advertiser wishes to spend per advertisement that leads to a user making a purchase from the advertiser.
- According to some implementations, an advertising system may be configured to report on various performance metrics for an advertiser's advertisements. Performance metrics may include, but are not limited to, how many times an advertiser's advertisement was provided to a user, a click through rate (“CTR”), a cost per click (“CPC”), a conversion rate (“CVR”), and a cost per action (“CPA”). In general, a conversion refers to a user performing a certain type of action associated with an advertisement. For example, a conversion may be the user clicking on the advertisement and making a purchase at the advertiser's website, downloading software from the advertiser's website, adding his or her contact information to a contact list, etc. A CPC or CVR value may be calculated by dividing the amount of money spent by the advertiser by the number of clicks or conversions for the advertisement.
- Performance metrics may be associated with a particular keyword or set of keywords used to determine whether the advertiser is to participate in an advertising auction. For example, the advertiser may specify different sets of words or phrases to the advertising system, as part of an advertising campaign. Whenever a user searches for the corresponding words or phrases, a bid may be generated on behalf of the advertiser in an advertising auction. For example, an advertiser may specify that they wish to advertise whenever a user searches for the phrases “best golf clubs” or “golf club ratings.” However, the different sets of words may have different performance metrics. For example, assume that an advertisement has a CTR of 6% when the phrase “best golf clubs” is searched and a CTR of 11% when the phrase “golf club ratings” is searched. In such a case, the advertiser may choose to stop using the phrase “best golf clubs,” to devote more of the advertiser's budget to the higher performing phrase.
- In some cases, a performance metric for a set of one or more keywords associated with an advertisement may not be a reliable predictor of future user interactions with the advertisement. For example, assume that an advertisement is presented to users that search for “best golf clubs” a total of two times. Also, assume that one of the two users clicks on the advertisement. In such a case, the CTR associated with “best golf clubs” would be 50%. However, this performance metric is not a reliable predictor of how future users will react to the advertisement, due to its low sample size. For example, the CTR may drop to 5% after the advertisement is presented two hundred times to users. Thus, a performance metric for a set of keywords may be more or less reliable based on how many times its associated advertisements are presented to users.
- According to various implementations, the reliability of a performance metric may be quantified and presented to an advertiser. For example, the advertising system may present an advertiser with a report that lists the performance metrics for different sets of keywords and a measure of the reliability of the performance metrics. In some implementations, the reliability of a performance metric may be based on a confidence interval. In general, a confidence interval provides a range of values in which the actual performance metric may exist. For example, an advertisement that was presented twice and clicked once may have a CTR of 50% and a confidence interval for its CTR of 0.0945-0.9055, using a 95% confidence interval. In other words, there is a 95% confidence that a subsequent CTR for the advertisement after further impressions lies somewhere between 0.0945-0.9055. In a second example, an advertisement that was presented one hundred times and clicked fifty times may have the same CTR of 50%, but a confidence interval for its CTR of 0.4038-0.5962. Since the second example has many more data points than the first example, the confidence interval for its CTR is much smaller, indicating a higher degree of reliability than in the first example. In some implementations, the confidence intervals across multiple sets of keywords may be sorted. Sorting the confidence intervals may allow an advertiser or other interested party to identify the highest or lowest performing sets of keywords, as well as how reliable their corresponding performance metrics are.
- Referring to
FIG. 1 , a block diagram of acomputer system 100 in accordance with a described implementation is shown.System 100 includes aclient 102 which communicates with other computing devices via anetwork 106.Client 102 may execute a web browser or other application to retrieve content from other devices overnetwork 106. For example,client 102 may communicate with any number ofcontent sources 108, 110 (e.g., a first content source through nth content source).Content sources client 102. In some implementations one or more ofcontent sources content sources computer system 100 may also include anauction server 104 configured to conduct an auction to select content to be provided toclient 102. For example,content source 108 may provide a webpage toclient 102 that includes an advertisement selected byauction server 104. -
Network 106 may be any form of computer network that relays information betweenclient 102,content sources auction server 104. For example,network 106 may include the Internet and/or other types of data networks, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a cellular network, satellite network, or other types of data networks.Network 106 may also include any number of computing devices (e.g., computer, servers, routers, network switches, gateways, etc.) that are configured to receive and/or transmit data withinnetwork 106.Network 106 may further include any number of hardwired and/or wireless connections. For example,client 102 may communicate wirelessly (e.g., via WiFi, cellular, radio, etc.) with a transceiver that is hardwired (e.g., via a fiber optic cable, a CAT5 cable, etc.) to other computing devices innetwork 106. -
Client 102 may be any number of different types of user electronic devices configured to communicate via network 106 (e.g., a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, a digital video recorder, a set-top box for a television, a video game console, combinations thereof, etc.).Client 102 is shown to include aprocessor 112 and amemory 114, i.e., a processing circuit.Memory 114 may store machine instructions that, when executed byprocessor 112cause processor 112 to perform one or more of the operations described herein.Processor 112 may include a microprocessor, ASIC, FPGA, etc., or combinations thereof.Memory 114 may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providingprocessor 112 with program instructions.Memory 114 may include a floppy disk, CD-ROM, DVD, magnetic disk, memory chip, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory, optical media, or any other suitable memory from whichprocessor 112 can read instructions. The instructions may include code from any suitable computer programming language such as, but not limited to, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, HTML, XML, Python and Visual Basic. -
Client 102 may include one or more user interface devices. A user interface device may be any electronic device that conveys data to a user by generating sensory information (e.g., a visualization on a display, one or more sounds, etc.) and/or converts received sensory information from a user into electronic signals (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, a pointing device, a touch screen display, a microphone, etc.). The one or more user interface devices may be internal to the housing of client 102 (e.g., a built-in display, microphone, etc.) or external to the housing of client 102 (e.g., a monitor connected toclient 102, a speaker connected toclient 102, etc.), according to various implementations. For example,client 102 may include anelectronic display 116, which displays webpages and other data received fromcontent sources auction server 104. -
Content sources client 102. For example,content sources client 102,content sources circuits comprising processors memories processors content source 108 may include instructions such as web server software, FTP serving software, and other types of software that causecontent source 108 to provide content vianetwork 106. - According to various implementations,
content sources client 102 that includes one or more content tags. In general, a content tag may be any piece of webpage code associated with including content, such as an advertisement, with a webpage. A content tag may, for example, define a slot on a webpage for additional content, a slot for out of page content (e.g., an interstitial slot), whether content should be loaded asynchronously or synchronously, whether the loading of content should be disabled on the webpage, whether content that loaded unsuccessfully should be refreshed, the network location of a content source that provides the content (e.g.,content sources auction server 104, etc.), a network location (e.g., a URL) associated with clicking on the content, how the content is to be rendered on a display, one or more keywords used to retrieve the content, and other functions associated with providing additional content with a webpage. For example,content source 108 may provide webpage data that causesclient 102 to retrieve an advertisement fromauction server 104. In another implementation, the advertisement may be selected byauction server 104 and provided bycontent source 108 as part of the webpage data sent toclient 102. - Similar to
content sources auction server 104 may be one or more electronic devices connected to network 106 that provide advertisements and/or other content toclient 102.Auction server 104 may be a computer server (e.g., FTP servers, file sharing servers, web servers, etc.) or a combination of servers (e.g., a data center, a cloud computing platform, etc.).Auction server 104 may include a processing circuit including aprocessor 120 and amemory 122 that stores program instructions executable byprocessor 120. The processing circuit ofauction server 104 may be configured to conduct an auction to select content to be provided toclient 102. For example,auction server 104 may select content, such as an advertisement, to be provided with a webpage served bycontent source auction server 104 is a combination of computing devices,processor 120 may represent the collective processors of the devices andmemory 122 may represent the collective memories of the devices. - In one implementation, an advertiser or other party may create an account with
auction server 104. Associated with the account may be data relating to which advertisements the advertiser wishes to use, a daily budget to spend, one or more sets of keywords that may be used byauction server 104 to select advertisements or other content to be displayed byclient 102, and other such parameters. Whenclient 102 visits a webpage that participates in the advertising network,auction server 104 may compare bids among advertisers or other parties to select content to be included on the webpage. In further implementations,auction server 104 may select an advertisement or other content that may be displayed as part of another application, such as a video game, email program, or the like. - After conducting an auction to select an advertisement,
auction server 104 may provide the selected advertisement toclient 102 or causeclient 102 to retrieve the advertisement. For example,auction server 104 may select content fromcontent source 110 to be included with a webpage served bycontent source 108. In another example,auction server 104 may provide the selected content toclient 102. In some implementations,auction server 104 may select content stored inmemory 114 ofclient 102. For example, previously provided content may be cached inmemory 114, content may be preloaded into memory 114 (e.g., as part of the installation of an application), or may exist as part of the operating system ofclient 102. In such a case,auction server 104 may provide an indication of the selection toclient 102. In response,client 102 may retrieve the selected content frommemory 114 and display it ondisplay 116. -
Auction server 104 may be configured to automatically manage budgets for advertisers having accounts onauction server 104. For example, an advertiser may specify a monthly budget and advertising goals to auctionserver 104. In response,auction server 104 may use the budget and advertising goals to generate auction bids on behalf of the advertiser. Advertising goals may specify desired user actions regarding a particular set of keywords for a topic. A set of keywords may be a set of one or more keywords used as part of an online search or appearing on a visited webpage. User actions specified by an advertiser may include a desired number of impressions (e.g., the number of times an advertisement is presented), clicks (e.g., the number of times a present advertisement is selected by a user), or conversions (e.g., the number of times a clicked advertisement led to the user making an online purchase or performing another such action). In some implementations, the advertiser may specify to auction server 104 a performance goal, such as a CTR, CVR, CPC, or CPA. - In one example, assume that an advertiser has specified a daily budget of $500, and that the advertiser wishes to reach three hundred users per day that search for golf-related webpages. In such a case, the advertiser may associate the advertising campaign with a golf-related set of keywords, e.g., a group of keywords that may be searched via a search engine or may appear on visited webpages. For example, a golf-related set of keywords may include the words “golf,” “hole in one,” “birdie,” etc. Such words may be identified within the text of a search query or appearing on a visited webpage, to identify the search query or webpage as being related to the topic of golf.
Auction server 104 may generate a bid for the advertiser based in part on these parameters, whenclient 102 is used to search for golf-related content or visit a golf-related webpage. If such a bid is the winning bid,auction server 104 may select an advertisement from the winning advertiser to be provided toclient 102. In some implementations, an advertiser may specify that a set of keywords is a phrase (e.g., a set of keywords appearing in a specific order). For example, the advertiser may specify that bids are only to be generated when a search query includes the exact phrase “best golf clubs 2012.” - According to various implementations,
auction server 104 may receive data indicative of user actions regarding its selected advertisements. For example,auction server 104 may receive an indication from client 102 (e.g., based on a content tag of a visited webpage) or from one of content sources 108-110 that a particular advertisement was clicked after being provided toclient 102. Similarly,auction server 104 may receive an indication fromclient 102 or from one of content sources 108-110 that the user performed a certain action while on the advertiser's website. For example, a cookie may be set onclient 102 when the user ofclient 102 completes an online purchase, subscribes to a marketing list, adds an item to an online shopping cart, downloads software from the advertiser, or performs any other online user action. -
Auction server 104 may be configured to report on various metrics regarding the performance of an advertiser's advertisements. In some implementations,auction server 104 may determine one or more performance metrics for any of the advertisements associated with a set of one or more keywords. For example,auction server 104 may determine a CTR, CVR, CPC, CPA, or other performance metric for the one or more advertisements associated with a set of keywords. If an advertiser has specified different sets of keywords as auction parameters,auction server 104 may generate a report that compares the various performance metrics for the different sets. For example, assume that an advertiser specifies that an advertisement is to be presented when users search for the phrases “parking near the Leaning Tower of Pisa” and “parking for the Leaning Tower of Pisa.” Thus, the phrases may differ by using either “near” or “for” in the phrases. Based on this slight difference, the performance metrics for the advertisement may differ based on which phrase is searched by a user. For example, the phrase “parking near the Leaning Tower of Pisa” may have a CTR of 0.19 and the phrase “parking for the Leaning Tower of Pisa” may have a CTR of 0.24. - According to various implementations,
auction server 104 may determine a value or range of values to quantify the reliability of a performance metric for a set of one or more keywords. In some implementations,auction server 104 may calculate an associated confidence interval for a performance metric. In general, a confidence interval is a statistical measure of the reliability of a performance metric and signifies that the performance metric's true value falls within the interval with a certain degree of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval represents the range of values for a performance metric, with a 95% confidence (e.g., there is a 95% chance that the performance metric will converge to a value within the interval after more data points are obtained). - In general, the smaller the range of values in a confidence interval, the more reliable the value of the performance metric. For example, a CTR of 50% that has a confidence interval of 0.4 to 0.6 may be viewed as being more reliable than a CTR of 50% that has a confidence interval of 0.1 to 0.9. In some implementations,
auction server 104 may provide a raw confidence interval for a performance metric as part of a report to an electronic device of an advertiser. In other implementations, the confidence intervals may be normalized and/or aggregated across different performance metrics. For example, the overall performance of a set of one or more keywords may be represented in a report fromadvertising server 104 by normalizing the confidence intervals for the set's CTR, CPC, CVR, or CPA. In various implementations,auction server 104 may present the actual range of a confidence interval or as a graphical icon. For example, a report may graphically depict the confidence intervals across different sets of keywords, so that an advertiser may quickly determine which performance metrics are the most reliable. - Referring now to
FIG. 2 , an illustration is shown ofelectronic display 116 displaying an examplesearch result webpage 206.Electronic display 116 is in electronic communication withprocessor 112 which causes visual indicia to be displayed onelectronic display 116. For example,processor 112 may execute aweb browser 200 stored inmemory 114 ofclient 102, to retrieve and display content from other networked devices.Web browser 200 may operate by receiving input of a uniform resource locator (URL) via afield 202 from an input device (e.g., a pointing device, a keyboard, a touchscreen, etc.). For example, the URL, http://www.example.org/search, may be entered intofield 202.Processor 112 may use the inputted URL to request data from a content source having a network address that corresponds to the entered URL. In response to the request, the content source may return webpage data and/or other data toclient 102 which may be used byclient 102 to cause visual indicia to be displayed byelectronic display 116. -
Web browser 200 displayed onelectronic display 116 may include a number of navigational controls associated withwebpage 206. For example,web browser 200 may be used to go back or forward to other webpages using inputs 204 (e.g., a back button, a forward button, etc.).Web browser 200 may also include one ormore scroll bars 220, which can be used to display parts ofwebpage 206 that are currently off-screen. For example,webpage 206 may be formatted to be larger than the screen ofelectronic display 116. In such a case, the one ormore scroll bars 220 may be used to change the vertical and/or horizontal position ofwebpage 206 onelectronic display 116. -
Webpage 206 may include search results from an online search engine (i.e., a search engine that catalogs multiple websites, a search engine that searches within a particular website, etc.). In some implementations,webpage 206 may include aninput field 208 configured to receive a search query.Input field 208 may be part of a search results webpage to allow a user to dynamically change a search query or may be on a separate webpage. After entry of a search query, the search results may be displayed onwebpage 206 automatically (i.e., without further input from a user), or in response to a request to perform the search. For example, a user may press the Enter key on a keyboard to perform the search orselect icon 210 using a pointing device. - In the example shown, assume that a user of
client 102 has entered the search query “car insurance” intoinput field 208 and has requested a search viaicon 210. In such a case,webpage 206 may be generated to include one or more hotlinks 212-216. Hotlinks 212-216 may link to various webpages related to the topic of the query, car insurance. For example, hotlink 212 may link to a webpage that provides consumer tips regarding car insurance. - In some implementations,
webpage 206 may also include anadvertisement 218 which is selected in part on the search query entered viainput field 208. For example, “car insurance” may be part of a set of keywords used within an advertising auction. If so, an auction server, such asauction server 104, may generate bids on behalf of advertisers and conduct an advertisement auction. For example, a particular advertiser that has selected the set of keywords as part of his or her auction parameters may place an automatically generated bid in an advertisement auction. If the advertiser is the winning bidder,advertisement 218 may be selected from the winner and provided toclient 102 for presentation withwebpage 206. - Bids in the advertisement auction may be based in part on predicted user behaviors regarding the selected advertisements. For example, an impression for
advertisement 218 may correspond toadvertisement 218 simply being presented to the user ofclient 102. Ifadvertisement 218 includes a hotlink to a website of the advertiser, another user action foradvertisement 218 may correspond to the user ofclient 102 clicking onadvertisement 218. A further user action may correspond a conversion, where the user ofclient 102 performs a desired action while on the advertiser's website (e.g., making a purchase, downloading software, registering for a user account or marketing promotions, etc.). - Referring now to
FIG. 3 , an illustration is shown ofelectronic display 116 displaying anexample webpage 300. Similar toFIG. 2 ,client 102 may requestwebpage 300 from the address entered viafield 202 ofweb browser 200. In the example shown, assume that the user ofclient 102 has navigated towebpage 300 located at the URL, http://sportsscores.test. For example, the user may navigate directly towebpage 300 by entering the URL ininput field 202 or by clicking on a hotlink on another webpage that links towebpage 300. - As shown,
webpage 300 may include various sports-related content. The content ofwebpage 300 may include text 302-306 and images 308-312. For example,text 302 andimage 308 may relate to the sport of basketball whiletext 304 andimage 310 may relate to the sport of baseball.Webpage 300 may also include anadvertisement 314 selected by an auction server, such asauction server 104. -
Advertisement 314 may be selected by an auction server based in part on the content ofwebpage 300. For example,webpage 300 may include one or more metatags that identify a topic ofwebpage 300. In other cases, text and/or image recognition may be used on text 302-306 and images 308-312, to identifywebpage 300 as relating to the topic of sports. Like keywords in a search query, as shown inFIG. 2 , keywords onwebpage 300 may belong to a set of keywords and used to selectadvertisement 314. The advertiser ofadvertisement 314 may specify that he wishes to presentadvertisement 314 on sports-related webpages by selecting a sports-related set of keywords. Bids may then be generated on behalf of the advertiser in advertising auctions, to determine whetheradvertisement 314 is to be presented withwebpage 300. - Similar to
advertisement 218, bids in the advertisement auction in whichadvertisement 314 was selected may be based in part on predicted userbehaviors regarding advertisement 314. For example, presentingadvertisement 314 may be an impression, a selection ofadvertisement 314 may be a click, and a desired action performed by the user ofclient 102 in response to being presented withadvertisement 314 may be a conversion. In some implementations, a participant in an advertising auction may specify whether his or her advertisements are to appear on search-related webpages, such aswebpage 206, or on content-related webpages, such aswebpage 300. - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , a flow diagram of anexample process 400 for evaluating keyword performance is shown, according to various implementations. In general,process 400 allows an advertiser or other interested party to quickly evaluate the performance of different sets of keywords used to provide advertisements to users' devices.Process 400 may be implemented, for example, by an auction server (e.g., auction server 104) that conducts an advertising auction to select an advertisement from an advertiser or by another computing device configured to evaluate the performance of advertisements selected via online advertising auctions. The auction server or other computing device may execute machine instructions that cause one or more processors to performprocess 400. -
Process 400 includes receiving history data regarding the presentation of online advertisements (block 402). The history data may be indicative of the number of times an advertisement was selected in an advertising auction and provided to a client device, the bid amount or other financial cost for the advertiser to provide the advertisement to the client device, whether the advertisement was clicked or otherwise selected at the client device (e.g., via an input device such as a mouse, touch screen display, etc.), and/or user actions performed at the client device subsequent to the advertisement being clicked (e.g., making a purchase at the advertiser's website, registering for a user account, etc.). For example, a client identifier, such as a cookie, may be set on the client device that is provided the advertisement. Such a cookie may be used, for example, to gather history data regarding whether the client device is redirected to the advertiser's website in response to the advertisement being clicked. The history data may be from any period of time or a specific period of time (e.g., the past n-number of days). In some implementations, the history data may be aggregated for multiple advertisers that use the same or similar sets of keywords as auction parameters. - The received history data may be associated with a set of one or more keywords. In various implementations, an advertiser may specify a set of one or more keywords to control when advertisements from the advertiser are to be provided to a client device. For example, a user's search query at a search engine may be compared to the set of one or more keywords. If the keywords in the set match the search query, the advertiser may participate in an advertisement auction to compete for the ability to provide an advertisement with the search results. Similarly, a set of keywords may be used to determine whether a website being visited by a client device contains text that matches the keywords. If so, the advertiser may compete in an advertisement auction to place an advertisement on the visited webpage. The order in which the keywords appear in a search query or on a webpage may or may not be exact for there to be a match, according to some implementations. For example, an advertiser may specify that an exact phrase must be entered as a search query if the advertiser is to compete for the ability to place an advertisement with the search results.
- A set of keywords may have an associated advertisement or multiple advertisements. For example, an online retailer running a sale on golf clubs may have multiple advertisements to notify users about the sale. In such a case, the advertiser may associate one or more of the advertisements with a particular set of keywords. For example, the advertiser may associate two advertisements with a first set of keywords and three advertisements with a second set of keywords. When a keyword match occurs, which advertisement is provided to a client device may selected randomly, based on performance metrics for the advertisements, or based on a quality score (e.g., how well the content of the advertisement matches the topic of the search or website).
- In other implementations, various grouping techniques may be used to categorize sets of keywords. In some implementations, sets of keywords having similar concepts may be grouped and evaluated together. For example, assume that a first and second set of keywords both relate to shopping. In such a case, the history data for both sets may be aggregated, to evaluate the general concept of shopping. In some implementations, concepts may belong to a preexisting hierarchy of concepts or product categories. For example, a sets of keywords related to mobile telephones may be grouped in the category/Shopping/Electronic Devices/Mobile Telephones. In further implementations, sets of keywords may be grouped as n-grams, e.g., sets that contain the same word or words, or grouped based on user-defined words or phrases.
-
Process 400 optionally includes removing low-impression data from consideration (block 404). According to various implementations, an advertisement having an impression count below a threshold value may be ignored from consideration when evaluating the performance of its set of keywords. In some implementations, the set itself may be removed from further evaluation if the impression count for its associated advertisements is below the threshold value. For example, a set of one or more keywords may be excluded from performance comparisons with other sets, if the set has less than ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, or any number of impressions. In various implementations, the threshold value may be set to a value between one hundred and one thousand impressions. -
Process 400 includes determining one or more performance metrics using the history data (block 406). In some implementations, the history data may be analyzed to determine a performance metric for an advertisement associated with a set of one or more keywords. For example, assume that an advertiser has specified that an advertisement is to be provided with search results, whenever a user searches using the phrase “parking near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.” In such a case, performance metrics regarding the performance of the advertisement may be determined using the history data. In non-limiting examples, a performance metric may be a CTR, CPC, CVR, or CPA. For example, if the advertisement associated with the phrase “parking near the Leaning Tower of Pisa” is provided one hundred times with search results and the advertisement was clicked ten times, the advertisement may have a CTR of 10%. Therefore, this CTR may also be used as a performance metric for the phrase itself. -
Process 400 includes determining a confidence for the one or more performance metrics (block 408). In general, a confidence interval provides a measure of reliability for a statistical value, such as a performance metric. A confidence interval includes upper and lower limit values in which the true performance metric may be found, to a certain degree of confidence. Any number of different calculations may be used to determine the confidence interval, according to various implementations. For example, the confidence interval may be a binomial proportion confidence interval based on the number of impressions and the performance metric. Such a binomial proportion confidence interval may be calculated as a normal approximation interval, a Wilson interval, a Clopper-Pearson interval, or any other form of binomial proportion confidence interval. For example, a Wilson interval may be calculated as follows: -
- where p is the performance metric, n is the number of impressions, and z1-α/2 is the 1-α/2 percentile of the standard distribution. For example, z1-α/2 may be set to a value of 1.96, to obtain a 95% confidence interval.
- In one example, assume that a set of one or more keywords has an associated advertisement that was presented 555 times and clicked by users 30 times. In such a case, the calculated CTR for the set will be 0.054. Based on this CTR, it may be assumed that 5.4% of users that are presented the advertisement based on the set of one or more keyword will also click on the advertisement. However, a 95% Wilson confidence interval gives a confidence interval of 0.038-0.076. Therefore, there is a 95% degree of confidence that the long-term CTR for the set will be somewhere between 0.038-0.076. In contrast, now assume that the advertisement was presented 5,555 times and clicked by users three hundred times. In such a case, the CTR will still be 0.054, but the 95% Wilson confidence interval will shrink to the range of 0.048-0.060.
-
Process 400 includes sorting the confidence intervals (block 410). In some implementations, the confidence intervals for the performance metrics may be sorted based on their upper or lower bounds. The sort may be performed optimistically or pessimistically, depending on whether the intervals are sorted by their upper or lower bounds. For example, sorting confidence intervals for CTRs or CVRs by their upper bounds may be viewed as an optimistic sort, since an advertiser may want a higher CTR or CVR than the currently calculated performance metric. Conversely, sorting confidence intervals for CPCs or CPAs by their lower bounds may also be viewed as an optimistic sort, since an advertiser may want a lower CPC or CPA. - The confidence intervals may be sorted in ascending or descending order. For example, a descending, pessimistic sort of confidence intervals for CTRs may be quickly analyzed to determine the best performing sets of keywords. In another example, an ascending, optimistic sort may be quickly analyzed to determine the worst performing sets of keywords. In some implementations, the system may be configured to notify an advertiser of the best or worst performing sets of keywords, based on their sorted confidence intervals. For example, the worst performing sets of keywords may be suggested to an advertiser as negative keywords, e.g., keywords that do not trigger an advertisement from the advertiser. In some cases, the negative keywords may be automatically set for the advertiser, e.g., without further action from the advertiser. In another example, variations of any well performing sets of keywords may be suggested to the advertiser or automatically added as another set of keywords for the advertiser.
-
Process 400 includes providing the sorted intervals (block 412). After the confidence intervals have been sorted, they may be provided to an electronic display or to a remote device for display. For example, the sorted intervals may be part of a generated performance report and presented on a display to an advertiser. In some implementations, the report may be an interactive report that allows an advertiser or other such party to specify report parameters. For example, an advertiser or other interested party may specify which performance metrics are to be presented in the interactive report, how the data in the report is to be sorted (e.g., ascending or descending), or which sets of keywords are to be compared in the report. - Referring now to
FIG. 5 , an example illustration of a performance report for sets of keywords used in an advertising system is shown, according to various implementations. In various implementations,performance report 500 may be an interactive report or a static report. Generally,performance report 500 include calculated performance information regarding the performance of different sets of keywords 516-526. Which performance information is presented inperformance report 500 may be specified by an advertiser. For example, an advertiser or other interested party may specify that performance report is to report on the CTR, CVR, CPC, CPA, or similar advertising-related performance metric of sets 516-526. - As shown,
performance report 500 may be provided to anelectronic display 502 in communication with a processing circuit. Example electronic displays include, but are not limited to, computer monitors, smart television sets, a display of a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, etc.), other displays for electronic devices. In some implementations,electronic display 502 may be a touch-screen display and configured to receive input and provide the input to its associated processing circuit. In some implementations, the processing circuit associated withelectronic display 502 may generateperformance report 500. In other implementations,performance report 500 may be provided to the processing circuit from a remote device, such as an auction server or other electronic device that stores history data regarding online advertisements. -
Performance report 500 may include any number of columns and rows (e.g., as part of a grid of performance data). In the example shown,performance report 500 may include akeyword group column 504, aperformance column 506, anaverage CTR column 510, animpression count column 512, and aclick count column 514. Other example columns include a CVR column, a CPC column, a CPA column, and columns regarding raw confidence intervals for the CTR, CVR, CPC, and CPA values. Rows inperformance report 500 may include any number of sets 516-526 of keywords. Sets 516-526 may correspond to various phrases grouped by their common keywords, in some implementations. For example, set 516 may include the query “parking for the Leaning Tower of Pisa” and set 518 may include the query “parking near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.” Thus, sets 516, 518 may include search phrases that vary by one or more keywords. In other implementations,performance report 500 may be represented using other graphical techniques, such as charts, graphs, and the like. -
Average CTR column 510 may include performance metrics for sets 516-526 based on the raw data contained inimpression count column 512 and clickcount column 514. The value for a set of keywords inaverage CTR column 510 may be determined by dividing the corresponding impression count incolumn 512 by the click count incolumn 514. For example, the average CTR forset 522 may be calculated as follows: CTR=48 clicks/343 impressions=0.14. Other data values and performance metrics may also be calculated and displayed inperformance report 500 in a similar manner. For example, a conversion count may be included as another column inperformance report 500 and a conversion rate may be calculated and displayed by dividing the conversion count by the impression count for a given set of keywords. - In some implementations, a raw confidence interval may be generated and displayed as part of
performance report 500. For example, each value inaverage CTR column 510 may have an associated CTR confidence interval (e.g., a raw CTR range). Such information may be displayed numerically or graphically. For example, a confidence interval may be displayed inperformance report 500 as an icon having a larger or smaller width, depending on its range of values. In some implementations, confidence intervals may be sorted by their upper or lower bounds. For example, the confidence intervals for the average CTRs may be sorted in descending order, to order the confidence intervals optimistically (e.g., those CTRs having the highest potential true CTRs may be shown at the top ofperformance report 500. - According to various implementations, all observed ranges of a performance metric may be normalized and displayed graphically as part of
performance column 506. In general,performance column 506 may include data regarding a performance metric the advertiser wishes to optimize. For example,performance column 506 may include normalized confidence ranges for a CPC performance metric. The normalized ranges inperformance column 506 may be sorted via input to sort button 508 (e.g., to sort the entries inperformance column 506 in ascending or descending order). The sort may be done optimistically or pessimistically (e.g., based on their upper or lower bounds). As shown,performance column 506 has been sorted optimistically in descending order. Entries further to the right inperformance column 506 may be considered to be better performing than entries further to the left inperformance column 506. Similarly, the more narrow the entry inperformance column 506, the more confidence its corresponding performance metric has. In cases in which a lower performance metric is considered better by an advertiser (e.g., a CPC, CPA, etc.), the normalized values may be inverted, allowingperformance column 506 to be shown consistently for all performance metrics. - Implementations of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software embodied on a tangible medium, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions, encoded on one or more computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. A computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Moreover, while a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially-generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium can also be, or be included in, one or more separate components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices). Accordingly, the computer storage medium may be tangible and non-transitory.

In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product embodied on a tangible medium or packaged into multiple software products.
- Thus, particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking or parallel processing may be utilized.
