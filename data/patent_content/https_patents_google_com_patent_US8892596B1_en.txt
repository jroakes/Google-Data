Definitions
- the World Wide Web (“web”) contains vast amounts of information. This information may be presented via documents, such as web pages. In many instances, different versions of web pages may exist. For example, content of a first web page may have a similar meaning to content of a second web page. However, the content of the first web page may include text written in English, while the content of the other web page may include text written in German.
- a method may include identifying, in a first document, a reference to a second document, the second document being different than the first document; identifying that the reference to the second document is associated with a relation indicator; and determining, based on identifying that the reference to the second document includes a relation indicator, that content of the second document is related to content of the first document.
- Determining that the content of the second document is related to the content of the first document may include translating the first document to obtain a translated first document, comparing the translated first document to the second document to obtain a measure of similarity between the translated first document and the second document, and determining, based on the comparing, that the content of the second document is related to the content of the first document when the measure of similarity satisfies a particular similarity threshold.
- the method may further include processing the second document based on determining that the content of the second document is related to the content of the first document.
- identifying that the reference to the second document is associated with a relation indicator may include identifying that the reference to the second document is associated with at least one of a name of a language, an image that represents a language, a name of a geographic region, or an image that represents a geographic region.
- the method may further include receiving, from a client device, a search query; identifying that the first document and the second document are responsive to the search query; identifying a particular language or a particular region associated with the client device; and identifying that the second document is associated with the particular language or the particular region.
- Processing the second document may include presenting information identifying the second document as a search result for the search query; and forgoing presenting information identifying the first document as a search result for the search query, based on identifying that the second document is associated with the particular language or the particular region and determining that the content of the second document is related to the content of the first document.
- the method may further include providing information regarding the first document for display at a client device; identifying a particular language associated with the client device; and identifying that the second document is associated with the particular language.
- Processing the second document may include presenting, in connection with the information regarding the first document, an option to access the second document.
- determining that the content of the second document is related to the content of the first document may include identifying a first update frequency associated with the first document; identifying a second update frequency associated with the second document; comparing the first update frequency to the second update frequency to obtain a measure of similarity between the first update frequency and the second update frequency; and determining, based on the comparing, that the content of the second document is related to the content of the first document when the measure of similarity satisfies a particular similarity threshold.
- the method may further include identifying selection activity regarding at least one of the first document or the second document. Determining that the content of the second document is related to the content of the first document is based on the identified selection activity.
- a computer-readable medium may include computer-executable instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform one or more of the acts mentioned above.
