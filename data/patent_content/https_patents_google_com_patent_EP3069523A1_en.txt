- interest information such as past selections, and location information associated with the television device and are available through one or more sources
- the application can provide the user with different recommendation interfaces, where a lure interface can be presented to the user that includes information on multiple recommended media content items and, in response to selecting a portion of the lure interface, a number of recommendation interfaces can be presented that include information and playback options for the recommended media content items on the lure interface.
- FIG. 1 is a flow chart of an illustrative process 100 for providing media guidance with media content items from various sources using one or more recommendation interfaces in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter.
- Process 100 can begin by receiving a query from a user at 110.
- a query can be received from the user by any suitable approach, such as a voice search or a text search provided by the user through a computing device.
- the user can initiate a client application on a mobile device that provides content recommendations and, in response to initiating the client application, the user is provided with an opportunity to transmit a query, such as "I want to stay home tonight and watch something.”
- process 100 can determine search terms from the received query at 120. For example, in response to receiving the search query "I want to stay home tonight and watch something,” process 100 can segment the query to obtain search terms, such as “stay home,” “home,” “tonight,” “watch something,” and “watch.” Process 100 can then determine whether one or more of the search terms fall into particular categories, such as timing terms (e.g., “tonight”), location terms (e.g., "stay home” and “home”), and/or action terms (e.g., "watch”). It should be noted that any suitable terms can be extracted from the query (e.g., a content type of "movie” or “television”). For example, a device term can be extracted from the query, such as "my CAST-enabled device” from the query “Romantic comedy to watch on my CAST-enabled device.”
- process 100 can input the query or segments of the query into a dictionary of words or phrases such that the search terms can be restricted to the words or phrases in the dictionary.
- process 100 can receive information relating to the user that provided the query at 130.
- the received information can include any suitable information regarding a user's location, and, in some implementations, can additionally or alternatively indicate interactions with types of media content or times of media content viewing.
- the received information can indicate that a user is currently at home and is therefore likely to want to watch media content.
- process 100 can determine location information from a user profile, user preferences, search history, etc. For example, process 100 can determine from a user account associated with a mobile device includes a location that the user has designated as a home location.
- process 100 can determine from email information and/or search history information (e.g., associated with a user account on the mobile device) an approximate location of the media device.
- the location information determined from a mobile device associated with the user can include coordinates such as coordinates derived using the Global Positioning System (GPS), and/or approximate coordinates such as coordinates derived using multilateration techniques (e.g., triangulation of radio signals from a known radio source, such as a wireless base station), or the like.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- multilateration techniques e.g., triangulation of radio signals from a known radio source, such as a wireless base station
- the user's location used for presenting recommended media content items can be limited to products provided by the company presenting the cards or interfaces (e.g., limited to a particular search query interface, limited to a particular e-mail client, and/or any other particular products).
- a user can be required to sign into an account before user location information can be used to present recommended media content items.
- the received information can include any suitable information regarding a user's interests and media preferences.
- the received information can indicate a user's preference based on past behavior (e.g., past media content selections).
- a user can specify that certain types of activity or information that should or should not be considered when presenting a card or interface with recommended media content items.
- a user can specify that recommendation interfaces should only be presented based on, for example, search queries, previously streamed media content, and/or any other type of activity.
- a user can specify that certain types of activity, for example, reading or responding to an e-mail, browsing history, and/or any other type of activity, should not be considered when presenting an interface with recommended media content items.
- the received information can include popularity information relating to media content items.
- the received information can indicate the popularity of a particular item of media content and their popularity can be based on past ratings or rankings (e.g., ratings, reviews, or any other indicator of popularity).
- the received information can indicate that the media content item was the most- watched television program in the country during the past week.
- the received information can indicate current trends of media content popularity, e.g., based on topics discussed on one or more social media networks.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), and/or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
- process 100 can receive interest information, location information, and/or popularity information without receiving a query from the user. For example, in response to initiating the client application on the computing device, process 100 can receive such information. In a more particular example, in response to initiating the client application on a mobile device, process 100 can receive location information relating to a user and popularity information relating to multiple media content items without receiving a voice query from the user.
- process 100 can select a media content item from multiple media content items at 140, where the selected media content item is available to be provided from one or more content sources.
- the media content item can be selected based on the received interest information, the location information, and the popularity information.
- the media content items can be selected based on location terms and timing terms within a search query.
- process 100 can select the episode that is likely to be interesting to the user. For example, a particular episode of a particular season can be selected based on popularity information (e.g., the most popular episode that aired in a given month). In another example, a particular episode of a particular season can be selected based on any other suitable criterion, such as a user's past media content selections (e.g., a subsequent episode that a user has not yet watched).
- process 100 can select media content items from multiple media content items based on available through media devices or media applications corresponding to the terms in the search query. For example, in response to receiving the query "Romantic comedy on my CAST-enabled device," process 100 can select media content items that are available through the CAST-enabled device indicated in the search query and select a subset of those media content items based on popularity information. In examples where a user has consented to the detection of nearby devices proximal to the user's device, process 100 can indicate the presence of one or more nearby devices that may be suitable for presenting media content in response to receiving the search query.
- process 200 begins by determining a media content item from multiple media content items. As shown, process 200 begins by determining a
- recommendation score for each of the media content items based on interest information, location information, and/or media popularity information. For example, each piece of received information can be scored and weighted on any suitable scale, and the resulting weighted scores can be combined in any suitable way to determine a recommendation score for each of the media content items.
- any combination of any suitable machine learning or statistical techniques including linear combinations, neural networks, classification algorithms, recommender systems, Bayesian statistics, and/or any other suitable techniques can be used to generate a recommendation score for each of the media content items.
- process 200 can rank the media content items based on the recommendation score at 220.
- process 200 can select a subset of the media content items for recommending to the user. For example, the top ten media content items can be inserted into recommendation interfaces that are presented to the user.
- process 100 can select a content source from multiple content sources for providing the media content item.
- the selected media content item can be provided by a live television content provider, by one or more over-the-top content providers, by one or more on-demand content providers, a digital video recorder, or any other suitable content source.
- process 100 can determine the content providers that the user is likely to have access to using various criterion.
- process 300 can determine that there are multiple content sources for providing the selected media content item.
- process 300 can determine available content sources based on popularity information and/or location information. For example, based on the user's location information, process 300 can determine the television channels that the user is likely to receive. In a more particular example, process 300 can determine a subset of television channels that the user is likely to receive by excluding particular channels, such as premium channels. In another more particular example, process 300 can determine television channels that the user at a particular location is likely to receive, sort those television channels based on popularity information, and select a subset of those television channels based on their popularity information (e.g., the top twenty television channels that the user is likely to receive and that the user is likely to watch).
- popularity information e.g., the top twenty television channels that the user is likely to receive and that the user is likely to watch.
- process 300 can allow a user of a computing device to configure available content sources by disabling particular channels. For example, process 300 can receive a voice command from the user of the computing device (e.g., "I do not get Channel XYZ" or "I do not want to see recommendations on Channel XYZ"). In another example, process 300 can receive a user interaction with a recommendation interface and, in response to the user interaction, disable particular channels. In a more particular example, in response to launching a client application on a mobile device, the user can be provided with a voice command from the user of the computing device (e.g., "I do not get Channel XYZ" or "I do not want to see recommendations on Channel XYZ"). In another example, process 300 can receive a user interaction with a recommendation interface and, in response to the user interaction, disable particular channels. In a more particular example, in response to launching a client application on a mobile device, the user can be provided with a
- recommendation interface that recommends a particular media content item that is playing at a particular time on channel XYZ and, in response to the user dismissing or otherwise removing the recommendation interface, the channel associated with the removed recommendation interface can be disabled or excluded from future recommendation interfaces.
- process 300 can differentiate between different voice inputs or text inputs, such as "I do not want to see programs on Channel XYZ" versus "I do not have a subscription to watch programs on Channel XYZ.”
- the terms can be parsed and interpreted to differentiate between the user not currently having a subscription to a content provider and the user not being interested in recommendations from a particular content provider.
- process 300 in response to not having a subscription, can provide the user with an opportunity to subscribe to a particular content provider in order to be provided with a particular media content item.
- process 300 can provide the user with a recommendation interface that includes an option to playback the media content item from the available content source.
- process 300 can determine available content sources based on popularity information, application installations, and/or historical information. For example, in response to a user of a mobile device launching a client application, the client application can determine device information that includes applications that have been installed on the mobile device. In response, process 300 can determine content sources that are playable on the mobile device at this point in time (e.g., based on application installations).
- process 300 can determine content sources that are playable on the mobile device by installing an application or by subscribing to a content provider.
- recommendation interfaces can be presented to the user that prompt the user to install an application available from an application marketplace or that prompt the user to subscribe to a content provider.
- process 300 can detect other devices connected to the mobile device.
- the client application on the mobile device can perform a particular discovery protocol to detect other media devices connected on a local area network.
- process 300 can determine content sources that are playable on a connected media device, such as an external streaming media device. As such, a
- recommendation interface can be presented to the user that instructs the connected media device to obtain and present a recommended media content item.
- process 300 can detect the presence of particular devices that are at or near the user's location, such as C AST-enabled devices.

- process 300 can receive information relating to email and/or browser history associated with a user of a computing device to determine which on- demand sources are available to the user.
- process 300 can allow a user of a computing device to configure available content sources by disabling particular on-demand sources. For example, process 300 can receive a voice command from the user of the computing device (e.g., "I do not want to see recommendations from provider A" or "I do not have a subscription to provider A"). In another example, process 300 can receive a user interaction with a recommendation interface and, in response to the user interaction, disable particular on-demand content sources.
- a voice command from the user of the computing device e.g., "I do not want to see recommendations from provider A" or "I do not have a subscription to provider A”
- process 300 can receive a user interaction with a recommendation interface and, in response to the user interaction, disable particular on-demand content sources.
- the user in response to launching a client application on a mobile device, the user can be provided with a recommendation interface that recommends a particular media content item that is available from a particular on-demand content source and, in response to the user dismissing or otherwise removing the recommendation interface, the on-demand content source associated with the removed recommendation interface can be disabled or excluded from future recommendation interfaces.
- the client application can prompt the user to indicate whether further recommendation interfaces should exclude the particular on-demand content source.
- process 300 can determine device information associated with a user device, such as device characteristics, and determine the ability for a content source to provide media content to the user device. For example, in response to determining that a user having a mobile device may have particular streaming media capabilities, content sources that can use such streaming media capabilities can be included in the group of available content sources.
- process 300 can select one or more of the available content sources for providing the selected media content item at 340. For example, based on popularity of the content providers, process 300 can further select one available television service provider that provides a selected media content item at a particular time on a particular television channel and one available on-demand provider that provides the selected media content item.
- process 100 can select an additional media content item and determine which content source or content sources to provide the additional media content item.
