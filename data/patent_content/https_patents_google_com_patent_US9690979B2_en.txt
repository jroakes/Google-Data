Definitions
- the synthesizer 130 may utilize the object image data 122 , as well as the augmentation information 132 as determined from the pose/occlusion module 120 , to generate a synthesized image 142 of the image file 102 .
- the synthesized image 142 may use the augmentation information 132 to re-orient and possibly re-position the object of interest. For example, if the object of interest is a face that is tilted one way or another, the synthesized image 142 may re-align the face so as to orient it towards a hypothetical camera angle.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a method for determining a set of training images for use in performing image recognition for one or more objects of interest, according to an embodiment of the invention.
- a method such as described in FIG. 3 may be used to establish a training set (or set of reference images) for use on a collection of images, and/or for newly received or captured images.
Abstract
Description
ChosenLabelList = empty list. |
PotentiallyRecognizedFaceList = empty list. |
For j=1 to n |
If SortedIndex(j) is not already in PotentiallyRecognizedFaceList, |
put SortedIndex(j) in the ChosenLabelList. |
Put SortedIndex(j) in PotentiallyRecognizedFaceList. |
Put all the faces in the CLOSELIST{SortedIndex (j)} into |
PotentiallyRecognizedFaceList. |
end |
end |
The faces under the ChosenLabelList is shown to the user.
φ(Xi=[x,y]) (1)
which estimate the likelihood that feature Fi is located at pixel [x,y] in the image based on the appearance of the image around that location.
