- the advertisement administration system 108 can provide information to the advertiser(s) to assist in choosing one or more of the publishers 102 when submitting a bid.
- the publisher 102 A may be an online news medium published by a newspaper corporation (e.g., an online newspaper), and the advertiser(s) 104 may wish to place their advertisement(s) 112 on one or more pages of the online newspaper that will be read by viewers.
- the advertiser(s) 104 may also or instead choose to have their content (e.g., the ad 112 ) published elsewhere than on the pages 110 , for example on a reference page 114 .

- Operations can be performed in a different order than they are described; as another example, one or more additional operations can be performed.
- a publisher P such as the publisher 102 A ( FIG. 1 ), can be a starting point. Assume in this example that the conversion rate ratio (i.e., CvR_p/CvR_reference) for that publisher P relative to one or more advertisers is to be determined.
- Information 206 is available relating to the publisher P.
- the information 206 can include values for calculating CvR_p and for calculating CvR_reference.
- the information 206 can include the number of the advertisements 112 or other content from the advertiser 104 A that the publisher P has published, the number of conversions that the advertiser 104 A has received based on the publications, to name a few examples.
- This information can be distributed over time if the publisher P has been displaying the advertisement(s) during a time period. Thus, a plurality of values for the publisher conversion rate can be obtained.
- the information 206 can include values for calculating CvR_reference, such as the number of the advertisements 112 or other content from the advertiser 104 A that the reference page 114 has published, and the number of conversions that the advertiser 104 A has received based on the publications on the reference page 114 .
- the estimator can process the information 206 to determine one or more statistical aspects of it, including, but not limited to, a mean and/or a standard deviation.

- estimators that could be used include Woolfs estimator, or a relative ratio of the two rates that does not weight different advertisers' contributions to the overall publisher CvR by the relative amounts of data available to each advertiser.
- the estimator 208 can provide at least one first estimate value 210 relating to the publisher P.
- the first estimate value 210 includes a mean (here referred to as m′) and a standard deviation (here referred to as s′) based on at least the information 206 . That is, they indicate, respectively, subject to the noise mentioned above, the mean conversion rate ratio for the publisher P and the certainty or uncertainty of the estimated mean.
- m′ and s′ can be the results of the first branch 200 .
- peer information 212 can be used.
- the information 206 and as a result the value 210 , can be sparse and/or considered noisy in part or its entirety
- the peer information 212 can be used in an attempt to improve the accuracy and/or reduce the noisiness and/or uncertainty.
- the peer information 212 can relate to one or more peers of the publisher P.
- the peer information 212 includes information relating to a plurality of publishers P*.
- the peer information 212 can be provided by identifying a plurality of publishers P* that are peers of the publisher P, and obtaining relevant data for each of the plurality of publishers P*.
- data can include values for conversion rates in analogy with the discussion above. For example, data can be obtained from which a publisher conversion rate and/or a reference conversion rate can be determined for each of the publishers P*.
- statistics corresponding to the estimate value(s) 210 can be determined for each of the publishers P*. For example, based at least on the peer information 212 , a mean and/or a standard deviation can be determined for each of the publishers P*. As noted in the above example, such a mean and/or standard deviation can relate to a corresponding conversion rate ratio relating to each individual one of the publishers P*.
- a precision calculation 214 can be performed for each of the publishers P* in some implementations.
- the precision for an ith publisher of the publishers P* can be determined as follows:
- s_i the standard deviation for the publisher i.
- the information 212 can be divided into at least one subset.
- the information 212 can be divided into a subset K and a remainder M.
- the dividing can be based on a threshold value for standard deviations relating to the publishers P*.
- the subset K can include those of the publishers P* whose standard deviations are above the threshold value
- the remainder M can include those of the publishers P* whose standard deviations are at or below the threshold value.
- having a low standard deviation can indicate that the publisher is a seasoned participant in the advertisement operations managed by the advertisement administrator 108 . That is, in such examples the advertiser may have a steady practice of displaying advertisements and produces approximately stable conversion rates over time.
- having a high standard deviation can indicate that the publisher is not a seasoned and/or established displayer of advertisements, because the conversion rates may fluctuate more.
- At least one of K and M can be used for the calculation in the second branch 202 .
- one of K and M is selected based on a perceived certainty or uncertainty of the information 206 and/or the estimate value 210 . For example, if the publisher P whose statistics are being estimated is expected to perform more as an unestablished participant than as a seasoned one, then the subset K (which here is associated with relatively higher standard deviations) can be chosen. In contrast, and as another example, if the publisher P is expected to perform more as a seasoned participant than as an unestablished one, then the subset M can be chosen.
- an uncertainty level of either i) high uncertainty or ii) low uncertainty can be chosen for the publisher P as characterizing future observations of the publisher's conversion rate ratio. Based on such a selected uncertainty, then, one of the subset K and the remainder M can be selected as a publisher peer group
- An estimate value 216 for the publisher peer group can be determined based on the information from the publisher peer group.
- the estimate value 216 can include one or more statistics for a conversion rate ratio.
- a peer group mean m and a peer group standard deviation s can be determined using:
- x_k all tuples of means and standard deviations in the publisher peer group
- m_k the mean for publisher k
- p_k the precision for publisher k
- s_k the standard deviation for publisher k.
- m and s can be considered the estimated mean and standard deviation of a prior.
- the mean and standard deviation of the prior may be derived either empirically (from preexisting data), or from prior expertise or belief added by designers of the system.
- the peer group standard deviation s can be determined using:
- p_k, m and m_k can be obtained substantially as described above.
- the just-mentioned approach can be used when the size of K grows large (e.g., above some threshold u).
- the estimation 204 can now be generated based at least on the estimate value(s) 210 and the estimate value(s) 216 .
- the estimation 204 comprises a modification of the estimate value(s) 210 , using the estimate value(s) 216 , from the mean m′ and standard deviation s′, to a modified mean m′′ and a modified standard deviation s′′.
- m′′ and s′′ can be generated using:
- m′′ and s′′ can be considered the mean and standard deviation of a normally distributed posterior estimate.
- Other ways of modifying a statistic for the publisher using information from a publisher peer group can be used
- FIG. 3 shows a flow chart of an example of operations 300 that can be performed.
- the operations 300 can be performed in a computer system by a processor executing instructions in a computer-readable medium. More or fewer steps can be performed, and/or in a different order.
- Step 302 involves determining a first estimate value based on a plurality of values relating to a first entity. For example, m′ and s′ relating to the publisher P can be determined, such as in the system 100 . In the statistics literature, this first estimate value is sometimes called a likelihood term or a likelihood distribution.
- Step 304 involves determining a second estimate value for at least one second entity identified as a peer of the first entity. For example, m and s relating to the publisher peer group K and/or M can be determined, such as in the system 100 . In the statistics literature, this second estimate value is sometimes called a prior term or a prior distribution.
- Step 306 involves modifying the first estimate value using the second estimate value.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/166,122, filed on Jul. 1, 2008, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
This document relates to information processing.
Advertiser or others who provide content for publishing may be interested in events such as conversions that occur relative to the publication of the advertisement or other content by a particular publisher. Conversions can include, for example, successful sales as a result of a user clicking on an advertisement. For example, the advertiser may wish to know how may conversions occur for every thousand times, or hundred thousand times, an advertisement or other content is displayed. Such a statistic can be referred to as a conversion rate.
Advertisers or other content providers may be interested in comparing the conversion rate for a particular publisher to a benchmark conversion rate. For example, the conversion rate received by the advertiser and/or others on an advertisement-enhanced page such as google.com is sometimes considered a relevant measure.
The invention relates to modifying an estimate value.
In a first aspect, a computer-implemented method for modifying an estimate value includes determining a first estimate value based on a plurality of values relating to a first entity. The method includes determining a second estimate value for at least one second entity identified as a peer of the first entity. The method includes modifying the first estimate value using the second estimate value.
Implementations can include any, all or none of the following features. The first estimate value can include a first mean of a ratio, and the second estimate value can include a second mean of the ratio. The method can further include determining a precision for each of a plurality of second entities determined as peers of the first entity, each of the plurality of second entities associated with a plurality of ratio values having a mean; wherein the second mean is determined using the means of the pluralities of ratio values and the precisions. Modifying the first mean using the second mean can include using a standard deviation of the plurality of ratio values and a standard deviation of the first mean. The first estimate value can further include a first standard deviation of the first mean, and the second estimate value can further include a second standard deviation of the second mean. A plurality of second entities can be determined as peers of the first entity, each of the plurality of second entities associated with a plurality of ratio values having a mean, and the second standard deviation can be determined using standard deviations for the pluralities of ratio values. The method can further include determining a precision for each of the plurality of second entities; wherein the second standard deviation is determined using the second mean, means of the pluralities of ratio values, and the precisions. Modifying the first standard deviation can include using a standard deviation of the plurality of ratio values. Determining the first estimate value and the second estimate value can include using a Mantel-Haenszel estimator. The second entity can be identified as a peer of the first entity based on at least one criterion selected from the group consisting of: the second entity is active in a common area of enterprise as the first entity; the second entity has a similar size as the first entity; the second entity has been associated with an organization approximately as long as the first entity, wherein it is the organization that modifies the estimate value; the second entity and the first entity being publishers that publish content from advertisers, and the second entity operating with advertisers having a similar quality as those of the first entity; the second entity and the first entity publishing pages that have an equivalent ranking according to a ranking function; and combinations thereof. The method can further include identifying a peer entity group including a plurality of second entities as peers of the first entity; and selecting a subset of the peer entity group, including the at least one second entity to be used for use in determining the second estimate value. The method can further include determining that future observations of the first estimate value are associated with a high uncertainty level; and the subset can be selected as those of the plurality of second entities associated with higher standard deviations than a remainder of the peer entity group. The method can further include determining that future observations of the first estimate value are associated with a low uncertainty level; and the subset can be selected as those of the plurality of second entities associated with lower standard deviations than a remainder of the peer entity group. The method can further include identifying a first publisher as the first entity, wherein the first estimate value is a conversion rate ratio for the first publisher; identifying a plurality of values for a publisher conversion rate of the first publisher as the plurality of values, the conversion rate ratio defined as a ratio between: i) the publisher conversion rate; and ii) a reference conversion rate; and identifying a plurality of second publishers, including the second entity, that are peers of the first publisher; wherein the conversion rate ratio is modified using information associated with the plurality of second publishers. The method can further include communicating the modified conversion rate ratio to at least one advertiser, the modified conversion rate ratio configured for use in determining whether to bid for advertising space on a page published by the first publisher. The method can further include adjusting a bid from an advertiser using the modified conversion rate ratio, the bid submitted for advertising space on a page published by the first publisher. The method can further include generating a recommendation regarding the first publisher using the modified conversion rate ratio. The method can further include evaluating the first publisher using the modified conversion rate ratio.
In a second aspect, a computer-implemented method for determining a publisher's mean conversion rate ratio and a standard deviation ratio for the mean conversion rate ratio includes identifying a first publisher whose conversion rate ratio is to be estimated, the conversion rate ratio defined as a ratio between: i) a publisher conversion rate that a first advertiser obtains for at least one advertisement placed on a page published by the first publisher; and ii) a reference conversion rate that the first advertiser obtains on one or more reference page(s). The method includes obtaining a value for the reference conversion rate and a plurality of values for the publisher conversion rate. The method includes determining a first mean and a first standard deviation using the value for the reference conversion rate and the plurality of values for the publisher conversion rate, the first mean and the first standard deviation relating to the first publisher. The method includes identifying a plurality of second publishers that are peers of the first publisher. The method includes obtaining, for each of the plurality of second publishers, values for the reference conversion rate and pluralities of values for the publisher conversion rate. The method includes determining, for each of the plurality of second publishers, a second mean and a second standard deviation using the corresponding values for the reference conversion rate and the pluralities of values for the publisher conversion rate. The method includes determining a precision for each of the plurality of second publishers using
wherein
p_i=the precision for second publisher i among the plurality of second publishers; and
s_i=the second standard deviation for the second publisher i. The method includes dividing the plurality of second publishers into a subset and a remainder based on a threshold value for the second standard deviations, the subset relating to those of the plurality of second publishers whose second standard deviations fall above the threshold value. The method includes selecting an uncertainty level as one of i) high uncertainty and ii) low uncertainty as characterizing future observations of the publisher conversion rate ratio. The method includes selecting one of the subset and the remainder as a publisher peer group based on the selected uncertainty. The method includes determining, using the publisher peer group, a peer group mean and a peer group standard deviation using:
wherein
m=the peer group mean;
x_k=all tuples of second means and second standard deviations in the publisher peer group;
m_k=the second mean for publisher k;
p_k=the precision for publisher k;

Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.
The system 100 here includes an advertisement administrator system 108. In some implementations, the system 108 administrates the distribution of content such as advertisements between the publishers 102 and the advertisers 104 and/or any other entity. For example, the system 108 can receive bids from the advertisers 104 for publishing content on any or all of pages 110 controlled by the publishers 102. The system 108 can choose among received bids, select a winning advertiser, and arrange so that a corresponding advertisement 112 or other content from the winning advertiser is submitted to the publisher 102 at issue, for publication on the page(s) 110. Such advertisement administration can be conducted using a fixed-price system, an auction mechanism, or any other form of transaction, to name a few examples. As another example, the advertisement administration system 108 can provide information to the advertiser(s) to assist in choosing one or more of the publishers 102 when submitting a bid. For example, the publisher 102A may be an online news medium published by a newspaper corporation (e.g., an online newspaper), and the advertiser(s) 104 may wish to place their advertisement(s) 112 on one or more pages of the online newspaper that will be read by viewers.
The advertiser(s) 104 may also or instead choose to have their content (e.g., the ad 112) published elsewhere than on the pages 110, for example on a reference page 114. In some implementations, the reference page 114 provides a search engine function that is available to users of the page 114. For example, the reference page 114 can perform searches for keywords and/or other search criteria specified by the user, and thereafter present search results for the user to review. The advertisement(s) 112 can be presented at any point of such operations, for example in connection with displaying the search results. In some implementations, the reference page 114 and the advertisement administrator 108 can be controlled by the same organization.
The advertisement(s) 112 or other content can be displayed on the page(s) 110 in any form. In some implementations, the advertisement 112 includes a hyperlink on which the viewer of the page 110 can click. The ultimate landing page for such a navigation may be a page or other network resource controlled by the corresponding advertiser 104, such as the home page or an online shopping page for that advertiser 104.
Some or all of the advertisers 104 may wish to determine whether there occurs any event(s) relating to the publication of its advertisement(s) 112 that is significant or otherwise of interest to the advertiser. In some implementations, such events can be referred to as conversions. Conversions can include, but are not limited to, that a viewer who clicks on the advertisement later: proceeds to purchase a product from the advertiser; makes a donation to the advertiser; registers with the advertiser; or accepts a proposition made by the advertiser; to name just a few examples. In some implementations, other event(s) can be used in lieu of, or together with, any of the conversions mentioned above.
In some implementations the advertiser(s) 104 may want to track conversions that occur relative to the advertisement (or other content) displayed on the page(s) 110. For example, the advertiser may wish to know how may conversions occur for every thousand times, or hundred thousand times, the advertisement 112 or other content is displayed. The mentioned numbers are examples and other numbers can be used. This statistic can be determined per publisher; thus, specifically for the publisher 102A, for example. In some implementations, this statistic can be considered a conversion rate for that publisher 102A and can be referred to as CvR_p.
Similarly, the advertiser(s) 104 whose advertisements 112 or other content are shown on the reference page 114 may wish to track events relating to this publication. Analogously to the above description, in some implementations a conversion rate for a particular advertiser can be defined regarding the reference page 114 and can be referred to as CvR_reference.
To some extent the variable CvR_p can depend on the particular publisher 112 and/or on the page 110, such as on how prominently the advertisement or other content is featured and/or on whether the publisher is known for presenting relevant and useful advertisements, to name just a few examples. Another relevant measure, however, can be a ratio between the two rates described above, defined as
CvR — p/CvR_reference
CvR — p/CvR_reference
In some implementations, this ratio can be considered to indicate how the individual publisher 102 is performing in terms of generating conversions for the advertiser 104, relative to how much conversions the advertiser 104 receives at the reference page. For example, the ratio can be referred to as a conversion rate ratio. Sometimes, the data used to calculate a conversion rate ratio can be noisy and lead to uncertain results. Using techniques of some implementations described herein, however, such information can be processed in an attempt to produce more reliable information.
A publisher P, such as the publisher 102A (FIG. 1 ), can be a starting point. Assume in this example that the conversion rate ratio (i.e., CvR_p/CvR_reference) for that publisher P relative to one or more advertisers is to be determined. Information 206 is available relating to the publisher P. The information 206 can include values for calculating CvR_p and for calculating CvR_reference. For example, the information 206 can include the number of the advertisements 112 or other content from the advertiser 104A that the publisher P has published, the number of conversions that the advertiser 104A has received based on the publications, to name a few examples. This information can be distributed over time if the publisher P has been displaying the advertisement(s) during a time period. Thus, a plurality of values for the publisher conversion rate can be obtained. As another example, the information 206 can include values for calculating CvR_reference, such as the number of the advertisements 112 or other content from the advertiser 104A that the reference page 114 has published, and the number of conversions that the advertiser 104A has received based on the publications on the reference page 114.
Some or all of the information 206 is forwarded to an estimator 208. For example, the estimator can process the information 206 to determine one or more statistical aspects of it, including, but not limited to, a mean and/or a standard deviation.
In some implementations, the estimator is a Mantel-Haenszel estimator, but other estimators can be used. Other estimators that could be used include Woolfs estimator, or a relative ratio of the two rates that does not weight different advertisers' contributions to the overall publisher CvR by the relative amounts of data available to each advertiser.
The estimator 208 can provide at least one first estimate value 210 relating to the publisher P. In this example, the first estimate value 210 includes a mean (here referred to as m′) and a standard deviation (here referred to as s′) based on at least the information 206. That is, they indicate, respectively, subject to the noise mentioned above, the mean conversion rate ratio for the publisher P and the certainty or uncertainty of the estimated mean. Thus, in some implementations m′ and s′ can be the results of the first branch 200.
In the second branch 202, moreover, peer information 212 can be used. For example, while the information 206, and as a result the value 210, can be sparse and/or considered noisy in part or its entirety, the peer information 212 can be used in an attempt to improve the accuracy and/or reduce the noisiness and/or uncertainty.
The peer information 212 can relate to one or more peers of the publisher P. Here, for example, the peer information 212 includes information relating to a plurality of publishers P*. Thus, the peer information 212 can be provided by identifying a plurality of publishers P* that are peers of the publisher P, and obtaining relevant data for each of the plurality of publishers P*. Such data can include values for conversion rates in analogy with the discussion above. For example, data can be obtained from which a publisher conversion rate and/or a reference conversion rate can be determined for each of the publishers P*.
In some implementations, statistics corresponding to the estimate value(s) 210 can be determined for each of the publishers P*. For example, based at least on the peer information 212, a mean and/or a standard deviation can be determined for each of the publishers P*. As noted in the above example, such a mean and/or standard deviation can relate to a corresponding conversion rate ratio relating to each individual one of the publishers P*.
Based at least on the information 212, a precision calculation 214 can be performed for each of the publishers P* in some implementations. For example, the precision for an ith publisher of the publishers P* can be determined as follows:
wherein
p_i=the precision; and
s_i=the standard deviation for the publisher i.
Other ways of calculating precision can be used, such as taking higher-order moments of s_i (powers of s_i), other nonlinear functions of s_i, or measuring the overall uncertainty in the distribution of values for publisher i.
The information 212 can be divided into at least one subset. For example, the information 212 can be divided into a subset K and a remainder M. In some implementations the dividing can be based on a threshold value for standard deviations relating to the publishers P*. For example, the subset K can include those of the publishers P* whose standard deviations are above the threshold value, and the remainder M can include those of the publishers P* whose standard deviations are at or below the threshold value. In some implementations, having a low standard deviation can indicate that the publisher is a seasoned participant in the advertisement operations managed by the advertisement administrator 108. That is, in such examples the advertiser may have a steady practice of displaying advertisements and produces approximately stable conversion rates over time. In contrast, having a high standard deviation can indicate that the publisher is not a seasoned and/or established displayer of advertisements, because the conversion rates may fluctuate more.
At least one of K and M can be used for the calculation in the second branch 202. In some implementations, one of K and M is selected based on a perceived certainty or uncertainty of the information 206 and/or the estimate value 210. For example, if the publisher P whose statistics are being estimated is expected to perform more as an unestablished participant than as a seasoned one, then the subset K (which here is associated with relatively higher standard deviations) can be chosen. In contrast, and as another example, if the publisher P is expected to perform more as a seasoned participant than as an unestablished one, then the subset M can be chosen. Thus, in some implementations an uncertainty level of either i) high uncertainty or ii) low uncertainty can be chosen for the publisher P as characterizing future observations of the publisher's conversion rate ratio. Based on such a selected uncertainty, then, one of the subset K and the remainder M can be selected as a publisher peer group
An estimate value 216 for the publisher peer group can be determined based on the information from the publisher peer group. In some implementations, the estimate value 216 can include one or more statistics for a conversion rate ratio. For example, a peer group mean m and a peer group standard deviation s can be determined using:
wherein
x_k=all tuples of means and standard deviations in the publisher peer group;
m_k=the mean for publisher k;
p_k=the precision for publisher k;
s_k=the standard deviation for publisher k.
For example, m and s can be considered the estimated mean and standard deviation of a prior. The mean and standard deviation of the prior may be derived either empirically (from preexisting data), or from prior expertise or belief added by designers of the system.
As another example, the peer group standard deviation s can be determined using:
wherein p_k, m and m_k can be obtained substantially as described above. In some implementations, the just-mentioned approach can be used when the size of K grows large (e.g., above some threshold u).
Other ways of calculating a statistic for the publisher peer group can be used.
The estimation 204 can now be generated based at least on the estimate value(s) 210 and the estimate value(s) 216. In some implementations, the estimation 204 comprises a modification of the estimate value(s) 210, using the estimate value(s) 216, from the mean m′ and standard deviation s′, to a modified mean m″ and a modified standard deviation s″. For example, m″ and s″ can be generated using:
For example, m″ and s″ can be considered the mean and standard deviation of a normally distributed posterior estimate. Other ways of modifying a statistic for the publisher using information from a publisher peer group can be used
Step 302 involves determining a first estimate value based on a plurality of values relating to a first entity. For example, m′ and s′ relating to the publisher P can be determined, such as in the system 100. In the statistics literature, this first estimate value is sometimes called a likelihood term or a likelihood distribution.
Step 304 involves determining a second estimate value for at least one second entity identified as a peer of the first entity. For example, m and s relating to the publisher peer group K and/or M can be determined, such as in the system 100. In the statistics literature, this second estimate value is sometimes called a prior term or a prior distribution.
Step 306 involves modifying the first estimate value using the second estimate value. For example, m′ and s′ can be modified to m″ and s″. In the statistics literature, this second estimate value is sometimes called a posterior term or a posterior distribution.
In optional step 308, one or more estimate values can be used. In some implementations, the of the conversion rate ratio for the publisher P can be used for one or more purposes relating to the publisher(s) 102 and/or the advertisers(s) 104. For example, the estimate value can be communicated to at least one advertiser for use in determining whether to bid for advertising space on a page published by the publisher. As another example, the estimate value can be used to adjust a bid from an advertiser submitted for advertising space on a page published by the publisher. As another example, the estimate value can be used to generate a recommendation regarding the publisher. As another example, the estimate value can be used to evaluate the publisher. Some implementations can involve other ways of using an estimate value.

determining a precision value and estimate value for a conversion rate ratio for a group of peers of the publisher, wherein the estimate value for the group of peers of the publisher includes a mean (m) and a standard deviation (s);
generating a modified estimate value for the conversion rate ratio of the publisher using the precision value of the publisher, the precision value for the group of peers of the publisher, and the estimate value for the conversion rate ratio for the group of peers of the publisher,
wherein the modified estimated value includes a modified mean (m″) and a modified standard deviation (s″),
wherein generating the modified estimate value comprises generating the modified mean (m″) by determining a weighted average of (i) the mean (m′) for the conversion rate ratio for the publisher, and (ii) the mean for the conversion rate ratio for the group of the peers of the publisher (m), and
wherein the weighted average is weighted based on (i) the precision value for the publisher, and (ii) the precision value for the group of peers of the publisher; and
communicating the modified estimate value for the conversion rate ratio for the publisher to one or more advertisers.
18. The computer system of claim 17 , wherein the mean (m′) of the estimate value for the publisher is a first mean of a first ratio, and wherein the mean (m) of the estimate value for the group of peers of the publisher is a second mean of a second ratio.
19. The computer system of claim 18 , wherein generating the modified standard deviation (s″) comprises using a standard deviation (s′) of the first mean of the first ratio and a standard deviation (s) of the second mean of a second ratio.
