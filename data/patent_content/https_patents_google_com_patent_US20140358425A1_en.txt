- points associated with parks, hiking trails, and camping areas may be classified by the route classifier 118 as “outdoor recreation areas”.
- routes may be classified.
- the route classifier 118 can evaluate one or more portions of a route including the starting point, destination point, and/or intermediary points of a route to classify the route as recreational, business-related, or another such classification. If a particular route includes a starting point classified as a “residential neighborhood” and a destination point classified as a “family recreation” destination, for example, the route may be classified by the route classifier 118 as a “family vacation” route.

- informational content e.g., contact information, hours of operation, prices, reviews, etc.
- points e.g., intermediary points, destination points
- promotional content such as advertisements and coupons may be determined.
- determining the content items may be based at least in part on classification of the route, the starting point, the destination point, and/or one or more of the intermediary points. For example, if the route 140 were to be classified by the route classifier 118 as an “outdoor vacation”, the content selector 114 may select one or more content items associated with outdoor activities, such as hiking and camping. As another example, if the route 140 were to be classified by the route classifier 118 as an “errand trip”, the content selector 114 may select one or more content items potentially relevant to the user 104 a while running errands, such as content items associated with banks, gas stations, and convenience stores.
- one or more of the content items may be determined based on interests associated with the user.
- the interests identifier 116 can receive from the interests data store 120 information associated with interests of the user 104 a . If the user 104 a is determined by the interests identifier 116 to have an interest in fine dining, for example, dining-related content items selected by the content selector 114 may be selected from upscale restaurants. As another example, if the user 104 a is identified as having an interest in home improvement, content items associated with entities such as hardware stores may be selected by the content selector 114 for a route classified by the route classifier 118 as an “errand trip”.
- one or more of the content items may be determined based at least in part on a trip purpose description provided by the user. For example, if the user 104 a indicates that the trip is intended to be a “scenic trip”, the content selector 114 may select one or more content items related to sightseeing activities or destinations. As another example, if the user 104 a indicates that the trip is intended to be “business trip”, the content selector 114 may select one or more content items related to business-related activities or conveniences.
- determining content items may be based at least in part on length of the route. For example, for a short route (e.g., an “errand trip”), content items selected by the content selector 114 may be related to convenience and service. As another example, for a long trip (e.g., a trip classified as a “vacation”), content items associated with dining and sleeping accommodations may be selected by the content selector 114 .
- a short route e.g., an “errand trip”
- content items selected by the content selector 114 may be related to convenience and service.

- the route information and the one or more content items can be delivered ( 312 ) to the user responsive to the request.
- the route providing system 110 can provide route information and content item information via the network(s) 106 to the client computing device 102 a for presentation to the user 104 a.
- a plurality of routes can be determined, and determining a route for delivery may be based in part on the one or more content items that are determined for each route.
- the route generator 112 can generate multiple routes (e.g., routes 140 , 150 ), the route classifier 118 can classify each of the routes, and the content selector 114 can select content items for each.
- the route providing system 110 can determine one or more of the routes 140 , 150 for delivery to the user 104 a based at least in part on the selected content items.
- the routes 140 , 150 are determined to be approximately equal in distance and/or travel time, but the route 140 is associated with one or more content items potentially of greater interest (e.g., as determined by the interests identifier 116 ) to the user 104 a , information and content items associated with the route 140 may be delivered to the user 104 a.
- determining a route for delivery may be based in part on a trip purpose description provided by the user. For example, if the user 104 a indicates that the trip is intended to be a “scenic trip”, a route classified by the route classifier 118 as “scenic” can be provided to the user 104 a . As another example, routes can be modified based on the determined content items. If the user 104 a has indicated a desire to embark on a “scenic trip”, for example, the route generator 112 can generate or modify a route to pass by destinations associated with content items that may be of interest to the user 104 a.

-
FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example system 100 that can deliver route information.FIG. 1 also illustrates an example flow of data within the system 100 during states (A) to (D), where the states (A) to (D) may occur in the illustrated sequence, or they may occur in a sequence that is different than in the illustrated sequence. - In further detail, the system 100 includes one or more client computing devices 102 (each operated by a user 104) that communicate over one or
more networks 106 with one ormore computing servers 108. Thenetworks 106 may include a wireless cellular network, a wireless local area network (WLAN) or WiFi network, a Third Generation (3G) or Fourth Generation (4G) mobile telecommunications network, or any other network or any appropriate combination thereof. - The client device(s) 102 may be any suitable type of electronic device (e.g., mobile phone, smart phone, PDA, tablet computer, laptop or desktop computer, or other stationary or portable device) that includes one or more processors and computer readable media. Among other components, for example, the client device(s) 102 includes one or more processors, computer readable media that store software applications, input device(s) (e.g., touch screens, keyboards, computer mice, motion sensors, microphones, and the like), output device(s) (e.g., display screens, speakers, and the like), and communications interfaces.
- The computing server(s) 108 may be configured to execute application code associated with a variety of software components (e.g., modules, objects, libraries, services, and the like), including computer instructions to perform some or all of the method steps described below. In some implementations, the computing server(s) 108 may include one or more components of a
route providing system 110 for delivering route information to users. - The
route providing system 110 can include aroute generator 112, acontent selector 114, aninterests identifier 116, and aroute classifier 118. Two or more of thecomponents route providing system 110 and server(s) 108 can be in communication with one or more data storage devices, including aninterests data store 120 and acontent data store 122. Thedata stores - Referring to the example flow of data, during state (A), a route request can be received from a user. For example, the
user 104 a can employ theclient device 102 a to access a route providing application 130 (e.g., an application for generating maps or directions). Using theroute providing application 130, for example, theuser 104 a can indicate astarting point 132 a and adestination point 134 a. For example, theuser 104 a can provide addresses or place names (e.g., the name of a neighborhood, building, landmark, etc.) for thestarting point 132 a anddestination point 134 a. As another example, theuser 104 a can interact with a map displayed by theroute providing application 130 to indicate (e.g., by pointing) thestarting point 132 a anddestination point 134 a. Information associated with thepoints client device 102 a to theroute providing system 110 via the network(s) and the computing server(s) 108. - During state (B), the route can be determined, including information defining the route. For example, the
route providing system 110 can use theroute generator 112 to generate one ormore routes starting point 132 a to thedestination point 134 a indicated by theuser 104 a. In the present example, the route 140 (e.g., a route along a coastal road) includes astarting point 132 b (corresponding to point 132 a) and adestination point 134 b (corresponding to point 134 a). The route 150 (e.g., a highway route) in the present example includes astarting point 132 c (corresponding to point 132 a) and adestination point 134 c (corresponding to point 134 a). Routes can be generated by referencing map representations, for example, and by determining possible paths along and between roads included in the representations. In some implementations, information defining the route may be supplemented with information such as speed limits, construction schedules, weather conditions, and traffic patterns. Thus, routes can be optimized for such factors as distance, time, convenience, and safety, for example. - In some implementations, one or more intermediary points along the route(s) can be identified. For example, the
route generator 112 can identifyintermediary point 142 along theroute 140, and can identifyintermediary points route 150. Intermediary points, for example, may be associated with providers of goods and services, or other places of interest. - During state (C), one or more content items can be determined. For example, the
route providing system 110 can use thecontent selector 114 to determine content items for presentation to theuser 104 a based at least in part on the route information. Content items may include content such as text, video, graphics, and audio, for example, and may be provided by thecontent data store 122. - In some implementations, content items may be determined based on user interests (e.g., activities, hobbies, research areas, etc.). The
route providing system 110 can use theinterests identifier 116, for example, to identify interests of theuser 104 a. For example, theuser 104 a, can use an application executed by theclient computing device 102 a to directly provide information related to his or her interests. As another example, interests of theuser 104 a can be inferred by examining web browsing histories or search query logs associated with the user. Processes for collecting information related to user interests may include options allowing users to opt in/out, and may include techniques for maintaining user privacy. For example, user data can be generalized (e.g., based on user demographics) rather than associated with particular users. Encryption and obfuscation techniques can also be used to protect user privacy. Information related to user interests can be stored and provided by theinterests data store 120, for example. - In some implementations, content items may be determined based on route classifications. For example, the
route providing system 110 can use theroute classifier 118 to classify theroutes - In the present example, the
route classifier 118 may determine that the route 140 (includingstarting point 132 b,intermediary point 142, anddestination point 134 b) primarily follows a coastline, and thus may be classified as a “scenic route”. Theroute classifier 118 may also determine, for example, that the route 150 (includingstarting point 132 c,intermediary points destination point 134 c) primarily follows highways, and thus may be classified as a “highway route”. Thus, in the present example, content items potentially of interest touser 104 a and/or of relevance to route 140 (e.g., the “scenic route”), such as information related to scenic overlooks or historical markers along theroute 140, can be selected by thecontent selector 114 for presentation to theuser 104 a. As another example, content items potentially of interest touser 104 a and/or of relevance to route 150 (e.g., the “highway route”), such as information related to conveniences such as rest stops and fast food restaurants along theroute 150, can be selected. - During state (D), route information and content items can be delivered. For example, the
route providing system 110 can deliver information associated with theroute 140, theroute 150, or both, to theclient computing device 102 a via the network(s) 106 for presentation to theuser 104 a. Prior to embarkation of theuser 104 a to thedestination 134 a, for example, the user can interact with the content items determined by thecontent selector 114. Thus, content items of potentially of interest to theuser 104 a can be provided prior to embarkation, assisting theuser 104 a in trip planning and/or route selection. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram of anexample system 200 that can receive route classification selections from content item providers. In some implementations, multiple entities (e.g., organizations, businesses, advertisers) can be provided with information associated with multiple route classifications including selectable classification labels. By selecting route classifications available for targeting, for example, the entities can publish information (e.g., content, recommendations, advertisements) to users embarking on routes matching certain criteria. Targeting for particular classifications can be facilitated by a user interface associated with a campaign origination/management tool (not shown). - In the present example, a route providing system 202 (e.g., similar to the
route providing system 110, shown inFIG. 1 ) can access information associated with classified routes via a routeclassifications data store 204. Theroute providing system 202, for example, can provide route classification information 210 to entities 212. For example, route classification information can include labels such as “scenic route”, “highway route”, “family vacation”, “couples vacation”, “long trip”, “short trip”, and the like. The entities 212, for example, can select from the provided route classification labels, and can provide route classification selection information 214 to theroute providing system 202. - In some implementations, route classification selection information 214 received from the entities 212 can be used by the
route providing system 202 for determining content items for presentation to users responsive to route requests. For example, upon determining that a particular user has requested route information for a route classified by the route classifier 118 (shown inFIG. 1 ) as a “scenic route”, the route providing system 110 (also shown inFIG. 1 ) may provide the user with content items associated with one or more entities 212 that have selected the route classification. Thus, in the present example, entities that desire to target content to users traveling along “scenic routes” may do so. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for delivering route information. In some implementations, theprocess 300 may be performed by the system 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ), and will be described as such for the purpose of clarity. Briefly, theprocess 300 can include receiving a request for a route from a starting point to a destination point, and determining the route including route information defining the route. The route, starting point, destination point, and/or one or more intermediary points along the route can be classified. Content items for presentation can be determined based on route information, and the route information can be delivered. - A request from a user for a route, for example, from a starting point to a destination point, can be received (302). For example, the
user 104 a can employ theroute providing application 130 executed by theclient computing device 102 a to request one or more routes including thestarting point 132 and the destination point 134. The route request can be received by theroute providing system 110, for example, via the network(s) 106. In some implementations, the starting point may be inferred from the current position of the user. For example, Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities of theclient computing device 102 a or location identifying capabilities of thenetwork 106 can be used to provide starting point information included in the route request. As another example, information associated with the current position of the user can be directly provided by theuser 104 a (e.g., via a user interface). - In some implementations, receiving the request for a route from the user may include receiving a trip purpose description. For example, the
user 104 a can employ theroute providing application 130 executed by theclient computing device 102 a to indicate a trip purpose description such as “this is a scenic trip for me”, “this is a business trip for me”, or another description. The description can be indicated by a user selection, for example, or by text or voice entry by the user. - The route can be determined (304), including route information defining the route. For example, the
route generator 112 can determine one or more routes (e.g.,routes 140, 150) between thestarting point 132 and the destination point 134. Route information, for example, may include navigational information such as route directions and mapping information (e.g., a map or streetview), and may include supplemental route information such as speed limits, construction schedules, weather conditions, and traffic patterns. Such navigational and supplemental route information can be used by theroute generator 112 for determining routes and selecting content items for presentation to users, for example, and can be provided to users in association with determined routes. - In some implementations, one or more intermediary points along the route may be identified. For example, the
route generator 112 can identify theintermediary point 142 along theroute 140, and can identify theintermediary points route 150. Intermediary points (e.g., points 142, 152, 154) may be associated with providers of goods and services (e.g., stores, gas stations, banks, restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues, etc.), or other places of interest (e.g., landmarks, parks, recreational areas, tourist destinations, etc.). - The route, the starting point, the destination point, and/or one or more intermediary points can be classified (306). In some implementations, classifying may include evaluating one or more predetermined criteria, including route attributes, route point attributes, and route user attributes, and providing one or more descriptive labels based on the classification. For example, the
route classifier 118 can classify theroutes starting point 132, the destination point 134, theintermediary points user 104 a. Classification, for example, may include comparing route information and route request information associated with multiple users 104 for patterns of similarity, and associating the routes with classification labels (e.g., the classification labels provided to the entities 212, as shown inFIG. 2 ). - In some implementations, starting points may be classified. For example, the
starting point 132 may be associated with an area such as a residential area, and theroute classifier 118 may classify thepoint 132 as a “residential neighborhood”. As another example, thestarting point 132 may be associated with an area such as an office park, and theroute classifier 118 may classify thepoint 132 as a “business area”. - In some implementations, destination points may be classified. For example, the destination point 134 may be associated with a tourist destination such as an amusement park, and the
route classifier 118 may classify the point 134 as a “family recreation” destination. As another example, the destination point 134 may be associated with a shopping destination such as a mall, and theroute classifier 118 may classify the point 134 as a “shopping” destination. - In some implementations, intermediary points may be classified. For example, the
intermediary points route classifier 118 as “dining establishments”, for example. As another example, points associated with parks, hiking trails, and camping areas may be classified by theroute classifier 118 as “outdoor recreation areas”. - In some implementations, routes may be classified. For example, the
route classifier 118 can evaluate one or more portions of a route including the starting point, destination point, and/or intermediary points of a route to classify the route as recreational, business-related, or another such classification. If a particular route includes a starting point classified as a “residential neighborhood” and a destination point classified as a “family recreation” destination, for example, the route may be classified by theroute classifier 118 as a “family vacation” route. As another example, if a route includes a starting point classified as a “residential neighborhood”, and a destination point and/or one or more intermediary points classified as “outdoor recreation areas”, the route may be classified as an “outdoors vacation” route. - In some implementations, classifying a route may include classifying the route as being longer than a predetermined distance. For example, the
route classifier 118 can evaluate the length of a particular route, and can use the length as a criterion for classification. If the route is shorter than a predetermined distance (e.g., twenty miles, ten miles, five miles, a mile, or another suitable distance), for example, and if the destination point is classified as a “shopping destination”, theroute classifier 118 may classify the route as an “errand trip”. As another example, if the route is longer than a predetermined distance, and if the destination point is classified as a “business area”, theroute classifier 118 may classify the route as a “business trip”. - Optionally, a targeting selection of one or more route classifications may be received (308) from a provider of one or more content items. For example, referring to
FIG. 2 , one or more entities 212 can select from provided route classification labels (e.g., included in the route classification information 210), and can provide route classification selection information 214 to theroute providing system 202. In some implementations, the entities 212 can also provide content items to be delivered to users embarking on routes associated with the selected classification labels, and content items can be delivered to users based at least in part on the selection. For example, an amusement park can provide content items associated with the park (e.g., contact information, hours of operation, service information, etc.), and can specify that users embarking on routes proximate to the park are to be provided with the content items should their route be classified as a “family vacation”. - Prior to the user embarking on the route, one or more content items for presentation to the user can be determined (310), based at least in part on the route information. For example, the
content selector 114 can select one or more content items from thecontent data store 122 to be provided to theuser 104 a prior to embarkation of the user. Content items, for example, may include content such as text, video, graphics, and audio content, and may be used to present information associated with various entities. For example, informational content (e.g., contact information, hours of operation, prices, reviews, etc.) related to entities associated with various points (e.g., intermediary points, destination points) along theroutes content selector 114. As another example, promotional content such as advertisements and coupons may be determined. - In some implementations, determining the content items may be based at least in part on classification of the route, the starting point, the destination point, and/or one or more of the intermediary points. For example, if the
route 140 were to be classified by theroute classifier 118 as an “outdoor vacation”, thecontent selector 114 may select one or more content items associated with outdoor activities, such as hiking and camping. As another example, if theroute 140 were to be classified by theroute classifier 118 as an “errand trip”, thecontent selector 114 may select one or more content items potentially relevant to theuser 104 a while running errands, such as content items associated with banks, gas stations, and convenience stores. - In some implementations, one or more of the content items may be determined based on interests associated with the user. For example, the
interests identifier 116 can receive from theinterests data store 120 information associated with interests of theuser 104 a. If theuser 104 a is determined by the interests identifier 116 to have an interest in fine dining, for example, dining-related content items selected by thecontent selector 114 may be selected from upscale restaurants. As another example, if theuser 104 a is identified as having an interest in home improvement, content items associated with entities such as hardware stores may be selected by thecontent selector 114 for a route classified by theroute classifier 118 as an “errand trip”. - In some implementations, one or more of the content items may be determined based at least in part on a trip purpose description provided by the user. For example, if the
user 104 a indicates that the trip is intended to be a “scenic trip”, thecontent selector 114 may select one or more content items related to sightseeing activities or destinations. As another example, if theuser 104 a indicates that the trip is intended to be “business trip”, thecontent selector 114 may select one or more content items related to business-related activities or conveniences. - In some implementations, determining content items may be based at least in part on length of the route. For example, for a short route (e.g., an “errand trip”), content items selected by the
content selector 114 may be related to convenience and service. As another example, for a long trip (e.g., a trip classified as a “vacation”), content items associated with dining and sleeping accommodations may be selected by thecontent selector 114. If the time of day at which theuser 104 a embarks on a route is known or can be determined, for example, thecontent selector 114 may select content items associated with dining establishments along the route that theuser 104 a will pass at meal times, and may select content items associated with sleeping accommodations along the route that theuser 104 a will reach at the end of a day of driving. - The route information and the one or more content items can be delivered (312) to the user responsive to the request. For example, prior to embarkation of the
user 104 a to the destination point 134, theroute providing system 110 can provide route information and content item information via the network(s) 106 to theclient computing device 102 a for presentation to theuser 104 a. - In some implementations, a plurality of routes can be determined, and determining a route for delivery may be based in part on the one or more content items that are determined for each route. For example, the
route generator 112 can generate multiple routes (e.g.,routes 140, 150), theroute classifier 118 can classify each of the routes, and thecontent selector 114 can select content items for each. In the present example, theroute providing system 110 can determine one or more of theroutes user 104 a based at least in part on the selected content items. For example, if theroutes route 140 is associated with one or more content items potentially of greater interest (e.g., as determined by the interests identifier 116) to theuser 104 a, information and content items associated with theroute 140 may be delivered to theuser 104 a. - In some implementations, determining a route for delivery may be based in part on a trip purpose description provided by the user. For example, if the
user 104 a indicates that the trip is intended to be a “scenic trip”, a route classified by theroute classifier 118 as “scenic” can be provided to theuser 104 a. As another example, routes can be modified based on the determined content items. If theuser 104 a has indicated a desire to embark on a “scenic trip”, for example, theroute generator 112 can generate or modify a route to pass by destinations associated with content items that may be of interest to theuser 104 a. - By providing content information in association with route information, for example, users can be provided with useful information while traveling. In addition, by classifying routes and providing content based at least in part on the classifications, route characteristics can be considered when selecting content.

FIG. 4 is a flowchart of anexample process 400 for delivering directions. In some implementations, theprocess 400 may be performed by the system 100 (shown inFIG. 1 ), and will be described as such for the purpose of clarity. Briefly, theprocess 400 can include receiving a request for directions from a starting point to a destination point, provided from a device associated with a location where the location is not the starting point. Directions can be determined, as can content items for presentation, based on the directions, starting point, and/or destination point. Directions and content items can be delivered, responsive to the request. - A request from a user can be received (402) for directions from a starting point to a destination point, the request provided from a device that is associated with a location where the location is not the starting point. For example, the
user 104 a can employ an application executed by theclient computing device 102 a to request one or more routes including thestarting point 132 and the destination point 134. In the present example, the location of thedevice 102 a (and theuser 104 a) is not the same as thestarting point 132. For example, theuser 104 a may use thedevice 102 a to perform research for various travel options in advance of a trip. The route request can be received by theroute providing system 110, for example, via the network(s) 106. - The directions can be determined (404). For example, the route generator can generate step-by-step directions for one or more routes from the
starting point 132 to the destination point 134. Directions, for example, may include navigational directions such as street names, place names, turning directions, distances, and times. Supplemental information such as speed limits, construction schedules, weather conditions, and traffic patterns may also be included. - One or more content items for presentation to the user can be determined (406), based at least in part on the directions, the starting point, or the destination point. For example, the
content selector 114 can select one or more content items from thecontent data store 122 to be provided to theuser 104 a. Content items, for example, may include content such as text, video, graphics, and audio content, and may be used to present information associated with various entities. As described above, the selection of content items can be based at least in part on a classification of the direction information, the starting point, the destination point, and/or intermediary points, the length of the associated trip, the interests of the user, available content items or a combination of one or more of these. - The directions and the content items can be delivered (408) to the user, responsive to the request. For example, the
route providing system 110 can provide direction information and content item information via the network(s) 106 to theclient computing device 102 a for presentation to theuser 104 a. Theuser 104 a can interact with the directions to navigate to the destination point 134, for example, and can interact with the content item information to locate potential points of interest along the route the destination point. -
