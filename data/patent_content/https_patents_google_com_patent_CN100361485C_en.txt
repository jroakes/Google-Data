Fig. 1 has usually described the communication system that realizes improved Nonlinear Processing according to the present invention effectively.In the described execution mode of Fig. 1, communication system is a code division multiple access (CDMA) radio telephone system, yet the general those of skill in the art in this area can know that various realization echoes are eliminated and/or the communication system of the other types of noise suppressing system also can be used the present invention effectively.Next public switch telephone network 103 (PSTN) is connected to mobile switching centre 106 (MSC).Well-known in this area, PSTN 103 has the Wireline exchange capacity and MSC 106 has the exchange capacity relevant with the cdma wireless telephone system.Controller 109 also is connected to MSC 106, and controller 109 comprises echo elimination and speech coding/decoding.109 controls of this controller advance/go out the Route Selection of the signal of base station 112,113, and 112,113 of base stations can communicate with travelling carriage 115.The cdma wireless telephone system meets interim standards (IS) 95-A.The particulars of relevant IS-95-A, referring to " TIA/EIA/IS-95-A; ' Mobile Station-Base StationCompatibility Standard for Dual Mode Wideband Spread SpectrumCellular System ', July 1993 ".Though the control ability of the exchange capacity of MSC 106 and controller 109 is shown in configuration among Fig. 1, persons skilled in the art are to be understood that these two functions can merge in the same physical entity on system realizes.
For the improved Nonlinear Processing according to the present invention is described, the echo of prior art is eliminated line map describe and help.Fig. 2 has usually described a typical prior art echo that is used for communication system (as the communication system 100 of Fig. 1) and has eliminated line map.As shown in Figure 2, be input to voice decoder parts (piece sampling rate) 209 in the controller 109 from the signal of travelling carriage 115.Voice decoder parts (piece sampling rate) are well known in the art, and it is decoded to " coding " speech that is encoded in travelling carriage 115 in fact.The output of voice decoder 209, promptly the Echo Canceller reference signal 205, and the operation principle that is input to Echo Canceller 203,203 will be done general the description below.In fact Echo Canceller reference signal 205 by MSC 106 and unaffected, finally arrives PSTN 103, is sent to the user of PSTN 103 at this, is generally referenced as the land line user.Well known in the art, in PSTN 103, intercouple relevant with the transmission line of input and output PSTN 103 can echogenicity.This echo is represented with the transfer function H (z) shown in the parts (piece sampling rate) 221.Like this, what illustrate not only comprises the pure signal that sends from the land line systems user from PSTN 103 output and the signal that is input to MSC 106, and also comprises the echo of the signal that comes from travelling carriage 115 as mentioned above.This signal is input to Echo Canceller 203 in the controller 109 once more by MSC 106.Echo Canceller 203 deducts the echo replica of an estimation, echogenicity arrester residue signal 207 from input.Echo Canceller 203 comprises a nonlinear processor 212, and it further suppresses Echo Canceller residue signal 207 based on control signal 224 states.
As shown in Figure 2, Nonlinear Processing can provide an a kind of low level comfort noise source 214 of sensation of alive circuit to realize by switching to the terminal use.To notice that importantly 214 in comfort noise source provides the low level white noise, and be that the PSTN or the user of travelling carriage are irrelevant fully.This Echo Canceller 203 is well known in the art, and one of them example is called in " Digital Signal ProcessingApplications with the TMS 320 Family " publication the 417th page as described in 436 pages the application note as the name by U.S. Texas Instruments in 1986.Another example of Echo Canceller 203 is called the U.S. Patent number 5 of " Method of Performing Convergence in aLeast Mean Square Adaptive Filter Echo Canceller " by the name that licenses to people such as Ashley and transferred the assignee of the present invention, 295,136 provide.G.165 the Echo Canceller of describing in this patent meets the CCITT agreement quoted the front.
The signal of Echo Canceller 203 (exactly nonlinear processor 212 in the Echo Canceller 203) output is input to noise suppressing system 206.In this preferred implementation, the 4.1.2 joint that the name of noise suppressing system 206 as issue on September 9th, 1996 is called among the TlA file IS-127 of " Enhanced Variable RateCodec; Speech Service Option 3 for Wideband Spread Spectrum DigitalSystems " is described, and its content is incorporated the application in order to reference.The signal of noise suppressing system 206 outputs is input to voice encryption device 210, is well known in the art, and it is encoded to the signal of noise suppressed so that be sent to travelling carriage 115 by base station 112,113.The speed that also has shown in Fig. 2 is determined algorithm 211, and it utilizes the voice signal energy and the spectral property that are input to voice encryption device 210 to determine the speech behavior.
Fig. 3 has usually described the energy-time graph of the prior art arrangement that is used for further specifying Fig. 2.As shown in Figure 3, above 301 representatives of that energy curve be input to the signal of Echo Canceller 203 from MSC 106 outputs, in Fig. 2, mark with putting an A (pt.A).This signal comprises the echo that produces by H (z) 221 and from the noise of the land line user among the PSTN 103.Below that energy curve 302 be from noise suppressing system 206 output and be input to the signal of voice encryption device 210, among Fig. 2 shown in a B.During time period 304 and 306 in Fig. 3, the user of the high expression of the energy level of curve 301 travelling carriage 115 talks in the meantime.During the time period 307, the user of travelling carriage 115 is sounding not, so energy from voice decoder 209 outputs is little during this.
With reference to curve among Fig. 3 302, during time period 304 and 306, the input difference of comparator 227 is big, and control signal 224 is effectively so that comfort noise source 214 is used as the input of noise suppressing system 206.During the time period 307, when the input difference of comparator 227 hour, it is from the land line user among the PSTN 103 that control signal 224 allows the input of noise suppressing systems 206.Input from comfort noise source 214 generally has the lower energy level of noise input of the land line user in PSTN 103 recently, shown in the time period on the energy curve 302 312.Because the energy during the time period 312 (being caused by the input from land line 214) is bigger than the energy during the time period 304, therefore noise suppressing system 206 its inputs of hypothesis have speech, so the effect of releasing noise suppressing system 206 is until recovering on the time period 315.In fact, noise suppressing system 206 13dB that during the time period 315, land line noise source level decayed.During the time period 306, when the output at voice decoder 209 had speech again, the input difference of comparator 227 became again greatly, and control signal 224 is effectively so that comfort noise source 214 is used as the input of noise suppressing system 206 again.To notice that importantly energy curve 302 is the inputs at voice encryption device 210, then all energy level variations of describing in energy curve 302 are encoded by voice encryption device 210 and with the land line telex network of PSTN 103 during send to the user of travelling carriage 115.
Fig. 4 has usually described the improved Nonlinear Processing that is used for communication system according to the present invention.As shown in Figure 4, the comfort noise source 214 among Fig. 2 has been removed, and the control signal 224 of comparator 227 outputs is directly inputted to noise suppressing system 403.Device 401 in preferred implementation according to the present invention comprises this comparator 227 and noise suppressing system 403.It allows the function of the Nonlinear Processing (being Nonlinear Processing in the present embodiment) of device 401 to be provided by noise suppressing system 403.When control signal 224 effectively the time, noise suppressing system 403 utilizes control signal 224 to forbid the correction repeatedly of background noise estimation, and this point is for a more detailed description with reference to Fig. 5.It can avoid any residual echo to depart from the noise estimation that noise suppressing system 403 provides.At last, this control signal 224 is used for each band attenuation is added to maximum magnitude the signal to noise ratio (snr) of current remaining channel by the gain calculator in the noise suppressing system 403.In this embodiment, noise suppressing system 403 provides a kind of device that is used for based on the background noise of this control signal analog subscriber, simulates PSTN user's background noise.
In more detail, when control signal 224 effectively the time, channel gain is changed so that forms the residual echo signal that its spectrum and noise estimation are equal to, the predetermined value of decaying then.Importantly to note it does not comprise noise synthetic (this can with prior art among Fig. 2 relatively, comfort noise source 214 has been used in the there), but the residual echo signal by filtering suitably to send the background noise after approaching of not perceiveed carried out normal noise suppressed.Because this improved Nonlinear Processing device has the accurate power spectrum density, so for example the speed in the communication system is determined in other aspects of communication system or speech act detects and is improved equally.

224 couples of sample value i are invalid if this has guaranteed control signal, and it is invalid to adjust 526 pairs of whole group L sample values of control signal so.
At this moment, the summation v of speech amount (m), the total channel energy budget E of present frame
Tot(m) and the spectrum deviation delta
E(m) be input to correction decision device 512 so that carry out as adjusting control signal 526 according to Nonlinear Processing of the present invention.Adjusting control signal 526 is corrected decision device 512 and is used to forbid revising mark (update_flag) and to stop background noise is estimated/revised.Decision logic, its pseudo-code are shown in the back, and described in flow chart such as Fig. 9, it has illustrated how noise estimation correction judgement finally realizes.Its process proceeds to step 903 from step 900, revises mark (update_flag) and is cleared.Then, in step 904, whether the correction logic of Vilmur (only being VMSUM) realizes less than a correction threshold (UPDATE_THLD) by the summation v (m) that detects the speech amount.If the summation of speech amount, is revised counter (update_cnt) so less than this correction threshold and is cleared in step 905, and the correction mark is set in step 906.The pseudo-code of step 903 to 906 is as follows:
update_flag＝FALSE；

Tot(m) compare with the background noise of representing with dB (NOISE_FLOOR_DB), will compose deviation delta simultaneously
E(m) compare with deviation threshold (DEV_THLD).If the total channel energy budget is composed deviation less than deviation threshold greater than background noise, then revising counter increases in step 908.After revising the counter increase, in step 909, detect to judge and whether revise counter more than or equal to revising counter threshold (UPDATE_CNT_THLD).If the result who detects in the step 909 is " very ", in step 906, revises mark so and be set.Step 907 to 909 and 906 pseudo-code are as follows:
else?if((E
tot(m)＞NOISE_FLOOR_DB)and(Δ
E(m)＜DEV_THLD))
{
update_cnt＝update_cnt+1
if(update_cnt≥UPDATE_CNT_THLD)
update_flag＝TRUE
}
As shown in Figure 9, if one of detection in step 907 and 909 is a "No", or after the correction mark has been set in step 906, then realize avoiding revising the logic of mark long-term " slow ".Realize that this hysteresis logic is to accumulate and cause an illegal pressure correction for fear of minimum spectrum deviation in long-time.This processing procedure is from step 910, detects to judge the last time correction Counter Value (last_update_cnt) of N frame (HYSTER_CNT_THLD) before whether revise counter equals at this.In this preferred implementation, six frames are used as a threshold value, yet any amount frame all can be used as threshold value.If the detection in step 910 is " very ", to revise counter so and in step 911, be cleared, processing procedure is withdrawn into the next frame in the step 912.If the detection in the step 910 is " vacation ", processing procedure directly is withdrawn into the next frame in the step 912 so.The pseudo-code of step 910 to 912 is as follows:
if(update_cnt＝＝last_update_cnt)
hyster_cnt＝hyster_cnt+1
else
hyster_cnt＝0
last_update_cnt＝update_cnt
if(hyster_cnt＞HYSTER_CNT_THLD)
update_cnt＝0。
In this preferred implementation, the value of the constant that the front is used is respectively:
UPDATE_THLD＝35，
NOISE_FLOOR_DB＝10log
10(l)，
DEV_THLD＝28，
UPDATE_CNT_THLD=50 and
HYSTER_CNT_THLD＝6。
When the correction mark of a given frame in step 906 was set, the estimation of the interchannel noise of next frame just was corrected.The following formula correction is pressed in the interchannel noise estimation in smoothing filter 524:

n(m).The interchannel noise estimation E that revises
n(m) be used as the input that above-mentioned channel SNR is estimated device 518, also be used as the input of following gain calculator 533.
Next step, noise suppressing system 403 judges whether channel SNR should regulate.This judgement is finished in channel SNR adjuster 527, and its calculating has the channel SNR exponential quantity number of channel of (this value surpasses an index threshold).During self regulates processing, channel SNR adjuster 527 reduces the SNR of those SNR indexes less than the special channel that restores threshold value (SETBACK_THLD), if perhaps the summation of speech amount is less than metric threshold (METRIC_THLD), then reduce the SNR of all channels.The pseudo-code that appears at the channel SNR adjusting processing in the channel SNR adjuster 527 is expressed as follows:

Figure 10 has usually described and has realized the formed energy-time graph of improved Nonlinear Processing according to the present invention.With reference to Fig. 4 and Figure 10, during time period 1006 and 1009, the input difference of comparator 227 is big, and the control signal 224 that is input to noise suppressing system 403 is effective.During the time period 1012, the input difference of comparator 227 that is input to noise suppressing system 403 is little, and control signal 224 is invalid.Yet, be different from the signal energy 302 among Fig. 3, be constant according to the signal energy among Figure 10 of the present invention 1003.This be because, be cancelled at the comfort noise generator 214 shown in prior art Fig. 2, the energy signal 1003 (point " C " among Fig. 4) that is input to noise suppressing system 403 comprises and noisiness from the noise " identical " of PSTN 103 basically.Moreover when the control signal 224 that is input to noise suppressing system 403 effectively the time, noise suppressing system 403 avoids distinguishing background noise and voice signal.Like this, when the control signal in the present embodiment 224 effectively the time, the noise and the signal (being echo remnants) that are input to noise suppressing system 403 all are attenuated all the time.Remain unchanged though shown whole energy during this period of time, what need reaffirm is that spectrum signature is also consistent.
Although the present invention is carried out specific expression and description with reference to a specific execution mode, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that without prejudice to the present invention's spirit with do not exceed under the situation of the scope of the invention, can realize various variations in form and details.For example, in fact can separate according to the device 401 shown in the Echo Canceller 400 of the present invention with Echo Canceller.In addition, network terminal realizes in the communication system though device 401 according to the present invention is described as be in, and device 401 can be realized in the mobile terminal of system equally.For example, if device 401 according to the present invention realizes that in travelling carriage 115 required unique variation is to remove PSTN 103 and MSC 106 among Fig. 4 so, and changes the model of realizing in the transfer function H (z) shown in the parts (piece sampling rate) 221.
In view of the above, the theory diagram among Figure 11 has been described the device of realizing according to the present invention 401 in travelling carriage 115.As shown in figure 11, when the signal in being input to Echo Canceller 400 sent from the microphone 1106 of travelling carriage 115, the signal of Echo Canceller 400 outputs was fed into the loud speaker 1103 of travelling carriage 115 again.Transfer function H (z) is a transfer function based on the sound model of the accurate environment of representing travelling carriage 115 preferably in the parts (piece sampling rate) 1109.As realizing in the network terminal of communication system, the operation of said apparatus 401 remains unchanged.In the present embodiment, provide a background noise that is used for based on the noise suppressing system 403 analogue mobile station users of the device of the background noise of control signal analog subscriber.
