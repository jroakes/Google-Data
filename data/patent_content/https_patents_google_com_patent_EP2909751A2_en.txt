For purposes of illustration only, the process of FIG. 4 is described below with respect to computing device 2 of FIGS. 1 and 2 and GUI 12 of FIG. 1.
- Aggregation module 8 may retrieve one or more pieces of information based on an identified contact. In some examples, aggregation module 8 may retrieve a substantial amount of data. To limit the data displayed at GUI 12, computing device 2 may determine a priority rating for each piece of information. The priority rating, generally, is a score, or number value, representing the predicted relevance to the user in a particular context and for the identified contact. Aggregation module 8 may base the priority rating value on data retrieved with the information, including associated application data, and the contact and associated contact identifiers.
- aggregation module 8 may retrieve many, e.g., more than 5, pieces of information for a determined contact. In response to receiving many pieces of information, aggregation module 8 determines a priority rating value for each piece of information (90). For instance, aggregation module 8 can be configured to assign a higher priority to the information of a similar or same type as the application that is currently-executing by computing device 2. A higher priority rating may be given to the information when aggregation module 8 identifies multiple pieces of information that match information in the currently-executing application and the application sending the retrieved information. In the example of FIG.
- the displayed pieces of information have a higher priority rating due to the Aggregation module 8 may give a higher priority rating to information more recent in time or from associated with an application that is more frequently used.
- Aggregation module 8 can alternatively or additionally compare the identity of the application being executed by computing device 2 to the application from which aggregation module 8 received the instruction to generate the respective information.
- Aggregation module 8 may assign a higher priority value to the information based on an instruction from the currently executed application compared stored information from another one of applications 12.
- aggregation module 8 can compare the information associated with the activity performed by applications 12 and information stored in the respective application. Aggregation module 8 may then assign a higher priority rating to a piece of information that is more closely related to the activity that the executed application is performing. For example, when the user is posting on a social networking message on the user's account, older posts to the identified person would have a higher priority rating.
- applications 12 locates a birthday notification event for a specific person in a calendar application, when the name of the specific person is identified in an email that the user is composing, on the same day as the specific person's birthday, then generating the event on the same day will increase the priority rating for the birthday information associated with the recipient of the email.
- Aggregation module 8 may analyze and compare any kind of information associated with stored information of applications 12, such as type of information, date and time of the information or execution of the respective application, recency and frequency of executing the respective application, and with the activity performed by the application.
- the recipient of the text message may have an association with the same social networking service of the user.
- the association may cause the social networking posts to receive a higher priority rating.
- the time associated with the data may also increase the priority score, such as text message 18 received 30 minutes ago may receive a higher priority rating over information received at an earlier time, such as email 24 received 1 month ago.
- Computing device 2 may determine threshold value based on the overall priority rating scores of the pieces of information (92). For example, aggregation module 8 may select the pieces of information with the top 1-20% of scores. For example, aggregation module 8 may determine a threshold value based on all the priority rating values. The value may identify a priority rating value at the 20% of all scores and determine this value as the threshold value.
- Aggregation compares the determined priority rating value to a threshold value to determine which pieces of information to select as information associated with the contact (94).
- aggregation module 8 may filter the information to improve the accuracy of the retrieved information and the relevancy of the information. For each sharing service with a probability rating value that does not satisfy the threshold value (e.g., is lower than the threshold value) ("NO" branch of 94), computing device 2 does not select the respective piece of information for display at GUI 12 (98).
- aggregation module 8 For each piece of information with a probability value that satisfies the threshold value (e.g., is greater the threshold value) ("YES" branch of 94), aggregation module 8 selects the respective piece of information as a piece of information associated with the contact (96). Computing device 10 displays the selected preferences at GUI 12 (99). In some examples, aggregation module 8 outputs the retrieved pieces of information based on the determined probability value.
