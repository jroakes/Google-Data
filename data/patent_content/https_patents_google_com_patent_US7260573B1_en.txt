Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to the field of search engines for locating documents in a computer network system, and in particular, to a system and method of personalizing search results produced by a search engine in accordance with user-specific parameters.
- Search engines provide a powerful tool for locating documents in a large database of documents, such as the documents on the World Wide Web (WWW) or the documents stored on the computers of an Intranet.
- the documents are located in response to a search query submitted by a user.
- a typical search query includes only two to three terms.
- the number of documents accessible via the Internet grows, the number of documents that match the search query may also increase.
- not every document matching the search query is equally important from the user's perspective. As a result, a user might be overwhelmed by the enormous number of documents retrieved by a search engine, if the search engine did not order the search results based on their relevance to the user's query.
- PageRank algorithm One approach to improving the relevance of search results to a search query is to use the link structure of the documents in the database, such as the links between documents on the WWW, to compute global “importance” scores for the documents in the database. These scores are used to affect the order of search results when they are presented to the user. This approach is sometimes referred to as the PageRank algorithm. A more detailed description of the PageRank algorithm can be found in the article “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine” by S. Brin and L. Page, 7 th International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia and U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference as background information.
- PageRank An important assumption of the PageRank algorithm is that there is a “random surfer” who starts his web surfing at a randomly selected web page and keeps clicking on the links embedded in the web pages, never clicking on the “back” button. Occasionally, the random surfer re-starts his surfing by randomly picking another web page.
- the probability that the random surfer visits (i.e., views or downloads) a web page is a function of its PageRank.
- a web page may have a high PageRank if there are many other web pages pointing to it, or if some of the web pages pointing to it have a high PageRank. For example, www.espn.com is a famous website reporting sports-related news.
- www.espn.com is more frequently visited by WWW users than www.gostanford.com, and we will further assume that www.espn.com has a higher PageRank than www.gostanford.com.
- An anchor text “Sports News” is associated with each link, characterizing the key feature of the corresponding destination page.
- a search engine such as the Google search engine
- the engine may return both web pages 110 - 2 and 120 - 2 . If so, the www.espn.com web page 120 - 2 would likely be displayed higher in the search results than the www.gostanford.com web page 110 - 2 because page 120 - 2 has a higher PageRank than page 110 - 2 .
- the Google search engine determines the position of a document in a set of search results as a function of the PageRanks of the documents in the search results, the query terms, the documents in the search results, and the anchor text of links to those documents.
- the Google search engine determines the position of a document in a set of search results as a function of the PageRanks of the documents in the search results, the query terms, the documents in the search results, and the anchor text of links to those documents.
- a search engine produces a set of search results in response to a query.
- the search results identify a set of documents, each of which is assigned an information retrieval score based on its content and the query terms.
- the information retrieval score is a query dependent score that does not take into account the user-specific parameters.
- the method identifies a set of source documents having links to the document.
- the anchor text of each of the identified source documents is examined to determine if the anchor text satisfies a predefined requirement with respect to the query terms. After identifying the source documents whose anchor text satisfies the predefined requirement, a personalized page importance score is computed for each of the identified source documents according to the set of user-specific parameters.
- a personalized anchor text score is generated for the document by accumulating the personalized page importance scores of the identified source documents.
- the personalized anchor text score of a document is combined with the document's information retrieval score to produce a personalized ranking for the document.
- the personalized ranking can be used in ordering the document in the search results.
- FIG. 1 provides two examples of the link structure between different web pages, the two source web pages of the two examples having the same anchor text.
- FIG. 2 is a simplified diagram illustrating a search engine system that utilizes user specific information to produce personalized search results.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of a method of determining a personalized ranking for a document in a set of search results.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a method of ordering a set of search results in accordance with a user profile.
- the web page www.gostandford.com 110 - 2 may be ranked higher and ordered before web age www.espn.com 120 - 2 , depending on a variety of factors that are taken into account by the search result ranking function of the search engine.
- FIG. 2 is a simplified diagram illustrating a search engine system 200 .
- the search engine system 200 is implemented in a client-server network environment, which comprises one or more client computers 201 and one or more server computers 210 .
- a network crawler 220 (sometimes called a web crawler) locates and downloads documents from a document database or network 219 (e.g., the Internet or an Intranet).
- these documents are processed by a content indexer to produce a set of indexes and databases are generated
- An anchor text indexer 217 is responsible for generating an inverted anchor text index 211 from the links in each document received by the server 210 , including the text surrounding the links.
- the links and corresponding text are extracted from each document and stored in records identifying the source document, the target document associated with a link, and the anchor text associated with the link.
- an inverted anchor text index 211 is generated, mapping anchor text terms to the documents that are the target of the corresponding links.
- the inverted anchor text index 211 is merged with or incorporated in the inverted content index 208 . More information about anchor text indexing is provided in U.S.
- a user of the system 200 first submits a search query 203 through a client 201 .
- a search query typically includes a set of query terms, which identify terms to be included in documents that satisfy the search query.
- the search query is processed by a query processor 205 on the server side. Based on the search query, the query processor 205 generates search results 207 , typically a list of documents that satisfy the search query 203 , and returns the search results to client 201 .
- the query processor 205 communicates with various databases to identify documents that satisfy the search query and to determine how to order the search results.
- these includes the inverted content index 208 , the page importance scores database 209 and the inverted anchor text index 211 .
- the database that stores the inverted content index 208 first returns a set of documents identifiers, which identify documents that contain the query terms of the search query.
- the query processor 205 may submit the same query to the database storing the inverted anchor text index 211 to find another set of documents that satisfy the search query. It is possible that a document may appear in both sets of documents.
- the two sets of documents are submitted to the page importance scores database 209 and ordered in accordance with their respective page importance scores.
- the ordering of documents is query dependent, taking into account the documents' query independent page importance scores (one example of which is PageRank) as well as the position(s) in which the query terms are found in the documents within the search result.
- the search engine system 200 further includes a user information database 206 , with personalization information for its users.
- the personalization information for each respective user is herein called a user profile.
- the term user profile is used here without limitation on the particular data structures and methodology used to store the personalization information.
- a user in addition to submitting a search query 203 to the server 210 , a user can also submit user information 204 to the server 210 .
- the user information 204 may be in the form of a user profile or a set of user-specific parameters characterizing a user's background and preferences.
- user information 204 is submitted to the server together with the search query 302 .
- user information is submitted to the server separately.
- the user information 204 is derived by the server 210 at least in part from search queries previously submitted by the user and by the documents in the search results that the user chooses to view or use.
- the server 210 when the server 210 receives (or derives) user information 204 , it stores such information in a user information database 206 and associates the user information with a unique user ID. In other embodiments, the server 210 receives the user information 204 with each search query and does not retain such user information for use when processing subsequent search queries.
- the Page Importance Ranker 215 boosts the page importance scores of documents that are deemed to match the user-specific parameters, which in turn boosts the downstream documents linked to those documents. From another viewpoint, the Page Importance Ranker 215 boosts the page importance scores of documents of each host whose URL matches one or more of the user-specific parameters.
- a document is be deemed to match (or not match) user-specific parameters solely based on the URL of the document. In other embodiments, a document is deemed to match the user-specified parameters based not only on the URL of the document, but also based on the content of the document, and/or based on the anchor text content of links to the document.
- the document is assigned a personalized page importance score specified by a parameter in the user profile. For example, the user profile may specify for each URL keyword a particular page importance score adjustment that is to be applied to matching documents. When a document matches more than one URL keyword, the largest such page importance score adjustment is applied to the document. In other embodiments, the user profile may specify the adjustment or assignment of personalized page importance scores in other ways.
- the personalized page importance score of a document is only a function of the document, the user-specific parameters, and the link structure through which the document is related to other documents.
- the personalized page importance score of a document is a ranking factor that is independent of any individual search query submitted by the user to the search engine.
- the server 210 is configured to generate at least some of the user-specific parameters based on previous search queries submitted by the user, and thus a user's search queries may indirectly affect a document's personalized page importance score. For example, if a user has submitted many queries related to the standard aptitude test (SAT), the server 210 may update his user information and incorporate this information into the set of user-specific parameters.
- SAT standard aptitude test
- source document information 304 is extracted from the initial search results.
- the source document information 304 and the user profile 306 of the user who submitted the search query are used by a Personalized Anchor Text (AT) Score Generator 310 to generate personalized link analysis (LA) scores 312 for the source pages that correspond to each respective document (D 1 , D 2 , etc.) in the initial search results.
- the personalized LA score for a source document is its personalized page importance score (e.g., personalized PageRank), while in other embodiments, the personalized LA score for a source document is a function of its personalized page importance score. The computation of personalized page importance scores is discussed above.
- An accumulator 320 sums or otherwise combines the personalized LA scores for the source documents that link to each respective, thereby producing an anchor text (AT) score for each respective document in the initial search results.
- a search result ranking function 324 is then used to combine, for each respective document, the AT score and the IR score of the document to produce a set of final personalized ranking scores or values 326 .
- the documents are then ordered ( 326 ) in accordance with the personalized document rankings to produce a final, ordered set of search results 330 .
- the computer program based on the link structure associating various documents, the computer program identifies a set of source documents, each of which having a link to the candidate document and certain anchor text associated with its link.
- the anchor text in a source document needs to match at least one query term in order for the source document to contribute to determining the candidate document's personalized ranking.
- the computer program calculates a personalized link analysis (LA) score for each of the source documents identified at step 420 .
- this LA score is the same as the personalized page importance score of the document that is determined by the Page Importance Ranker 215 ( FIG. 2 ) on the basis of a set of user-specific parameters. Therefore, in the example shown in FIG. 1 , web page 110 - 1 should have a higher personalized page importance score or LA score than web page 120 - 1 based on a set of user-specific parameters provided by the user.
- the computer program accumulates them together to produce a personalized anchor text (AT) score for the candidate document (step 450 ).
- this personalized AT score is different from the conventional usage of anchor text, which is based solely on the textual content of the anchor text associated with a link to a candidate document.
- the personalized AT score is also a function of the personalized page importance score of a source document that includes the anchor text.
- the candidate document's personalized AT score can be defined as
- the method combines the IR score and personalized AT score together to generate a personalized ranking for the candidate document.
- the method computes a predefined function of the IR score, the page importance score (PS) and the personalized AT score of the candidate document to generate the personalized ranking:
- Personalized Ranking F 1( IR score, PS,AT score) where F1 is the predefined function.
- the page importance score for the candidate document may be either a system (not personalized) page importance score (e.g., the PageRank), or it may be a personalized page importance score.
- the personalized rankings for a set of candidate documents can be used by a search engine to order search results or for other further analysis.
- the IR score for a candidate document is also personalized using a personalized IR score generator 622 ( FIG. 6 ).
- the IR score is personalized by adding to each search query a set of terms obtained from the user profile.
- the added terms (herein called the user profile terms) are treated as optional terms, not required for satisfying the query, but which contribute to the IR score of the document if the terms are found within the content of a document that satisfies the search query.
- the IR score of a document will be increased if any of the user profile terms are located in the title of the document, in the URL of the document, or in the first K words of the document, where K is a predefined value.
- the resulting IR value is herein called a personalized IR value, and in such embodiments the personalized ranking function is applied to personalized IR value, along with the page importance score and AT score of the document to produce a personalized ranking value.
- an embodiment of a search engine 600 that implements the methods described above includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 602 , one or more network or other communications interfaces 610 , memory 612 , and one or more communication buses 614 for interconnecting these components.
- the personalized search engine 600 may optionally include a user interface 604 comprising a display device 606 and a keyboard 608 .
- Memory 612 may include high speed random access memory and may also include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices.
- Memory 612 may include mass storage that is remotely located from the CPU's 602 .
- the memory 612 preferably stores:
- the query processor 205 includes a search result ranking function 324 for ordering the documents in a set of search results, and a personalized score generator 622 for generating personalized scores for each document in the search results.
- the personalized score generator 622 includes a personalized anchor text (AT) score generator 310 , as discussed above.
- the personalized score generator 622 also includes a personalized information retrieval (IR) score generator 622 , also discussed above.
- the search engine 600 also includes the network crawler 220 , content indexer 213 , Page Importance Ranker 215 and anchor text indexer 217 , all discussed above.
- the software modules of the search engine include instructions for performing the steps of the methods described above, for processing search queries and producing search results that are ordered in accordance with user-specific parameters.
Abstract
Description
where ati is the ith source document's anchor text weight. In some embodiments, a source document's anchor text weight ati has two possible values, 1 if the anchor text contains at least one query term or 0 if the anchor text contains no query term. In this case, the candidate document's personalized AT score can be computed as
Personalized Ranking=F1(IR score,PS,AT score)
where F1 is the predefined function. As noted above, the page importance score for the candidate document may be either a system (not personalized) page importance score (e.g., the PageRank), or it may be a personalized page importance score. The personalized rankings for a set of candidate documents can be used by a search engine to order search results or for other further analysis.
