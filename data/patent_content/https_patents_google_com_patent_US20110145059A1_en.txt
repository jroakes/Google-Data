- commercially available information such as dvd or cd-based maps used in GPS automobile navigation systems.
- information directories such as telephone directories may be used to define location-based attributes. Any of these techniques may be used alone or in combination with each other to determine the types and names of stores in proximity to the billboard.
- the individual stores' inventory may be checked for products and product categories so that a list of products, products, and or product categories can be defined for each retailer in proximity to each billboard so that these products and/or product categories can be associated with the particular billboard. In various embodiments, this may be done manually, automated, or through a combination of automated and manual processes. In various embodiments store inventories may be checked by examining retailers' web sites or retail aggregators such as the website “froogle.com” where merchants often upload their catalogs of products.
- product descriptions of the retailers' products may be found. For example, if the product lists are found through an automated process, products may only be listed by name or number. Thus, in various embodiments, product descriptions may be determined so that keywords/concepts or other descriptions may be derived for each product. In various embodiments, product names and/or descriptions may be found by searching the Internet using the product id or name. In reply to this type of search, content including retailer defined descriptions as well as search engine extracted description such as key word(s) in context will be returned. In block 520 , based on the information obtained blocks 5105 , 510 and 515 one or more various keywords/attribute are defined for each billboard. In block 525 the keywords/attributes determined for the billboard may be stored in a billboard attribute database. The process terminates in block 530 .
- a flow chart illustrate a method for scheduling advertisement messages for display over the network of electronic billboards based on budget constraints and an association between the advertiser's product and attributes of electronic billboards in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention is depicted. Operation of the method begins in block 600 .
- budget constraints associated with the advertisement message may be determined.
- an advertiser may specify a total monthly budget along with a maximum per impression rate.
- the advertiser may specify one or more specific billboards, or general billboard locations which may then trigger a particular rate. For example, rates may be specific to particular billboards, times of day or combinations of each.
- pricing schemes may be non-linear to the extent purchasers of large amounts of ad space/time may enjoy relatively lower per impression rates than small purchasers.
- Various pricing schemes may allow an advertiser to pay per impressions, that is per showing or output of the ad, pay per impression when the board is able to insure that persons are standing in front or near the billboard using various sensor technology, pay per unit of time, pay for a specific type of interaction such as handing out a coupon or other incentive, pay on redemption of the coupon or pay additionally for redemptions, etc.
- the cost a specific billboard may vary according to several facts such as the demand for that billboard, the location of the billboard, terms specified by the owner of the billboard, the time of day, the particular technology of the billboard, such as the above mentioned sensing technology operable to determine when persons are actually present in front of or near the billboard, etc.
- keywords and/or product categories relating to the advertisement message may be selected through automated processes. For example, in various embodiments, if the advertiser's product is a product for which no keyword or product category is provided or easily obtained, techniques such as co-query history may be used to determine one or more key words or product categories. Using the product's name or description provided by the advertiser, the advertising server may interrogate a database of search engine co-queries to determine if searches for the advertiser's product were also performed with searches for any other products or product categories so that a set of keywords or product category or categories may be associated with the advertisement. As noted above, thesaurus based co-queries may also be used.
- one or more billboards may be selected from a billboard attribute database that have the same attributes as the key word(s) or product categories determined in block 610 or 615 .
- an advertising campaign may be created by the server which may include information such as, location of billboards to output the advertising message, number of times a hour/day/month the message is to be output, date of expiration, etc. Operation terminates in block 625 .
- FIG. 7 a flow chart illustrating a method for outputting advertisement messages on an electronic billboard based on predetermined and dynamic scheduling in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention is depicted. Operation of the method begins in block 700 .
- advertisement messages are downloaded to the individual electronic billboard devices. In various embodiments, this may be done in real time, that is once an advertising campaign is determined. In various other embodiments, advertisement messages may be downloaded, such as, in a batch mode basis, that is once every time period such as once a day, or once every N hours.
- a schedule may also be downloaded to the billboards corresponding to the advertisement messages. In various embodiments, the schedule may specify particular times and numbers of advertisement messages to be displayed per day.
- the schedule may be a list of parameters such as, at least N times per day, or at least N times between opening and closing.
- the schedule may be downloaded in real or near real time or in batch mode.
- the schedule may be downloaded with the advertisement messages themselves as a schedule update to a master schedule. It should be appreciated that the schedule of advertisement messages to be displayed on a particular billboard can be updated at any time, such as, for example, whenever, an advertiser changes its campaign, budget constraints, etc., the schedule may be updated.
- advertisement message may be output based on the schedule.
- the billboard may determine whether there are any gaps in the schedule—that is if, after outputting each message according to the “rules” imposed by the schedule, there is additional unallocated advertising space. If so, operation goes to block 725 . Otherwise, operation goes to block 730 .
- an exception handling process may be invoked to determine how to allocate the unallocated advertising space.
- certain advertisement messages may be given left over space.
- advertiser may specify that they wish to pay for only this left over, unallocated space.
- preferred customers that is, those buying relative more ad space, may be given additional advertisement messages during this unallocated space. Operation stops in block 730 .
- scheduling of advertisement messages on the available billboards may, in various embodiments, also be performed based on an auction model. That is, where advertisers will bid on any number of different combinations of location, time, number of impressions, etc.
- scheduling of advertisement messages on the network of billboards may be performed in a manner analogous to the scheduling of banner ads to display in response to keyword queries on a search engine.
- the choice of billboard may be based on a combination of factors such as relevance of the billboard to the specific advertisement message, how much the advertiser is willing to pay and the amount of available inventory (time) on the board.
- Advertiser may compete with one another for space by specifying that they will pay a certain amount or percent more than other advertisers selling related products.
- advertisers may specify that their advertisement messages are to appear before or after adds for other products, or never within a certain time period of advertisement messages for certain products.

Abstract
Systems and methods for allocating space for advertisements in a network of electronic display devices are provided. Attribute information indicating retailer and categories of products available for purchase in the vicinity of a display device is maintained for each device in a database. Advertisers may upload advertisement messages to a server specifying information such as budget, price per impression, preferred billboards and/or other constraints. One or more keywords or other descriptors are specified for each advertisement message. The system then generates an advertising campaign specifying where the advertisement message is to be output and send the messages to the specified displays. The output may consist of various forms including video, audio, printed incentive, interactive data transfers and/or combinations of these.
Description
- This application is a continuation application of, and claims priority to, pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/155,881, filed on Jun. 20, 2005, entitled “Allocating Advertising Space in a Network of Displays.” The disclosure of the foregoing application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- The present invention relates to allocation of advertising and other documents over a distributed network of electronic output devices based on a geographic location.
- Advances in technology have created new advertising channels to promote products and services. One example of this are kiosk-type billboards typically located in retail outlets, such as shopping malls, airports, hotel lobbies, etc. In their simplest form these devices loop through a series of poster-type advertisements promoting, movies, products and/or retail outlets in proximity to the sign to induce specific customer behavior. Usually these billboards execute a predetermined cycle whereby each advertisement is displayed for predetermined time period before the device automatically cycles to the next advertisement in the loop. Changes in the content of such a billboard are made by physically changing the roll of printed advertisements that provides the loop or modifying the electronic content of the advertisements for electronic billboards. Therefore, management of a system of these kiosk-type billboards is difficult. Furthermore, sale of advertising space and creation of an effective advertising campaign within a given budget in such a system is also complicated due to the distributed nature of the billboards. Other problems with existing billboard technologies also exit.
- Accordingly, at least one exemplary embodiment may provide a method for allocating space for advertisement messages in a network of electronic display devices. The method for allocating advertisement messages in a network of electronic display devices according to this embodiment may comprise defining a set of display attributes associated with a plurality of displays in the network, associating a document with at least one concept, selecting at least one document to output to a display based on the display attributes and the at least one concept associated with the document, and outputting the document to the display.
- In another exemplary embodiment, a system may be provided. The system according to this embodiment may provide a database system that defines a set of display attributes associated with a plurality of displays in a network and associates a document with at least one concept, a document selection module that selects at least one document to output to a display based on the display attributes and the at least one concept associated with the document and a document output module that outputs the selected document for presentation at the display.
- Yet another exemplary embodiment may provide an automated targeted marketing system. The automated targeted marketing system according to this embodiment may comprise a network of geographically distributed electronic billboards, each electronic billboard associated with one or more attributes, a data base of advertisement messages, each advertisement message associated with at least one keyword, a selection means adapted to one or more electronic billboards from which to output an advertisement message based on a correlation between the at least one key word and the one or more attributes and an advertiser specified budget.
- In still an additional embodiment, an automated method for creating and advertising campaign in an ad network of distributed electronic billboards may be provided. The automated method for creating an advertising campaign in an ad network of distributed electronic billboards according to this embodiment may comprise receiving an advertisement message and a budget from an advertiser, associating the advertisement message with at least one product category or keyword, and selecting one or more electronic billboards on which to output the advertisement message based on at least (1) a correlation between the at least one product category or keyword and attributes of the one or more electronic billboards, and (2) the budget.
- These and other embodiments and advantages of the present invention may become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.

block 400. Inblock 405, the advertiser may log into the ad server. As discussed herein, in various embodiments, this can be performed using a web browser interface. Inblock 410, the advertiser may register as an advertiser on the system. In various embodiments, this may comprise specifying information such as categories of goods to be advertised, preferred payment methods, duration of desired participation, etc. Inblock 415, the advertiser may upload an advertisement message to the ad server. In various embodiments the may include uploading multiple files in various different output formats, such as, for example voice, text, coupons, etc. that can be suited to each different output format. Inblock 420, any formatting may be performed. For example, this may comprise changing a format of the message file, formatting the length, compressing, decompression or performing any other format operation on the advertisement message. - In
block 425, the advertisement message may be associated with one or more product categories and/or keywords/concepts. As discussed above, in various embodiments, the advertiser may select one or more keywords from a list of available keywords/concepts. Also, the advertiser may specify his/her own keywords/concepts. In still further embodiments, the server may derive product categories and/or keywords/concepts based on correlations observed in historical search engine queries—persons searching for product A also searched for product B. Inblock 430, the billboard attribute database may be filtered based on the product categories and/or keywords/concepts selected inblock 425 to derive a list of billboards that are intelligently correlated to the particular advertisement. In various embodiments, this may comprise generating a ranked list showing a correlation metric illustrating the relative level of correlation, such as, for example, a relevancy ranking that is returned in response to a search engine query. In various embodiments, co-queries may be performed by using methods such as thesaurus correlations. For example a shoe supplier may specify “sandals” as a keyword may also include other types of shoes such as “flip-flops,” “boots,” etc. - In
block 435 an advertising strategy or campaign may be created by the ad server based on the advertiser's budget, and the ranked list of electronic billboards and existing scheduling obligations to other advertisers. In various embodiments, this schedule, along with the advertisement messages may be transmitted to the electronic billboard. Operation terminates inblock 440. - It should be appreciated that in various embodiments, the advertisement message and schedule may remain at the advertising server and the ads are simply sent to the appropriate billboard according to the schedule so that the billboard serve simply as output devices, outputting advertisements, in real or near real time, in response to messages being received at the billboard devices.

FIG. 5 , a flow chart illustrating a method for defining a set of attributes for an electronic billboard based on the billboard's proximity to retail outlets in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention is illustrated. The method begins inblock 500. Inblock 505, a determination may be made of the types and names of stores in proximity to the billboard. This may comprise manually inspecting the retail or other area in which the billboard may be located to define a list of location-based attributes for the billboard. In addition, Internet search engine containing local retail information, such as, for example, “local.google.com” or “local.yahoo.com” may be used to identify attributes. Also, in various embodiments, commercially available information such as dvd or cd-based maps used in GPS automobile navigation systems. In still further embodiments, information directories such as telephone directories may be used to define location-based attributes. Any of these techniques may be used alone or in combination with each other to determine the types and names of stores in proximity to the billboard. - In
block 510, the individual stores' inventory may be checked for products and product categories so that a list of products, products, and or product categories can be defined for each retailer in proximity to each billboard so that these products and/or product categories can be associated with the particular billboard. In various embodiments, this may be done manually, automated, or through a combination of automated and manual processes. In various embodiments store inventories may be checked by examining retailers' web sites or retail aggregators such as the website “froogle.com” where merchants often upload their catalogs of products. - In
block 515, product descriptions of the retailers' products may be found. For example, if the product lists are found through an automated process, products may only be listed by name or number. Thus, in various embodiments, product descriptions may be determined so that keywords/concepts or other descriptions may be derived for each product. In various embodiments, product names and/or descriptions may be found by searching the Internet using the product id or name. In reply to this type of search, content including retailer defined descriptions as well as search engine extracted description such as key word(s) in context will be returned. Inblock 520, based on the information obtainedblocks block 525 the keywords/attributes determined for the billboard may be stored in a billboard attribute database. The process terminates inblock 530. - Referring now to
FIG. 6 , a flow chart illustrate a method for scheduling advertisement messages for display over the network of electronic billboards based on budget constraints and an association between the advertiser's product and attributes of electronic billboards in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention is depicted. Operation of the method begins inblock 600. Inblock 605 budget constraints associated with the advertisement message may be determined. As discussed herein, in various embodiments, an advertiser may specify a total monthly budget along with a maximum per impression rate. Also, the advertiser may specify one or more specific billboards, or general billboard locations which may then trigger a particular rate. For example, rates may be specific to particular billboards, times of day or combinations of each. Also, pricing schemes may be non-linear to the extent purchasers of large amounts of ad space/time may enjoy relatively lower per impression rates than small purchasers. Various pricing schemes may allow an advertiser to pay per impressions, that is per showing or output of the ad, pay per impression when the board is able to insure that persons are standing in front or near the billboard using various sensor technology, pay per unit of time, pay for a specific type of interaction such as handing out a coupon or other incentive, pay on redemption of the coupon or pay additionally for redemptions, etc. Furthermore, the cost a specific billboard may vary according to several facts such as the demand for that billboard, the location of the billboard, terms specified by the owner of the billboard, the time of day, the particular technology of the billboard, such as the above mentioned sensing technology operable to determine when persons are actually present in front of or near the billboard, etc. - With continued reference to
FIG. 6 , inblock 610, a determination may be made as to whether the advertiser has specified keywords or categories that are to be associated with the advertiser's advertisement message. If the advertiser has not specified any key words or product categories, operation goes to block 615. Otherwise, if inblock 610 it is determined that the advertiser has specified one or more keywords and/or product categories, operation goes to block 620. - In
block 615, keywords and/or product categories relating to the advertisement message may be selected through automated processes. For example, in various embodiments, if the advertiser's product is a product for which no keyword or product category is provided or easily obtained, techniques such as co-query history may be used to determine one or more key words or product categories. Using the product's name or description provided by the advertiser, the advertising server may interrogate a database of search engine co-queries to determine if searches for the advertiser's product were also performed with searches for any other products or product categories so that a set of keywords or product category or categories may be associated with the advertisement. As noted above, thesaurus based co-queries may also be used. - In
block 620, one or more billboards may be selected from a billboard attribute database that have the same attributes as the key word(s) or product categories determined inblock block 625. - Referring now to
FIG. 7 , a flow chart illustrating a method for outputting advertisement messages on an electronic billboard based on predetermined and dynamic scheduling in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention is depicted. Operation of the method begins inblock 700. Inblock 705 advertisement messages are downloaded to the individual electronic billboard devices. In various embodiments, this may be done in real time, that is once an advertising campaign is determined. In various other embodiments, advertisement messages may be downloaded, such as, in a batch mode basis, that is once every time period such as once a day, or once every N hours. Inblock 710, a schedule may also be downloaded to the billboards corresponding to the advertisement messages. In various embodiments, the schedule may specify particular times and numbers of advertisement messages to be displayed per day. In various other embodiments, the schedule may be a list of parameters such as, at least N times per day, or at least N times between opening and closing. As with the advertisement messages, the schedule may be downloaded in real or near real time or in batch mode. Also, the schedule may be downloaded with the advertisement messages themselves as a schedule update to a master schedule. It should be appreciated that the schedule of advertisement messages to be displayed on a particular billboard can be updated at any time, such as, for example, whenever, an advertiser changes its campaign, budget constraints, etc., the schedule may be updated. - Referring now to block 715, advertisement message may be output based on the schedule. In
block 720, the billboard may determine whether there are any gaps in the schedule—that is if, after outputting each message according to the “rules” imposed by the schedule, there is additional unallocated advertising space. If so, operation goes to block 725. Otherwise, operation goes to block 730. - In
block 725, an exception handling process may be invoked to determine how to allocate the unallocated advertising space. In various embodiments, certain advertisement messages may be given left over space. In various other embodiments, advertiser may specify that they wish to pay for only this left over, unallocated space. Also, preferred customers, that is, those buying relative more ad space, may be given additional advertisement messages during this unallocated space. Operation stops inblock 730. - It should also be appreciated that the scheduling of advertisement messages on the available billboards may, in various embodiments, also be performed based on an auction model. That is, where advertisers will bid on any number of different combinations of location, time, number of impressions, etc. In various methods, scheduling of advertisement messages on the network of billboards may be performed in a manner analogous to the scheduling of banner ads to display in response to keyword queries on a search engine. Also, the choice of billboard may be based on a combination of factors such as relevance of the billboard to the specific advertisement message, how much the advertiser is willing to pay and the amount of available inventory (time) on the board. Various embodiments, may seek to maximize revenue generated from advertisers by allocating advertisement messages in a manner that extracts the maximum allowable budget from each advertiser while also maximizing advertiser utility and therefore, perceived and/or actual effectiveness. Advertiser may compete with one another for space by specifying that they will pay a certain amount or percent more than other advertisers selling related products. In addition, advertisers may specify that their advertisement messages are to appear before or after adds for other products, or never within a certain time period of advertisement messages for certain products.
- Exemplary Embodiment
- Referring now to
FIG. 8 , an overhead view of an electronic billboard in an exemplary retail outlet in accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention is illustrated. In the example depicted inFIG. 8 , 3persons 15 have entered theretail area 10. In various embodiments, theelectronic billboard 101 may cycle through the list of available advertisement messages in accordance with the schedule. In various other embodiments, the billboard may remain idle until a sensor detects the presence of persons in proximity to a field of view of the billboard. - Continuing the example, of
FIG. 8 , the billboard may output an advertisement message for a particular brand owner's athletic shoes that is available at one or more of theretail locations 10A-10Z in theretail outlet 10. Because of the correlation between the product promoted and the attributes of theelectronic billboard 101, that is the retailers or categories of retailers in physical proximity to thebillboard 101, a gain in advertising effectiveness, and a corresponding gain in value for advertisers may be achieved. Moreover, by logically allocating advertisement messages to electronic billboards that share attributes with the products being promoted based on their proximity to retailers selling those products, the system may reduce the outputting of advertisement messages to audiences who are unable to purchase the goods being promoted anywhere near where they are viewing the advertisement message. Furthermore, statistics may be maintained for each electronic billboard on which advertisement messages were played when so that advertisers can determine the effective of their ad campaign by examining sales figures during the period of the campaign. - Thus, the various systems and methods for intelligently allocating advertising space in a network of electronic billboards based on a correlation between attributes each billboard and the products being promoted in the advertisement messages, gains in effectiveness for advertisers wishing to promote their products by playing advertisement messages near stores selling their product may be achieved. Also, advertisers may reduce “ineffective” advertisement messages that promote their products in areas in which the actual products can not be purchased. Furthermore, the systems and methods discussed herein provide an advertising channel that is useful to local, regional and nationwide advertisers. That is, region advertisers can specify that their advertisement messages appear only on electronic billboard in a particular retail outlet, city or region.
- It should be understood that the server, processors, and modules described herein may perform their functions (e.g., reading optical information or determining rating information) automatically or via an automated system. As used herein, the term “automatically” refers to an action being performed by any machine-executable process, e.g., a process that does not require human intervention or input.
- The embodiments of the present inventions are not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein. For example, although many of the embodiments disclosed herein have been described with reference to advertisement messages, the principles herein are equally applicable to other documents and content.
