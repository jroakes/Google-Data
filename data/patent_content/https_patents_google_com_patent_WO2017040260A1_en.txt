- the present disclosure relates generally to determining pick-up locations, and more particularly to systems and methods for determining improved pick-up locations based at least in part on one or more travel parameters.
- car rides such as taxi, car, or limousine rides
- ride share or ride hailing platforms can be used to coordinate rides for passengers with private drivers. More particularly, a driver can be provided an
- ride share platforms can receive requests from passengers for a ride between an origin and a destination during a given time period.
- the ride share platform can identify drivers suitable for giving the passenger the ride along the travel route.
- the ride share platform can present offers to the identified drivers to give a ride to the passenger.

- FIG. 10 depicts an example computing system according to example embodiments of the present disclosure.
- Taxis and minicabs can provide a convenient means of transport for users who do not have their own cars, or wish to make a one-off journey without having to worry about parking their vehicle at their destination.
- software applications have emerged whereby a person can use their mobile or personal communication device to issue a request for a taxi to collect them and convey them to their destination.
- the user's request includes an indication of their current location, or the point from which they wish to be picked up (if different from their current location).
- the request is sent to a central server, and from there allocated to one of several drivers.
- the choice of driver may be determined based on whichever one of the drivers is closest to the user's desired pick-up point, for example.
- the selected driver determines a route to travel to the user's location and proceeds with the pick-up.
- a problem that arises with the above scenario is that in determining the route by which the driver is to reach the user, a number of factors may need to be taken into account, including the geography of the streets (for example, whether there are one-way systems in place), the amount of traffic expected to be present along different routes, toll charges that may be present along certain roads, as well as the presence of road construction. These factors mean that the selected route, while still being the fastest route to the user's current, is somewhat circuitous. Thus, the user may experience delays in being picked up.
- An additional problem that arises is that the initial pick-up location specified by the user may be inefficient with regard to initiating the trip, or may lead to an inefficient route selection to the destination location.
- the amount of traffic proximate the pick-up location, the nature of the geography of the streets, the presence of road construction proximate the pickup location, etc. can cause a trip from the pick-up location to the destination to take longer, cost more, etc. compared to a trip from a nearby pick-up location to the destination.
- example embodiments of the present disclosure use the initial pick-up location, and various travel parameters including the route of the driver to determine one or more alternative candidate pick-up points, which may be more optimal for the user, the driver or both. For example, it might be determined that the user can significantly reduce the distance that the driver has to travel if they simply walk down to the end of the street that they are standing on. In addition, it might be determined that the distance or time of the trip to the destination may be reduced if the user simply walks to the end of the street, or other candidate pick-up location.
- the utility of the subject matter of the present disclosure resides in identifying that a more optimal pick-up location can be calculated to benefit the user, the driver, or both based at least in part on the destination location.
- a more optimal pick-up point can be determined.
- the user issues the initial request for a taxi they can have no idea of the optimal pick-up point, since they may not have knowledge of the various timings, prices, or efficiencies of the travel routes to the destination from various nearby locations.
- the user has no knowledge of which taxi will be allocated to them and the route that taxi will be taking.
- the taxi meanwhile, has no input into the initial selection of the pick-up point, since this is made as part of the user's request, before the taxi has even been allocated to that ride.
- the candidate location(s) may, for example, be chosen to reduce the distance the taxi has to travel to reach the user, the distance the driver has to travel to reach the destination once the pick-up has been made, the cost of the trip to the destination, and/or other suitable parameters. This may not only result in fuel savings for the driver, but may reduce the time that the user spends waiting for the taxi.
- the candidate locations may also be chosen to reduce the overall distance that the user needs to travel to reach their destination, the cost of the trip to the destination, and/or to accommodate a user's desire to avoid passing through a particular neighborhood that may be unsafe.
- example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing one or more candidate pick-up locations to a user.
- one or more candidate pickup locations can be determined proximate a current location of the user.
- the one or more candidate pick-up locations can be ranked based at least in part on one or more travel parameters, and provided for display to the user in a user interface presented on a display of a display device.
- the user can select a candidate pick-up location, and the selected pick-up location can be provided to a car service or ride share platform to facilitate a pick-up.
- a user may order a car ride from a car service (e.g. taxi service, limousine service, or other suitable car service) or ride share platform or service via a user device (e.g. smartphone, tablet, laptop, wearable computing device, or any other suitable computing device capable of being carried by a user while in operation).
- a user device e.g. smartphone, tablet, laptop, wearable computing device, or any other suitable computing device capable of being carried by a user while in operation.
- Conventional car service ordering techniques allow a user to provide a starting location and a destination location to the car service.
- the starting location can be a location corresponding to a current location of a user and can be determined using GPS, IP address, cell tri angulation, proximity to Wi-Fi access points, proximity to beacon devices, or other suitable techniques.
- such starting location can be in the form of raw location data such as latitude, longitude coordinates or other raw location data.
- Raw location data such as latitude, longitude coordinates may cause ambiguity as to the exact starting location. For instance, a driver of a car service who receives a starting location in the form of latitude, longitude coordinates may not have enough information to efficiently and quickly locate the user. Such a driver may initially stop at the wrong corner of an intersection. As another example, if a user is located indoors when the user specifies a starting location, the starting location may not be a feasible pick-up location.
- the specified starting location may not be the most efficient location for pick-up. For instance, a slight shift in pick-up location may lead to a shorter and/or cheaper ride.
- traffic patterns, street flow patterns (e.g. one way streets, no U- turn, etc.), or other factors may cause varying efficiencies of proximate pick-up locations. In this manner, moving to the opposite side of the road, moving to a proximate intersection, etc. may orient the beginning of a car ride such that the car initially travels in the proper direction.
- techniques are provided for providing one or more candidate pick-up locations to a user based at least in part on one or more travel parameters. More particularly, a plurality of locations proximate a current location of a user can be analyzed in view of a destination specified by the user and/or in view of one or more travel parameters to determine one or more candidate pick-up locations and to provide the one or more candidate pick-up locations to the user.
- the one or more travel parameters can include a level of traffic proximate the one or more candidate pick-up locations, an amount of expected time to travel between each candidate pick-up location and the destination, an expected cost to travel between each candidate pick-up location and the specified destination, proximity of the candidate pick-up locations to the current location of the first user, a safety factor associated with the candidate pick-up locations and/or other suitable travel parameters.
- the one or more travel parameters can further include one or more user selected preferences.
- At least one candidate pick-up location can be provided for display by the user device.
- Each displayed candidate pick-up location can further include one or more annotations associated with the candidate pick-up location.
- the annotations may include information relating to one or more aspects or contexts of the location of the candidate pickup location. For instance, the annotations may include an address of the candidate pick-up location.
- the annotations may further include a position of the candidate pick-up location relative to a landmark. For instance, the annotations may specify a position relative to a business, building, or other landmark proximate the candidate pick-up location.
- the annotations may further include information relating to a distance and/or time of travel between the current location of the user and the candidate pick-up location.
- the annotations may further include information associated with an expected time and/or cost of travel between the candidate pick-up location and the specified destination.
- the annotations may provide a comparison of the expected time and/or cost of travel of two or more candidate pick-up locations. In this manner, the annotations may provide a better description to the user of the actual location of the candidate pick-up location and/or the expected cost of each candidate pick-up location.
- the user may select a candidate pick-up location from the list of displayed candidate pick-up locations. Responsive to selecting a pick-up location, the selected pick-up location and/or the specified destination location can be provided to a car service or ride share platform. For instance, the selected pick-up location and the specified destination location can be provided to a user device of one or more employees or drivers associated with the car service or ride share platform, such that one of the one or more employees or drivers may pick the user up in his vehicle.
- the one or more annotations associated with the selected pick-up location can also be provided to the one or more employees or drivers. Such provided annotations can provide to the one or more employees or drivers a better understanding of the location of the user and thereby can reduce the need for additional communication between the user and the one or more employees or drivers to facilitate a pick-up.
- feedback data associated with the quality of the pick-up location can be obtained.
- the feedback data may be direct feedback data obtained directly from a user responsive to a survey (or other questionnaire) presented to the user.
- feedback data can be indirect feedback data obtained passively using location data associated with the user for an approximate time period during which the user was in the car.
- the feedback data can be used to assess the quality of the selected pick-up location.
- the feedback data can indicate whether the actual pick-up location corresponded to the selected pick-up location, whether the actual cost and/or travel time corresponded to the expected cost and/or travel time, etc.
- the feedback data can then be used in determining future candidate pick-up locations proximate the selected and/or actual pick-up location. For instance, the feedback data can be added to the travel parameters associated with the selected and/or actual pick-up location. For instance, the feedback data can be used to determine future candidate pick-up locations responsive to an order from the same user or from one or more other users.
- a user in order to obtain the benefits of the techniques described herein, a user may be required to allow the collection and analysis of location information associated with a user or device. For example, in some embodiments, users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect such information. If the user does not allow collection and use of such signals, then the user may not receive the benefits of the techniques described herein (e.g. may not be provided information associated with a candidate pick-up location). The user can also be provided with tools to revoke or modify consent. In addition, certain information or data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- embodiments of the disclosed technology can be configured to enhance user privacy by removing identifiers for mobile devices or users.
- device and/or user identifiers can be replaced with a lossy device indicator which might conflate a large number of devices or users into a single identifier.

- the current location 102 can be a current geographic location of the user (e.g. determined by a positioning systems associated with a user device of the user) and/or an initial pick-up location specified by the user.
- Candidate pick-up locations 104-108 can be determined, for instance, responsive to a user input on a user device (e.g. user device 404) indicative of a request for a car, taxi, limousine, etc. ride from a car service or ride share platform.
- a user device e.g. user device 404
- Candidate pick-up locations 104-108 can be determined according to example aspects of the present disclosure.
- candidate pick-up locations 104-108 can be determined by ranking a plurality of locations proximate current location 102 based at least in part on one or more travel parameters and/or route data associated with a driver assigned to the user for providing a ride to the user. For instance, candidate pick-up locations 104-108 can be determined to reduce an expected amount of time required for a driver to travel to the user, an amount of time and/or money associated with a car ride from candidate pick-up locations 104-108 to a specified destination relative to an amount of time and/or money associated with a car ride from current location 102 to the specified destination.
- Candidate pick-up locations 104-108 can further include one or more annotations 110, 112, 114 displayed in association with candidate pick-up locations 104-108.
- Annotations 110-114 can provide information relating to a candidate pick-up location, information relating to a car ride from a candidate pick-up location to the specified destination and/or other information.
- annotations 110 and 112 include information relating to a position of candidate pick-up locations 104 and 106 respectively relative to a landmark.
- annotation 110 indicates that candidate pick-up location 104 is located "in front of Starbucks.”
- annotation 112 indicates that candidate pick-up location 106 is located "in front of Lacoste.”
- annotation 114 indicates that a car ride from candidate pick-up location 108 to the specified destination has a less expensive (e.g. "$5 cheaper”) expected fare than a car ride from current location 102 to the specified destination.
- a candidate pick-up location may have an additional annotation providing information relating to a relative cost between the candidate pick-up location and a different candidate pick-up location.
- a candidate pick-up location may have an associated annotation providing an indication of the safety of the area proximate the candidate pick-up location.

- the one or more travel parameters can further include one or more user selected preferences. In this manner, the plurality of locations can be ranked or otherwise filtered based at least in part on the user selected preferences. For instance, the user selected preferences may provide that safety of the area proximate the pick-up location is to be given additional preference. As another example, the user selected preferences may indicate that the cost of the trip is the most important factor, or that the travel time is the most important factor.
- the plurality of locations can be ranked or otherwise scored using any suitable ranking technique.
- the ranking can be performed using a scoring system specifying a score on a scale of one to one-hundred, or other suitable scale.

- Additional example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to determining pick-up locations for use in a ride share platform based at least in part on a driver assigned to provide the ride to the use. For instance, data indicative of a first pick-up location selected by a user can be received. The first pick-up location can be associated with a request by the user for a ride using the ride share platform. A driver for providing the ride to the user can be assigned to the user, such that the driver can be tasked with picking up the user and delivering the user to a destination. Location data associated with a travel route of the driver can be received. One or more candidate pick-up locations can be determined based at least in part on the first pick-up location and the location data associated with the route of the user.
- the user can interact with a user device to request a ride from a ride share platform.
- the user can provide an input to the user device indicative of a first pick-up location.
- the first pick-up location can be a current location of the user as determined by the user device, or the first pick-up location can be a location proximate the current location as selected by the user.
- the user can further provide an input to the user device indicative of a destination location to which the user desires to travel.
- the first pick-up location and/or the destination location can be used to assign a driver for providing a ride to the user.
- the ride share platform can identify a plurality of candidate drivers that may be available for providing the ride to the user.
- the candidate drivers can include drivers of private vehicles or autonomous vehicles.
- a driver from the plurality of candidate drivers can be assigned to the driver based at least in part on a current location of the driver and/or the first pick-up location selected by the user.
- the driver can begin traveling to the first pick-up location to pick the user up at the first pick-up location.
- data associated with the route of the driver can be used to determine one or more candidate pick-up locations.
- the data associated with the route of the driver can include data associated with a route already traveled by the driver and/or a route expected to be traveled by the driver. For instance, a predicted route associated with the driver based at least in part on a current location of the driver and the first pick-up location.
- the driver may select a route through interaction with a user device associated with the user, and the user device can provide data indicative of the selected route to the ride share platform.
- a route to the first pick-up location can be predicted by interpolating a travel route between a portion of the route already traveled by the driver and the first pick-up location. In this manner, the remainder of the route to the first pick-up location can be predicted based at least in part on the portion of the route previously traveled.
- the predicted route can be determined based at least in part on historical location data or other data (e.g. travel direction search history) associated with drivers. For instance, historical data associated with a driver can be analyzed to determine a predicted travel path for the driver. More particularly, historical data can indicate that a driver typically travels along a particular travel route. Such historical data can be used in predicting one or more future travel routes to be taken by the driver.
- one or more candidate pick-up locations can be determined based at least in part on the first pick-up location and the route data associated with the driver.
- the one or more candidate pick-up locations can be different locations than the first pick-up location.
- the candidate pick-up locations can be determined to provide one or more alternative pick-up locations that may be more beneficial to the user and/or driver than the first pick-up location.
- the candidate pick-up locations can be determined using a candidate pick-up location selection algorithm used to rank and/or score a plurality of locations proximate the first pick-up location and/or the current location of the user in accordance with one or more travel parameters. For instance, in some implementations, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined by identifying a plurality of locations proximate the first pick-up location.

Description
DETERMINING IMPROVED PICK-UP LOCATIONS
FIELD
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to determining pick-up locations, and more particularly to systems and methods for determining improved pick-up locations based at least in part on one or more travel parameters.
BACKGROUND
[0002] With the increased popularity of mobile computing devices, car rides, such as taxi, car, or limousine rides, are increasingly being reserved or otherwise ordered via mobile platforms. For instance, ride share or ride hailing platforms can be used to coordinate rides for passengers with private drivers. More particularly, a driver can be provided an
opportunity to give a passenger a ride in exchange for some form of compensation or incentive. For instance, ride share platforms can receive requests from passengers for a ride between an origin and a destination during a given time period. The ride share platform can identify drivers suitable for giving the passenger the ride along the travel route. The ride share platform can present offers to the identified drivers to give a ride to the passenger. The offers can include compensation for giving the passenger a ride. The compensation can be determined based on various factors, such as distance of detour by the driver to give the passenger a ride, auction bidding, or based on supply and demand. When a driver accepts an offer, the passenger can be alerted that a ride has been arranged for the passenger. The ride share platform can navigate the driver to the passenger location and along the travel route requested by the passenger.
[0003] For instance, a user may order a car ride from a ride share platform or other car service by providing a starting location and a destination location to the ride share platform or other car service via a mobile application, and upon receiving the order, the ride share platform or car service may send a vehicle to the starting location. Conventional car ordering techniques may allow a user to specify a current location as the starting location. For instance, the current location can be determined by the mobile computing device without the user having to expressly specify a starting point. For example, the current location can be a location determined based on GPS, IP address, cell tri angulation, proximity to Wi-Fi access points, proximity to beacon devices, or other techniques. The determined location can correspond to raw location data. For example, the current location can be a geocode that identifies a latitude and longitude.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0020] Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the embodiments, not limitation of the present disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to
yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that aspects of the present disclosure cover such modifications and variations.
[0021] Taxis and minicabs can provide a convenient means of transport for users who do not have their own cars, or wish to make a one-off journey without having to worry about parking their vehicle at their destination. In recent years, software applications have emerged whereby a person can use their mobile or personal communication device to issue a request for a taxi to collect them and convey them to their destination. In this scenario, the user's request includes an indication of their current location, or the point from which they wish to be picked up (if different from their current location). The request is sent to a central server, and from there allocated to one of several drivers. The choice of driver may be determined based on whichever one of the drivers is closest to the user's desired pick-up point, for example. The selected driver determines a route to travel to the user's location and proceeds with the pick-up.
[0022] A problem that arises with the above scenario is that in determining the route by which the driver is to reach the user, a number of factors may need to be taken into account, including the geography of the streets (for example, whether there are one-way systems in place), the amount of traffic expected to be present along different routes, toll charges that may be present along certain roads, as well as the presence of road construction. These factors mean that the selected route, while still being the fastest route to the user's current, is somewhat circuitous. Thus, the user may experience delays in being picked up. An additional problem that arises is that the initial pick-up location specified by the user may be inefficient with regard to initiating the trip, or may lead to an inefficient route selection to the destination location. For instance, the amount of traffic proximate the pick-up location, the nature of the geography of the streets, the presence of road construction proximate the pickup location, etc. can cause a trip from the pick-up location to the destination to take longer, cost more, etc. compared to a trip from a nearby pick-up location to the destination.
[0023] To solve these problems, example embodiments of the present disclosure use the initial pick-up location, and various travel parameters including the route of the driver to determine one or more alternative candidate pick-up points, which may be more optimal for the user, the driver or both. For example, it might be determined that the user can significantly reduce the distance that the driver has to travel if they simply walk down to the end of the street that they are standing on. In addition, it might be determined that the
distance or time of the trip to the destination may be reduced if the user simply walks to the end of the street, or other candidate pick-up location.
[0024] The utility of the subject matter of the present disclosure resides in identifying that a more optimal pick-up location can be calculated to benefit the user, the driver, or both based at least in part on the destination location. In addition, once the user has been assigned a taxi and/or driver, and the taxi's route has been calculated, that a more optimal pick-up point can be determined. At the time the user issues the initial request for a taxi, they can have no idea of the optimal pick-up point, since they may not have knowledge of the various timings, prices, or efficiencies of the travel routes to the destination from various nearby locations. In addition, the user has no knowledge of which taxi will be allocated to them and the route that taxi will be taking. The taxi, meanwhile, has no input into the initial selection of the pick-up point, since this is made as part of the user's request, before the taxi has even been allocated to that ride. However, once both the user and taxi have been assigned to one another and a route established between them, it is possible to identify one or more optimal pick-up locations. The candidate location(s) may, for example, be chosen to reduce the distance the taxi has to travel to reach the user, the distance the driver has to travel to reach the destination once the pick-up has been made, the cost of the trip to the destination, and/or other suitable parameters. This may not only result in fuel savings for the driver, but may reduce the time that the user spends waiting for the taxi. The candidate locations may also be chosen to reduce the overall distance that the user needs to travel to reach their destination, the cost of the trip to the destination, and/or to accommodate a user's desire to avoid passing through a particular neighborhood that may be unsafe.
[0025] In this manner, example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing one or more candidate pick-up locations to a user. For instance, one or more candidate pickup locations can be determined proximate a current location of the user. The one or more candidate pick-up locations can be ranked based at least in part on one or more travel parameters, and provided for display to the user in a user interface presented on a display of a display device. The user can select a candidate pick-up location, and the selected pick-up location can be provided to a car service or ride share platform to facilitate a pick-up.
[0026] For instance, a user may order a car ride from a car service (e.g. taxi service, limousine service, or other suitable car service) or ride share platform or service via a user device (e.g. smartphone, tablet, laptop, wearable computing device, or any other suitable computing device capable of being carried by a user while in operation). Conventional car
service ordering techniques allow a user to provide a starting location and a destination location to the car service. The starting location can be a location corresponding to a current location of a user and can be determined using GPS, IP address, cell tri angulation, proximity to Wi-Fi access points, proximity to beacon devices, or other suitable techniques. As indicated above, such starting location can be in the form of raw location data such as latitude, longitude coordinates or other raw location data. Raw location data, such as latitude, longitude coordinates may cause ambiguity as to the exact starting location. For instance, a driver of a car service who receives a starting location in the form of latitude, longitude coordinates may not have enough information to efficiently and quickly locate the user. Such a driver may initially stop at the wrong corner of an intersection. As another example, if a user is located indoors when the user specifies a starting location, the starting location may not be a feasible pick-up location.
[0027] In addition, the specified starting location may not be the most efficient location for pick-up. For instance, a slight shift in pick-up location may lead to a shorter and/or cheaper ride. In particular, traffic patterns, street flow patterns (e.g. one way streets, no U- turn, etc.), or other factors may cause varying efficiencies of proximate pick-up locations. In this manner, moving to the opposite side of the road, moving to a proximate intersection, etc. may orient the beginning of a car ride such that the car initially travels in the proper direction.
[0028] According to example aspects of the present disclosure, techniques are provided for providing one or more candidate pick-up locations to a user based at least in part on one or more travel parameters. More particularly, a plurality of locations proximate a current location of a user can be analyzed in view of a destination specified by the user and/or in view of one or more travel parameters to determine one or more candidate pick-up locations and to provide the one or more candidate pick-up locations to the user. The one or more travel parameters can include a level of traffic proximate the one or more candidate pick-up locations, an amount of expected time to travel between each candidate pick-up location and the destination, an expected cost to travel between each candidate pick-up location and the specified destination, proximity of the candidate pick-up locations to the current location of the first user, a safety factor associated with the candidate pick-up locations and/or other suitable travel parameters. In example embodiments, the one or more travel parameters can further include one or more user selected preferences.
[0029] At least one candidate pick-up location can be provided for display by the user device. Each displayed candidate pick-up location can further include one or more
annotations associated with the candidate pick-up location. The annotations may include information relating to one or more aspects or contexts of the location of the candidate pickup location. For instance, the annotations may include an address of the candidate pick-up location. The annotations may further include a position of the candidate pick-up location relative to a landmark. For instance, the annotations may specify a position relative to a business, building, or other landmark proximate the candidate pick-up location. The annotations may further include information relating to a distance and/or time of travel between the current location of the user and the candidate pick-up location.
[0030] The annotations may further include information associated with an expected time and/or cost of travel between the candidate pick-up location and the specified destination. In example embodiments, the annotations may provide a comparison of the expected time and/or cost of travel of two or more candidate pick-up locations. In this manner, the annotations may provide a better description to the user of the actual location of the candidate pick-up location and/or the expected cost of each candidate pick-up location.
[0031] The user may select a candidate pick-up location from the list of displayed candidate pick-up locations. Responsive to selecting a pick-up location, the selected pick-up location and/or the specified destination location can be provided to a car service or ride share platform. For instance, the selected pick-up location and the specified destination location can be provided to a user device of one or more employees or drivers associated with the car service or ride share platform, such that one of the one or more employees or drivers may pick the user up in his vehicle. In this regard, the one or more annotations associated with the selected pick-up location can also be provided to the one or more employees or drivers. Such provided annotations can provide to the one or more employees or drivers a better understanding of the location of the user and thereby can reduce the need for additional communication between the user and the one or more employees or drivers to facilitate a pick-up.
[0032] In example embodiments, once the pick-up is complete, feedback data associated with the quality of the pick-up location can be obtained. For instance, the feedback data may be direct feedback data obtained directly from a user responsive to a survey (or other questionnaire) presented to the user. As another example, upon obtaining consent from the user, feedback data can be indirect feedback data obtained passively using location data associated with the user for an approximate time period during which the user was in the car. In this manner, the feedback data can be used to assess the quality of the selected pick-up
location. For instance, the feedback data can indicate whether the actual pick-up location corresponded to the selected pick-up location, whether the actual cost and/or travel time corresponded to the expected cost and/or travel time, etc.
[0033] The feedback data can then be used in determining future candidate pick-up locations proximate the selected and/or actual pick-up location. For instance, the feedback data can be added to the travel parameters associated with the selected and/or actual pick-up location. For instance, the feedback data can be used to determine future candidate pick-up locations responsive to an order from the same user or from one or more other users.
[0034] As indicated above, in some embodiments, in order to obtain the benefits of the techniques described herein, a user may be required to allow the collection and analysis of location information associated with a user or device. For example, in some embodiments, users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect such information. If the user does not allow collection and use of such signals, then the user may not receive the benefits of the techniques described herein (e.g. may not be provided information associated with a candidate pick-up location). The user can also be provided with tools to revoke or modify consent. In addition, certain information or data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, embodiments of the disclosed technology can be configured to enhance user privacy by removing identifiers for mobile devices or users. In some instances, device and/or user identifiers can be replaced with a lossy device indicator which might conflate a large number of devices or users into a single identifier.
[0035] With reference now to the FIGS., example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in further detail. FIG. 1 depicts an example mapping interface 100 suggesting a plurality of candidate pick-up locations according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. The mapping interface 100 can be displayed, for instance, by user device 404 depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5. In particular, mapping interface 100 depicts a current location 102 associated with a user and candidate pick-up locations 104, 106, and 108 proximate current location 102. The current location 102 can be a current geographic location of the user (e.g. determined by a positioning systems associated with a user device of the user) and/or an initial pick-up location specified by the user. Candidate pick-up locations 104-108 can be determined, for instance, responsive to a user input on a user device (e.g. user device 404) indicative of a request for a car, taxi, limousine, etc. ride from a car service or
ride share platform. Candidate pick-up locations 104-108 can be determined according to example aspects of the present disclosure.
[0036] In example embodiments, candidate pick-up locations 104-108 can be determined by ranking a plurality of locations proximate current location 102 based at least in part on one or more travel parameters and/or route data associated with a driver assigned to the user for providing a ride to the user. For instance, candidate pick-up locations 104-108 can be determined to reduce an expected amount of time required for a driver to travel to the user, an amount of time and/or money associated with a car ride from candidate pick-up locations 104-108 to a specified destination relative to an amount of time and/or money associated with a car ride from current location 102 to the specified destination.
[0037] Candidate pick-up locations 104-108 can further include one or more annotations 110, 112, 114 displayed in association with candidate pick-up locations 104-108.
Annotations 110-114 can provide information relating to a candidate pick-up location, information relating to a car ride from a candidate pick-up location to the specified destination and/or other information. For instance, annotations 110 and 112 include information relating to a position of candidate pick-up locations 104 and 106 respectively relative to a landmark. As depicted, annotation 110 indicates that candidate pick-up location 104 is located "in front of Starbucks." As another example, annotation 112 indicates that candidate pick-up location 106 is located "in front of Lacoste." As yet another example, annotation 114 indicates that a car ride from candidate pick-up location 108 to the specified destination has a less expensive (e.g. "$5 cheaper") expected fare than a car ride from current location 102 to the specified destination. It will be appreciated that further annotations may be displayed including further information. For instance a candidate pick-up location may have an additional annotation providing information relating to a relative cost between the candidate pick-up location and a different candidate pick-up location. As another example, a candidate pick-up location may have an associated annotation providing an indication of the safety of the area proximate the candidate pick-up location.
[0038] FIG. 2 depicts a flow diagram of an example method (200) of providing one or more candidate pick-up locations to a user according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Method (200) can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in FIG. 10. In particular implementations, the method (200) can be implemented by the routing engine 412 and/or the pick-up determiner 414 depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5. In addition, FIG. 2 depicts steps performed in a particular
order for purposes of illustration and discussion. Those of ordinary skill in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will understand that the steps of any of the methods discussed herein can be adapted, rearranged, expanded, omitted, or modified in various ways without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure.
[0039] At (202), method (200) can include receiving location data associated with a user. In example embodiments, the location data can be associated with a current location of the user. In example embodiments, the location data may be provided by the user or may be determined using GPS, IP address, cell triangulation, proximity to Wi-Fi access points, proximity to beacon devices, or other suitable location determination techniques. In alternative embodiments, the location data may include data associated with a destination location specified by the user. For instance, a user may input a destination location indicative of an intended destination associated with the user.
[0040] At (204), method (200) may include determining one or more candidate pick-up locations proximate the current location of the user. In example embodiments, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined based at least in part on one or more travel parameters associated with the user.
[0041] For instance, FIG. 3 depicts a flow diagram of an example method (300) of determining one or more candidate pick-up locations according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Method (300) can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in FIG. 10. In particular
implementations, the method (300) can be implemented by the routing engine 412 and/or the pick-up determiner 414 depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5.
[0042] At (302), method (300) can include identifying a plurality of locations proximate the current location of the user. For instance, the plurality of locations can include any location within a threshold distance of the user that can be accessed by a user, such as for instance, a location on a sidewalk, a location in a parking lot, a location on the side of the road, etc. In alternative embodiments, the plurality of locations can include any location within a threshold distance of the user regardless of accessibility to the user.
[0043] At (304), method (300) can include ranking the plurality of locations based at least in part on one or more travel parameters. The ranking can be performed by a user device, or by a remote computing device in communication with a user device such as a server device. In example embodiments, the locations can be ranked based at least in part on the one or more travel parameters in view of the destination specified by the user. For instance, the one
or more travel parameters may include a level of traffic proximate the one or more candidate pick-up locations, an amount of expected time to travel between each candidate pick-up location and the destination, an expected cost to travel between each candidate pick-up location and the destination, proximity of the candidate pick-up locations to the current location of the first user, a safety factor associated with the candidate pick-up locations and/or other suitable travel parameters. In further embodiments, the one or more travel parameters can further include one or more user selected preferences. In this manner, the plurality of locations can be ranked or otherwise filtered based at least in part on the user selected preferences. For instance, the user selected preferences may provide that safety of the area proximate the pick-up location is to be given additional preference. As another example, the user selected preferences may indicate that the cost of the trip is the most important factor, or that the travel time is the most important factor.
[0044] It will be appreciated that the plurality of locations can be ranked or otherwise scored using any suitable ranking technique. For instance, the ranking can be performed using a scoring system specifying a score on a scale of one to one-hundred, or other suitable scale. As another example, the ranking can be performed by ordering the locations by expected travel time to the destination and/or expected cost of travel to the destination.
[0045] At (306), method (300) can include selecting at least one location from the ranked plurality of locations as a candidate pick-up location. For instance, selecting the at least one location as a candidate pick-up location may include selecting the top three (or other suitable number) highly ranked locations. As another example selecting the at least one location as a candidate pick-up location may include selecting each location having a ranking or score greater than a threshold. It will be appreciated that other suitable techniques can be used to select candidate pick-up locations without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure.
[0046] At (308), method (300) can include providing the at least one candidate pick-up location for display on a user interface presented by a user device. For instance, the at least one candidate pick-up location may be displayed in a mapping application or other geographic information system, such that the annotations overlay a corresponding location represented in the mapping application or geographic information system. As another example, the at least one candidate pick-up location can be displayed in a list format. As indicated above, in example embodiments, one or more annotations may be provided for display in association with the at least one candidate pick-up location.
[0047] Referring back to FIG. 2, at (206), method (200) can include receiving a pick-up selection from the user. For instance, the user may provide an input indicative of a selected pick-up location by selecting a candidate pick-up location from the at least one candidate pick-up location. At (208), method (200) can include providing data indicative of the pick-up location selection to a remote computing device. For instance, the data indicative of the pickup location selection can be provided to a user device of one or more employees or drivers associated with a car service or ride share platform. In this manner, an employee or driver who receives the data indicative of the pick-up location selection can locate the user for pickup. In example embodiments, the data indicative of the pick-up location selection can include location data corresponding to the pick-up location and/or the one or more annotations associated with the pick-up location. In further embodiments, the driver may further receive data indicative of the specified destination location.
[0048] At (208), method (200) may include receiving feedback data associated with the pick-up location selection. For instance, the feedback data may include data provided by the user, or upon obtaining user consent, may include data associated with the user's changing location associated with the ordered car ride. In this manner, the feedback data can be used to assess or otherwise determine the quality of the pick-up location. For instance, the feedback data may be used to compare an actual pick-up location relative to the pick-up location selection. As another example, the feedback data may be used to compare an expected travel cost and/or travel time with an actual travel cost and/or travel time.
[0049] In example embodiments, the feedback data may be used in subsequent candidate pick-up location determinations for the user or for a different user. For instance, the feedback data can be used in subsequent rankings of locations proximate a current location of a user to select an at least one candidate pick-up location.
[0050] Additional example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to determining pick-up locations for use in a ride share platform based at least in part on a driver assigned to provide the ride to the use. For instance, data indicative of a first pick-up location selected by a user can be received. The first pick-up location can be associated with a request by the user for a ride using the ride share platform. A driver for providing the ride to the user can be assigned to the user, such that the driver can be tasked with picking up the user and delivering the user to a destination. Location data associated with a travel route of the driver can be received. One or more candidate pick-up locations can be determined based at least in part on the first pick-up location and the location data associated with the route of the user.
[0051] More particularly, the user can interact with a user device to request a ride from a ride share platform. The user can provide an input to the user device indicative of a first pick-up location. For instance, the first pick-up location can be a current location of the user as determined by the user device, or the first pick-up location can be a location proximate the current location as selected by the user. In some implementations, the user can further provide an input to the user device indicative of a destination location to which the user desires to travel. The first pick-up location and/or the destination location can be used to assign a driver for providing a ride to the user. For instance, the ride share platform can identify a plurality of candidate drivers that may be available for providing the ride to the user. The candidate drivers can include drivers of private vehicles or autonomous vehicles. A driver from the plurality of candidate drivers can be assigned to the driver based at least in part on a current location of the driver and/or the first pick-up location selected by the user.
[0052] Subsequent to the assignment of the driver, the driver can begin traveling to the first pick-up location to pick the user up at the first pick-up location. As the driver travels, data associated with the route of the driver can be used to determine one or more candidate pick-up locations. The data associated with the route of the driver can include data associated with a route already traveled by the driver and/or a route expected to be traveled by the driver. For instance, a predicted route associated with the driver based at least in part on a current location of the driver and the first pick-up location. In some implementations, the driver may select a route through interaction with a user device associated with the user, and the user device can provide data indicative of the selected route to the ride share platform. In some implementations, a route to the first pick-up location can be predicted by interpolating a travel route between a portion of the route already traveled by the driver and the first pick-up location. In this manner, the remainder of the route to the first pick-up location can be predicted based at least in part on the portion of the route previously traveled. In some implementations, the predicted route can be determined based at least in part on historical location data or other data (e.g. travel direction search history) associated with drivers. For instance, historical data associated with a driver can be analyzed to determine a predicted travel path for the driver. More particularly, historical data can indicate that a driver typically travels along a particular travel route. Such historical data can be used in predicting one or more future travel routes to be taken by the driver.
[0053] As indicated, one or more candidate pick-up locations can be determined based at least in part on the first pick-up location and the route data associated with the driver. The
one or more candidate pick-up locations can be different locations than the first pick-up location. In this manner, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined to provide one or more alternative pick-up locations that may be more beneficial to the user and/or driver than the first pick-up location.
[0054] The candidate pick-up locations can be determined using a candidate pick-up location selection algorithm used to rank and/or score a plurality of locations proximate the first pick-up location and/or the current location of the user in accordance with one or more travel parameters. For instance, in some implementations, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined by identifying a plurality of locations proximate the first pick-up location. The plurality of locations can be located within a threshold distance or radius of the first pickup location. In some implementations, the plurality of locations can be identified proximate a current location of the user.
[0055] The candidate pick-up locations can then be selected based at least in part on one or more travel parameters determined for the plurality of identified locations. In some implementations, the identified locations can be ranked and/or scored based at least in part on the one or more travel parameters. For instance, the one or more travel parameters can include pick-up time (e.g. an expected amount of time required for the driver to travel to the location determined based at least in part on the route data associated with the driver), travel time (e.g. an expected amount of time required for the driver to travel from the location to the destination location) cost of travel (e.g. an expected monetary cost to travel from the location to the destination location), and/or other suitable travel parameters. In this manner, the one or more travel parameters can be determined for each identified location and used in the ranking and/or scoring of the locations. In some implementations, the ranking and/or scoring can be determined based at least in part on a combination of two or more travel parameters (e.g. two or more of pick-up time, travel time, cost of travel, etc.). In some implementations, a ranking of the identified locations can be determined based at least in part on the scores determined for the identified locations. In some implementations, the user may select at least one travel parameter (e.g. through interaction with the user device) for use in ranking and/or scoring the identified locations. For instance, if the user desires to minimize the cost of travel to the destination location, the user can select the 'cost of travel' travel parameter to facilitate a ranking and/or scoring of the identified locations based at least in part on the cost of travel from the locations to the destination location.
[0056] In this manner, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined based at least in part on the one or more travel parameters (e.g. based at least in part on the ranks and/or scores of the identified locations). For instance, the candidate pick-up locations can include the top three, top five, etc. identified locations (e.g. based on the ranks and/or scores of the locations). In some implementations, the candidate pick-up locations can include each location having a pick-up location score above a threshold. In some implementations, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined by comparing the identified locations to the first pick-up location. For instance, one or more travel parameters can be determined for the first pick-up location and compared with the one or more travel parameters determined for the identified locations. In this manner, the candidate pick-up locations can include one or more identified locations having a higher ranking/score than the first pick-up location. In some implementations, a combination of the above mentioned candidate pick-up location selection techniques can be used. It will be appreciated that various other suitable candidate pick-up location selection techniques can be used without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure.
[0057] Data indicative of the one or more candidate pick-up locations can be provided to the user device associated with the user. The user device can then provide the candidate pick-up locations for display, such that the user is able to select a second pick-up location from the one or more candidate pick-up locations. Upon a selection of the second pick-up location, data indicative of the second pick-up location can be provided to a user device associated with the driver. The driver can then be re-routed to the second pick-up location to facilitate a pick-up of the user at the second pick-up location. If the user chooses not to select a second pick-up location (e.g. if the user desires to be picked up at the first pick-up location), the driver can continue along the route to the first pick-up location.
[0058] In some implementations, in order to obtain the benefits of the techniques described herein, a user may be required to allow the collection and analysis of location information associated with a user or device. For example, in some embodiments, users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect such information. If the user does not allow collection and use of such signals, then the user may not receive the benefits of the techniques described herein (e.g. may not be provided information associated with a candidate pick-up location). The user can also be provided with tools to revoke or modify consent. In addition, certain information or data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is
removed. For example, embodiments of the disclosed technology can be configured to enhance user privacy by removing identifiers for mobile devices or users. In some instances, device and/or user identifiers can be replaced with a lossy device indicator which might conflate a large number of devices or users into a single identifier.
[0059] Referring now to the figures, example aspects of the present disclosure will be discussed in greater detail. For instance, FIG. 4 depicts an overview of an example system 400 for determining pick-up locations associated with a ride share platform according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. System 400 includes a ride share platform 402. The ride share platform 402 can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in FIG. 10. In one example implementation, the ride share platform 402 can be implemented by a server (e.g. a web server) configured to communicate with one or more remote devices over a network.
[0060] For instance, the ride share platform 402 can be in communication with a user device 404 associated with a passenger and one or more driver devices 406 associated with one or more drivers. The user device 404 and the one or more driver devices 406 can be any suitable computing device, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, PDA, mobile phone, display with one or more processors, wearable computing device, or other suitable device. A passenger can provide a request via the user device 404 to the ride share platform 402 for a ride from an origin (e.g. pick-up location) to a destination. The request can be manually specified by the passenger using a suitable user interface presented on, for instance, a display device of the user device 404, and/or can be automatically generated, for instance, based on historical data indicative of previous ride requests associated with the passenger. The request can include an origin, a destination, a departure window of time when the passenger needs to be picked up, an arrival window of time when the passenger needs to reach the destination, the amount of time the passenger can wait before learning if a ride is available, and/or other information. The request can be communicated to the ride share platform 402 from the user device 404, for instance, over a network.
[0061] The ride share platform 402 can include a driver matcher 408. Driver matcher 408 can be configured to determine one or more candidate drivers based at least in part on the request for the ride. The one or more candidate drivers can be identified by driver matcher 408 based on various criteria. More particularly, information such as current locations of the drivers, travel patterns associated with drivers, driver cost, driver ratings, and other information can be used to identify the one or more candidate drivers. As an example, the
one or more candidate drivers can be drivers that are currently, or are expected to be, located within a threshold distance of the pick-up location. As another example, the one or more candidate drivers can be drivers that have a driver rating above a threshold rating.
[0062] In one particular implementation, driver matcher 408 can identify the one or more candidate drivers based at least in part on data indicative of travel patterns of drivers. For instance, data indicative of travel patterns can provide, for a particular driver, a typical travel route for the driver during a given time window. The data indicative of travel patterns can be input by drivers and/or can be determined using historical location data or other data (e.g. travel direction search history) associated with drivers. For instance, historical data associated with a driver can be analyzed to determine a predicted travel path for the driver during a time window. More particularly, historical data can indicate that a driver typically travels from his home to work along a particular travel route during a particular travel window. The driver can be selected as a candidate driver based on the predicted travel path for the driver.
[0063] According to yet other aspects of the present disclosure, the ride share platform 402 can allow the passenger to specify criteria for drivers for use by the driver matcher 408 in identifying one or more candidate drivers. For example, the passenger can request to be matched only with drivers of the same gender as the passenger. As yet another example, the passenger can request to be matched only with drivers having a driver rating that exceeds a rating threshold. As yet another example, the passenger can request to be matched only with drivers of that are in the same age group as the passenger. Various other criteria can be specified by the passengers to be used by the driver matcher 408 in identifying one or more candidate drivers.
[0064] The driver matcher 408 can provide data indicative of the request for the ride to the one or more candidate drivers. The one or more candidate drivers can then choose whether to accept the request. A driver that accepts the request can be assigned to the passenger for providing a ride to the passenger. For instance, the first candidate driver to accept the request for the ride can be assigned to the passenger. As another example, the closest driver to the passenger that accepts the request can be assigned to the request can be assigned to the passenger. As yet another example, the driver with the highest driver rating that accepts the request can be assigned to the passenger.
[0065] Upon an assignment of a driver, the assigned driver can begin traveling towards the specified pick-up location. Location data 410 associated with the assigned driver can be
obtained, for instance, by the driver device 406. For instance, the location data 410 can be obtained by a positioning system associated with the driver device 406. The location data 410 can be communicated to the ride share platform. The communicated location data 410 can be used by a routing engine 412 associated with the ride share platform to determine a travel route associated with the driver. For instance, the route can be a travel route that the driver is taking, or is expected to take to the specified pick-up location. The routing engine 412 can determine the travel route based on the location data 410 associated with the driver and the specified pick-up location. For instance, the travel route can be interpolated between a portion of the travel route already traveled by the driver (e.g. determined based on the location data 410) and the specified pick-up location. In some implementations, the route data may be selected by the driver. For instance, the routing engine 412 can determine one or more candidate travel routes and provide the one or more candidate travel routes to the driver device 406. The driver can select a candidate travel route, and the selection can be communicated back to the ride share platform 402.
[0066] The routing engine 412 can update the travel route as the driver travels. The travel route can be updated or modified to reflect a deviation from the travel route by the driver. For instance, if the location data 410 indicates that the driver has deviated from the travel route previously communicated to the ride share platform 402, a new travel route can be determined based on the location data 410 to reflect the deviation. As another example, the travel route can be updated or modified based on traffic conditions or road conditions.
[0067] As indicated, the travel route can be communicated to the ride share platform 402. The communicated travel route can be used by a pick-up determiner 414 associated with the ride share platform to determine one or more candidate pick-up locations. For instance, pickup determiner 414 can identify a plurality of locations proximate the specified pick-up location and/or the current location of the user. The plurality of locations can be located within a threshold distance or radius from the specified pick-up location and/or current location of the user. At least one candidate pick-up location can be determined from the plurality of identified locations.
[0068] The candidate pick-up locations can be determined by ranking, scoring, and/or prioritizing the plurality of identified locations. For instance, the pick-up determiner 414 can be configured to determine one or more travel parameters associated with the plurality of locations. As indicated, the travel parameters can include pick-up time (e.g. an expected amount of time required for the driver to travel to the location determined based at least in
part on the route data associated with the driver), travel time (e.g. an expected amount of time required for the driver to travel from the location to the destination location), cost of travel (e.g. an expected monetary cost to travel from the location to the destination location), quality of the location as a pick-up location (e.g. a measure of difficulty for the passenger and/or driver to travel to the location, based at least in part on proximity of the location to the user), safety of the location (e.g. determined based on time of day, amount of light proximate the location, amount of people proximate the location, crime rates associated with the location, etc.), and/or other suitable travel parameters.
[0069] The pick-up determiner 414 can rank, score, and/or prioritize the plurality of locations based at least in part on the travel parameters determined for each location. In some implementations, the ranks, scores, and/or prioritization can be determined based at least in part on a combination of the travel parameters determined for each location. The pick-up determiner 414 can determine one or more candidate pick-up locations based at least in part on the ranks, scores, and/or prioritization of the plurality of locations. For instance, the candidate pick-up locations can include one or more locations having a higher ranking than some rank threshold. As another example, the candidate pick-up locations can include one or more locations having a score above some score threshold.
[0070] In some implementations, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined based on a comparison with the original pick-up location specified by the user. For instance, pick-up determiner 414 can determine one or more travel parameters for the specified pick-up location. The specified pick-up location can then be ranked, scored, and/or prioritized against the plurality of locations (e.g. based on the travel parameters for the locations and the specified pick-up locations). The candidate pick-up locations can then include one or more locations having a higher rank, score, etc. than the specified pick-up location. For instance, if the specified pick-up location has the highest rank, score, etc., no candidate pick-up locations will be determined.
[0071] In some implementations, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined based at least in part on one or more user specified travel parameters. For instance, a user can interact with the user device 404 to select one or more travel parameters for use in
determining the candidate pick-up locations. The selected travel parameters can be communicated to the ride share platform 402 and used by pick-up determiner 414 in determining the candidate pick-up locations according to example embodiments of the present disclosure.
[0072] In some implementations, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined based at least in part on one or more modes of transportation associated with the user. For instance, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined to accommodate a public transportation route having a transit stop proximate the user. The candidate pick-up locations can be determined by analyzing routing information (e.g. route data, schedule data, stop data, etc.) associated with such public transportation. In this manner, the plurality of locations identified by the pick-up determiner can include one or more locations proximate a subsequent stop associated with the public transportation. Such locations can be determined to be candidate pick-up locations based at least in part on the travel parameters associated with the stop, while taking into account an expected time taken for the user to travel to the locations via the public transportation service.
[0073] Data indicative of the one or more candidate pick-up locations can be provided to the user device 404, and presented, for instance, within a user interface associated with the user device 404. The user may then select a candidate pick-up location by interacting with the user interface. Such selected pick-up location can be communicated to the ride share platform 402 and to the driver device 406. The selected pick-up location can replace the previously specified pick-up location, such that the driver and the passenger can travel to and meet at the selected pick-up location to initiate the requested ride.
[0074] In some implementations, the ride share platform can be implemented by one or more entities. For instance, the ride share platform can include an integration of services associated with the multiple entities. As a particular example, one or more aspects of a ride share service can be implemented within, for instance, an application (e.g. software application) associated with a hosting entity. The hosting entity can be associated with, for instance, a navigation data provider that offers a navigation experience within the software application of the hosting entity. In this manner, the software application can provide navigation information (e.g., turn-by-turn navigation information) to a user as a user traverses along a navigation route or other path. One or more aspects of the ride share service can be implemented within the software application to facilitate ride transactions offered by the ride share service from within the hosting software application. In this manner, one or more computing devices associated with the ride share service can communicate with one or more computing devices associated with the navigation data provider to implement the ride share platform.
[0075] For instance, FIG. 5 depicts an overview of an example system 420 for determining pick-up locations for a ride share service according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. The system 420 can correspond to system 400 of FIG. 4 or other system. The system 420 includes a ride share platform 422. The ride share platform 422 can communicate with a user device 404 and one or more driver devices 406. As shown, the ride share platform includes a hosting entity 424 and a ride share service 426. The hosting entity 424 can be associated with a navigation data provider. The hosting entity 424 can include one or more computing devices 428 that implement pick-up determiner 414. The hosting entity can be in communication with the ride share service 426 (e.g. over a network) to implement the ride share platform 422. The ride share service can include one or more computing devices 429 that implement routing engine 412 and driver matcher 408.
[0076] As indicated, the hosting entity and the ride share service can be independent entities. One or more aspects of the ride share service 426 can be integrated with one or more services of the hosting entity 424 to implement the ride share platform 422. For instance, one or more aspects of the ride share service 426 can be implemented within a software application developed by the hosting entity 424. The software application can be stored on the user device 404, and presented on a display of the user device 404 to facilitate a ride transaction associated with the ride share service 426 from within the software application.
[0077] For instance, in some implementations, the passenger can request a ride (e.g. and a pick-up location) from the ride share service 426 through an interaction with the software application. The request can be communicated to the ride share service 426 by the hosting entity 424. The ride share service 426 can then determine one or more candidate drivers, and can assign a driver to the passenger according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. As the driver travels to the specified pick-up location, the ride share service can determine a travel route on which the driver is traveling or is expected to travel (e.g. based on the location data 410), and can communicate the travel route to the hosting entity. The pickup determiner 414 can then determine one or more candidate pick-up locations based on the communicated travel route (e.g. and one or more travel parameters). The hosting entity 424 can provide the candidate pick-up locations to the user device 404 for presentation to the user, for instance within a user interface associated with the software application. For instance, the user interface can be the example interface 100 depicted in FIG. 1.
[0078] FIG. 6 depicts a flow diagram of an example method (500) of determining pick-up locations associated with a ride share platform according to example embodiments of the
present disclosure. Method (500) can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in FIG. 10. In particular
implementations, the method (500) can be implemented by the driver matcher 408, the routing engine 412 and/or the pick-up determiner 414 depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5.
[0079] At (502), method (500) can include receiving data indicative of a first pick-up location associated with a request for a ride from a ride share platform. As indicated, a user can request a ride from an origin to a destination from a ride share platform. The first pickup location can be a current location of the user (e.g. as determined by a positioning system associated with the user device) or a different location specified by the user.
[0080] At (504), method (500) can include assigning a driver for providing the ride to the user. For instance, one or more candidate drivers can be identified based at least in part, for instance, on a location of the drivers, a driver rating of the drivers, expected travel patterns of the drivers, etc. The candidate drivers can be presented with the request (e.g. on a display device of a computing device associated with the driver), and can determine whether to accept the request. A driver that accepts the request can be assigned to the user for providing the ride to the user.
[0081] At (506), method (500) can include receiving location data associated with a route of the driver. For instance, the location data can be determined by a positioning system associated with the driver computing device. The location data can be used to determine a route associated with the driver. The route can be a travel route taken by the driver to the first pick-up location. In some implementations, the route can be a travel route expected to be taken by the driver to the first pick-up location. In some implementations, the route can be selected by the driver. For instance, one or more candidate routes can be determined between a location of the driver and the first pick-up location, and presented to the driver (e.g. on the driver computing device). The driver can select a candidate route that the driver desires to take.
[0082] At (508), method (500) can include determining one or more candidate pick-up locations based at least in part on the first pick-up location and the route of the driver. For instance, the candidate pick-up location can be determined by ranking, scoring and/or prioritizing a plurality of locations proximate the first pick-up location. The ranking, scoring, and/or prioritizing can be determined based at least in part on one or more travel parameters determined for the plurality of locations.
[0083] At (510), method (500) can include providing data indicative of the one or more candidate pick-up locations to a user computing device associated with the user. For instance, the data indicative of the one or more candidate pick-up locations can include data to be displayed by the user device in a user interface indicative of the one or more candidate pick-up locations.
[0084] FIG. 7 depicts a flow diagram of an example method (600) of determining one or more candidate pick-up locations according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Method (600) can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in FIG. 10. In particular implementations, the method (600) can be implemented by the driver matcher 408, the routing engine 412 and/or the pick-up determiner 414 depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5.
[0085] At (602), method (600) can include identifying a plurality of locations proximate a location associated with the user (e.g. a current location of the user and/or a first pick-up location associated with a request for a ride by the user). For instance, the identified locations can be locations within a threshold distance or radius of the current location of the user. In some implementations, the identified locations can be locations suitable for initiating a pick-up. For instance, the identified locations can be locations along a sidewalk, on the side of a road, in a parking lot, etc. In this manner, such locations may not include locations in the middle of a road, along a highway, etc.
[0086] At (604), method (600) can include determining one or more travel parameters associated with each identified location. For instance, the one or more travel parameters can include pick-up time (e.g. an expected amount of time required for the driver and/or the user to travel to the location determined based at least in part on the route data associated with the driver), travel time (e.g. an expected amount of time required for the driver to travel from the location to the destination location), cost of the ride (e.g. an expected monetary cost to travel from the location to the destination location), quality of pick-up location (e.g. a measure of difficulty for the passenger and/or driver to travel to the location), safety of the location (e.g. determined based on time of day, amount of light proximate the location, amount of people proximate the location, crime rates associated with the location, etc.), and/or other suitable travel parameters. In some implementations, the travel parameters can be selected by the user.
[0087] At (606), method (600) can include ranking, scoring, and/or prioritizing the identified locations based at least in part on the associated travel parameters. For instance,
the identified locations can be ranked based on the travel parameters to reflect a benefit of the identified location to the driver and/or user if selected as the pick-up location. In some implementations, the identified locations can be ranked, scored, and/or prioritized based at least in part on a combination (e.g. linear combination) of two or more travel parameters.
[0088] At (608), method (600) can include selecting at least one identified location as a candidate pick-up location based at least in part on the ranking, scoring, and/or prioritizing. For instance, as indicated above, the one or more candidate pick-up locations can include one or more identified locations that have a score, ranking, etc. that is higher than a threshold. In some implementations, the candidate pick-up locations can be selected based at least in part on a comparison with the first pick-up location. For instance, travel parameters can be determined for the first pick-up location and compared against the travel parameters determined for the identified locations.
[0089] FIG. 8 depicts a flow diagram of an example method (700) selecting one or more pick-up locations associated with a ride share platform according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Method (700) can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in FIG. 10. In particular
implementations, the method (700) can be implemented by user device 404 depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5.
[0090] At (702), method (700) can include receiving a first user input indicative of a first pick-up location associated with a request for a ride by a user. As indicated, the user may request a ride from a ride sharing platform or service by interacting with a user interface presented on a display device of a user computing device associated with the user. At (704), method (700) can include providing data indicative of the first pick-up location to one or more computing devices associated with a ride share platform. For instance, the ride share platform can include one or more computing devices configured to implement the ride share platform.
[0091] At (706), method (700) can include receiving data indicative of one or more candidate pick-up locations. For instance, the candidate pick-up locations can be determined by the one or more computing devices associated with the ride share platform according to example embodiments of the present disclosure.
[0092] At (708), method (700) can include providing for display data indicative of the one or more candidate pick-up locations. For instance, the user device can provide for
display visual representations of the candidate pick-up locations in conjunction with a mapping component of a user interface.
[0093] At (710), method (700) can include receiving a second user input indicative of a second pick-up location selected by the user. For instance, the second pick-up location can be one of the candidate pick-up locations presented to the user. The user can interact with the user interface to select the second pick-up location to modify the pick-up location to a new location. At (712), method (700) can include providing data indicative of the second pick-up location to the one or more computing devices associated with ride share platform.
[0094] FIG. 9 depicts a flow diagram of an example method (800) of initiating a ride associated with a ride share platform according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Method (800) can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing devices depicted in FIG. 10. In particular implementations, the method (800) can be implemented by driver device 406 depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5.
[0095] At (802), method (800) can include receiving a request for a ride from a user. For instance, a driver computing device associated with a driver can receive an indication that a user has requested a ride associated with the ride share platform, and can present data indicative of the requested ride within a user interface of the driver device. The request for the ride can include or otherwise be associated with a first pick-up location at which the ride is to be initiated. At (804), method (800) can include accepting the ride from the user. For instance, the driver can accept the request, and data indicative of the acceptance can be provided to a ride share platform (e.g. one or more computing devices that implement the ride share platform) to signify the acceptance.
[0096] At (806), method (800) can include providing location data to the ride share platform. The location data can be determined, for instance, by a positioning system associated with the driver device. The location data can be used by the ride share platform to determine a route, for instance, from a current location of the driver, to the first pick-up location. The determined route can be used by the ride share platform to determine one or more candidate pick-up locations to be presented to the user.
[0097] At (808), method (800) can include receiving data indicative of a second pick-up location associated with the user. For instance, the second pick-up location can be a candidate pick-up location selected by the user to modify or change the pick-up location from the firs pick-up location to the second pick-up location.
[0098] FIG. 10 depicts an example computing system 900 that can be used to implement the methods and systems according to example aspects of the present disclosure. The system 900 can be implemented using a client-server architecture that includes a ride share platform 910 that communicates with one or more client devices 930 over a network 940. The system 900 can be implemented using other suitable architectures, such as a single computing device.
[0099] The system 900 includes a ride share platform 910, such as a web server.
