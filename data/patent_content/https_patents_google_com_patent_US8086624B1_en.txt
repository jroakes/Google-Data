Definitions
- This invention relates to advertising.
- the content provided by the service is typically related to a particular topic that can, for example, be divided up into various content categories.
- a service provider can give the Internet user additional content and/or advertisements focused on the category desired by the user, thus improving the user's experience.
- some content providers include search functionality that is based on keywords entered by the user seeking information.
- This user query can be an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user.
- AdWordsTM offered by Google, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.).
- An example of such a system is described in part in U.S. Pat. No. 6,816,857, entitled “Meaning-based advertising and document relevance determination,” issued Nov. 9, 2004, currently assigned to the assignee of the present application and which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
- a content provider can serve advertisements to a user based on a determination of an advertisement most closely related to Internet content such as a web page. This can be done, for example, by associating the content of the web page to a set of one or more advertising keywords closely related to the page content, and serving targeted ads to a user of that web page.
- An example of such as a system is the AdSenseTM system offered by Google, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.).
- An example of such a system is in part described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,136,875, entitled “Serving advertisements based on content,” issued Nov. 14, 2006 to the assignee of the present application and which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
- the present disclosure includes a system and method for determining proximity to topics of content items (e.g., an advertisement or “ad”).
- a method includes identifying match criteria associated with keywords of a content item.
- the keywords used in determining whether or not to embed the content item in Web pages including content such as, for example, search query terms.
- Numerical scores for the match criteria is determined based, at least in part, on a topic of the content item, the numerical score indicative of proximity to the topic of the content item.
- the method includes preliminarily selecting an advertisement based on a set of search keywords associated with a search query, determining a set of ad keywords associated with the advertisement; mapping the ad keywords to at least one keyword cluster; computing a first conditional probability of the ad keywords in the presence of the at least one keyword cluster; computing a second conditional probability of the search keywords in the presence of the at least one keyword cluster; and, comparing the first conditional probability and the second conditional probability to determine a topical proximity between the search query and the advertisement.
- the method further includes identifying a threshold associated with the at least one of the search keywords and the ad keywords; and determining a subset of the search keywords are substantially relevant to the ad keywords based, at least in part, on comparing the difference between the first conditional probability and the second conditional probability, to the threshold.

- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method 400 for identifying substantially irrelevant search criteria in system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- method 400 describes an example technique for evaluation engine 128 to determine substantially irrelevant search criteria based on proximity to a topic of an advertisement. The following descriptions will primarily focus on the operation of evaluation engine 128 in performing this method. But system 100 contemplates using any appropriate combination and arrangement of logical elements implementing some or all of the described functionality.
- Method 400 begins at step 402 where keywords of an advertisement are identified.
- the identified keywords are mapped to a set of clusters indicative of a topic of the advertisement.
- search criteria relevant to the keywords are identified. For example, search criteria that can lead to an impression of the ad based on the keywords can be identified. In some implementations, the amount of search criteria may be limited, for example, by a period of time (e.g., 30 days).
- conditional probabilities that the search criteria occur in the set of clusters are determined. Using the conditional probabilities, numerical scores indicating proximity to the topic of the ad is determined at step 410 .
- the relevance score may be determined based on the logarithm of the conditional probabilities as described with respect to FIG. 1 .
- Substantially irrelevant search criteria are determined in accordance with the associated numerical score at step 412 .
- the substantially irrelevant search criteria are identified based, at least in part, on a comparison between a threshold and the numerical score.
Abstract
Description
In some implementations, this expression substantially determines an average logarithmic probability that a word occurs in a set of clusters associated with a topic of an advertisement. In this example, P(Word|C) increases for words that occur with greater frequency in the associated clusters, and accordingly, Score(K|C) also increases. In some implementations, the computed score can be compared with the probability that the keywords associated with an advertisement occurs in the set of clusters, which can be expressed as P(Keywords Associated with an Ad|C). In one example, the relevance can be determined by the difference as expressed in the following equation:
Relevance(Q|C)=Score(Q|C)−Score(Keywords Associated with an Ad|C)
In this example, the relevance of search criteria is determined by the difference in the logarithmic odds between search criteria and keywords of an advertisement. In addition, the evaluation criteria 122 can include logical expressions for comparing determined metrics (e.g., relevance) to one or more parameters. For example, the evaluation criteria 122 can identify a proximity threshold such that a metric below this value indicates that the search criteria is not relevant to or otherwise associated with the topic of an advertisement. Also, the evaluation criteria 122 can include a value such that a relevance score above this value indicates that the search query is associated with the topic of the advertisement. The above expressions are examples for determining the relevance of search criteria to a topic associated with an advertisement. Accordingly, other similar mathematical and/or logical expressions can be used to determine relevancy without departing from the scope of this disclosure. In some implementations, the evaluation criteria 122 can be formatted, stored, or defined as various data structures in text files, XML documents, VSAM files, flat files, Btrieve files, CSV files, internal variables, or one or more libraries. In short, the evaluation criteria 122 can be stored to comprise one table or file or a plurality of tables or files stored on one computer or across a plurality of computers in any appropriate format. Moreover, evaluation criteria 122 can be local or remote without departing from the scope of this disclosure and store any type of appropriate data.
