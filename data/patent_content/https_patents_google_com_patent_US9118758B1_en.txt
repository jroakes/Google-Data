Definitions
- the disclosure relates to communicating promotional messages to computing device(s) and in particular to determining relevance of a promotional message based on caller feedback.
- Conventional systems typically determine relevance (i.e., interest by a target audience or user) of a promotional message based on various factors including whether the promotional message was selected, such as clicked, by the target.
- conventional systems fail to leverage caller experience to determine relevance of promotional messages.
- conventional systems fail to include information collected after a phone call has been made to enhance quality of promotional messages and caller experience. Caller experience may deteriorate due to long IVR (interactive voice response) times. This may result in lost calls leading to lackluster sales and/or service for entities such as advertisers. What is needed is a system and method that incorporates caller feedback in determining relevance of promotional message(s).
- the method may include determining relevance of a promotional message based on caller feedback.
- the method may include receiving at least one phone call, the at least one phone call indicating a phone number that was called to make the at least one phone call.
- the method may include associating the at least one phone call with a promotional message or promotional message group via the phone number, the promotional message group comprising one or more promotional messages.
- the method may include receiving feedback that indicates a user experience associated with the at least one phone call.
- the method may include determining a relevance of the promotional message or promotional message group based on the received feedback.

- call metric system 150 may receive at least one phone call indicating a phone number that was called to make the at least one phone call.
- the phone call may be made using computing device 120 .
- the phone call is made using another device having a telephone function.
- call metric system 150 may track the received at least one phone call. In some implementations, tracking may include monitoring the duration of the call, area code of the caller associated with the call, date/time of the call, recording the call, transcribing the call (for the advertiser, for example).
- call metric system 150 may associate the at least one phone call with a promotional message group via the phone number. In some implementations, call metric system 150 may associate the at least one phone call with the promotional message group based on the association between the promotional message group and the phone number (for example, the association stored in memory 154 ).
- call metric system 150 may track the received at least one phone call by determining that the phone call resulted from a promotional message such as an advertisement, thereby attributing the call to the promotional message. For example, call metric system 150 may receive a phone call from a user that called a phone number that is displayed on an advertisement, landing page, or other content and/or response associated with the entity. Accordingly, when the user calls the phone number, call metric system 150 may determine that the phone call originated from the promotional message based on the association between the phone number and the promotional message. In other words, call metric system 150 may associate the phone call with the promotional message based on the phone number and may determine that the promotional message led to the phone call.
- a promotional message such as an advertisement
- a promotional message/promotional message group may be associated with a phone number before the promotional message and the phone number are communicated to computing device 120 .
- the received at least one phone call may be tracked using the association.
- the association may be stored in a memory such as memory 154 of call metric system 150 . Accordingly, when a user calls the phone number, call metric system 150 may determine that the at least one phone call originated from the promotional message based on the association between the phone number and the promotional message.
- the promotional message when communicated may include or when selected may cause a phone number to be displayed. Thus, a user may call the phone number after viewing the promotional message.
- call metric system 150 may determine that the phone call resulted from the promotional message. Also, because the promotional message is associated with a promotional message group, call metric system 150 may determine that the phone call resulted from (or is associated with) the promotional message group.
- the promotional message may be associated with an entity such as an advertiser and a phone number may be associated with the entity.
- the at least one phone call may be tracked by correlating when the promotional message was communicated and when a phone call associated with the phone number was received. As would be appreciated, for example, based on the date/time that the promotional message was communicated and the date/time that the phone call was received, various statistical analyses may be performed to determine that the phone call is correlated with (i.e., resulted from) the promotional message (in other words, that the promotional message led to the phone call). Also, because the promotional message is associated with a promotional message group, call metric system 150 may determine that the phone call resulted from (or is associated with) the promotional message group.
- the phone number may be associated with at least one keyword (i.e., keywords targeted by an entity, for example) such that the promotional message associated with the entity may be displayed in response to a keyword.
- the at least one phone call may be tracked by correlating when the keyword was entered, when the promotional message was communicated and when a phone call associated with the phone number was received.
- various statistical analyses may be performed to determine that the phone call is correlated with (i.e., resulted from) the keyword and/or promotional message (in other words, that the keyword and/or promotional message led to the phone call).
- call metric system 150 may determine that the phone call resulted from (or is associated with) the promotional message group.
- call metric system 150 may establish a connection between a caller associated with the at least one phone call and an entity associated with the promotional message/promotional message group. In some implementations, call metric system 150 may establish a connection based on the received at least one phone call. In some implementations, establishing a connection may include forwarding the call to the entity, dialing the entity and bridging the call, etc.
- call metric system 150 may receive a first feedback that indicates a user/caller experience associated with the at least one phone call.
- the first feedback may be received after the established connection is completed between the caller and the entity.
- the received first feedback may include a positive feedback indicating a positive user/caller experience associated with the at least one phone call.
- the received first feedback may include a negative feedback indicating a negative user/caller experience associated with the at least one phone call.
- call metric system 150 may provide one or more surveys and/or questionnaires to the caller associated with the at least one phone call to elicit the first feedback from the caller.
- the surveys may be provided after the at least one phone call is finished between the caller and the entity associated with the promotional message/promotional message group.
- the surveys may comprise one or more questions regarding the caller's experience with the at least one phone call. In other words, the surveys may elicit feedback regarding the user's perceived quality of the at least one phone call.

- the surveys may include IVR (Interactive Voice Response) based surveys, web based surveys, and/or other surveys.
- call metric system 150 may receive one or more survey responses from a caller associated with the at least one phone call (in response to the one or more surveys). In some implementations, the first feedback comprises the one or more survey responses.
- the caller may provide the survey responses using computing device 120 .
- computing device 120 may include a user interface (not otherwise illustrated in FIG. 1 ) that is configured to receive the surveys from call metric system 150 and present the surveys/questions to the caller in order to elicit feedback from the caller.
- the user interface may present the surveys that prompt for and receive input from the caller regarding the caller's experience with the at least one phone call.
- the responses to the surveys may include a multiple choice format and/or open character input.
- the responses may include ratings and may be numeric such as a rating on a scale of 0-5 of a quality of a phone call, descriptive such as “poor,” “below average,” “average,” “good,” “excellent” and so forth, and/or other ratings that reflect a the caller's experience with the at least one phone call.
- the responses may include open-ended responses such as comments to be entered by the caller.
- the caller's survey responses may indicate a positive feedback indicating a positive caller experience associated with the at least one phone call. In some implementations, the caller's survey responses may indicate a negative feedback indicating a negative caller experience associated with the at least one phone call.
- a caller may disconnect the phone call before completing the survey (i.e., before providing survey responses) or may otherwise choose not to complete the survey (i.e., not provide responses).
- no caller response may indicate at least a “not negative” type of response.
- no caller response may indicate that at least the caller did not have a negative caller experience associated with the at least one phone call. This is because it may be assumed that if the caller had a negative caller experience, the caller may have chosen to provide feedback rather than no feedback.
- call metric system 150 may receive a second feedback from an entity associated with the promotional message/promotional message group.
- the second feedback may indicate an entity experience associated with the at least one phone call.
- call metric system 150 may provide one or more entity surveys and/or questionnaires to the entity such as an advertiser associated with the at least one phone call to elicit the second feedback from the entity.
- the entity surveys may be provided after the at least one phone call is finished between the caller and the entity associated with the promotional message/promotional message group.
- the entity surveys may comprise one or more questions regarding the entity's experience with the at least one phone call. In other words, the entity surveys may elicit feedback regarding the entity's perceived quality of the at least one phone call.
- the entity surveys may include questions such as, for example, “how would you rate the quality of the call?”, or “did the customer seem satisfied with the quality of the call?”
- the entity surveys may include IVR (Interactive Voice Response) based surveys, web based surveys, and/or other surveys.
- IVR Interactive Voice Response
- call metric system 150 may receive one or more entity survey responses from an entity associated with the at least one phone call. In some implementations, the second feedback comprises the one or more entity survey responses.
- the entity may provide the entity survey responses using a computing device (not otherwise illustrated in FIG. 1 ) associated with the entity.
- the computing device associated with the entity may include a user interface that is configured to receive the entity surveys from call metric system 150 and present the entity surveys/questions to the entity in order to elicit feedback from the entity.
- the user interface may present the entity surveys that prompt for and receive input from the entity regarding the entity's experience with the at least one phone call.
- the entity responses to the entity surveys may include a multiple choice format and/or open character input.
- the entity responses may include ratings and may be numeric such as a rating on a scale of 0-5 of a quality of a phone call, descriptive such as “poor,” “below average,” “average,” “good,” “excellent” and so forth, and/or other ratings that reflect the entity's experience with the at least one phone call.
- the entity responses may include open-ended responses such as comments to be entered by the entity.
- the entity may automatically provide the second feedback via the user interface.
- the user interface may include a button such as “provide feedback” button, which when selected by the entity may prompt or otherwise allow the entity to provide the second feedback.
- the entity's survey responses may indicate a positive feedback indicating a positive entity experience associated with the at least one phone call. In some implementations, the entity's survey responses may indicate a negative feedback indicating a negative entity experience associated with the at least one phone call.
- call metric system 150 may record the at least one phone call and may analyze the recorded phone call to determine a third feedback that indicates a user/caller experience and/or entity experience associated with the phone call.
- the recorded at least one phone call may be manually analyzed (for example, by professional raters that listen to the recordings).
- the recording may be input into speech recognition and/or machine learning systems that analyze the recorded at least one phone call. In some implementations, these systems may translate speech to text and may identify patterns in the speech to determine a caller and/or entity experience associated with at least one phone call.
- both manual and automated mechanisms may be utilized to determine the third feedback regarding a caller and/or entity experience associated with the phone call.
- the recorded at least one phone call may be rated and the third feedback may be provided in the form of one or more ratings such as a numeric, descriptive, or other ratings.
- the recorded at least one phone call may be rated as a “good call” indicating a positive caller/entity experience associated with the call.
- the recorded at least one phone call may be rated as a “bad call” indicating a bad caller/entity experience associated with the call.
- the recorded at least one phone call may be rated as a “neutral call” indicating a neutral or non-negative caller/entity experience associated with the call.
- call metric system 150 may determine a relevance of the promotional message/promotional message group based on the received feedback (i.e., first feedback, second feedback, third feedback, and/or other feedback) associated with the at least one phone call.
- the received feedback may be used to determine whether a particular promotional message/promotional message group that led to the at least one phone call is relevant to the caller and/or entity associated with the at least one phone call.
- a determination of relevance may be made based on a type of received feedback (for example, positive/good, negative/bad, neutral/non-negative, and/or other type of feedback) associated with the at least one phone call and/or analysis (manual or automated) of the at least one phone call.
- a determination may be made that the promotional message/promotional message group is relevant to caller/entity based on a positive feedback associated with the at least one phone call. In some implementations, determining a relevance may include determining a higher relevance for the promotional message/promotional message group based on the positive feedback compared to a relevance before the positive feedback. In some implementations, a determination may be made that the promotional message/promotional message group is not relevant to caller/entity based on a negative feedback associated with the at least one phone call. In some implementations, determining a relevance may include determining a lower relevance for the promotional message/promotional message group based on the negative feedback compared to a relevance before the negative feedback.
- determining a relevance of a promotional message group may be based on a determined relevance of one or more promotional messages associated with the promotional message group.
- call metric system 150 may increase or decrease pCTRs (predicted click through rates) associated with the promotional message. For example, if the promotional message is determined to be relevant or of higher relevance based on positive feedback, the pCTR for the promotional message may be increased. Similarly, if the promotional message is determined to be relevant or of lower relevance based on negative feedback, the pCTR for the promotional message may be decreased. In some implementations, the pCTR for one or more promotional messages included in the promotional message group may be increased or decreased based on the determined relevance. In some implementations, promotional messages with higher pCTRs may be ranked higher than promotional messages with lower pCTRs. In some implementations, the relevance of the promotional message group may be based on the pCTR values of the associated promotional messages.
- pCTRs predicted click through rates
- call metric system 150 may associate a weight with each of one or more promotional messages included in the promotional message group.
- the weight associated with each promotional message may be based on a probability that the promotional message may led to a phone call. For example, a particular promotional message may be associated with a higher weight in response to a determination that there is a higher probability that the promotional message may lead to a phone call as compared to another promotional message with a lower probability.
- call metric system 150 may generate a quality score that is used to determine relevance of a promotional message/promotional message group.
- the quality score may include a quality score per impression of a promotional message.
- the quality score may include an average quality score per promotional message group.
- call metric system 150 may distribute the quality score among the one or more promotional messages associated with the promotional message group based on the assigned weight.
- the quality score may be distributed uniformly among the promotional messages associated with the promotional message group.
- the quality score may be distributed based on a weighted average.
- call metric system 150 may determine a relevance of the promotional message based on the quality score associated with the promotional message. In some implementations, call metric system 150 may determine a relevance of the promotional message group based on the quality score associated with the promotional message group. For example, a higher quality score may result in a determination of a higher relevance of the promotional message/promotional message group. Similarly, a lower quality score may result in a determination of a lower relevance of the promotional message/promotional message group.
- call metric system 150 may determine whether to provide the phone number to be displayed on at least one promotional message of the one or more promotional messages associated with the promotional message group based on the determined relevance of the promotional message/promotional message group. In some implementations, when the promotional message/promotional message group is determined to be relevant or of higher relevance to the caller/entity, a determination may be made to continue displaying the phone number on the at least one promotional message (i.e., continue displaying the phone number when the promotional message is subsequently communicated). In some implementations, when the promotional message/promotional message group is determined to be not relevant or of lower relevance to the caller/entity, a determination may be made to discontinue displaying the phone number on the at least one promotional message. In this manner, whether to display a phone number may be based on a determined relevance, which in turn may be based on caller feedback described herein.
- an advertiser may want keywords “coffee” and “coffee machine” to be targeted such that at least one promotional message associated with the promotional message group/entity may be communicated to/displayed at computing device 120 in response to the keywords (for example, in response to a search query that includes the keywords).
- the at least one promotional message and associated one or more phone numbers may be communicated to computing device 120 .
- a caller (associated with computing device 120 or other device) may make at least one phone call via at least one phone number of the one or more phone numbers. Based on a first phone number associated with a first phone call, a determination may be made that the keyword “coffee” or the promotional message communicated in response to the keyword “coffee” led to the first phone call.
- a determination may be made that the keyword “coffee machine” or the promotional message communicated in response to the keyword “coffee machine” led to the second phone call.
- the caller/entity may not be happy about the experience associated with the first phone call and may provide negative feedback, thereby resulting in lower relevance being determined for the promotional message/promotional message group associated with the first phone call.
- a determination may be made to discontinue displaying the first phone number on the promotional message communicated in response to the keyword “coffee”.
- the caller/entity may be happy about the experience associated with the second phone call and may provide positive feedback, thereby resulting in higher relevance being determined for the promotional message/promotional message group associated with the second phone call.
- a determination may be made to continue displaying the second phone number on the promotional message communicated in response to the keyword “coffee machine”.
- the first phone call and the second phone call may be associated with the same promotional message group.
- phone calls received by call metric system 150 may be associated with different promotional message groups.
- call metric system 150 may generate at least one report.
- the report may include, among other things, the number of received calls for a promotional message, promotional message group and/or entity, type of feedback received for one or more promotional messages associated with one or more promotional message groups, the relevance/quality score/rank of one or more promotional messages associated with one or more promotional message groups.
- the report may include other metrics associated with the calls as would be appreciated.
- call metric system 150 may receive a request for the report from an advertiser or other entity. In response to the request, call metric system 150 may generate the report and communicate the report to a remote computing device used by an advertiser (not otherwise illustrated in FIG. 1 ).
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process 200 of determining a relevance of a promotional message based on caller/entity feedback, according to various implementations of the invention.
- the various processing operations and/or data flows depicted in FIG. 2 are described in greater detail herein.
- the described operations for a flow diagram may be accomplished using some or all of the system components described in detail above and, in some implementations of the invention, various operations may be performed in different sequences. According to various implementations of the invention, additional operations may be performed along with some or all of the operations shown in the depicted flow diagrams. In yet other implementations, one or more operations may be performed simultaneously. Accordingly, the operations as illustrated (and described in greater detail below) are examples by nature and, as such, should not be viewed as limiting.
- process 200 may receive at least one phone call in operation 202 .
- the at least one phone call may indicate a phone number that was called to make the at least one phone call.
- process 200 may associate the at least one phone call with a promotional message group via the phone number.
- a promotional message group may be associated with and/or created by an entity (for example, an advertiser, retailer, or other entity).
- a promotional message group may include one or more promotional messages which target a set of keywords, for example.
- the set of keywords may include similar or related keywords.
- the keywords may include one or more letters, numbers, characters, symbols, words, and/or any combination of the foregoing.
- the keywords may be chosen by the entity.
- process 200 may receive feedback that indicates a caller and/or entity experience associated with the at least one phone call. In an operation 208 , process 200 may determine a relevance of the promotional message group based on the received feedback.
- FIG. 3 is a data flow diagram 300 illustrating example process relationships in a system of determining a relevance of a promotional message based on caller/entity feedback, according to various implementations of the invention.
- promotional message serving system 110 may communicate at least one promotional message (associated with a promotional message group, for example) and the associated one or more phone numbers to computing device 120 .
- promotional message serving system 110 may communicate the least one promotional message and the associated one or more phone numbers in response to a second request.
- promotional message serving system 110 may identify the at least one promotional message to be communicated based on the second request.
- the at least one promotional message and the one or more phone numbers may be displayed at computing device 120 and may be viewed by user 302 of computing device 120 .
- user 302 may call at least one phone number of the one or more phone numbers associated with the at least one promotional message.
- call metric system 150 may receive at least one phone call from computing device 120 or other device used by user 302 to make the call.
- call metric system 150 may associate the at least one phone call with the promotional message/promotional message group.
- call metric system 150 may establish a connection between computing device 120 associated with user 302 and entity 160 associated with the promotional message/promotional message group. In some implementations, call metric system 150 may establish the connection based on the received at least one phone call.
- call metric system 150 may receive feedback from user 302 indicating the user's experience associated with the at least one phone call. In some implementations, in an operation 328 , call metric system may receive feedback from entity 160 indicating the entity's experience associated with the at least one phone call.
- call metric system 150 may determine a relevance of the promotional message/promotional message group based on the received user and/or entity feedback.
- Implementations of the invention may be made in hardware, firmware, software, or any suitable combination thereof. Implementations of the invention may also be implemented as instructions stored on a machine readable medium, which may be read and executed by one or more processors.
- a tangible machine-readable medium may include any tangible, non-transitory, mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computing device).
