Definitions
- This specification relates to digital data processing, and more particularly to presenting search results with a geographic map.
- mapping websites provide interactive maps for display on the individuals' computers. Individuals can move the maps, zoom-in on regions of the maps, and view traffic information on the maps. Further, users can submit search queries and, in response, view icons that are placed on the maps at locations of businesses that are responsive to the search queries.
- a user of a computing device can submit multiple search queries to a mapping service.
- the mapping service can provide information to the computing device for displaying a layer of visual indicators, where the visual indicators can represent search results or geographical contexts.
- the multiple layers of visual indicators can be overlaid on a display of a map.
- a set of graphical user interface elements for manipulating the display of the layers can accompany the display of the map.
- each particular layer can be associated with a first graphical interface element for toggling a visibility of the visual indicators for the particular layer.
- each particular layer can be associated with a second graphical interface element that provides focus to the particular layer.
- a layer that has focus can interact with other layers differently than when the layer does not have focus.
- providing focus to a layer that defines a geographical context can cause search results, from other layers, that are determined to be associated with the focused geographical context to appear emphasized in the display or alone as the only search results in the display.
- Providing focus to a layer that identifies search results can cause those search results from the focused layer that are associated with geographical contexts of other visible layers to appear emphasized or alone as the only search results in the display.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in one or more computer-readable storage devices storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processing devices, cause a computing system to perform operations.
- the operations include receiving, from a server system, information that is responsive to each of multiple distinct search queries, wherein the information for each of the search queries identifies a geographical context or includes search results.

- This document generally describes displaying layers of search results on a map.
- a user of an internet web mapping service can submit to the web mapping service a series of queries that include content related to various geographic locations, business, and services.
- Visual identifiers of search results or geographical locations that the mapping service has determined are responsive to the search queries can be successively layered on a map for display to the user.
- the user can interact with user interface controls that accompany the display of the map in order to remove layers that correspond to specific queries. Also, the user can interact with user interface controls to modify interactions between the layers of the map.
- a user can submit a first query that identifies a particular shopping mall, a second query that requests driving directions from the user's house to his friend's house, a third query that requests the locations of gas stations, and a fourth query that requests the locations of bike shops.
- a map can be presented on a display of a computing device, where the map includes visual identifiers of information that is responsive to each of the search queries. For example, a blue icon can appear at a location of the mall, a green line can appear along a route from the user's house to his friend's house, purple icons can appear at locations of gas stations, and yellow icons can appear at locations of bike shops.
- Each visual representation of information for a particular search query can be conceptually understood to be a “layer” that is overlaid the map.
- the webpage that is displayed to the user can include, for each submitted search query, a graphical interface element for “turning on” and “turning off” the corresponding layer of information.
- the user can turn off the “bike shop” layer in order to view just the mall icon, the route line, and the gas station icons. The user can later turn the bike shop layer back on using the same or a different graphical interface element.
- a geographical context can be a specific location (e.g., geographical coordinates), range of locations (e.g., a series of locations that represents a route), or region (e.g., a region that is bounded by a city boundary).
- the geographical context can be determined based on user-supplied content of a query.
- a query that identifies a starting street address and an ending street address can be determined by a server system to identify a geographical context that is a route between the two addresses.
- a query that identifies a city name can be determined by the server system to identify a geographical context that is a region corresponding to the city, or a specific location at a downtown region of the city.
- a query that includes a name of a particular mall can be determined by a server system to identify a geographical context that is a location of the mall.
- Search queries from which a context can be determined can be referred to as unambiguous search results.
- search queries are considered unambiguous search results when a single context can be determined from the content of the search query. For example, a search query for a department store can not be considered unambiguous because the search can return the locations of multiple department stores.
- the determination of whether a search query is associated with a single context can be determined based on how many visual indicators are displayed or to be displayed on a map for the query. For example, a server system can determine that multiple geographical contexts can be associated with the search query “City of Burlington.” The server system, however, can determine that a single of the geographical contexts is relevant to a user of the computing device (e.g., based on a popularity of a particular city, a user history of viewing information about the city, a presently-viewed or based on a user-supplied disambiguation for the city).
- An indication of the single geographical context can be provided to the user's computing device, and a single visual indication of the geographical context can be displayed to the user.
- a single one of the geographical contexts may be provided for display to the user in response to the query.
- search results can not be associated with a particular geographical context. For example, there are many gas stations around the world, and thus a search query for “gas stations” can not identify a particular geographical context to which the query should apply. In other words, the server system can not determine a single gas station to which the user of the computing device is interested in. Such search queries can be referred to as “ambiguous” search queries. Thus, search results for the “gas station” query can be provided to the computing device based on a context that was not defined by the user input query “gas station.” The context can be a default context that is a “home” location of the user, or a current view of a map.
- a user can provide a series of search queries to a mapping service, where some of the queries are ambiguous search queries and some of the search queries are unambiguous search queries.
- the user can select graphical interface elements to further refine the context that is applied to ambiguous search queries. For example, the user can use the graphical interface elements to selectively apply geographical contexts from the unambiguous queries to the ambiguous queries.
- a user can provide focus to a search query layer that is unambiguous, and thus has a specific geographical context, so that ambiguous search results from other search query layers that are geographically near the context can be emphasized.
- the user can select a graphical interface element that corresponds to the driving route in order to cause the map to emphasize icons for gas stations and bike shops that are along the driving route.
- icons for gas stations and bike shops that are not near the driving route but are within the displayed region for the map can be removed from display, or can be displayed with a different shade, size, or style.
- the user can select a graphical interface element that corresponds to the mall search query in order to cause the map to emphasize icons for gas stations and bike shops that are located near the mall.
- the icons that were previously emphasized as being along the driving route can disappear or be deemphasized.
- the user can provide focus to a search query layer that is ambiguous and thus does not have a specific geographical context.
- Providing focus to the ambiguous search query layer can cause the map to emphasize icons for search results of the focused layer that are near a geographical context of other, unambiguous layers.
- a user can select a graphical interface element that corresponds to the bike shop query in order to provide focus to the bike shop query layer.
- the map can remove from display or deemphasize those icons that are for bike shop search results that are not near the mall or that are not along the driving route. Should the user “hide” one of the search query layers that is unambiguous (e.g., the “mall” layer), the mall icon can disappear and the icons for bike shops that are near the mall can disappear from display or be deemphasized.
- submission by a user of a new query can cause a visibility of one or more query layers for previously submitted queries to “turn off.” For example, if a user submits two ambiguous queries in a row, the visibility of the query layer for the first ambiguous query can automatically “turn off” in response to displaying a query layer for the second ambiguous query.
- the query layer for the ambiguous query can be displayed along with the query layer for the unambiguous query. Indeed, the unambiguous query can provide a geographical context for the ambiguous query.
- a query for “gas station” can follow a query for “pizza.”
- the search results that were displayed on the map for the “pizza” query can be removed from display on the map.
- the query “gas station” can follow a query for “111 8th ave nyc.”
- one or more graphical interface elements for the “111 8th ave nyc” query can remain on the map, because “111 8th ave nyc” can be determined to be an unambiguous query.
- a visibility of a first of two unambiguous queries can turn off in response to receipt of the second unambiguous query.
- all other query layers of a same type (i.e., unambiguous or ambiguous) of a most-recently received query are turned off in response to receiving the most-recently received query.
- an unambiguous layer can include user-defined content. For example, a user can submit user input that causes a layer of “favorited” pins to appear for display on the map. The user can have identified, on various map displays over the last few months, the user's favorite places by selecting “stars” on search results that the user likes. Thus, the user can display a layer of these favorited placed on the map. The favorited places can each supply a geographical context.
- a user can create a layer of user-defined places or regions, for example, by dropping pins on a map, placing user defined lines and shapes on a map, or modifying a driving directions route and saving the route.
- Each of the user-defined places or regions can supply a geographical context.
- the user can submit user input to render visible a layer of such user-defined places or regions so that the “Pizza” places that are near the user-defined places or regions are emphasized on the display or appear in distinction to “Pizza” places that are not near the user-defined places or regions.
- a query layer for an unambiguous query can influence a content of a query layer for another unambiguous query. Such an influence can occur when the second unambiguous query is associated with a geographical context, but can be modified.
- a first query layer can specify several blocks and closed streets in a city where a festival is taking place.
- a second query for driving directions can be submitted. The determined route for the driving directions can be modified based on the festival query layer (e.g., to either avoid the festival or route through the festival).
- a user can save query layers for various events and road closures, and can selectively apply the query layers to a driving route to see how the driving route is impacted by the events and road closures.
- FIGS. 1 - 4 An illustration of mechanisms for displaying layers of search results on a map is provided with reference to FIGS. 1 - 4 .
- user Susan is sitting in a coffee shop near Union Square, San Francisco. Susan is visiting San Francisco for the day and has her laptop in front of her on the table in order to figure out what to do with her day. Susan would like to visit two parks before the end of the day, Golden Gate Park and Bayview Park. A girl near Susan told Susan how to get to Golden Gate Park from Union Square, but did not know where Bayview Park was. Thus, Susan needs directions from Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park. Susan is also hungry, and would like to swing by a pizza place at sometime during the day.
- Susan knows that her fuel tank is almost empty and that she should stop at a gas station before driving north to visit a friend in Vancouver. Susan knows that she can accomplish all of these tasks with a single session of a web-based mapping service.
- An example illustration of Susan using her laptop computer to accomplish these tasks is hereafter provided with reference to FIGS. 1 - 4 .
- Susan uses her laptop to launch a web browser application program, and types in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a web-based mapping service.
- Susan's laptop sends a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request over the internet to a server system associated with the web-based mapping service.
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- the server system returns resources for displaying a web page for the mapping service.
- Susan selects a query input box on the displayed webpage, types in the query “Union Square, San Francisco, CA,” and selects a “Search Maps” graphical interface element.
- Susan's laptop sends an HTTP request with the search query to the server system.
- the server system ranks multiple search results, from among a datastore of search results that identify venues and geographical places, based on the query.
- a single search result identifying a plaza in San Francisco is determined by the server system to be responsive to Susan's query and is returned to Susan's laptop computer.
- the server can identify other search results that are responsive to Susan's query, but the particular search result that was returned to Susan's laptop can exceed a threshold of relevance or be associated with a significantly higher relevance score than other of the search results.
- the server system returns to Susan's laptop a set of resources for rendering the web page displayed in FIG. 1 .
- the resources can include information that identifies the single search result (along with a geographical location of the single search result), map tiles for displaying a portion of a map around the geographical location, and additional content for rendering the webpage.
- FIG. 1 is a screenshot of a mapping webpage provided in response to the query “Union Square.”
- the webpage displays, in a viewport portion 102 of the web browser, a map of San Francisco.
- a single pin 154 is displayed on the map of San Francisco at a geographical location of “Union Square.”
- the query input text box 106 displays the search query that Susan previously entered.
- a left pane 108 displays information that is associated with the single search result for the query “Union Square.”
- Susan would like to also know how to get from Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park. Thus, Susan selects the query input text box 106 , and types the query “Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park.” Susan selects the “Search Maps” interface element 110 , and the web browser navigates to the display that is provided in FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 2 is a screenshot of a mapping webpage that is provided in response to the query “Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park.”
- the pin for Union Square has remained on the map, but is supplemented by a line 252 that designates a route between a starting location pin 256 at Golden Gate Park and an ending location pin 258 at Bayview Park.
- the information on Union Square in the left pane 208 has been replaced with details on the route between the starting location pin 256 and the ending location pin 258 .
- the layers toolbar 218 includes, for each of the “Union Square” and “Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park” search queries, a user selectable checkbox 212 and text 214 identifying the search query. Also, a small graphical interface element 216 identifies a color of the graphical interface elements on the map that are associated with the “Union Square” query.
- the checkboxes allow Susan to identify which of the layers in the toolbar 218 are “visible” in the map viewport 202 . For example, if Susan de-selects the “Union Square” checkbox, the pin 254 that identifies the location of Union Square can disappear from the map. Should Susan re-select the checkbox, the pin 254 can reappear. Similarly, Susan can select the checkbox for the “driving directions” search query to toggle visibility of the line 252 and the pins 256 and 258 .
- Susan can select the text 214 for either of the “driving directions” and “Union Square” queries to set a “focus” of the mapping web page.
- the “driving directions” query layer has focus, as illustrated by the bold characteristics of the text in toolbar 218 .
- the left pane 208 displays information that is responsive to the “driving directions” query. If Susan selected the text for the “Union Square” query (changing the focus to the “Union Square” query layer), the content in the left pane 108 can change to the content that is displayed in the left pane of FIG. 1 .
- Susan would like to stop at a pizza place that is either around Union Square or along the drive from Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park.
- Susan enters the query “pizza” in the query input text box 206 and selects the search maps graphical interface element 210 .
- the web browser navigates to the display that is provided in FIG. 3 .
- FIG. 3 is a screenshot of a mapping webpage that is provided in response to the query “pizza.” Focus is provided to the query layer “pizza.”
- the pin 354 for Union Square has remained on the map along with the pins 356 and 358 and line 352 for the driving directions.
- Multiple additional graphical interface elements have appeared for display on map. For example, multiple pins (e.g., pins 360 a and 360 b ) represent locations that are associated with various search results that are responsive to the pizza query. Also multiple markers (e.g., markers 362 a and 362 b ) represent various pizza search results that are not scored as highly as the pizza search results that are identified with the pins.
- a set of graphical interface elements that represent the “pizza” query layer have been added to the layers toolbar 318 .
- the content in the left pane 308 has been replaced with content that identifies information for at least some of the “pizza” pins that have been added to the map 302 .
- the pins 360 on map 302 are grouped around the driving route 352 and the Union Square pin 354 , even though there are many other pizza place search results (as illustrated by the markers 362 ).
- the pins 360 emphasize those pizza search results that are relevant to the context of the other layers that are visible on the map 302 .
- the search query “pizza” is an ambiguous search query that is not itself associated with a single geographical context, and thus can borrow context from other layers. Accordingly, pizza search results that are geographically near the driving route or are geographically near Union Square can be weighted more heavily.
- the mapping service server system can assign a score to each of the search queries based on various factors.
- Example factors can include how often terms in the query appear in content that is stored for the search result, and how often users select a search result in response to entering the search query.
- the mapping service server system or Susan's laptop can weight the score for each of multiple search results that are associated with a present view of the map based on a distance between the search result and a geographical context of one or more other layers.
- a distance between a search results and a route may be a number that identifies a conceptual distance between a location associated with the search result and a closest of a continuum of locations in the route. The distance may be as the bird flies or based on navigable roadways or paths. Geographical contexts of different layers can weight search results differently based on how recent a particular layer had focus.
- those search results that are associated with scores that exceed a threshold, or that are included in a group of the highest scoring “N” search results can be displayed on the map 302 more prominently than the other search results (e.g., as the pins 360 ).
- the high-ranking search results are displayed exclusively (e.g., the markers 362 can not appear alongside the pins 360 for a layer).
- Susan can interact with the layers toolbar 318 to modify interactions between the layers of the map 302 . For example, if Susan de-selects the checkbox 364 for the “Union Square” layer, the pin 354 that identifies the location of Union Square can disappear from the map. Further, the Union Square geographical context can no longer be used to weight “pizza” search results. Thus, a score for each of the pizza search results 360 c - e that are clustered around the Union Square pin 354 can be reduced, and each of the search results 360 c - e can disappear from display in the map 302 , or be replaced by circular markers (e.g., a marker 362 ).
- circular markers e.g., a marker 362
- pizza search results that are close the route 352 can change from a marker 362 to a pin 360 as more pins can become “available” for placement by the route 352 .
- the content of the left pane 308 can similarly change to display content for each of a new set of highest ranking pins.
- the route 352 and the pins 356 and 358 can be removed from the map display.
- the pizza search results can no longer be weighted based on a distance from the route 352 , but can be evaluated based on a relevance to the geographical region displayed within the map viewport 302 .
- the geographical context for the pizza search results is no longer provided based on another search query layer, but is instead provided based on a view of the map.
- the display in FIG. 3 can change so that the pizza pins disperse across the map of San Francisco.
- the gas station query layer can receive focus upon submission of the query. Because the server system can be unable to determine a specific geographical context based on the query “gas station,” the context for placement of pins can be defined by other layers that are visible. Thus, the gas station pins can cluster around the driving route 352 and the Union Square pin 354 . Other gas stations that are not as geographically relevant to the driving route or to Union Square can appear as circular markers.
- each of the pizza markers and pins can provide a geographical context for the gas stations. For example, where a gas station is particularly close to a pizza place, the search result for the gas station can be scored more heavily and a pin can appear instead of a marker. In other examples, pizza markers do not provide a geographical context because the query “pizza” is an ambiguous query. In some examples, the pizza pins 360 are changed to small circular markers 362 in response to the gas station query (and focus being changed to the gas station query layer).
- Susan suddenly gets a call from a friend, whom is waiting for Susan at Golden Gate Park. Susan knows that she will upset her friend if she has pizza before she drives from Union Square to Golden Gate Park, or even if she stops for gas before getting to Golden Gate Park. Still, Susan will need to get food and gas on some point on the drive over to Bayview Park. Thus, Susan would like the mapping service webpage to display the pizza places and gas stations that are along the driving route from Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park. Accordingly, Susan selects the interface element 466 for providing focus to the driving directions query layer. In response, the display in FIG. 4 can be provided to Susan.
- FIG. 4 is a screenshot of a mapping webpage that is provided in response to the query “gas station,” and a user providing focus to the “driving directions” query layer.
- both the pizza and gas station search results that are geographically near the driving route are emphasized with pins.
- search results for multiple other layers that are associated with an ambiguous query can be re-scored to weight more prominently those search results that are near the geographical context of the focused layer.
- the left pane 408 can display content for a combination of pizza and gas station search results.
- the layers toolbar 418 has been populated with multiple search query layers that have their own context (e.g., the Union Square and driving directions layers), and multiple search query layers that do not have their own context (e.g., the gas station and pizza layers).
- Providing focus to a layer that does not have its own context can result in search results for the layer “spreading out” to cluster around the geographical context for those layers that have context and that are visible.
- Providing focus to a layer that has its own context can result in search results for layers that do not have their own context “grouping” around the geographical context for the focused layer.
- the addition and removal of graphical interface elements from the map are performed in response to a user selection of a graphical interface element in the layers toolbar, and without any user-input subsequent to the user selection of the graphical interface element in the layers toolbar.
- de-selection of the checkbox 368 e.g., by clicking with a mouse on the checkbox 368
- the computing device can remove from the display of the map 302 the route 352 and the pins 356 and 358 without user-input subsequent to de-selection of the checkbox 368 .
- the addition and removal of pins to a map in response to a user providing focus to a different query layer can be performed without additional user input beyond the user input to provide focus to the different query layer (e.g., by selection of text in the layers toolbar).
- FIG. 5 A is a chart illustrating example interactions between four search query layers.
- the chart describes interactions between layers for each of four search queries, for example, the “gas station,” “pizza,” “driving directions to Bayfield park,” and “Union Square” queries, as illustrated in FIG. 5 .
- the interactions are provided after a user has entered all four search query layers.
- Susan has provided focus to the gas station query layer, for example, by selecting the words “gas station” in the layers toolbar 418 .
- the gas station search results in the map 402 that are near graphical interface elements for other layers are emphasized. For example, gas stations that are along the driving route or that are near Union Square can be emphasized. As described above, gas stations that are near pizza places can optionally be emphasized.
- Susan can remove the visibility of both the driving directions query layer and the Union Square query layer by de-selecting the checkboxes 412 that accompany each layer.
- the search results that are emphasized in the map can be those search results that are highest scoring without regard to the driving directions or Union Square context.
- repeated user selection of the gas station search result layer e.g., repeated selection of the text “gas station” in the layers toolbar 418
- the map 402 can toggle between a non-context-specific display of gas stations (e.g., as if the driving directions and Union Square layers were not visible), and a context-specific display of gas stations (e.g., as when the driving directions and Union Square layers are visible).
- Susan has provided focus to the driving route layer, for example, by selecting the words “driving directions to Bayview Park” in the layers toolbar 418 .
- the search results in the map 402 that are emphasized are those search results that are near the graphical interface elements for the driving directions layer. For example, pizza places and gas stations that are along the driving route can be emphasized.
- Susan can remove the visibility of the gas station search query layer by selecting the respective checkbox 412 in the layers toolbar 418 .
- the pins and markers that represent gas station search results can be removed from the display of map 502 .
- FIG. 5 B illustrates another graphical scheme for the layers toolbar.
- the first graphical display 550 is displayed to a user instead of the buttons 490 that are illustrated in FIG. 4 .
- a user may click on the “Satellite” graphical interface element 551 in order to change the present view of the displayed geographical area from a map view to a satellite view.
- the “Satellite” graphical interface element may change to a “Maps” graphical interface element.
- Selection of the “Traffic” graphical interface element 552 causes the present view of the displayed geographical area to include indications of vehicle traffic.
- the user's computing system presents the second graphical display 560 in response to the user performing a mouse-over selection of any component of the first graphical display 550 .
- the second graphical display shows an “Earth” graphical interface element 556 which, when selected, causes the computing system to present a view of the displayed geographical area using an “Earth” virtual globe mapping display.
- the second graphical display 560 also includes a layers toolbar 553 section of the second graphical display 560 . In this illustration, the layers toolbar 553 shows that the user has previously entered a single search query for “Union Square, San Francisco, CA.”
- the user may subsequently enter multiple additional search queries, as described above with reference to FIGS. 1 - 4 .
- the third graphical display 570 shows the layers toolbar 553 after the user has entered such multiple additional search queries.
- Some of the layers in the layers toolbar 553 include an “x” graphical interface element 554 that, when selected, causes the computing system to remove the selected layer from the layers toolbar 553 and also remove from the displayed geographical area any associated graphical interface elements (e.g., any combination of pins, markers, and lines that are associated with the selected layer).
- check marks e.g., check mark 555 .
- a check mark indicates that the layer is presently being displayed on the map, while no check mark indicates that the layer is not presently being displayed on the map.
- a user can make a non-visible layer visible by selecting the region of the layers toolbar 553 that identifies the layer (e.g., the region of the layers toolbar 553 that lies includes the identifying text and lies within the horizontal lines that bound the identifying text).
- a user may provide focus to a layer by selecting an already visible layer an additional time.
- the fourth graphical display 580 identifies the “Gas Station” layer with bold text 554 .
- the “Gas Station” layer has focus.
- a user may switch focus to another layer by selecting the other layer (visible or non-visible). Accordingly, selecting a non-visible layer (e.g., with a mouse click or a finger tap) renders the layer visible and provides focus to the layer. Selecting a visible layer that does not have focus causes that layer to obtain focus. Selecting a visible layer that has focus an additional time renders the layer non-visible and removes focus from the layer. It is possible that no layers have focus.
- FIG. 6 illustrates a system for displaying layers of search results on a map.
- Mobile computing device 602 includes a web browser 604 that submits a search query 606 to a server system 608 .
- a local search engine 610 at the server system receives the query and returns a geographical context 620 and map tiles 618 that are responsive to the query.
- the web browser 604 submits a second search query 630 , and in response, receives search results 632 .
- a GUI generator 622 generates a display that includes a map view port 624 , a focus panel 626 , and a layer toolbar 628 .
- a layering system 634 is stored at the mobile computing device 602 , the server system 608 , or a combination of both.
- the map layering system 634 stores, for each of the search queries, information that is responsive to the search query in a layer storage 636 .
- the layering system 634 includes a search result filter 642 for selecting subsets of search results to display in the map viewport 624 based on one or more geographical contexts.
- an individual can use the mobile computing device 602 to access a mapping service.
- a user of the mobile computing device can use the web browser to visit a website for the mapping service.
- the website can provide the user with an option for submitting a search query to the server system by typing or speaking a search query into the mobile computing device 602 .
- the search query 606 can be transmitted over a network (e.g., the internet) to the server system.
- the search query 606 that is received by the server system 608 can be provided to a local search engine 610 .
- the local search engine can receive search queries and return information that is responsive to the search queries. For example, if the search query is determined by the local search engine to be for a geographical place, the local search engine can identify a geographical location for the place, and provide to the computing device 602 map tiles 618 for an area that includes the geographical place, along with an indication of the geographical place. If the search query is determined to be for directions between two places, the route determiner 614 can determine a route between the two places, and supply information identifying the route to the mobile computing device 602 .
- a context identifier 612 determines a geographical context that is associated with a search query.
- the server system has determined particular map tiles 618 and a geographical context 620 that are responsive to the search query 606 , and returns this information to the mobile computing device 602 .
- the context 620 and map tiles 618 can be included in a set of resources that are returned as responsive to the search query 606 .
- the GUI generator 622 can generate a display of a webpage based on the returned resources. For example, the GUI generator 622 can display the webpage illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- the displayed webpage can include a map view port 624 (e.g., the map viewport 102 ), and a focus panel 626 (e.g., the left pane 108 ).
- a user of the mobile computing device 602 can submit a second search query 630 , for example, using the query text input box 106 that is illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- the local search engine 610 can determine multiple search results that are responsive to the second search query.
- the second search query 630 may not include user-generated content that is sufficient for the context identifier 612 to identify a geographical context that is relevant to the query.
- the query can be associated with search results that are associated with venues from across a broad geographical region.
- the query 630 can be an “ambiguous” query (described earlier in this document). Accordingly, the search results 632 that are returned to the computing device 502 can be determined based on context that is associated with a present view of the map view port 624 region of the web browser.
- the computing device can place indicators for at least a portion of the received search results 632 on a region of the map that is being displayed in the map view port 624 . Additionally, because the map viewport 624 can display, on the map, visual indicators that correspond to more than one successive query, the GUI generator 622 can display a layer selector (e.g., the layer toolbar 218 ) that enables a user of the mobile computing device to modify which of multiple layers are displayed, and how the layers interact.
- a layer selector e.g., the layer toolbar 218
- a layering system 634 includes a layer storage 636 that includes information for each of multiple search query layers.
- the layer storage can include a geographical context 638 that was identified as responsive to the first search query 606 .
- the layer storage can include information identifying the search results 640 that were identified as responsive to the second search query 630 .
- the map viewport 624 can display a subset of the search results 640 that is determined based on the context 638 .
- a search result filter 642 can apply the context 638 to the set of search results 640 in order to select a subset of the search results that are relevant to the context 638 (e.g., the search results that are geographically near the context 638 ).
- the selected subset of search results can be emphasized in the map viewport 624 (e.g., appear differently than other search results of a same search query layer), or can appear exclusively in the map viewport 624 (e.g., appear as the only search results for the search query layer).
- the search results filter 642 can select the subset of search results based on distance of the search results from the context 538 .
- the search results that are within a predetermined distance of the context can be selected as the subset.
- the search results that are within a predetermined distance of the context can have their respective scores weighted more heavily.
- a weighting of each search result can be based on a distance from the context. For example, the farther away a search result is from the context, the less heavily it will be weighted (e.g., have its score proportionally modified).
- layers from successive search queries are added to the layer toolbar 628 (and the layer storage 636 ) until a mapping service browsing session is terminated.
- a mapping service browsing session can terminate when the user navigates to a website that is not hosted by the mapping service (e.g., by typing in a URL for the other website or by selecting a bookmark for the other website).
- a mapping service can also end when the user closes the web browser window.
- layers are stored in association with the user's user account, and may not be removed when the user closes the web browser or navigates to another website.
- the user can visit the mapping service website several weeks later and see a list of layers from previous search sessions.
- the user can be able to remove particular layers or select a “clear all” button to start a fresh browsing session.
- a user submits a particular query and is provided a display of a map that includes search results for the particular query.
- the particular query can be identified within a layers toolbar as one of multiple layers.
- the particular query may have been mistyped or included content that otherwise prompts the server system to propose a refined query.
- the proposed query can be displayed to the user in a same web browser screen that is displaying the map with the search results for the particular query.
- the search results on the map for the particular query can be removed from display and replaced with a display of search results for the refined query.
- the identification of the particular query within the layers toolbar can be removed, and an identification of the proposed query can appear in the layers toolbar.

- An example mechanism for receiving user-input includes keyboard 714 , which can be a full qwerty keyboard or a traditional keypad that includes keys for the digits ‘0-9’, ‘*’, and ‘#.’
- the keyboard 714 receives input when a user physically contacts or depresses a keyboard key.
- User manipulation of a trackball 716 or interaction with a trackpad enables the user to supply directional and rate of rotation information to the mobile computing device 710 (e.g., to manipulate a position of a cursor on the display device 712 ).
- the mobile computing device 710 can be able to determine a position of physical contact with the touchscreen display device 712 (e.g., a position of contact by a finger or a stylus).
- various “virtual” input mechanisms can be produced, where a user interacts with a graphical user interface element depicted on the touchscreen 712 by contacting the graphical user interface element.
- An example of a “virtual” input mechanism is a “software keyboard,” where a keyboard is displayed on the touchscreen and a user selects keys by pressing a region of the touchscreen 712 that corresponds to each key.

Abstract
Displaying geographic search results incudes receiving, from a server system and in response to a query related to the geographic area, a plurality of search results; providing a digital map of the geographic area via a user interface; displaying the plurality of search results as visual indicators at respective geographic locations on the digital map; and providing a user interface element which, when selected by a user, causes removal from the digital map a portion of the plurality of search results that is not relevant to a certain geographic context.
Description
- This specification relates to digital data processing, and more particularly to presenting search results with a geographic map.
- Individuals can use computers to access mapping websites over the internet. The mapping websites provide interactive maps for display on the individuals' computers. Individuals can move the maps, zoom-in on regions of the maps, and view traffic information on the maps. Further, users can submit search queries and, in response, view icons that are placed on the maps at locations of businesses that are responsive to the search queries.
- This document describes techniques, methods, systems, and mechanisms for displaying layers of search results on a map. In general, a user of a computing device can submit multiple search queries to a mapping service. In response to each of the queries, the mapping service can provide information to the computing device for displaying a layer of visual indicators, where the visual indicators can represent search results or geographical contexts. The multiple layers of visual indicators can be overlaid on a display of a map.
- A set of graphical user interface elements for manipulating the display of the layers can accompany the display of the map. For example, each particular layer can be associated with a first graphical interface element for toggling a visibility of the visual indicators for the particular layer. Additionally, each particular layer can be associated with a second graphical interface element that provides focus to the particular layer. A layer that has focus can interact with other layers differently than when the layer does not have focus.
- For example, providing focus to a layer that defines a geographical context can cause search results, from other layers, that are determined to be associated with the focused geographical context to appear emphasized in the display or alone as the only search results in the display. Providing focus to a layer that identifies search results can cause those search results from the focused layer that are associated with geographical contexts of other visible layers to appear emphasized or alone as the only search results in the display.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in one or more computer-readable storage devices storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processing devices, cause a computing system to perform operations. The operations include receiving, from a server system, information that is responsive to each of multiple distinct search queries, wherein the information for each of the search queries identifies a geographical context or includes search results. The operations include displaying, on a geographical map, one or more visual indications of the information for each of the search queries. The operations include displaying a user interface element for each of the search queries, wherein the user interface element for each of the search queries, when selected by a user, causes removal from the display of the one or more visual indications of the information for the search query that corresponds to the selected user interface element.

The information for the particular search query (i) identifies a geographical context, or (ii) includes search results, so as to cause the computing device to: display on a geographical map for each particular search query, one or more visual indications of the information for the particular search query, and display for each of at least two of the search queries, a user interface element that, when selected by a user, causes the computing device to remove the display of the one or more visual indications of the information that corresponds to the selected user interface element.
- In yet another aspect, the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a system for displaying search results on a map. The system includes a mobile device. The mobile device is configured to receive user input submitting multiple distinct search queries. The mobile device is configured to provide the search queries to a server system. The mobile device is configured to receive from the server system determined information that is responsive to each particular search query of the search queries. The information for the particular search query (i) identifies a geographical context, or (ii) includes of search results. The mobile device is configured to display on a geographical map for each particular search query, one or more visual indications of the information for the particular search query. The mobile device is configured to display for each of at least two of the search queries, a user interface element that, when selected by a user, causes the computing device to remove the display of the one or more visual indications of the information that corresponds to the selected user interface element. The mobile device is configured to provide a display of a map of each of the layers and graphical interface elements for toggling a display of each layer on or off, and for clustering search results around one or more geographical positions.
- The system includes a server system. The server system is configured to receive the search queries from the mobile device. The server system is configured to determine, for each particular search query of the search queries the information that is responsive to the particular search query. The determined information for the particular search query (i) identifies a geographical context, or (ii) includes search results. The server system is configured to provide to the computing device for each particular search query, the determined information.
- These and other implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features. Each particular search query may be input by a user using a keyboard. Each particular search query may be input by a user using a voice input device that includes a microphone. The computing device may receive from the server system an identification of a first geographical context that the server system has determined based on content in a first of the search queries. The first geographical context is a first route between a starting position and an ending position. The computing device may receive from the server system second search results that the server system has determined are responsive to a second of the queries. The computing device may display on the geographical map a visual indication of the first route between the first position and the second position, and visual indications of a portion of the second search results that have been determined to be geographically relevant to the first route. The computing device may display on the geographical map a visually different style of visual indications of a portion of the second search results that have not been determined to be geographically relevant to the first route.
- First user selection of a first user interface element that corresponds to the first search query may be received. In response to the first user selection, the visual indication of the first route may be removed from display. In response to the first user selection, visual indications of additional second search results that are not included in the portion of the second search results may be displayed. Second user selection of the first user interface element may be received. In response to the second-user selection, the visual indication of the first route may be re-displayed. In response to the second user selection, the visual indications of the additional second search results may be removed from display.
- The computing device may receive from the server system an identification of a first geographical context that the server system has determined based on content in a first of the queries. The computing device may receive from the server system an identification of a second geographical context that the server system has determined based on content in a second of the search queries. The computing device may receive from the server system third search results that the server system has determined are responsive to a third of the queries. The computing device may receive from the server system fourth search results that the server system has determined are responsive to a fourth of the queries.
- User selection of a first interface element that corresponds to the first query may be received. In response to the user selection of the first interface element, visual indications of a first portion of the third search results that have been determined to be geographically relevant to the first geographical context may be displayed on the map. In response to the user selection of the first interface element, visual indications of a first portion of the fourth search results that have been determined to be geographically relevant to the first geographical context may be displayed on the map.
- The first geographical context may not be identified based on content in the third search query or the fourth search query. User selection of a second interface element that corresponds to the second query may be received. In response to the user selection of the second interface element, visual indications of a second portion of the third search results that have been determined to be geographically relevant to the second geographical context may be displayed. In response to the user selection of the second interface element, visual indications of a second portion of the fourth search results that have been determined to be geographically relevant to the second geographical context may be displayed.
- The display of the visual indications of the first portion of the third search results and the display of the visual indications of the first portion of the fourth search results may be removed from the map an in response to the user selection of the second interface element. User selection of a third interface element that corresponds to the third query may be received. In response to the user selection of the third interface element, visual indications of a first portion of the third search results that have been determined to be geographically relevant to first geographical context may be displayed. In response to the user selection of the third interface element, visual indications of a second portion of the third search results that have been determined to be geographically relevant to the second geographical context may be displayed. A third portion of the third search results may not be displayed. The third portion of the third search results may not include any of the first portion or second portion of the third search results.
- The first geographical context may not be determined based on content in the third search query or the fourth search query. The third portion of the third search results may not be determined to be geographically relevant to the first geographical context and may not be determined to be geographically relevant to the second geographical context. User selection of a fourth interface element that corresponds to the fourth query may be received. In response to the user selection of the fourth interface element, visual indications of a first portion of the fourth search results that have been determined to be geographically relevant to the first geographical context may be displayed. In response to the user selection of the fourth interface element, visual indications of a second portion of the fourth search results that have been determined to be geographically relevant to the second geographical context may be displayed. A third portion of the fourth search results is not displayed.
- In response to the user selection of the fourth interface element, the visual indications of the first portion of the third search results and the visual indications of the second portion of the third search results may be removed from display. The visual indications that are displayed on the map in response to the user selection of the third interface element may be displayed without receipt of user-input at the computing device subsequent to the user selection of the third interface element. The visual indications that are displayed on the map in response to the user selection of the fourth interface element may be displayed without receipt of user-input at the computing device subsequent to the user selection of the fourth interface element.
- Particular embodiments can be implemented, in certain instances, to realize one or more of the following advantages. A user can view multiple layers of search results in a single display of a map. The display of search results and visual indicators of geographical context can be toggled on and off. Applying multiple contexts to a set of search results can allow comparisons between the search results that are emphasized for each context. Applying multiple sets of search results to a single context can allow comparisons between the sets of search results that are emphasized for the single context.
- The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

- This document generally describes displaying layers of search results on a map. A user of an internet web mapping service can submit to the web mapping service a series of queries that include content related to various geographic locations, business, and services. Visual identifiers of search results or geographical locations that the mapping service has determined are responsive to the search queries can be successively layered on a map for display to the user. The user can interact with user interface controls that accompany the display of the map in order to remove layers that correspond to specific queries. Also, the user can interact with user interface controls to modify interactions between the layers of the map.
- For example, a user can submit a first query that identifies a particular shopping mall, a second query that requests driving directions from the user's house to his friend's house, a third query that requests the locations of gas stations, and a fourth query that requests the locations of bike shops. In response to submitting the queries, a map can be presented on a display of a computing device, where the map includes visual identifiers of information that is responsive to each of the search queries. For example, a blue icon can appear at a location of the mall, a green line can appear along a route from the user's house to his friend's house, purple icons can appear at locations of gas stations, and yellow icons can appear at locations of bike shops.
- Each visual representation of information for a particular search query can be conceptually understood to be a “layer” that is overlaid the map. The webpage that is displayed to the user can include, for each submitted search query, a graphical interface element for “turning on” and “turning off” the corresponding layer of information. For example, the user can turn off the “bike shop” layer in order to view just the mall icon, the route line, and the gas station icons. The user can later turn the bike shop layer back on using the same or a different graphical interface element.
- Some of the search queries can allow a determination of a geographical context. A geographical context can be a specific location (e.g., geographical coordinates), range of locations (e.g., a series of locations that represents a route), or region (e.g., a region that is bounded by a city boundary). The geographical context can be determined based on user-supplied content of a query.
- For example, a query that identifies a starting street address and an ending street address can be determined by a server system to identify a geographical context that is a route between the two addresses. A query that identifies a city name can be determined by the server system to identify a geographical context that is a region corresponding to the city, or a specific location at a downtown region of the city. A query that includes a name of a particular mall can be determined by a server system to identify a geographical context that is a location of the mall.
- Search queries from which a context can be determined can be referred to as unambiguous search results. In some examples, search queries are considered unambiguous search results when a single context can be determined from the content of the search query. For example, a search query for a department store can not be considered unambiguous because the search can return the locations of multiple department stores.
- The determination of whether a search query is associated with a single context can be determined based on how many visual indicators are displayed or to be displayed on a map for the query. For example, a server system can determine that multiple geographical contexts can be associated with the search query “City of Burlington.” The server system, however, can determine that a single of the geographical contexts is relevant to a user of the computing device (e.g., based on a popularity of a particular city, a user history of viewing information about the city, a presently-viewed or based on a user-supplied disambiguation for the city).
- An indication of the single geographical context can be provided to the user's computing device, and a single visual indication of the geographical context can be displayed to the user. Thus, even though multiple geographical contexts can be determined to be associated with a search query, a single one of the geographical contexts may be provided for display to the user in response to the query.
- On the other hand, some search results can not be associated with a particular geographical context. For example, there are many gas stations around the world, and thus a search query for “gas stations” can not identify a particular geographical context to which the query should apply. In other words, the server system can not determine a single gas station to which the user of the computing device is interested in. Such search queries can be referred to as “ambiguous” search queries. Thus, search results for the “gas station” query can be provided to the computing device based on a context that was not defined by the user input query “gas station.” The context can be a default context that is a “home” location of the user, or a current view of a map.
- A user can provide a series of search queries to a mapping service, where some of the queries are ambiguous search queries and some of the search queries are unambiguous search queries. The user can select graphical interface elements to further refine the context that is applied to ambiguous search queries. For example, the user can use the graphical interface elements to selectively apply geographical contexts from the unambiguous queries to the ambiguous queries.
- A user can provide focus to a search query layer that is unambiguous, and thus has a specific geographical context, so that ambiguous search results from other search query layers that are geographically near the context can be emphasized. Referencing the above example, the user can select a graphical interface element that corresponds to the driving route in order to cause the map to emphasize icons for gas stations and bike shops that are along the driving route. In response to selection of the graphical interface element, icons for gas stations and bike shops that are not near the driving route but are within the displayed region for the map can be removed from display, or can be displayed with a different shade, size, or style. Similarly, the user can select a graphical interface element that corresponds to the mall search query in order to cause the map to emphasize icons for gas stations and bike shops that are located near the mall. The icons that were previously emphasized as being along the driving route can disappear or be deemphasized.
- In another example, the user can provide focus to a search query layer that is ambiguous and thus does not have a specific geographical context. Providing focus to the ambiguous search query layer can cause the map to emphasize icons for search results of the focused layer that are near a geographical context of other, unambiguous layers. For example, a user can select a graphical interface element that corresponds to the bike shop query in order to provide focus to the bike shop query layer. In response, the map can remove from display or deemphasize those icons that are for bike shop search results that are not near the mall or that are not along the driving route. Should the user “hide” one of the search query layers that is unambiguous (e.g., the “mall” layer), the mall icon can disappear and the icons for bike shops that are near the mall can disappear from display or be deemphasized.
- In various examples, submission by a user of a new query, and thus addition of a new query layer to the map, can cause a visibility of one or more query layers for previously submitted queries to “turn off.” For example, if a user submits two ambiguous queries in a row, the visibility of the query layer for the first ambiguous query can automatically “turn off” in response to displaying a query layer for the second ambiguous query. On the other hand, if an ambiguous query is submitted after an unambiguous query, the query layer for the ambiguous query can be displayed along with the query layer for the unambiguous query. Indeed, the unambiguous query can provide a geographical context for the ambiguous query.
- As an illustration, a query for “gas station” can follow a query for “pizza.” In response to submission of the “gas station” query, the search results that were displayed on the map for the “pizza” query can be removed from display on the map. On the other hand, the query “gas station” can follow a query for “111 8th ave nyc.” In response to submission of the “gas station” query, one or more graphical interface elements for the “111 8th ave nyc” query can remain on the map, because “111 8th ave nyc” can be determined to be an unambiguous query. In various examples, a visibility of a first of two unambiguous queries can turn off in response to receipt of the second unambiguous query. In various examples, all other query layers of a same type (i.e., unambiguous or ambiguous) of a most-recently received query are turned off in response to receiving the most-recently received query.
- In various examples, an unambiguous layer can include user-defined content. For example, a user can submit user input that causes a layer of “favorited” pins to appear for display on the map. The user can have identified, on various map displays over the last few months, the user's favorite places by selecting “stars” on search results that the user likes. Thus, the user can display a layer of these favorited placed on the map. The favorited places can each supply a geographical context.
- Similarly, a user can create a layer of user-defined places or regions, for example, by dropping pins on a map, placing user defined lines and shapes on a map, or modifying a driving directions route and saving the route. Each of the user-defined places or regions can supply a geographical context. Thus, when a user has entered a search query for an unambiguous query (e.g., “Pizza”), the user can submit user input to render visible a layer of such user-defined places or regions so that the “Pizza” places that are near the user-defined places or regions are emphasized on the display or appear in distinction to “Pizza” places that are not near the user-defined places or regions.
- In various examples, a query layer for an unambiguous query can influence a content of a query layer for another unambiguous query. Such an influence can occur when the second unambiguous query is associated with a geographical context, but can be modified. For example, a first query layer can specify several blocks and closed streets in a city where a festival is taking place. A second query for driving directions can be submitted. The determined route for the driving directions can be modified based on the festival query layer (e.g., to either avoid the festival or route through the festival). Thus, a user can save query layers for various events and road closures, and can selectively apply the query layers to a driving route to see how the driving route is impacted by the events and road closures.
- An illustration of mechanisms for displaying layers of search results on a map is provided with reference to
FIGS. 1-4 . Suppose that user Susan is sitting in a coffee shop near Union Square, San Francisco. Susan is visiting San Francisco for the day and has her laptop in front of her on the table in order to figure out what to do with her day. Susan would like to visit two parks before the end of the day, Golden Gate Park and Bayview Park. A girl near Susan told Susan how to get to Golden Gate Park from Union Square, but did not know where Bayview Park was. Thus, Susan needs directions from Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park. Susan is also hungry, and would like to swing by a pizza place at sometime during the day. Also, Susan knows that her fuel tank is almost empty and that she should stop at a gas station before driving north to visit a friend in Vancouver. Susan knows that she can accomplish all of these tasks with a single session of a web-based mapping service. An example illustration of Susan using her laptop computer to accomplish these tasks is hereafter provided with reference toFIGS. 1-4 . - Susan uses her laptop to launch a web browser application program, and types in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a web-based mapping service. Susan's laptop sends a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request over the internet to a server system associated with the web-based mapping service. The server system returns resources for displaying a web page for the mapping service.
- Susan selects a query input box on the displayed webpage, types in the query “Union Square, San Francisco, CA,” and selects a “Search Maps” graphical interface element. Susan's laptop sends an HTTP request with the search query to the server system. The server system ranks multiple search results, from among a datastore of search results that identify venues and geographical places, based on the query. A single search result identifying a plaza in San Francisco is determined by the server system to be responsive to Susan's query and is returned to Susan's laptop computer. The server can identify other search results that are responsive to Susan's query, but the particular search result that was returned to Susan's laptop can exceed a threshold of relevance or be associated with a significantly higher relevance score than other of the search results.
- The server system returns to Susan's laptop a set of resources for rendering the web page displayed in
FIG. 1 . The resources can include information that identifies the single search result (along with a geographical location of the single search result), map tiles for displaying a portion of a map around the geographical location, and additional content for rendering the webpage. -
FIG. 1 is a screenshot of a mapping webpage provided in response to the query “Union Square.” The webpage displays, in aviewport portion 102 of the web browser, a map of San Francisco. Asingle pin 154 is displayed on the map of San Francisco at a geographical location of “Union Square.” The queryinput text box 106 displays the search query that Susan previously entered. Aleft pane 108 displays information that is associated with the single search result for the query “Union Square.” - Susan would like to also know how to get from Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park. Thus, Susan selects the query
input text box 106, and types the query “Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park.” Susan selects the “Search Maps”interface element 110, and the web browser navigates to the display that is provided inFIG. 2 . -
FIG. 2 is a screenshot of a mapping webpage that is provided in response to the query “Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park.” AsFIG. 2 illustrates, the pin for Union Square has remained on the map, but is supplemented by aline 252 that designates a route between a startinglocation pin 256 at Golden Gate Park and an endinglocation pin 258 at Bayview Park. The information on Union Square in the left pane 208 has been replaced with details on the route between the startinglocation pin 256 and the endinglocation pin 258. - Additionally, at a bottom of the left pane 208 is a
layers toolbar 218. Thelayers toolbar 218 includes, for each of the “Union Square” and “Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park” search queries, auser selectable checkbox 212 andtext 214 identifying the search query. Also, a smallgraphical interface element 216 identifies a color of the graphical interface elements on the map that are associated with the “Union Square” query. - The checkboxes allow Susan to identify which of the layers in the
toolbar 218 are “visible” in themap viewport 202. For example, if Susan de-selects the “Union Square” checkbox, thepin 254 that identifies the location of Union Square can disappear from the map. Should Susan re-select the checkbox, thepin 254 can reappear. Similarly, Susan can select the checkbox for the “driving directions” search query to toggle visibility of theline 252 and thepins - Further, Susan can select the
text 214 for either of the “driving directions” and “Union Square” queries to set a “focus” of the mapping web page. In this example, the “driving directions” query layer has focus, as illustrated by the bold characteristics of the text intoolbar 218. Thus, the left pane 208 displays information that is responsive to the “driving directions” query. If Susan selected the text for the “Union Square” query (changing the focus to the “Union Square” query layer), the content in theleft pane 108 can change to the content that is displayed in the left pane ofFIG. 1 . - Susan would like to stop at a pizza place that is either around Union Square or along the drive from Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park. Thus, Susan enters the query “pizza” in the query
input text box 206 and selects the search mapsgraphical interface element 210. In response, the web browser navigates to the display that is provided inFIG. 3 . -
FIG. 3 is a screenshot of a mapping webpage that is provided in response to the query “pizza.” Focus is provided to the query layer “pizza.” Thepin 354 for Union Square has remained on the map along with thepins line 352 for the driving directions. Multiple additional graphical interface elements have appeared for display on map. For example, multiple pins (e.g., pins 360 a and 360 b) represent locations that are associated with various search results that are responsive to the pizza query. Also multiple markers (e.g.,markers 362 a and 362 b) represent various pizza search results that are not scored as highly as the pizza search results that are identified with the pins. A set of graphical interface elements that represent the “pizza” query layer have been added to thelayers toolbar 318. The content in theleft pane 308 has been replaced with content that identifies information for at least some of the “pizza” pins that have been added to themap 302. - As illustrated in
FIG. 3 , thepins 360 onmap 302 are grouped around the drivingroute 352 and theUnion Square pin 354, even though there are many other pizza place search results (as illustrated by the markers 362). Thepins 360 emphasize those pizza search results that are relevant to the context of the other layers that are visible on themap 302. In other words, the search query “pizza” is an ambiguous search query that is not itself associated with a single geographical context, and thus can borrow context from other layers. Accordingly, pizza search results that are geographically near the driving route or are geographically near Union Square can be weighted more heavily. - For example, the mapping service server system can assign a score to each of the search queries based on various factors. Example factors can include how often terms in the query appear in content that is stored for the search result, and how often users select a search result in response to entering the search query. The mapping service server system or Susan's laptop can weight the score for each of multiple search results that are associated with a present view of the map based on a distance between the search result and a geographical context of one or more other layers. For example, a distance between a search results and a route may be a number that identifies a conceptual distance between a location associated with the search result and a closest of a continuum of locations in the route. The distance may be as the bird flies or based on navigable roadways or paths. Geographical contexts of different layers can weight search results differently based on how recent a particular layer had focus.
- After the scores for each of the search results have been weighted, those search results that are associated with scores that exceed a threshold, or that are included in a group of the highest scoring “N” search results can be displayed on the
map 302 more prominently than the other search results (e.g., as the pins 360). In some examples, the high-ranking search results are displayed exclusively (e.g., the markers 362 can not appear alongside thepins 360 for a layer). - Susan can interact with the
layers toolbar 318 to modify interactions between the layers of themap 302. For example, if Susan de-selects thecheckbox 364 for the “Union Square” layer, thepin 354 that identifies the location of Union Square can disappear from the map. Further, the Union Square geographical context can no longer be used to weight “pizza” search results. Thus, a score for each of the pizza search results 360 c-e that are clustered around theUnion Square pin 354 can be reduced, and each of the search results 360 c-e can disappear from display in themap 302, or be replaced by circular markers (e.g., a marker 362). Further, pizza search results that are close theroute 352 can change from a marker 362 to apin 360 as more pins can become “available” for placement by theroute 352. The content of theleft pane 308 can similarly change to display content for each of a new set of highest ranking pins. - Should Susan further deselect the
checkbox 368 for the driving directions layer (so that no query layers with a context are visible), theroute 352 and thepins route 352, but can be evaluated based on a relevance to the geographical region displayed within themap viewport 302. Thus, the geographical context for the pizza search results is no longer provided based on another search query layer, but is instead provided based on a view of the map. Thus, the display inFIG. 3 can change so that the pizza pins disperse across the map of San Francisco. - Susan also needs to get gas at some point during the day, and thus types the query “gas station” into the search
query text box 306 and selects the search mapsgraphical interface element 310. In response, a set of pins and markers for gas stations are overlaid on the map that is depicted inFIG. 3 . (This view of the browser is not provided in a figure.) The gas station query layer can receive focus upon submission of the query. Because the server system can be unable to determine a specific geographical context based on the query “gas station,” the context for placement of pins can be defined by other layers that are visible. Thus, the gas station pins can cluster around the drivingroute 352 and theUnion Square pin 354. Other gas stations that are not as geographically relevant to the driving route or to Union Square can appear as circular markers. - In some examples, each of the pizza markers and pins can provide a geographical context for the gas stations. For example, where a gas station is particularly close to a pizza place, the search result for the gas station can be scored more heavily and a pin can appear instead of a marker. In other examples, pizza markers do not provide a geographical context because the query “pizza” is an ambiguous query. In some examples, the pizza pins 360 are changed to small circular markers 362 in response to the gas station query (and focus being changed to the gas station query layer).
- Susan suddenly gets a call from a friend, whom is waiting for Susan at Golden Gate Park. Susan knows that she will upset her friend if she has pizza before she drives from Union Square to Golden Gate Park, or even if she stops for gas before getting to Golden Gate Park. Still, Susan will need to get food and gas on some point on the drive over to Bayview Park. Thus, Susan would like the mapping service webpage to display the pizza places and gas stations that are along the driving route from Golden Gate Park to Bayview Park. Accordingly, Susan selects the
interface element 466 for providing focus to the driving directions query layer. In response, the display inFIG. 4 can be provided to Susan. -
FIG. 4 is a screenshot of a mapping webpage that is provided in response to the query “gas station,” and a user providing focus to the “driving directions” query layer. As illustrated inFIG. 4 , both the pizza and gas station search results that are geographically near the driving route are emphasized with pins. In other words, when a query layer that is associated with an unambiguous query (e.g., a query from which a geographical context can be determined) has focus, search results for multiple other layers that are associated with an ambiguous query can be re-scored to weight more prominently those search results that are near the geographical context of the focused layer. Further, theleft pane 408 can display content for a combination of pizza and gas station search results. - In summary, the
layers toolbar 418 has been populated with multiple search query layers that have their own context (e.g., the Union Square and driving directions layers), and multiple search query layers that do not have their own context (e.g., the gas station and pizza layers). Providing focus to a layer that does not have its own context can result in search results for the layer “spreading out” to cluster around the geographical context for those layers that have context and that are visible. Providing focus to a layer that has its own context can result in search results for layers that do not have their own context “grouping” around the geographical context for the focused layer. - In various examples, the addition and removal of graphical interface elements from the map are performed in response to a user selection of a graphical interface element in the layers toolbar, and without any user-input subsequent to the user selection of the graphical interface element in the layers toolbar. For example, de-selection of the checkbox 368 (e.g., by clicking with a mouse on the checkbox 368) for the driving direction query layer in
FIG. 3 can cause the computing device to remove from the display of themap 302 theroute 352 and thepins checkbox 368. Similarly, the addition and removal of pins to a map in response to a user providing focus to a different query layer can be performed without additional user input beyond the user input to provide focus to the different query layer (e.g., by selection of text in the layers toolbar). -
FIG. 5A is a chart illustrating example interactions between four search query layers. The chart describes interactions between layers for each of four search queries, for example, the “gas station,” “pizza,” “driving directions to Bayfield park,” and “Union Square” queries, as illustrated inFIG. 5 . The interactions are provided after a user has entered all four search query layers. - In
box 502, Susan has provided focus to the gas station query layer, for example, by selecting the words “gas station” in thelayers toolbar 418. In response, the gas station search results in themap 402 that are near graphical interface elements for other layers are emphasized. For example, gas stations that are along the driving route or that are near Union Square can be emphasized. As described above, gas stations that are near pizza places can optionally be emphasized. - In various examples, Susan can remove the visibility of both the driving directions query layer and the Union Square query layer by de-selecting the
checkboxes 412 that accompany each layer. In response, the search results that are emphasized in the map can be those search results that are highest scoring without regard to the driving directions or Union Square context. In various examples, repeated user selection of the gas station search result layer (e.g., repeated selection of the text “gas station” in the layers toolbar 418) can cause themap 402 to toggle between a non-context-specific display of gas stations (e.g., as if the driving directions and Union Square layers were not visible), and a context-specific display of gas stations (e.g., as when the driving directions and Union Square layers are visible). - In
box 504, Susan has provided focus to the pizza query layer. In response, the pizza search results that are near the driving route and that are near Union Square can be emphasized, similar to the above described example for the gas station layer. - In
box 506, Susan has provided focus to the driving route layer, for example, by selecting the words “driving directions to Bayview Park” in thelayers toolbar 418. In response, the search results in themap 402 that are emphasized are those search results that are near the graphical interface elements for the driving directions layer. For example, pizza places and gas stations that are along the driving route can be emphasized. - In various examples, Susan can remove the visibility of the gas station search query layer by selecting the
respective checkbox 412 in thelayers toolbar 418. In response, the pins and markers that represent gas station search results can be removed from the display ofmap 502. - In
box 508, Susan has provided focus to the Union Square query layer. In response, the gas station and pizza search results that are near theUnion Square pin 454 can be emphasized, similar to the above described example for the driving route layer. -
FIG. 5B illustrates another graphical scheme for the layers toolbar. In this graphical scheme, the firstgraphical display 550 is displayed to a user instead of thebuttons 490 that are illustrated inFIG. 4 . A user may click on the “Satellite”graphical interface element 551 in order to change the present view of the displayed geographical area from a map view to a satellite view. In further response to such a selection, the “Satellite” graphical interface element may change to a “Maps” graphical interface element. Selection of the “Traffic”graphical interface element 552 causes the present view of the displayed geographical area to include indications of vehicle traffic. - The user's computing system presents the second
graphical display 560 in response to the user performing a mouse-over selection of any component of the firstgraphical display 550. The second graphical display shows an “Earth”graphical interface element 556 which, when selected, causes the computing system to present a view of the displayed geographical area using an “Earth” virtual globe mapping display. The secondgraphical display 560 also includes alayers toolbar 553 section of the secondgraphical display 560. In this illustration, thelayers toolbar 553 shows that the user has previously entered a single search query for “Union Square, San Francisco, CA.” - The user may subsequently enter multiple additional search queries, as described above with reference to
FIGS. 1-4 . The thirdgraphical display 570 shows thelayers toolbar 553 after the user has entered such multiple additional search queries. Some of the layers in thelayers toolbar 553 include an “x”graphical interface element 554 that, when selected, causes the computing system to remove the selected layer from thelayers toolbar 553 and also remove from the displayed geographical area any associated graphical interface elements (e.g., any combination of pins, markers, and lines that are associated with the selected layer). - The visibility of layers (as discussed above) is identified by check marks (e.g., check mark 555). A check mark indicates that the layer is presently being displayed on the map, while no check mark indicates that the layer is not presently being displayed on the map. A user can make a non-visible layer visible by selecting the region of the
layers toolbar 553 that identifies the layer (e.g., the region of thelayers toolbar 553 that lies includes the identifying text and lies within the horizontal lines that bound the identifying text). - A user may provide focus to a layer by selecting an already visible layer an additional time. For example, the fourth
graphical display 580 identifies the “Gas Station” layer withbold text 554. As such, the “Gas Station” layer has focus. A user may switch focus to another layer by selecting the other layer (visible or non-visible). Accordingly, selecting a non-visible layer (e.g., with a mouse click or a finger tap) renders the layer visible and provides focus to the layer. Selecting a visible layer that does not have focus causes that layer to obtain focus. Selecting a visible layer that has focus an additional time renders the layer non-visible and removes focus from the layer. It is possible that no layers have focus. -
FIG. 6 illustrates a system for displaying layers of search results on a map.Mobile computing device 602 includes aweb browser 604 that submits asearch query 606 to aserver system 608. Alocal search engine 610 at the server system receives the query and returns ageographical context 620 andmap tiles 618 that are responsive to the query. Theweb browser 604 submits asecond search query 630, and in response, receives search results 632. - A
GUI generator 622 generates a display that includes amap view port 624, afocus panel 626, and alayer toolbar 628. Alayering system 634 is stored at themobile computing device 602, theserver system 608, or a combination of both. Themap layering system 634 stores, for each of the search queries, information that is responsive to the search query in a layer storage 636. Thelayering system 634 includes asearch result filter 642 for selecting subsets of search results to display in themap viewport 624 based on one or more geographical contexts. - In more detail, an individual can use the
mobile computing device 602 to access a mapping service. For example, a user of the mobile computing device can use the web browser to visit a website for the mapping service. The website can provide the user with an option for submitting a search query to the server system by typing or speaking a search query into themobile computing device 602. Thesearch query 606 can be transmitted over a network (e.g., the internet) to the server system. - The
search query 606 that is received by theserver system 608 can be provided to alocal search engine 610. The local search engine can receive search queries and return information that is responsive to the search queries. For example, if the search query is determined by the local search engine to be for a geographical place, the local search engine can identify a geographical location for the place, and provide to thecomputing device 602map tiles 618 for an area that includes the geographical place, along with an indication of the geographical place. If the search query is determined to be for directions between two places, theroute determiner 614 can determine a route between the two places, and supply information identifying the route to themobile computing device 602. In some examples, acontext identifier 612 determines a geographical context that is associated with a search query. - In this example, the server system has determined
particular map tiles 618 and ageographical context 620 that are responsive to thesearch query 606, and returns this information to themobile computing device 602. Thecontext 620 andmap tiles 618 can be included in a set of resources that are returned as responsive to thesearch query 606. - The
GUI generator 622 can generate a display of a webpage based on the returned resources. For example, theGUI generator 622 can display the webpage illustrated inFIG. 1 . The displayed webpage can include a map view port 624 (e.g., the map viewport 102), and a focus panel 626 (e.g., the left pane 108). - A user of the
mobile computing device 602 can submit asecond search query 630, for example, using the querytext input box 106 that is illustrated inFIG. 1 . Thelocal search engine 610 can determine multiple search results that are responsive to the second search query. Thesecond search query 630 may not include user-generated content that is sufficient for thecontext identifier 612 to identify a geographical context that is relevant to the query. For example, the query can be associated with search results that are associated with venues from across a broad geographical region. - Thus, the
query 630 can be an “ambiguous” query (described earlier in this document). Accordingly, the search results 632 that are returned to thecomputing device 502 can be determined based on context that is associated with a present view of themap view port 624 region of the web browser. - The computing device can place indicators for at least a portion of the received
search results 632 on a region of the map that is being displayed in themap view port 624. Additionally, because themap viewport 624 can display, on the map, visual indicators that correspond to more than one successive query, theGUI generator 622 can display a layer selector (e.g., the layer toolbar 218) that enables a user of the mobile computing device to modify which of multiple layers are displayed, and how the layers interact. - A
layering system 634 includes a layer storage 636 that includes information for each of multiple search query layers. For example, the layer storage can include ageographical context 638 that was identified as responsive to thefirst search query 606. The layer storage can include information identifying the search results 640 that were identified as responsive to thesecond search query 630. - Based on user interaction with the
layer toolbar 628, themap viewport 624 can display a subset of the search results 640 that is determined based on thecontext 638. Thus, asearch result filter 642 can apply thecontext 638 to the set ofsearch results 640 in order to select a subset of the search results that are relevant to the context 638 (e.g., the search results that are geographically near the context 638). The selected subset of search results can be emphasized in the map viewport 624 (e.g., appear differently than other search results of a same search query layer), or can appear exclusively in the map viewport 624 (e.g., appear as the only search results for the search query layer). - The search results filter 642 can select the subset of search results based on distance of the search results from the context 538. In a first example, the search results that are within a predetermined distance of the context can be selected as the subset. In another example, the search results that are within a predetermined distance of the context can have their respective scores weighted more heavily. In yet another example, a weighting of each search result can be based on a distance from the context. For example, the farther away a search result is from the context, the less heavily it will be weighted (e.g., have its score proportionally modified).
- In various examples, layers from successive search queries are added to the layer toolbar 628 (and the layer storage 636) until a mapping service browsing session is terminated. A mapping service browsing session can terminate when the user navigates to a website that is not hosted by the mapping service (e.g., by typing in a URL for the other website or by selecting a bookmark for the other website). A mapping service can also end when the user closes the web browser window.
- In some examples, layers are stored in association with the user's user account, and may not be removed when the user closes the web browser or navigates to another website. Thus, the user can visit the mapping service website several weeks later and see a list of layers from previous search sessions. The user can be able to remove particular layers or select a “clear all” button to start a fresh browsing session.
- In various examples, a user submits a particular query and is provided a display of a map that includes search results for the particular query. The particular query can be identified within a layers toolbar as one of multiple layers. The particular query, however, may have been mistyped or included content that otherwise prompts the server system to propose a refined query. The proposed query can be displayed to the user in a same web browser screen that is displaying the map with the search results for the particular query.
- Should the user select the proposed query, the search results on the map for the particular query can be removed from display and replaced with a display of search results for the refined query. The identification of the particular query within the layers toolbar can be removed, and an identification of the proposed query can appear in the layers toolbar. Thus, if a user incorrectly types a query and later corrects his mistake, the incorrect query can be automatically removed from display in the layers toolbar and the map so that the toolbar and map display are not polluted by the incorrect query.
- Referring now to
FIG. 7 , a conceptual diagram of a system that can be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document is illustrated.Mobile computing device 710 can wirelessly communicate withbase station 740, which can provide the mobile computing device wireless access tonumerous services 760 through anetwork 750. - In this illustration, the
mobile computing device 710 is depicted as a handheld mobile telephone (e.g., a smartphone or an application telephone) that includes atouchscreen display device 712 for presenting content to a user of themobile computing device 710. Themobile computing device 710 includes various input devices (e.g.,keyboard 714 and touchscreen display device 712) for receiving user-input that influences the operation of themobile computing device 710. In further implementations, themobile computing device 710 can be a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a personal digital assistant, an embedded system (e.g., a car navigation system), a desktop computer, or a computerized workstation. - The
mobile computing device 710 can include various visual, auditory, and tactile user-output mechanisms. An example visual output mechanism isdisplay device 712, which can visually display video, graphics, images, and text that combine to provide a visible user interface. For example, thedisplay device 712 can be a 3.7 inch AMOLED screen. Other visual output mechanisms can include LED status lights (e.g., a light that blinks when a voicemail has been received). - An example tactile output mechanism is a small electric motor that is connected to an unbalanced weight to provide a vibrating alert (e.g., to vibrate in order to alert a user of an incoming telephone call or confirm user contact with the touchscreen 712). Further, the
mobile computing device 710 can include one ormore speakers 720 that convert an electrical signal into sound, for example, music, an audible alert, or voice of an individual in a telephone call. - An example mechanism for receiving user-input includes
keyboard 714, which can be a full qwerty keyboard or a traditional keypad that includes keys for the digits ‘0-9’, ‘*’, and ‘#.’ Thekeyboard 714 receives input when a user physically contacts or depresses a keyboard key. User manipulation of atrackball 716 or interaction with a trackpad enables the user to supply directional and rate of rotation information to the mobile computing device 710 (e.g., to manipulate a position of a cursor on the display device 712). - The
mobile computing device 710 can be able to determine a position of physical contact with the touchscreen display device 712 (e.g., a position of contact by a finger or a stylus). Using thetouchscreen 712, various “virtual” input mechanisms can be produced, where a user interacts with a graphical user interface element depicted on thetouchscreen 712 by contacting the graphical user interface element. An example of a “virtual” input mechanism is a “software keyboard,” where a keyboard is displayed on the touchscreen and a user selects keys by pressing a region of thetouchscreen 712 that corresponds to each key. - The
mobile computing device 710 can include mechanical or touch sensitive buttons 718 a-d. Additionally, the mobile computing device can include buttons for adjusting volume output by the one ormore speakers 720, and a button for turning the mobile computing device on or off. Amicrophone 722 allows themobile computing device 710 to convert audible sounds into an electrical signal that can be digitally encoded and stored in computer-readable memory, or transmitted to another computing device. Themobile computing device 710 can also include a digital compass, an accelerometer, proximity sensors, and ambient light sensors. - An operating system can provide an interface between the mobile computing device's hardware (e.g., the input/output mechanisms and a processor executing instructions retrieved from computer-readable medium) and software. The operating system can provide a platform for the execution of application programs that facilitate interaction between the computing device and a user.
- The
mobile computing device 710 can present a graphical user interface with thetouchscreen 712. A graphical user interface is a collection of one or more graphical interface elements and can be static (e.g., the display appears to remain the same over a period of time), or can be dynamic (e.g., the graphical user interface includes graphical interface elements that animate without user input). - A graphical interface element can be text, lines, shapes, images, or combinations thereof. For example, a graphical interface element can be an icon that is displayed on the desktop and the icon's associated text. In some examples, a graphical interface element is selectable with user-input. For example, a user can select a graphical interface element by pressing a region of the touchscreen that corresponds to a display of the graphical interface element. In some examples, the user can manipulate a trackball to highlight a single graphical interface element as having focus. User selection of a graphical interface element can invoke a pre-defined action by the mobile computing device. In some examples, selectable graphical interface elements further or alternatively correspond to a button on the keyboard 704. User selection of the button can invoke the pre-defined action.
- In some examples, the operating system provides a “desktop” user interface that is displayed upon turning on the
mobile computing device 710, activating themobile computing device 710 from a sleep state, upon “unlocking” themobile computing device 710, or upon receiving user selection of the “home”button 718 c. The desktop graphical interface can display several icons that, when selected with user-input, invoke corresponding application programs. An invoked application program can present a graphical interface that replaces the desktop graphical interface until the application program terminates or is hidden from view. - User-input can manipulate a sequence of
mobile computing device 710 operations. For example, a single-action user input (e.g., a single tap of the touchscreen, swipe across the touchscreen, contact with a button, or combination of these at a same time) can invoke an operation that changes a display of the user interface. Without the user-input, the user interface can not have changed at a particular time. For example, a multi-touch user input with thetouchscreen 712 can invoke a mapping application to “zoom-in” on a location, even though the mapping application can have by default zoomed-in after several seconds. - The desktop graphical interface can also display “widgets.” A widget is one or more graphical interface elements that are associated with an application program that has been executed, and that display on the desktop content controlled by the executing application program. A widget's application program can start with the mobile telephone. Further, a widget can not take focus of the full display. Instead, a widget can only “own” a small portion of the desktop, displaying content and receiving touchscreen user-input within the portion of the desktop.
- The
mobile computing device 710 can include one or more location-identification mechanisms. A location-identification mechanism can include a collection of hardware and software that provides the operating system and application programs an estimate of the mobile telephone's geographical position. A location-identification mechanism can employ satellite-based positioning techniques, base station transmitting antenna identification, multiple base station triangulation, internet access point IP location determinations, inferential identification of a user's position based on search engine queries, and user-supplied identification of location (e.g., by “checking in” to a location). - The
mobile computing device 710 can include other application modules and hardware. A call handling unit can receive an indication of an incoming telephone call and provide a user capabilities to answer the incoming telephone call. A media player can allow a user to listen to music or play movies that are stored in local memory of themobile computing device 710. Themobile telephone 710 can include a digital camera sensor, and corresponding image and video capture and editing software. An internet browser can enable the user to view content from a web page by typing in an addresses corresponding to the web page or selecting a link to the web page. - The
mobile computing device 710 can include an antenna to wirelessly communicate information with thebase station 740. Thebase station 740 can be one of many base stations in a collection of base stations (e.g., a mobile telephone cellular network) that enables themobile computing device 710 to maintain communication with anetwork 750 as the mobile computing device is geographically moved. Thecomputing device 710 can alternatively or additionally communicate with thenetwork 750 through a Wi-Fi router or a wired connection (e.g., Ethernet, USB, or FIREWIRE). Thecomputing device 710 can also wirelessly communicate with other computing devices using BLUETOOTH protocols, or can employ an ad-hoc wireless network. - A service provider that operates the network of base stations can connect the
mobile computing device 710 to thenetwork 750 to enable communication between themobile computing device 710 and other computerized devices that provideservices 760. Although theservices 760 can be provided over different networks (e.g., the service provider's internal network, the Public Switched Telephone Network, and the Internet),network 750 is illustrated as a single network. The service provider can operate aserver system 752 that routes information packets and voice data between themobile computing device 710 and computing devices associated with theservices 760. - The
network 750 can connect themobile computing device 710 to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 762 in order to establish voice or fax communication between themobile computing device 710 and another computing device. For example, the serviceprovider server system 752 can receive an indication from thePSTN 762 of an incoming call for themobile computing device 710. Conversely, themobile computing device 710 can send a communication to the serviceprovider server system 752 initiating a telephone call with a telephone number that is associated with a device accessible through thePSTN 762. - The
network 750 can connect themobile computing device 710 with a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)service 764 that routes voice communications over an IP network, as opposed to the PSTN. For example, a user of themobile computing device 710 can invoke a VoIP application and initiate a call using the program. The serviceprovider server system 752 can forward voice data from the call to a VoIP service, which can route the call over the internet to a corresponding computing device, potentially using the PSTN for a final leg of the connection. - An
application store 766 can provide a user of themobile computing device 710 the ability to browse a list of remotely stored application programs that the user can download over thenetwork 750 and install on themobile computing device 710. Theapplication store 766 can serve as a repository of applications developed by third-party application developers. An application program that is installed on themobile computing device 710 can be able to communicate over thenetwork 750 with server systems that are designated for the application program. For example, a VoIP application program can be downloaded from theApplication Store 766, enabling the user to communicate with theVoIP service 764. - The
mobile computing device 710 can access content on theinternet 768 throughnetwork 750. For example, a user of themobile computing device 710 can invoke a web browser application that requests data from remote computing devices that are accessible at designated universal resource locations. In various examples, some of theservices 760 are accessible over the internet. - The mobile computing device can communicate with a
personal computer 770. For example, thepersonal computer 770 can be the home computer for a user of themobile computing device 710. Thus, the user can be able to stream media from hispersonal computer 770. The user can also view the file structure of hispersonal computer 770, and transmit selected documents between the computerized devices. - A
voice recognition service 772 can receive voice communication data recorded with the mobile computing device'smicrophone 722, and translate the voice communication into corresponding textual data. In some examples, the translated text is provided to a search engine as a web query, and responsive search engine search results are transmitted to themobile computing device 710. - The
mobile computing device 710 can communicate with asocial network 774. The social network can include numerous members, some of which have agreed to be related as acquaintances. Application programs on themobile computing device 710 can access thesocial network 774 to retrieve information based on the acquaintances of the user of the mobile computing device. For example, an “address book” application program can retrieve telephone numbers for the user's acquaintances. In various examples, content can be delivered to themobile computing device 710 based on social network distances from the user to other members. For example, advertisement and news article content can be selected for the user based on a level of interaction with such content by members that are “close” to the user (e.g., members that are “friends” or “friends of friends”). - The
mobile computing device 710 can access a personal set ofcontacts 776 throughnetwork 750. Each contact can identify an individual and include information about that individual (e.g., a phone number, an email address, and a birthday). Because the set of contacts is hosted remotely to themobile computing device 710, the user can access and maintain thecontacts 776 across several devices as a common set of contacts. - The
mobile computing device 710 can access cloud-basedapplication programs 778. Cloud-computing provides application programs (e.g., a word processor or an email program) that are hosted remotely from themobile computing device 710, and can be accessed by thedevice 710 using a web browser or a dedicated program. Example cloud-based application programs include GOOGLE DOCS word processor and spreadsheet service, GOOGLE GMAIL webmail service, and PICASA picture manager. -
Mapping service 780 can provide themobile computing device 710 with street maps, route planning information, and satellite images. Themapping service 780 can also receive queries and return location-specific results. For example, themobile computing device 710 can send an estimated location of the mobile computing device and a user-entered query for “pizza places” to themapping service 780. Themapping service 780 can return a street map with “markers” superimposed on the map that identify geographical locations of nearby “pizza places.” - Turn-by-
turn service 782 can provide themobile computing device 710 with turn-by-turn directions to a user-supplied destination. For example, the turn-by-turn service 782 can stream to device 710 a street-level view of an estimated location of the device, along with data for providing audio commands and superimposing arrows that direct a user of thedevice 710 to the destination. - Various forms of streaming
media 784 can be requested by themobile computing device 710. For example,computing device 710 can request a stream for a pre-recorded video file, a live television program, or a live radio program. Example services that provide streaming media include YOUTUBE and PANDORA. - A
micro-blogging service 786 can receive from the mobile computing device 710 a user-input post that does not identify recipients of the post. Themicro-blogging service 786 can disseminate the post to other members of themicro-blogging service 786 that agreed to subscribe to the user. - A
search engine 788 can receive user-entered textual or verbal queries from themobile computing device 710, determine a set of internet-accessible documents that are responsive to the query, and provide to thedevice 710 information to display a list of search results for the responsive documents. In examples where a verbal query is received, thevoice recognition service 772 can translate the received audio into a textual query that is sent to the search engine. - These and other services can be implemented in a
server system 790. A server system can be a combination of hardware and software that provides a service or a set of services. For example, a set of physically separate and networked computerized devices can operate together as a logical server system unit to handle the operations necessary to offer a service to hundreds of individual computing devices. - In various implementations, operations that are performed “in response” to another operation (e.g., a determination or an identification) are not performed if the prior operation is unsuccessful (e.g., if the determination was not performed). Features in this document that are described with conditional language can describe implementations that are optional. In some examples, “transmitting” from a first device to a second device includes the first device placing data into a network, but can not include the second device receiving the data. Conversely, “receiving” from a first device can include receiving the data from a network, but can not include the first device transmitting the data.

FIG. 8 is a block diagram ofcomputing devices 800, 850 that can be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers. Computing device 800 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 850 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other similar computing devices. Additionally computingdevice 800 or 850 can include Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drives. The USB flash drives can store operating systems and other applications. The USB flash drives can include input/output components, such as a wireless transmitter or USB connector that can be inserted into a USB port of another computing device. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be exemplary only, and are not meant to limit implementations described and/or claimed in this document. - Computing device 800 includes a processor 802,
memory 804, astorage device 806, a high-speed interface 808 connecting tomemory 804 and high-speed expansion ports 810, and alow speed interface 812 connecting to low speed bus 814 andstorage device 806. Each of thecomponents memory 804 or on thestorage device 806 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 816 coupled tohigh speed interface 808. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses can be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also, multiple computing devices 800 can be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 804 stores information within the computing device 800. In one implementation, thememory 804 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 804 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. Thememory 804 can also be another form of computer-readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical disk. - The
storage device 806 is capable of providing mass storage for the computing device 800. In one implementation, thestorage device 806 can be or contain a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. A computer program product can be tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product can also contain instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 804, thestorage device 806, or memory on processor 802. - The
high speed controller 808 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 800, while thelow speed controller 812 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of functions is exemplary only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 808 is coupled tomemory 804, display 816 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 810, which can accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 812 is coupled tostorage device 806 and low-speed expansion port 814.
