Definitions
- the present invention relates to spread-spectrum communication systems, and more particularly to a multipath-combining subsystem and method for use with a spread-spectrum receiver which can receive a spread-spectrum signal arriving from a plurality of paths.
- multipath presents a problem in terms of synchronization and signal reliability.
- a spread-spectrum signal is transmitted from a transmitter and, as shown in FIG. 1, can be reflected from a number of surfaces, such as buildings, mountains, trees, trucks, etc.
- the multipath problem is more acute, due to the propagation characteristics of microwaves.
- a RAKE system can be used for selecting the strongest path in a multipath system. Such a system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,081,643.
- matched filters When using matched filters, a different problem arises. For each path of a multipath signal, a match of the chip sequence within the spread-spectrum signal may occur within the matched filter, producing an output. While the strongest output might be chosen, the subsequent outputs may have power levels close to the strongest output or at least sufficiently strong to cause false triggers and other problems.
- Multipath can be aggravated by the time varying nature of propagation characteristics due to motion of a vehicle, a receiver, a transmitter, and objects from which reflections may occur.
- the strong path may be locked onto at one point in time, the strong path may move in time to a different path due to the multipath environment.
- a general object of the invention is a subsystem and method for receiving a spread-spectrum signal arriving at different times from a plurality of paths.
- Another object of the invention is a subsystem and method which, in place of selecting the strongest signal, instead enhances reception of a multipath signal by combining power from the various paths.
- a multipath-combining subsystem and method for use with a spread-spectrum receiver for receiving a spread-spectrum signal is provided.
- the spread-spectrum signal is assumed to be arriving at different times, from a plurality of paths.
- the plurality of paths typically might be due to reflections of the spread-spectrum signal off of buildings, automobiles, and other objects which may be found in the environment.
- the spread-spectrum signal has a plurality of packets, with each packet having a header followed by a data portion.
- the header includes a header-chip-sequence signal.
- the data portion includes a data-symbol-sequence signal, with each data symbol of the data-symbol-sequence signal spread-spectrum processed by a data-chip-sequence signal.
- the multi path-combining subsystem includes matched-filter means, a header memory, and a combiner.
- the matched-filter means may be embodied as a header-matched filter in parallel with a data-matched filter, or alternatively, as a programmable-matched filter.
- the header-matched filter has a first impulse response matched to the header-chip-sequence signal
- the data-matched filter has a second impulse response matched to the data-chip-sequence signal.
- the programmable-matched filter initially has the first impulse response matched to the header-chip-sequence signal, and subsequently has the second impulse response matched to the data-chip-sequence signal.
- the following discussion uses, by way of example, the header-matched filter and data-matched filter.
- the programmable-matched filter can accomplish the same function as the header-matched filter and the data-matched filter, by having the impulse response of the programmable-matched filter change from the first impulse response to the second impulse response, thereby matching the header-chip-sequence signal and the data-chip-sequence signal, respectively.
- the header-matched filter detects, within a packet and for each path of the spread-spectrum signal, each match of the header-chip-sequence signal with the first impulse response. The detection is compared to a threshold, denoted herein as the header threshold, and when the header threshold is met, the header-matched filter outputs a header-detection signal.
- the header-detection signal has a header amplitude, and a respective chip location with respect to the header-chip-sequence signal.
- the time difference between the receipt of each path of the spread-spectrum signal is assumed to be greater than the time of each chip of the header-chip-sequence signal, and greater than the time of each chip of the data-chip-sequence signal.
- the header memory stores the header amplitude of each header-detection signal and the respective chip location of each header-detection signal.
- the data-matched filter detects, at each respective chip location of each header-detection signal for each path, each match of the data-chip-sequence signal with the second impulse response.
- the data-matched filter outputs, in response to each detected match, a data-detection signal.
- Each data-detection signal has a data amplitude.
- the combiner which typically includes a memory and adder gates, multiplies the header amplitude of each header-detection signal by the data amplitude of each data-detection signal, at each corresponding chip location, respectively.
- the multiplication generates a plurality of weighted elements for each data symbol.
- the combiner then adds the plurality of weighted elements for each data symbol to generate a sum signal.
- the sum signal typically is detected by a detector and outputted as data.

- the present invention provides a new and novel spread-spectrum multipath-combining subsystem and method which can be used as part of a spread-spectrum receiver on a received spread-spectrum signal.
- the received spread-spectrum signal in a preferred embodiment, is assumed to include a plurality of packets.
- Each packet illustratively shown in FIG. 2, has a header followed in time by a data portion.
- the header includes a header-chip-sequence signal.
- the header alternatively may be generated from spread-spectrum processing, by using techniques well known in the art, a header-symbol-sequence signal with a header-chip-sequence signal.
- the header-symbol-sequence signal is a predefined sequence of symbols.
- the header-symbol-sequence signal may be alternating 1-bits and 0-bits or alternating symbols, a pseudorandom sequence of symbols, or other predefined sequence of symbols as desired.
- the header-chip-sequence signal is user defined and, in a usual practice, is generated from a pseudorandom sequence of chips.
- the header includes only the header-chip-sequence signal, without spread-spectrum processing with a header-symbol-sequence signal.
- the header-chip-sequence signal has a large processing gain for improved header detection.
- the data portion of the spread-spectrum packet of FIG. 2 is generated similarly, from techniques well known in the art, by spread-spectrum processing a data-symbol signal or a data-symbol-sequence signal with the data-chip-sequence signal.
- a data-symbol signal includes a single data symbol, whereas a symbol-sequence signal includes a sequence of data symbols.
- the term “data-symbol-sequence signal” is used hereinafter to include both, a data-symbol signal and a data-symbol-sequence signal.
- the data-symbol-sequence signal may be derived from data, or an analog signal converted to data, signalling information, or other source of data symbols or bits.
- the data-chip-sequence signal can be user defined, and preferably is nearly orthogonal to other spread-spectrum channels using the chip-sequence signal, as is well known in the art.
- the data-chip-sequence signal typically is different from the header-chip-sequence signal, although they may be the same. In the preferred embodiment, the data-chip-sequence signal has a significantly smaller processing gain than the header-chip-sequence signal.
- header-chip-sequence signal and “data-chip-sequence signal” denote signals having a chip sequence, used for the header and data portion of the packet, respectively.
- header-symbol-sequence signal and “data-symbol-sequence signal” denote signals having a symbol sequence, used for the header and data portion of the packet, respectively.
- the received spread-spectrum signal is complex, i.e., it has in-phase and quadrature-phase components.
- the discussion herein refers to signals which are complex. Reference to the signals disclosed herein is assumed to refer to complex signals The invention alternatively may operate on only a real component or on an imaginary component of the complex signal.
- a multipath-combining subsystem for use with the spread-spectrum receiver for receiving a spread-spectrum signal.
- the spread-spectrum signal is assumed to be arriving at different times, from a plurality of paths.
- the spread-spectrum signal has a plurality of packets. The plurality of packets may arrive continuously, each packet may be separated in time from the other packets, or the plurality of packets may arrive as a combination of continuous and separated in time.
- the multipath-combining subsystem comprises matched-filter means, header-memory means, and combining means.
- the matched-filter means is coupled to the spread-spectrum receiver.
- the header-memory means is coupled to the matched-filter means.
- the combining means is coupled to the header-memory means and to the matched-filter means.
- the matched-filter means which can have means for filtering in-phase and quadrature-phase components, has a first impulse response matched to the header-chip-sequence signal of the header embedded in the spread-spectrum signal.
- the first impulse response is for detecting, within a packet and for each path of the spread-spectrum signal, each match of the header-chip-sequence signal with the first impulse response.
- the detection preferably includes matching the in-phase component and the quadrature-phase component of the header-chip-sequence signal with the first impulse response. To detect a match, the level of correspondence between the header-chip-sequence signal and the first impulse response must go above a threshold, denoted herein as the header threshold.
- the header threshold may be a specified voltage. In a digital the header threshold may be a specified number of chips that must correspond in order for a “match” to have occurred. Other well known threshold measurement embodiments may also be employed.
- the matched-filter means outputs a signal which is denoted as a header-detection signal.
- the header-detection signal has a header amplitude and a respective chip location with respect to the header-chip-sequence signal.
- the matched-filter means outputs, in response to each detected match of each occurrence of the header-chip-sequence signal within the packet with the first impulse response in the matched-filter means, a header detection signal having a header amplitude and a respective chip location of the header-detection signal.
- the gain requirement of the data-chip-sequence signal may be greatly reduced.
- the effect of this invention is analogous to coherent detection and integration of the spread-spectrum signal arriving from the plurality of paths.
- the header-chip sequence has 1024 chips, i.e., a processing gain of 30 dB
- the data-chip-sequence signal has 256 chips, i.e., a processing gain of 23 dB
- reliable data communications may be maintained.
- the header by its large processing gain, provides reliable timing.
- the reliability of the data can be increased by using error correction coding techniques with the data-symbol-sequence signal. This presents a major cost advantage as the data-matched filter is less expensive than the header-matched filter, since the data-matched filter requires fewer adders, gates, etc.
- the matched-filter means may produce a multiplicity of header-detection signals.
- the location of each header-detection signal corresponds to a chip location within the header-chip-sequence signal, relative to a first header-detection signal detected within the packet.
- chip location for relating the position of a header-detection signal detected later than the first header-detection signal within a packet, is by way of example.
- Other techniques for relating a position in time of a later detected header-detection signal from the first header-detection signal, such as a clock or timing signal are equivalent to the use of chip location, as used herein.
- the term “chip location” is used hereinafter with the understanding that this term includes other equivalent clock or timing signal techniques.
- the header-memory means which can include means for storing in-phase and quadrature-phase components of the header-detection signal, stores the amplitude of each header-detection signal, which may include the amplitude for the in-phase component and the amplitude for the quadrature-phase component, and the respective chip location, or position in time, of each header-detection signal.
- the matched-filter means also has a second impulse response matched to the data-chip-sequence signal of the data portion embedded in the spread-spectrum signal.
- the matched-filter means uses the second impulse response, detects, at each respective chip location, or time position, of each header-detection signal for each path, each match of the data-chip-sequence signal with the second impulse response. This preferably includes detecting the in-phase component and the quadrature-phase component of the data-chip-sequence signal with the second impulse response.
- each data symbol of the data-symbol-sequence signal within a packet there is a set of matches with the data-chip-sequence signal, preferably including the matching of the in-phase component and the quadrature-phase component of the data-chip-sequence signal, with the second impulse response.
- the location of each match within the set corresponds to the respective chip location of each header-detection signal for each path.
- a threshold requirement may be introduced but is not necessary.
- the time for detecting each match of the data-chip-sequence signal is limited to the time needed to check those chip locations.
- the chip locations of the header-detection signals of the header of the packet are used to identify detection periods. This targeting eliminates false alarms by eliminating the blanket review of all chic locations including chip locations or times that do not correspond to the timing of header-detection signal output.
- the matched-filter means outputs, in response to each detected match, a data-detection signal having a data amplitude and corresponding chip location.
- the data-detection signal for complex signals has an in-phase-data amplitude and a quadrature-phase-data amplitude.
- the data amplitude can have an in-phase component and a quadrature-phase component.
- the combining means which can include means for combining in-phase and quadrature-phase components, multiplies, for each packet, the header amplitude, including in-phase and quadrature-phase components, for a particular chip location or time position, of each header-detection signal, including in-phase and quadrature-phase components, respectively, by the data amplitude of each data-detection signal, including in-phase and quadrature-phase components, respectively, at each corresponding chip location or time position, respectively.
- the chip location or time position may serve as an index for matching the header amplitude of each header-detection signal with the data amplitude of each data-detection signal.
- the header amplitude serves a weighting function.
- a greater header amplitude increases the magnitude of the corresponding data-detection signal such that stronger signals are given greater weight than weaker signals, with the result being more accurate data detection.
- the combining means generates a plurality of weighted elements from the plurality of data-detection signals, for each data symbol of the data-symbol-sequence signal within the data portion of the packet.
- the combining means adds the plurality of weighted elements for each data symbol, to generate a sum signal of the respective data symbol.
- the combining means may further include product means, a combiner memory, and adding means.
- the product means multiplies the plurality of header amplitudes (in-phase and quadrature-phase components) of the plurality of header-detection signals by the plurality of data amplitudes (in-phase and quadrature-phase components, respectively) of the plurality of data-detection signals, respectively.
- the multiplication takes place at corresponding chip locations of the header-detection signals, respectively.

- the data-matched filter 43 is also coupled to the spread-spectrum receiver.

- a header-timing circuit 46 is coupled to the output of the header-matched filter 42 , through the header memory 44 .
- the combiner 75 is coupled to the header memory 44 and to the data-matched filter 43 .
- the header-matched filter 42 has a first impulse response matched to the header-chip-sequence signal of the header embedded in the spread-spectrum signal.
- the header-matched filter 42 detects within each packet, and for each path of the spread-spectrum signal, each match of the header-chip-sequence signal with the first impulse response.
- the “detection” requires that the match between the header-chip-sequence signal and the first impulse response have a level of correspondence above the header threshold. This “level of correspondence” may, in an analog context, be reflected by a specified voltage level or, in a digital context, may arise in response to a specified number of matching chips.
- the header-matched filter 42 When the header threshold has been met, the header-matched filter 42 outputs a header-detection signal.
- the header-detection signal has a header amplitude and a respective chip location.
- a time difference between receiving each path of the spread-spectrum signal is assumed to be greater than a time of each chip of the header-chip-sequence signal, and greater than a time of each chip of the data-chip-sequence signal.
- the header memory 44 stores the header amplitude and the respective chip location of each header-detection signal.
- the data-matched filter 43 detects, at each respective chip location of each header-detection signal for each path, each match of the data-chip-sequence signal with a second impulse response. When there is a match, the data-matched filter 43 outputs a data-detection signal having a data amplitude.
- the header-timing circuit 46 detects, from a plurality of header-detection signals, a strongest header-detection signal. In response to detecting the strongest header-detection signal, the header-timing circuit 46 outputs a packet-start signal.
- the matched-filter means alternatively may be embodied as a programmable-matched filter 39 .
- the programmable-matched filter 39 is coupled to the spread-spectrum receiver and to the header-memory 44 .
- the programmable-matched filter 39 preferably includes an in-phase-programmable-matched filter and a quadrature-phase-programmable-matched filter.
- the discussion refers to programmable-matched filter 39 , as a preferred embodiment, including the in-phase and quadrature-phase programmable-matched filters.
- the programmable-matched filter 39 has a first impulse response initially matched to the header-chip-sequence signal of the header embedded in the spread-spectrum signal.
- the programmable-matched filter detects, within each packet and for each path of the spread-spectrum signal, each match of the header-chip-sequence signal with a first impulse response. For a valid detection, the match must have a level of correspondence between the header-chip-sequence signal and the first impulse response above the header threshold.
- the header threshold may be adjusted to adapt to particular environmental situations.
- the programmable-matched filter 39 outputs a header-detection signal having a header amplitude and a respective chip location of the header-detection signal.
- the programmable-matched filter 39 In response to the packet-start signal from the header-timing circuit 46 and, if required, with further timing or control from processor 57 , the programmable-matched filter 39 is changed from the first impulse response to the second impulse response. At each respective chip location of each header-detection signal for each path, the programmable-matched filter 39 detects each match of the data-chip-sequence signal with the second impulse response. In response to each detected match, the programmable-matched filter 39 outputs a data-detection signal having a data amplitude.
- the combiner 75 which can include means for combining in-phase and quadrature-phase components, multiplies, for each packet, each header amplitude, including in-phase and quadrature-phase components, for a particular chip location or time position, of each header-detection signal, including in-phase and quadrature-phase components, respectively, by each data amplitude of each data-detection signal, including in-phase and quadrature-phase components, respectively, at each corresponding chip location or time position, respectively.
- the chip location or time position may serve as an index for matching the header amplitude of each header-detection signal with the data amplitude of each data-detection signal.
- the chip locations of the header-detection signals By using the chip locations of the header-detection signals, the time needed to detect each match of the data-chip-sequence signal is reduced in that matches are only looked for at those chip locations. For a data symbol of the data-symbol-sequence signal within the data portion of the packet, using the chip locations of the header-detection signals eliminates many false alarms because there is no attempt to detect the data-chip-sequence signal at chip locations or times that do not correspond to the timing of the header-detection signal output.
- a header-chip-sequence signal having a large processing gain in combination with the chip locations of the header-detection signal, a data-chip-sequence signal with a much smaller processing gain may be used, reducing the cost of the receiver.
- the header amplitude serves a weighting function.
- a header-detection signal having a large amplitude indicates that the match between the header-chip-sequence signal and the first impulse response was high.
- a header-detection signal having a large amplitude would indicate that a large percentage of the possible matching chips were matched.
- a data-detection signal arising from the detection of a data-chip-sequence signal at the chip location corresponding to the header-detection signal with the large amplitude would therefore be more reliable than a data-detection signal arising from the detection of a data-chip-sequence signal at a chip location corresponding to a header-detection signal with a smaller amplitude.
- the amplitude of the header-detection signal is multiplied with the data-detection signal to weight the data-detection signal more heavily.
- the less reliable data-detection signal is weighted by multiplication with the smaller amplitude of its corresponding header-detection signal. The result is an increased reliance on the most reliable signals arriving at the receiver.
- the combiner Following the weighting process, the combiner generates an in-phase sum and a quadrature-phase sum which are outputted to demodulator 59 .
- the demodulator 59 demodulates the in-phase sum and the quadrature-phase sum as demodulated data.
- the combiner may further include product means, a combiner memory 52 , and adding means.

- the multiplication takes place at corresponding chip locations of the header-detection signal, respectively.
- the product means thereby generates a plurality of weighted elements having in-phase and quadrature-phase components for each data symbol of the data-symbol-sequence signal within the data portion of the packet.

- FIG. 5 shows, by way of example, the circuitry or logic for detecting three strongest magnitudes, corresponding to the three strongest paths.
- This circuitry may be extended to any number of paths within the size of the matched filter 139 . With this circuitry, the four strongest paths may be found in one bit time which may be, for example, 240 chips.
- the first register 203 stores the magnitude from the strongest path
- the second register 206 stores the magnitude from the second strongest path
- the third register 209 stores the magnitude from the third strongest path.
- the magnitude device 201 determines a magnitude from each set of the in-phase header-symbol sum and the quadrature-phase header-symbol sum from the correlator 175 .
- the first register 203 , the second register 206 , and the third register 209 are all set to zero.
- the first magnitude enters the first comparator 202 and is compared to the level stored in the first register 203 , which is zero. Since the first magnitude is greater than zero, the first magnitude is stored in the first register 203 .
- the first address, timing or index of the first magnitude is stored in the first address register 222 .
- the first address, timing or index of the first magnitude is determined from a counting circuit 221 .
- the second magnitude is compared by comparator 202 to the level of the first magnitude, the value stored in the first register 203 . If the second magnitude were greater than the level of the first magnitude, stored in the first register 203 , then the first magnitude passes through the multiplexer 205 to the second register 206 , and the second magnitude is stored in the first register 203 .
- the first address register 222 now stores the second address, timing or index of the second magnitude
- the second address register 224 stores the first address, timing or index of the first magnitude. The first address passes through the multiplexer 223 to the second address register 224 .
- a third magnitude came from magnitude device 201 , then the third magnitude is compared with the value or level stored in the first register 203 by the first comparator 202 , with the value or level stored in the second register 206 by the second comparator 204 , and with the value or level stored in the third register 209 by the third comparator 207 . If the third magnitude were greater than the level of the second magnitude, then the first magnitude passes through the multiplexer 208 to the third register 209 and the second magnitude passes through the multiplexer 205 to the second register 206 . The third magnitude is stored in the first register 203 .
- the first address register 222 now stores the third address, timing or index of the third magnitude
- the second address register 224 stores the second address, timing or index of the second magnitude
- the third address register 226 stores the first address, timing or index of the first magnitude.
- the second address passes through the multiplexer 223 to the second address register 224
- the first address passes through the multiplexer 225 to the third address register 226 .
- the first magnitude passes through the multiplexer 208 to the third register 209 and the third magnitude is stored in the second register 206 .
- the second address register 224 now stores the third address, timing or index of the third magnitude
- the third address register 226 stores the first address, timing or index of the first magnitude.
- the first address passes through the multiplexer 225 to the third address register 226 .
- the third magnitude is stored in the third register or 209 .
- the third address, timing or index of the third magnitude then passes straight to the third address register 226 . The process continues until the largest levels of the magnitudes from the combiner 175 are stored in first register 203 , second register 206 and third register 209 . These largest levels are used by the header-timing circuit for determining the peak levels from the data.
- Hdr i 10 predefined header information
- I c ( Ih mp1 *I mp1 )+( Ih mp2 *I mp2 )+( Ih mp3 *I mp3 )+( Ih mp4 *I mp4 )
- the present invention also includes a multipath-combining method for use with a spread-spectrum receiver for receiving a spread-spectrum signal arriving at different times from a plurality of paths.
- the multipath-combining method comprises the steps of detecting, with a first impulse response matched to the header-chip-sequence signal of the header embedded in the spread-spectrum signal, within a packet for each path, each match of the header-chip-sequence signal with a first impulse response. To be considered a sufficient match, the correspondence between the header-chip-sequence signal and the first impulse response must be above a specified threshold.
- a header-detection signal is generated having a header amplitude and a respective chip location.
- the method further includes the step of storing the header amplitude and the respective chip location of each header-detection signal.
- the method includes the steps of detecting, at each respective chip location of each header-detection signal for each path, each match of the data-chip-sequence signal with the second impulse response. In response to each detected match, the method outputs a data detection signal having a data amplitude.
- the method further includes multiplying the header amplitude of each header-detection signal with the data amplitude of each data-symbol-sequence signal at each corresponding chip location, respectively. The step of multiplying thereby generates a plurality of weighted elements for each data symbol of the data-symbol-sequence signal. The plurality of weighted elements for each data symbol are added to generate a sum signal of the respective data symbol.
- the method may further include the step of generating a header pattern in response to each occurrence of the header-detection signal within a frame of the header-chip-sequence signal. Additionally, the method includes the steps of detecting data from the sum signal.
