Technical field
Present disclose relates generally to wireless communication system, and relate more specifically to OFDM (OFDM) communication system
Control channel transmitting and reception in system.
Background technology
In current 3GPP LTE (third generation partner program Long Term Evolution) communication system, i.e., in version 8,9 and 10,
User equipment (UE) subframe first three (or first four) symbol (for 5MHz etc. big system bandwidth, typically less than 3
It is individual, and for such as 1.25MHz relatively mini system bandwidth, less than 4) middle downlink (DL) control received from e nodes B
Signaling.The control channel duration is transmitted or via height on physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH) with signaling
Layer signaling is sent.Remaining symbol is generally used for receiving user data, system information, synchronizing signal etc..For example, Figure 1A and Figure 1B are retouched
The Exemplary frame structure of prior art is painted.Control signaling first three symbol of subframe whole carrier bandwidths (for example, 10
Megahertz (MHz)) on extend, and received by UE on physical downlink control channel (PDCCH).User data is existed by UE
Received on physical down link sharing channel (PDSCH), and in the choosing for taking whole carrier bandwidths or part thereof of PDSCH
Select in resource block (RB).In the LTE of version 8 and the super LTE of such as version 10 system (also referred to as senior LTE), base station exists
Launched on downlink using OFDM modulation schemes, and UE uses single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC- on uplink
FDMA) scheme and/or discrete Fourier transform extend OFDM (DFT-OFDM) to be launched.In FDD (FDD) operation
In, each in the frame structure of up-link and downlink includes the radio frame of 10 milliseconds (ms), itself so divide
Each to have 10 subframes of 1ms duration, wherein each subframe is divided into each when being two of 0.5ms
Gap, wherein each time slot includes multiple OFDM symbols.In time division duplex (TDD), radio frame is still divided into 10 sons
Frame, but subframe can have different type --- downlink subframe, uplink sub-frames and special subframe, the special subframe
With downlink subportion (or region, DwPTS), protection subdivision (or period or GP) and up-link subdivision (or
Region, UpPTS).DL subframe generally has two types --- CRS regular DL subframe is all included in two time slots；Multicast
Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) subframe, it is not wrapped only in the beginning of subframe comprising CRS in the remainder of subframe
Containing CRS.UE receives the down link control information (DCI) in control area.There are various DCI format types each for carrying
Plant control information.For example, DCI format 0 is used for schedules uplink transmission, and schedule information field is generally included, such as adjusted
System and encoding scheme (MCS) index, resource block distribution, jump mark, new data indicator, transmission power control (TPC) order with/
Or mixing ARQ information.User is identified or ID (UEID) is generally embedded in CRC bits (for example, based on UEID to CRC
Scrambling).DCI format 1A is the compact scheduling authorization for dispatching single transmission block, and including similar in DCI format 0
The extra field of those fields and such as redundancy versions (RV).DCI format 2A is used to carry out dispatching downlink chain using open loop MIMO
Two transmission blocks in road, and DCI format 2B is used to dispatch two transmission blocks in DL using closed-loop MIMO and CRS.DCI lattice
Formula 2C is used to dispatch DL transmission in transmission mode 9, wherein can use DMRS to dispatch up to two transmission blocks.
In order to decode the information sent on PDCCH, UE needs to perform the channel estimation of the coherent demodulation for PDCCH.
In order to perform channel estimation, UE receives the reference signal (RS) of such as frequency pilot sign, and the reference signal is that cell is specifically referred to
Signal (CRS) and it is included in subframe, and it is associated with one or more antenna ports.For example, in 3GPP LTE editions
This is in 8,9 and 10, and UE receives PDCCH using with the associated CRS of one or more of antenna port 0,1,2 and 3.For
The number for demodulating the antenna port of control channel is the Physical Broadcast Channel launched to the known resource block in subframe 0
(PBCH) decoded to determine.Generally, when more than one antenna port, which is used for control channel, to be demodulated, transmitting point is used
Collection scheme.Antenna port is defined such that on antenna port that the transmission channel that symbol passed through can be by same antenna port
Upper transmission channel that another symbol passed through is inferred.The reference letter of antenna port 0,1,2 and 3 is shown in Figure 1A and Figure 1B
Number (CRS) structure, wherein the RS for being designated as R0 is the carrying RS associated with antenna port 0 resource element, being designated as R1 RS is
The carrying RS associated with antenna port 1 resource element, the RS for being designated as R2 is the carrying RS associated with antenna port 2 money
Source element, and it is designated as the resource element that R3 RS is the carrying RS associated with antenna port 3.
For 3GPP LTE versions 10, in order to demodulate user data (being sent on PDSCH), UE can be used and antenna end
Mouthfuls 0,1,2 and 3 associated RS, or UE can use with such as antenna port 7,8,9,10,11,12,13 and 14 other
The associated RS of antenna port, i.e. UE can based on the transmission plan received for PDSCH come using with these antenna port
The associated RS of all or its subset.The RS associated with these other antenna ports is commonly known as that " UE is with particular reference to letter
Number (UERS) " or " demodulated reference signal (DMRS) " or " DRS (Dedicated Reference Signal) (DRS) ".It is associated with antenna port 0,1,2 and 3
RS be commonly known as " public reference signal (CRS) ".In the transmission plan based on CRS, UE can use antenna port 0,
1st, 2, one or more of 3, and for the transmission plan based on DMRS, UE can use antenna port 7,8,9,10,11,
12nd, 13, one or more of 14.It can be determined based on downlink control channel (DCI) information associated with PDSCH
The spatial emission layer and the actual number UE of associated antenna port during PDSCH are decoded using DMRS.Generally, CRS is used when different
The data in PDSCH are demodulated with both DMRS.When e nodes B sends CRS in whole carrier bandwidths, DMRS can only exist
UE has on those RS that PDSCH is assigned and existed.Therefore, when receiving PDSCH using DMRS, UE, which can be used only in it, to be had
DMRS present on those RB of PDSCH assignments.
For 3GPP LTE versions 11 (LTE system of future generation), it is contemplated that new DL control signalings will be by e nodes B across son
UE is sent in the symbol of first time slot of frame or in the symbol of the first and second cross-subframe time slots.New DL control signalings
Commonly known as enhanced PDSCH (EPDSCH).It is different from the PDCCH launched in whole channel width, expect UE can be with
EPDCCH is received in the RB of the carrier bandwidths part in only frequency domain gathers.Moreover, unlike being received by UE using CRS
PDCCH, it is contemplated to which EPDCCH can be received by UE using DMRS.
Expect new DL control signalings, i.e. EPDCCH, the downlink for supplementing existing 3GPP LTE versions 8/9/10
Control channel, i.e. PDCCH, to support senior long term evolution (LTE-A) version 11+ characteristic, (coordinate multipoint is passed such as CoMP
It is defeated) and enhanced multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technology, including multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO).Such control channel enhancing
The frequency selectivity controlling transmission of beam forming can be allowed, for example, via using DMRS and to Single User MIMO (SU-MIMO)
And/or the control channel of MU-MIMO control channels allocation space multiplexing uses the special controlling transmission to UE.Generally, so
New control channel can be defined as frequency division multiplexing (FDM) control channel, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) control channel and DL RB
Total number compared to taking less downlink (DL) RB.Another new DL control channels, that is, relay physical down link control
Channel (R-PDCCH) processed, carries the down link control information (DCI) for via node (RN).R-PDCCH has operation mould
Formula (is not interweaved, based on DMRS), wherein, the DCI for being transferred to RN takes a small amount of RB (usual 1,2,4 or 8 RB), and matches somebody with somebody
Put and transmitted for the RB set of control channel transmission via radio resource control (RRC) agreement with signal.In addition, RN is used
Fixed antenna port, i.e. antenna port 7 (AP7), and fixed scrambling identifier (ID), that is, scramble ID 0, for connecing
Receive DCI (that is, without MU-MIMO).DL permits sending in the first slot and up-link (UL) permits sending out in the second time slot
Send.
It is assumed that the fixation or limited blind decoding budget of every such as UE or RN user are set, it is necessary to develop effective control channel
Meter, the design also solves the control channel obstructing problem in multi-user's control scene.3GPP standards do not address how to be directed to day
The control channel search space of the configuration user such as line end mouthful and blind decoding.If for example, all users are configured in cell
For in the same RB subsets of control and same antenna port (such as R-PDCCH), then blocking rate is controlled to be high, because all
User will attempt to take identical resource.On the other hand, if using the different RB set for DL control signalings, not on the same day
Line end mouthful configures all users in cell, then there is the wasting of resources.
Accordingly, it would be desirable to which resource efficiency, multiplexing efficiency and reduction and randomization control channel obstruction can be improved together by defining
When also allow control channel search space and/or the blind decoding configuration of rational blind decoding complexity at UE.

Make), such as UE 302 and 301 UE can use with the RS associated with 3 of antenna port 0,1,2, or can use with it is all
The associated RS such as other antenna ports of antenna port 7,8,9,10,11,12,13 and 14, i.e. UE can be used and these days
The associated RS of all or subset of line end mouthful.It is associated with these other antenna ports 7,8,9,10,11,12,13 and 14
RS is commonly known as " the specific reference signals of UE (UERS) " or " demodulated reference signal (DMRS) or DRS (Dedicated Reference Signal)
(DRS)”.Different from the PDCCH that UE is received using CRS, EPDCCH is received by UE using DMRS.
That is, as described in Fig. 6 A and Fig. 6 B, R0-R3 is designated as (and related to antenna port 0-3 respectively
Connection) RE be assigned to CRS (CRS RE), and the RE for being designated as R7-R10 (and associated with antenna port 7-10 respectively) is divided

Identical RE is mapped in domain.Subframe 630 also include being distributed in the control area of subframe and/or user data area its
He is RS.These other RS may have, but be not necessarily used for being docked the demodulation of the collection of letters number by UE in LTE-A communication systems.Example
Such as, these RS can include CSI-RS, UE it shall be assumed that potentially contributing to the quiet of zero transmission power on the RS RE of interferometry
Sound RS, the positioning RS that can be used for test position information etc..
In addition, as described in Fig. 6 A and Fig. 6 B, being assigned to corresponding to the RS of antenna port in user data area
Resource element (RE) it is right, and be more specifically allocated to the RE centering associated with 613-614 with OFDM symbol 606-607

Port 7 or antenna port 8, and be designated as R9/10 adjacent DMRS RE to antenna port 9 or antenna port can be assigned to
10.In this example, for R9 and R10 RS using orthogonal Walsh code (Walsh codes) come by code division multiplexing.Class
As, the RS for R7 and R8 is using orthogonal Walsh code come by code division multiplexing.
It is expected that UE 301 and 302 monitors the EPDCCH in control area (i.e. EPDCCH control areas 622), the control zone
Domain is different from the control area (i.e. PDCCH control areas 620) for PDCCH.Can be across corresponding to EPDCCH control area
Multiple RB in subframe.It is usual across the time different from the time symbol corresponding to PDCCH corresponding to EPDCCH control area
Symbol.For example, in Fig. 6 A and Fig. 6 B, corresponding to PDCCH across the time symbol 601,602 in control area, and corresponding to
EPDCCH control area can be across the symbol 603-607 in multiple RB and time domain in frequency domain or alternatively symbol 603-614.For
The EPDCCH in control area 622 is received, UE 301,302 is each had to carry out for some EPDCCH in control area
The blind decoding of candidate.Referring now to Figure 7, there is provided diagram being used for EPDCCH signals according to various embodiments of the present invention
It is sent to the block diagram of the Exemplary frame structure of UE two ways.In the first way of two ways, i.e., in option one,
The DL assignments that such as UE 301 and 302 UE is sent to signal are restricted to the first time slot (time slot 0), and up-link
(UL) permit being restricted to the second time slot (time slot 1).In the second way of two ways, i.e., in option 2, DL assignments and UL
Allowance can be sent to such as UE 301 and 302 UE in the first slot or in the second time slot with signal.Another
In option, DL assignments (or UL permits) can take two time slots.
In order that EPDCCH is received with any method depicted in figure 7, the phases firstly the need of knowing of UE 302
RB set where the new control signaling hoped, i.e. EPDCCH RB set.However, in order to reduce the blind decoding complexity at UE
Degree, communication system 300 provides, when UE for the blind decoding in subframe to search for different control channel candidates when, UE for
Two different candidates use at least two different antenna ports.Then, UE can be according to resource block (RB) or RB control
Channel element (CCE) index or candidate in the CCE that includes determine the antenna port for control channel candidate.
Referring now to Figure 8, there is provided diagram according to various embodiments of the present invention based on antenna port hash and in order to
Decode the control information that is sent on EPDCCH and patrolling as the blind decoding performed by the UE of such as UE 301 communication system 300
Collect flow chart 800.When the operation of communication system 300 of the description relative to UE 301, communication is illustrated using UE 301
The operation of system, and it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the function performed by UE 301 here can also be by all
Performed such as any other UE of UE 302 communication system 300.
When the downlinks to monitor air interface 312 for EPDCCH of UE 301, logic flow 800 starts (802).
Specifically, UE 301 selects one or more of (804) multiple antenna ports antenna port to be directed to EPDCCH monitoring in the air
RS in the EPDCCH of the downlink of interface 312, and be then based on selected one or more antenna ports to monitor
(806)EPDCCH.Described as discussed, UE selects the one or more antenna port using antenna port hash
Monitored.In response to monitoring and based on selected one or more antenna ports, UE is carried out to EPDCCH RB candidates
Blind decoding (808), and be then based on decoded EPDCCH RB to receive the decode the downlink in (810) EPDCCH
Control information (DCI).Then, logical flow chart 800 terminates (812).
That is, as depicted in Figure 7, two for the control channel (i.e. EPDCCH) based on DMRS are exemplary
Subframe structure is：Option one (the R-PDCCH similar structures that the option one such as Fig. 7 is described), wherein downlink (DL) permit quilt
It is limited to the first time slot and up-link (UL) is restricted to the second time slot；With option 2, it is supported by permitting in two time slots
Perhaps frequency division multiplexing (FDM) control that DL and UL permits.Then, expectation EPDCCH RB is indicated using bitmap, i.e., for blind
The UE search spaces of the candidate of decoding.It can allow for frequency selectivity search space candidate and frequency distribution formula search space candidate
Efficiency of the multiplexing via the specific hash functions of UE is possibly used for, frequency selectivity search space candidate is such as directed to conduct
The RB searched for for the RS by UE blind decoding, wherein in the presence of one (1) or two (2) RB candidates, frequency distribution formula is searched
Rope spatial candidate is for example in the presence of four (4) or eight (8) RB candidates.Although being presented above two examples, it can also create
Hybrid plan is built, wherein interweaved per the PRB pair two CCE and RE for two CCE with distribution form, such as two of which CCE
Across two time slots.
Each EPDCCH blind decodings are performed to search space candidate.M- frequency when each search space candidate has related
Resource element (RE), control channel element (CCE) or resource block (RB) in rate resource collection, such as subframe, and/or alternatively
Can have the DMRS port index of related down link control information (DCI) form, the order of modulation of association and association
One or more of (being used to demodulate).If each parameter associated for the candidate of blind decoding with selecting, instant m- frequency
Rate resource (again, such as RB), DCI format, order of modulation and/or DMRS port index, are allowed to change and take numerous values,
Then it may become very big by the number of the candidate of carry out blind decoding, i.e. blind decoding complexity.Therefore, communication system 300 passes through
Parameter combination is limited to control the complexity of blind decoding process.For example, can be fixed to QPSK (orthogonal for order of modulation
Phase-shift keying (PSK)) for control channel transmission (but to increase the demand of efficiency if there is the operator of communication system 300,
Other modulation schemes, 16-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) etc. can also be used).For RPDCCH, DMRS port index quilt
Being fixed as antenna port 7 is used for all control channel candidates.
For without the EPDCCH (during such as RPDCCH) of mutually interweaving, being used for the candidate of blind decoding in time-frequency domain
Search space can be defined as taking small RB set, such as one (1), two (2), four (4) or eight (8) RB,
And being arranged for controlling for the RB set of transmission can use radio resource control (RRC) agreement to pass through sky by BS 310
The downlink of middle interface 312 is sent to UE 301 with signal.So, each time slot, EPDCCH is defined for blind decoding
Up to two DCI formats of candidate collection { 6,6,2,2 } and every candidate, are produced per time slot " the secondary blind solutions of (6+6+2+2) * 2=32 "
Code is attempted.That is, blind decoding candidate collection { 6,6,2,2 } corresponds to six of which independence PRB by six lists of blind decoding
It is blind that individual (1) PRB convergences level, wherein six couples PRB converge level, the PRB of two of which four by six two (2) PRB of blind decoding
Two four (4) PRB convergences level of decoding, the PRB of two of which eight converge level by two eight (8) PRB of blind decoding.
Convergence RB for each convergence level can be by such as the RB set for being used for high-rise configuration defined in following table
Numbering plan provides and (is specifically used for EPDCCH, such as R-PDCCH).In addition, in the case of RN, it is assumed that fixed antenna end
Mouth (i.e. antenna port 7 (AP7)) and fixed scrambling identifier (ID) (scrambling ID 0) are used to receive control information (that is, nothing
MU-MIMO).In addition, scheme defined below uses the option one of the above, wherein send in the first slot DL authorize and
UL is sent in second time slot to authorize.
In each time slot, EPDCCH candidates m, wherein converge the m=0 at horizontal Λ, 1 ..., M (Λ) -1 includes can be with
It is numbered as nRPDCCH=(Λ m+i) mod NRPDCCHVirtual resource blocks (VRB), wherein m is VRB number, and M (Λ) is to wait
The number of choosing, i=0,1 ..., (Λ -1), and M (Λ) is provided from the following table of 3GPP technical specifications (TS) 36.216：
The E-PDCCH candidates that via node is monitored
Converge horizontal Λ | The number M (Λ) of R-PDCCH candidates |
1 | 6 |
2 | 6 |
4 | 2 |
8 | 2 |
In order to preferably illustrate the program and convergence level, in fig .9 there is provided diagram according to an embodiment of the invention
The block diagram 900 of the search space candidate of EPDCCH different convergence levels.It is logic RB indexes 910 at the top of Fig. 9, lists
Logic RB, RB0-RB15.Then, Fig. 9 respectively depict four horizontal 901-904 of convergence, i.e. level 1,2,4 and 8.1 pair of level
Ying Yuliu single (1) PRB convergence levels (six of which independence PRB is by blind decoding), the independent PRB can be correspondingly by independence
Logic RB (i.e. RB0-RB5) is indexed.Level 2 corresponds to six two (2) PRB convergence levels, and six of which PRB pair is by blind solution
Code, the PRB pair can be indexed correspondingly by logic RB to (i.e. RB0/RB1, BR2/RB3, RB4/RB5 etc.).Level 4 corresponds to
Two four (4) PRB converge level, and the PRB of two of which four is by blind decoding, and four PRB can be correspondingly by four logic RB (i.e. RB0/
RB1/RB2/RB3 and RB4/RB5/RB6/RB7) index.Moreover, level 8 corresponds to two eight (8) PRB convergence levels, wherein
Two eight PRB can be indexed correspondingly by blind decoding, eight PRB by eight logic RB.Although index logic depicted in figure 9
RB is continuous, but they need not so do.Assuming that in fig .9, fixed antenna port (i.e. (describe in fig .9 by antenna port 7
For R7)) it is used to receive control information.
In order to allow such as UE 301 and 302 multiple UE while using EPDCCH resource blocks, it may be desirable to multiplexing addressing
Into single PRB two different users two (or more) EPDCCH.This can be by using for transmitting two of DMRS
Antenna port (be used for transmit DMRS antenna port be referred to herein as " DMRS port ") realizes, such as He of antenna port 7
8, wherein DMRS port 7 (" R7 ") is addressed to such as UE 301 the first user, and DMRS port 8 (" R8 ") is addressed to such as UE
302 second user.Then, UE can decode specific EPDCCH candidates using specific DMRS port, because attempting to be used for often
The each possible DMRS port of individual candidate may cause excessive blind decoding.If for example, control channel candidate is defined for
100 RB, two DCI format sizes of four antenna ports and monitoring, then the number of times that blind decoding is attempted is (it is assumed that only 1 RB
EPDCCH candidates) it is 100x 4x2=800, its is excessive and medium errors may be caused to detect and cause performance loss.
Each UE 301,302 is used for the DMRS port for decoding the CCE in PRB (or PRB set), also referred to as DMRS
Port index, can by RB indexes of the UE based on PRB and/or such as other specification of subframe index and UE identifier (UEID) come
It is determined that.UE it is determined that the other specification for considering for decoding CCE in DMRS port can also include it is related to control channel candidate
The first RB indexes and last RB indexes of connection, the RB set associated with control channel candidate, associated DCI format are assumed
(that is, UE conjecture used in DCI format), System Frame Number, timeslot number, cell identifier, point identifier, any other type
UE identifier, high-rise offset identifier, the control antenna port identifier sent via traditional PDCCH, control port hop pattern,
The limited port transmitted via high-level signaling with signal and CSI-RS (channel condition information-reference signal) configurations.Use this
A little parameters determine to be referred to alternatively as herein for decoding CCE DMRS port " DMRS transmission ports hash ".Note, resource block rope
It can be one in VRB indexes, DVRB indexes or LVRB indexes to draw.
For example, in one embodiment of the invention, UE can have odd number or even number index number to select based on PRB
Using DMRS port 7 or 8 (i.e. R7 or R8), such as using DMRS port 7 for odd number PRB (PRB has odd number call number)
DMRS port 8 is used for even number PRB (PRB has even number index number).In another such embodiment of the present invention, UE can be with every
Individual subframe this is inverted.By the another more general embodiment of the present invention, UE can determine DMRS based on algorithm
Port index number, in the algorithm, RB indexes (RB_Index) and associated DMRS port index can configure as follows：
(RB_Index1, DMRS port index (RB_Index1)), (RB_Index2, DMRS port index (RB_Index2)) ....
In another embodiment of the invention, UE can determine that DMRS port is indexed by certainty mapping function, wherein DMRS ends
It is following one or more function that stomochord, which draws (port-index),：RB indexes (RB_index), time slot index (slot_
Index), UE identifier (UE_ID) and transmitted with signal parameter (that is, port_index=function (RB_index,
Slot_index, UE_ID, signaled_parameter), passed wherein the parameter transmitted with signal can be BS 310 with signal
The parameter sent.
When the DMRS port corresponding to each RB and/or scrambling identifier (ID) with signal can be sent to UE via RRC
When, such method is restricted to multi-user's situation.Therefore, in other embodiments of the invention, UE can be in decoding E-
Using fixed scrambling ID during PDCCH, for example, ID0 is scrambled, or scrambling ID can also be defined as a part for port definition.
It will can also include for the scrambling ID of the transmission of control channel in Master Information Block (MIB) or system information block (SIB), such as
SIB-x (wherein x=1,2,3 ..., L, and each x values are different SIB).In another embodiment of the present invention, UE can be with
The DMRS port different to each or subset trial in CCE combinations in PRB pair and different scrambling ID；However, as described above, this
It result in excessive many blind decodings.
Such as UE 301 and 302 with reference now to Figure 10 and Figure 11 there is provided diagram according to various embodiments of the present invention
UE how can to perform antenna port hash.In Fig. 10, the antenna port associated with each blind decoding candidate (or CCE)
It is to be determined based on the candidate index in correspondence convergence level.For example, UE can use DMRS port 7 to all odd number candidates
(R7) and can to all even number candidates use DMRS port 8 (R8).That is, in convergence level 1, UE is waited for odd number
Choosing uses R7, i.e., first, the 3rd and the 5th RB (being indexed by logic RB indexes RB0, RB2 and RB4), and for second,
4th and the 6th RB (is indexed) using R8 by logic RB indexes RB1, RB3 and RB5.Similarly, in convergence level 2, UE pairs
In the first, the 3rd and the 5th candidate, i.e. RB is used (being indexed by logic RB indexes RB0/RB1, RB4/RB5 and RB8/RB9)
R7, and for the second, the 4th and the 6th candidate, i.e. RB is to (by logic RB indexes RB2/RB3, RB6/RB7 and RB10/RB11
To index), use R8.In convergence level 4, UE makes for the first candidate, i.e. four RB (being indexed by logic RB indexes RB0-RB3)
With R7, and for the second candidate, i.e. four RB (being indexed by logic RB indexes RB4-RB7) use R8.Moreover, in convergence level
8, UE for the first candidate, i.e. eight RB (being indexed by logic RB indexes RB0-RB7) use R7, and for the second candidate, i.e.,
Eight RB (being indexed by logic RB indexes RB8-RB15) use R8.Therefore, if it is desired to which UE monitors that two different DCI formats are big
It is small that (such as 0/1A has 40 bit payloads, and 1 bit wherein in payload is used to distinguish 0 and 1A, and form 2C has 70 bits
Payload), then the number of times that performed blind decoding is attempted is provided by 2x (6+6+2+2)=32.This and 44 blind decodings i.e. in version 8
The exponent number of the number of times of trial is identical.Although figure 10 illustrates the 2nd UE in cell can not use complementary mapping
To monitor that control channel, i.e. UE can use DMRS port 7 (R7) for all even number candidates, and can be for all odd numbers
Candidate uses DMRS port 8 (R8).
And in fig. 11, determined based on the candidate index in corresponding convergence level with each blind decoding candidate (or
CCE) associated antenna port；However, because in some convergence levels, some RB may be searched, it is possible to
Multiple DMRS ports are searched for for the RB of the level.For example and similar to Figure 10, in convergence level 1, UE for odd number candidate,
I.e. first, the 3rd and the 5th RB (being indexed by logic RB indexes RB0, RB2 and RB4) uses R7, and for the second, the 4th
R8 is used with the 6th RB (being indexed by logic RB indexes RB1, RB3 and RB5).In convergence level 2, UE is for the first, the 3rd
R7 used (being indexed by logic RB indexes RB0/RB1, RB4/RB5 and RB8/RB9) with the 5th candidate, i.e. RB, and for
Secondth, the 4th and the 6th candidate, i.e. RB are used (being indexed by logic RB indexes RB2/RB3, RB6/RB7 and RB10/RB11)
R8.However, in convergence level 3, RB4-RB7 is not used in EPDCCH.Correspondingly, in convergence level 4, UE can be used for candidate
Both R7 and R8, i.e., by four RB of logic RB index RB0-RB3 indexes.And in convergence level 8, RB8-RB15 is not used in
EPDCCH, and therefore, UE can use R7 and R8 for candidate, i.e., by eight RB of logic RB index RB0-RB7 indexes.
In still another embodiment of the process, UE can imply DMRS port from DCI format.For example, it may be desirable to which UE is used
DMRS port 7 is to decode DCI format 0/1A and DCI format 2/4 is decoded using DMRS port 8, or makes for DL allowances
With DMRS port 7, and permit using DMRS port 8 for UL.The association of DCI format and DMRS port can be used as entered here
The ashing technique of one step description is performed on the basis of UE is specific.For example, different hash functions can be used for each DCI lattice
Formula, it can be the function of other specification such as RB indexes, UEID, subframe index etc. again.
EPDCCH can be sent being sent to by BS 310 via RRC with signal in the set of UE PRB pair.Neighbouring PRB
(i.e. neighbouring in a frequency domain) can be bound, and UE assume that identical precoding is applied to the PRB of binding, and this can be provided
Improved channel estimating performance.Bind size, such as 1,2 or 3 PRB, can by BS using RRC come with signal transmission or can
With identical with resource block group (RBG) size for giving DL system bandwidths.RRC signaling can be more flexible, but 3GPP
The PRB bindings size of LTE versions 10 can be reused.In each PRB bindings, UE all CCE combinations are addressed to all
It is assumed that being decoded in the case of identical DMRS transmission ports.Although Figure 10 and Figure 11 logic-based RB indexes describe hash letter
Number, identical technology can apply to converge the situation for the convergence being defined as on PRB pair rather than PRB.In this case,
Control channel candidate can take the first and second time slots (i.e. LVRB) of subframe.
Referring now to Figure 12, there is provided the exemplary static day for describing antenna port hash according to an embodiment of the invention
Line virtualization block diagram, wherein BS 310 aerial array 510 be used for across the BS sectors 1210 serviced spatially guiding just
Hand over wave beam, such as wave beam grid (GoB).In the example shown, virtualization causes each of antenna port pair and sector 1210
Sub- sector 1201-1204 is associated, and such as port 7 and 8 is associated with sub- sector 1201, port 9 and 10 and the sub- phase of sector 1202
Association, port 11 and 12 is associated with sub- sector 1203, and port 13 and 14 is associated with sub- sector 1204.This is for sector
Each UE in 1210 ensure that the transmission (causing up to 8 convergence-levels with MU-MIMO to be transmitted) of up to order 2.By this
The scheme of sample, EPDCCH is launched based on such as UE 301 and 302 UE position in one or two of antenna port pair
Code word, the position of the UE for example can be fed back based on such as channel quality information (CQI) or channel condition information (CSI) feeds back,
The UL letters of pre-coding matrix (PMI) feedback, the channel state feedback of rank information or such as UL detection reference signals (SRS) detection
Road is detected or the two is determined.Due to only launching EPDCCH in the subset of antenna port, so UE can only limit blind decoding
It is made as the associated subset of antenna port.In one suchembodiment, BS 310 can launch the specific antennas of UE by RRC
Port subset information for UE monitoring.In another such embodiment, UE can be it is assumed that on the two antenna ports
Best " N " (" N " is equal to 2 in Figure 12) individual antenna port with highest CSI is determined in the case of single order transmission.Then, UE
It is used for restricted subset blind decoding using " N " the individual antenna port.By BS 310 is ensured based on the CSI feedback received from UE
EPDCCH launches on best N number of antenna port.
Support UE according to being included in during different control channel candidates by being used for blind decoding in subframe in search
Control channel element (CCE) index or resource block (RB) of RB or CCE in candidate determine the day for control channel candidate
Line end mouthful, communication system 300 is answered by reducing the space size of UE search control channel candidates to reduce the blind decoding at UE
Miscellaneous degree.Which reduce the time required for the blind decoding that UE performs control channel, and also reduce in the such blind solution of execution
Processing load during code on UE.
