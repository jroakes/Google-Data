Definitions
- the present disclosure relates, generally, to audio signal processing techniques and, in particular, to audio matrix decoding schemes in which two or more audio signal streams (or “channels”), each associated with a direction or spatial orientation, are decoded (i.e., extracted) from a pair of audio input signal streams.
- Audio matrix encoding and decoding schemes are generally well known.
- Early “surround sound” technologies employed a 4:2:4 process in which four discrete audio channels are encoded (or downmixed) into two channels, passed through a two channel medium (e.g. an LP record), and subsequently decoded (or upmixed) back to four channels before being presented to four speakers.
- the 4:2:4 process often entails information loss, i.e., the four channels reproduced at the final stage are not necessarily identical to the four initially encoded channels.
- the two encoded audio channels can be played using a standard two channel stereo player.
- Examples of surround sound systems employing the 4:2:4 process include the SQ (Stereo Quadraphonic) system introduced by CBS in 1971 and the QS (Quadraphonic Stereo) system by Sansui also introduced in 1971. Both the SQ and QS systems use speakers in a square configuration: left front; right front; left back; and right back.
- Another example of a system employing the 4:2:4 process is the Dolby Surround system introduced in 1982. This system uses speakers in a diamond configuration: left front; center; right front; and one or more rear speakers referred to as “surround” speakers.
- the Dolby Surround system uses an encoding matrix known as the Dolby MP (Motion Picture) Matrix which encodes four channels of audio into a standard two channel format suitable for recording and stereo transmission.
- the Dolby Surround decoder recovers the four audio channels from the two encoded channels using a (4 ⁇ 2) decoding matrix. Since the coefficients of the decoding matrix are constants, the Dolby Surround decoder is generically referred to as a “passive” decoder. Such a decoder may provide in the range of a 3 dB separation between adjacent channels, e.g., between left and surround channels.
- Passive decoders are limited in their ability to spatially orient sounds with precision for various listening positions.
- Active decoders adapt the decoding matrix coefficients to enhance the directionality of sounds. These decoders reduce the crosstalk between channels and increase channel separation.
- An example of active decoders is the Dolby Pro Logic decoder introduced in 1987.
- the Dolby Pro Logic II matrix decoding technology was introduced in 2000. This decoder extracts five channels of audio from a stereo (i.e. two-channel) signal: left front; center; right front; right back; and left back.
- the Dolby Pro Logic II decoder is suitable for use with current 5.1 surround systems, where the “0.1” refers to the reduced bandwidth low frequency effects (LFE) channel.
- the Dolby Pro Logic II encoder downmixes five channels of audio (or six with LFE) into two channels which can be played over a standard stereo player if no decoder is available.

- the scaling coefficients at the output summers can be chosen such that for each cardinal direction the choice of the corresponding gain as unity and the remaining gains as zero would result in substantial or complete cross-talk cancellation.
- An encoder can then be designed which uses the decoder outputs as inputs and re-encodes them.
- the scaling coefficients at the output summers of the encoder stage can be selected such that, for each cardinal direction, the outputs of the encoder match the inputs of the decoder, assuming complete cross-talk cancellation at the decoder stage.
- the N equations relating the decoder intermediate signals (i.e., the outputs of the passive matrix decoder stage) to the decoder outputs can be formulated.
- the two encoder equations relating its outputs to the decoder intermediate signals can also be formulated. By requiring that each of the encoder outputs match the corresponding decoder inputs, the two “necessary condition” equations relating the intermediate variables and the unknown gain terms may be determined.

- FIG. 16 and FIG. 17 illustrate respective alternative implementations of the four output and five output active matrix decoders.
- the main signal path (circuit 1601 in FIG. 16 ; circuit 1701 in FIG. 17 ) is composed of just the adaptive matrix block (modules 1610 and 1710 in FIGS. 16 and 17 , respectively).
- the input signals L t and R t are fed directly into the adaptive matrix block to generate the outputs L out , C out , S out , and R out for the four output case (circuit 1600 in FIG. 16 ) and the outputs L out , C out , LB out , RB out , and R out for the five output case (circuit 1700 in FIG. 17 ).
- Respective adaptive matrix decoders 1610 , 1710 use equation (27) to compute the outputs using the H matrix of equation (28) for the four output case and the H matrix of equation (72) for the five output case.
- the appropriate adaptive matrix coefficients h l,l , h l,r , h c,l , h c,r , h s,l , h s,r , h r,l , and h r,r for the four output case and h l,l , h l,r , h c,l , h c,r , h lb,l , h lb,r , h rb,l , h rb,r , h r,l , and h r,r for the five output case are computed in the control signal path (circuit 1603 in FIG. 16 ; circuit 1703 in FIG. 17 ) and fed into the adaptive matrix decoder module.
- the input signals L t and R t are fed into the band-pass filter blocks to obtain the filtered signals L tf and R tf , respectively.
- the filtered input signals L tf and R tf are fed into the 4-output passive matrix module (block 1606 in FIG. 16 ; block 1706 in FIG. 17 ) to generate the filtered versions of the intermediate signals L f , C f , S f , and R f according to equations (1) through (4).

- the signal envelopes L env , C env , S env , and R env are fed into the angle estimator module (block 1614 in FIG. 16 ; block 1714 in FIG. 17 ).
- the angle estimator block uses equations (47) and (48) to compute the ratios M l,r and M c,s in dB.
- FIG. 18 shows the ratios M l,r ( ⁇ ) and M c,s ( ⁇ ) as a function of the panning angle ⁇ .
- the maximum ratios are limited to ⁇ 50 dB by appropriate choice of the constant ⁇ . It is seen from the graphs that for each value of ⁇ , the pair of ratios (M l,r , M c,s ) takes on a unique value. Therefore, using appropriate quantizers for the ratios M l,r and M c,s , the angle can be estimated, e.g., accurate to within a degree.
- the ratios M l,r and M c,s may not attain their ideal values in a practical system and in that event, the two ratios are assumed to be proportionately affected; in other words, the ratio of ratios is assumed to be constant for any given ⁇ .
- the estimated angle ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ q may be smoothed by a first order filter using a filter time constant of about 10 milliseconds.
- the estimated angle is then used to look up the appropriate adaptive matrix coefficient values from a lookup table module (block 1612 in FIG. 16 ; bock 1712 in FIG. 17 ).
- the adaptive matrix coefficient values are then fed into the adaptive matrix module (block 1610 in FIG. 16 ; block 1710 in FIG. 17 ).
- the lookup table module stores the adaptive matrix coefficient values, namely, h l,l , h l,r , h c,l , h c,r , h s,l , h s,r , h r,l , and h r,r for the four output case and h l,l , h l,r , h c,l , h c,r , h lb,l , h lb,r , h rb,l , h rb,r , h r,l , and h r,r for the five output case, for each quantized angle value ⁇ circumflex over ( ⁇ ) ⁇ q , e.g., for each degree from 0 to 360.
- the main signal paths of FIG. 14 and FIG. 15 can be combined with the control signal paths of FIG. 16 and FIG. 17 respectively.
- the lookup table block will hold variable gain values g l , g c , g s , and g r for the four output case and g l , g c , g lb , g rb , and g r for the five output case instead of the adaptive matrix coefficient values.
- the main signal paths of FIG. 16 and FIG. 17 can be combined with the control signal paths of FIG. 14 and FIG. 15 respectively.
- variable gains computed by the linear equation solver block 14 will be transformed using equation (28) or (72) into the adaptive matrix coefficient values, namely, h l,l , h l,r , h c,l , h c,r , h s,l , h s,r , h r,l , and h r,r for the four output case and h l,l , h l,r , h c,l , h c,r , h lb,l , h lb,r , h rb,l , h rb,r , h r,l , and h r,r for the five output case before they are fed into the adaptive matrix block.
- variable gains or the adaptive matrix coefficient values are computed for every sample index n.
- variable gains or the adaptive matrix coefficient values can be computed once every N (>1) samples and interpolated to obtain the values for each sample index.

Description
In various embodiments, the gain values may be computed such that
A.) Four Output Matrix Decoders
L=L t (1)
C=a·(L t +R t) (2)
S=a·(L t −R t) (3)
and
R=R t (4)
L out =L (5)
C out =C (6)
S out =S (7)
and
R out =R (8)
Equations (1) through (4) can also be expressed using vector notation as
Similarly, equations (5) through (8) can be expressed using vector notation as
and I is the (4×4) identity matrix.
Combining equations (13) and (9) yields
z=I·y=I·F·x=F·x (15)
L out =L−p·g c ·C−p·g s ·S (20)
C out =C−a·g l ·L−a·g r ·R (21)
S out =S−a·g l ·L+a·g r ·R (22)
and
R out =R−p·g c ·C+p·g s ·S (23)
where the scaling coefficient p>0 is given by
The choice of the scaling coefficients for the signals summed by the
Combining equations (9) and (25), we have
{circumflex over (L)} t =L out +p·C out +p·S out (29)
and
{circumflex over (R)} t =R out +p·C out −p·S out (30)
is the encoding (or “re-encoding”) matrix.
{circumflex over (L)} t =L t+(1−g l)·L−p·g c ·C−p·g s ·S (33)
{circumflex over (R)} t =R t+(1−g r)·R−p·g c ·C+p·g s ·S (34)
(1−g l)·L−p·g c ·C−p·g s ·S=0 (35)
(1−g r)·R−p·g c ·C+p·g s ·S=0 (36)
(1−g c)·C−a·g l ·L−a·g r ·R=0 (37)

L−p·g c ·C−p·g s ·S=0 (39)
C−a·g l ·L−a·g r ·R=0 (40)
S−a·g l ·L+a·g r ·R=0 (41)
and
R−p·g c ·C+p·g s ·S=0 (42)
In a similar manner, choosing the appropriate equations from (35) through (42), the following results for segments II, III, and IV, respectively, may be derived:
where δ>0 is any small positive constant (e.g. δ=0.0001) used to limit the maximum positive and negative values of the ratios, if desired. The following inequalities can then be used to identify the angular segments I, II, III, and IV, respectively:
M l,r≧0,M c,s<0 for 0≦α<90 (49)
M l,r>0,M c,s≧0 for 90≦α<180 (50)
M l,r≦0,M c,s>0 for 180≦α<270 (51)

B.) Five Output Matrix Decoders
L=L t (53)
C=a·(L t +R t) (54)
LB=b·L t −d·R t (55)
RB=b·R t −d·L t (56)
and
R=R t (57)
where a>0, and b>d>0 are scaling coefficients. The scaling coefficients are selected in such a way that the intermediate signals have the same maximum power as the input signals, namely, 2·a2=1 or a=√{square root over (½)}=0.707; and b2+d2=1, e.g., b=0.8718 and d=0.4899 for a principal direction of α=31.33° (or 328.67°). Equations (53) through (57) can also be expressed using vector notation as
L out =L−p·g c ·C−q·g lb ·LB+t·g rb ·RB (60)
C out =C−a·g l ·L−u·g lb ·LB−u·g rb ·RB−a·g r ·R (61)
LB out =LB−b·g l ·L−v·g c ·C+w·g rb ·RB+d·g r ·R (62)
RB out =RB+d·g l ·L−v·g c ·C+w·g lb ·LB−b·g r·R (63)
and
R out =R−p·g c ·C+t·g lb ·LB−q·g rb ·RB (64)
where the scaling coefficients q>0, t>0, u>0, v>0, and w>0 are respectively given by
Combining equations (9) and (25) yields
{circumflex over (L)} t =L out +p·C out +q·LB out −t·RB out (73)
and
{circumflex over (R)} t =R out +p·C out −t·LB out +q·RB out (74)
is the encoding matrix.
(p·a+q·b+t·d)·g l ·L+(p+q·v−t·v)·g c ·C+(q+p·u+t·w)·g lb ·LB+(−t+p·u−q·w)·g rb ·RB+(p·a−q·d−t·b)·g r ·R=p·C+q·LB−t·RB (76)
and
(p·a−q·d−t·d)·g l ·L+(p+q·v−t·v)·g c ·C+(−t+p·u−q·w)·g lb ·LB+(q+p·u+t·w)·g rb ·RB+(p·a+q·b+t·d)·g r ·R=p·C−t·LB+q·RB (77)
As in the four output case, the output equations (60) through (64) for
L−p·g c ·C−q·g lb ·LB+t·g rb ·RB=0 (78)
C−a·g l ·L−u·g lb ·LB−u·g rb ·RB−a·g r ·R=0 (79)
LB−b·g l ·L−v·g c ·C+w·g rb ·RB+d·g r ·R=0 (80)
RB+d·g l ·L−v·g c ·C+w·g lb ·LB−b·g r ·R=0 (81)
and
R−p·g c ·C+t·g lb ·LB−q·g rb ·RB=0 (82)
q·g lb ·LB−t·g rb ·RB=L (83)
and
−t·g lb ·LB+q·g rb ·RB=R (84)
−q·g lb ·|LB|−t·g rb ·|RB|=−|L|
and
t·g lb ·|LB|+q·g rb ·|RB|=|R|
q·g lb ·|LB|+t·g rb ·|RB|=|L|
and
−t·g lb ·|LB|−q·g rb ·|RB|=−|R|
So, for either sub-segment, i.e., for segment I, equations (83) and (84) may be re-written as
q·g lb ·|LB|+t·g rb ·|RB|=|L| (85)
and
t·g lb ·|LB|−q·g rb ·|RB|=|R| (86)
L env(n)=λ·L env(n−1)+(1−λ)·|L f| (97)
