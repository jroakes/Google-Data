- FIG. 10 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some implementations of the subject technology are implemented.
- the subject disclosure provides a method for negotiating prices for an item based on a user's participation in a social shopping environment with one or more other users (e.g., a social shopping trip).
- a social shopping trip Based on the activities of participants within a social shopping environment (e.g., a social shopping trip), the system may provide the user with a mechanism for price negotiation on items the user intends to purchase.
- Two types of price negotiation may be performed by the system.
- the first price-negotiation technique is based on the context of a social shopping environment. For example, a user may be a participant of a social shopping trip or may otherwise shop for items with one or more other users.
- a user may engage in social shopping trips with one or more online contacts using a social shopping application.
- the social shopping application facilitates collaboration and feedback between shoppers without limiting the flexibility and variety provided by online shopping and provides for a shopping experience among users who are not necessarily physically located near one another.
- the social shopping application further supports the ability to extend a social shopping experience beyond online shopping and into shopping at physical stores.
- a user may log into a social shopping application and begin a social shopping trip. Once the user begins the social shopping trip, the user is then asked to enter information regarding the context of the social shopping trip (e.g., the items and/or types of items that the user wishes to shop for).
- the context information may include information on the item or types of items that the user creating the social shopping trip and/or the participants of the social shopping trip wish to shop for and may include various item characteristics such as item type, category, brand, retailer, price range, color, and other similar item characteristics.
- the user may designate one or more contacts or groups (e.g., social circles) to be invited to join the social shopping trip.
- the user may ask that the invitation to shop be shared with all contacts of the user (e.g., at one or more social networking sites).
- the system may use such information to recommend one or more contacts for the specific social shopping trip (e.g., based on various information regarding the contacts such as past social shopping trip experiences and/or profile information indicating contact shopping interests or expertise).
- the user may select one or more contacts for joining the social shopping trip.
- the selected contacts are then notified about the ongoing social shopping trip and provided with the context of the social shopping trip.
- the invitees may then request to join the social shopping trip.
- Contacts may be added to the trip before or during the social shopping trip.
- only the creator of the social shopping trip may add participants to the shopping trip.
- all participants of the shopping trip may add others to the shopping trip.
- the creator may be notified of an invite sent by other participants and may have to approve the invite before the invitation is sent to the invitee and/or before the invitee can join the shopping trip.
- the social shopping trip participants e.g., the user initiating the social shopping trip or contacts joining the social shopping trip
- the participants may individually browse various retailer websites (e.g., similar to a solitary online shopping experience), or physical stores, for items that the participants may be interested in purchasing and/or recommending to other participants.
- the retailer sites and physical stores are independent from the social shopping application, and are not required to vary any infrastructure to allow for social shopping trips according to the embodiments of the present subject matter.
- the social shopping trip application may be implemented as a browser extension or a separate browser-based or software-based application.
- the social shopping application may determine an item being viewed by the user (e.g., using the URL) and post the item being viewed to the social shopping application.
- a participant at a physical store may scan a barcode and/or enter information regarding the item (e.g., take a picture, write a description) and may select to share the item with other participants of the social shopping trip.
- the system detects an indication of interest of a participant in a certain item, the item is then posted to the social shopping application for review and comment by all other participants in the social shopping trip.
- online retailer sites may integrate social shopping trip capability into their website. For example, an online store may provide a button to launch the social shopping application and/or a button to post the item currently being viewed to the social shopping trip.
- the system may also, with proper permissions, provide information as to the location of the participants (e.g., the online store or physical store that the user is currently at) and/or participants may explicitly share information about the online website or physical store they are currently shopping at, to prompt other participants to visit the same stores (e.g., online site or physical store), thus making the shopping experience less solitary.
- participants e.g., the online store or physical store that the user is currently at
- participants may explicitly share information about the online website or physical store they are currently shopping at, to prompt other participants to visit the same stores (e.g., online site or physical store), thus making the shopping experience less solitary.
- the social shopping trip display includes mechanisms for receiving feedback regarding the posted items from the participants of the social shopping experience.
- the participants can for example endorse an item posted by other participants, rate the item, vote “yes” or “no” on the item or recommend other items in lieu of the posted items to participants.
- the system may further provide mechanisms such that users can provide reasons for their feedback (e.g., endorsement, opinions and rating) regarding an item.
- reasons for their feedback e.g., endorsement, opinions and rating
- the system upon receiving a certain endorsement, rating or other opinion regarding the item, may provide a list of reasons to the user and the user may select a reason for providing the feedback.
- the reasons provided for selection to the user may be customized to the feedback provided by the user. For example, a specific type of rating, vote or opinion, may trigger a listing of reasons specific to the feedback provided by the user.
- the system may provide the user with a comment box where the user may provide feedback, an explanation about their feedback or comments regarding the item.
- the social shopping trip may further provide chat capability such that the participants of the social shopping trip may discuss various items or other information relating to the shopping trip using the chat capability.
- the chat capability may be used for topics unrelated to the social shopping trip.
- Items posted by each participant may be items intended for the participant or item recommendations for other participants within the social shopping trip (e.g., recommendations for the user initiating the social shopping trip).
- the system may receive the feedback from each of the one or more participants and updated the social shopping trip to display the feedback associated with each items to the one or more participants.
- the participants are able to view the items posted to the social shopping trip and all feedback provided by the participants and associated with the posted items.
- a participant may select an item from the social shopping trip and add the item to a social shopping cart for purchase.
- the system may provide the user with a mechanism for price negotiation on items the user is interested in purchasing.
- the system may receive a request from participants of a social shopping trip to check for price negotiation opportunities.
- the system may automatically determine if the items include negotiation offers and may provide an indication to the user (e.g., an icon displayed next to the price).
- the user may request to perform a negotiation where a negotiation is possible (e.g., using the icon).
- the system may check one or more databases storing negotiation criteria. Several criteria may be used for performing a context-based price negotiation including the number of participants involved in a social shopping trip and/or the quantity of items that the participants wish to purchase. For example, the system may identify items having special negotiation offers for groups of people. The system may then retrieve negotiated prices based on the number of participants buying an item. Similarly, if a communal social shopping cart is available, and an item is placed within the communal social shopping cart, the system may automatically check whether group negotiated prices are available for the items added to the social shopping cart, the system may notify the user and the participants. Similarly, if the system detects several participants selecting the same item for purchase, the system may similarly determine whether a lower price can be negotiated based on the number of participants wishing to purchase the item.
- negotiation criteria including the number of participants involved in a social shopping trip and/or the quantity of items that the participants wish to purchase. For example, the system may identify items having special negotiation offers for groups of people. The system may then retrieve negotiated prices based on the number
- the system may determine a purchasing likelihood for the item, and may further determine the likelihood that the purchase will results in future purchases and such information may be used as price negotiation criteria to provide the participants with a negotiated price.
- the purchasing likelihood indicates a likelihood that the item will be purchased (e.g., by one or more participants of the social shopping trip) and may be determined based on various information including the purchase history of the user, the item characteristics associated with the social shopping trip, whether any competing items are posted to the social shopping trip, feedback data regarding the item, user preferences, and/or explicit information or feedback provided by the one or more users indicating an interest in the item.
- the purchasing likelihood may be calculate for the item under the present conditions (e.g., for the present price), for one/or alternative prices (e.g., the chances of purchase if the item is offered at a certain price) and/or for one or more other additional incentives.
- item characteristics associated with the social shopping trip are determined based upon one or more of context information provided by participants of the shopping trip (e.g., the user creating the shopping trip), items added to the shopping trip, feedback provided by the participants of the shopping trip, and items added and/or to a social shopping cart associated with the social shopping trip and/or one or more participants of the social shopping trip.
- the item characteristics may include price range, color, category, brand, store, store type, or other similar item characteristics determined to be preferred and/or desirable according to the activity of the participants of the social shopping trip.
- the system may further take into account preferences of each of the participants of the social shopping trip.
- the social shopping application may maintain a user profile associated with each user. Each user may be a participant in one or more social shopping trips.
- the system may determine user preferences based on the user's activity in past or ongoing social shopping trips. Such preferences may include item characteristics such as brand, color, size, price range, category, store, store type, or other similar item characteristics preferred by the user based on their social shopping activity and purchase history.
- the system may determine one or more contact preferences for each user (e.g., contacts the user usually enjoys shopping with or relies on when making purchasing decisions).
- the system may also identify historical information regarding similar social shopping trips or users (e.g., based on the item characteristics associated with the social shopping trip and or participants) and may provide the historical information as purchase context information for negotiation purchases.
- a second price negotiation technique involves competitive-based price negotiation.
- the system may allow stores to compete more efficiently by providing stores with an opportunity to compete for purchasers when competing items are posted and favored (e.g., based on feedback data), and allowing the store to provide incentives to the user to increase the chance of the user purchasing the item from the store. For example, where multiple similar items are posted to the social shopping trip and one is favored (e.g., based on feedback by participants or being placed within a social shopping cart of one or more participants), the system may notify the other stores (e.g., online retailer, physical store) that the user is likely to pass on their item. The store may provide a lower price or other incentives to encourage the participants better compete with the store providing the competing item.
- the system provides the participants and stores with an effective way for negotiating prices.
- the system may search for other retailers offering the item for sale and may search for best offered prices.
- the availability of better offers may be a criteria used when negotiating prices for the user. For example, the system may identify an item being offered at a better price and may determine if the original retailer or any other retailers offering the item for sale are willing to offer a better price or other incentives to the participants of the social shopping trip to entice the participants to shop from that retailer.
- Stores may provide pre-defined price negotiation criteria and the system may determine negotiated prices for items based on the pre-defined price negotiation criteria.
- the system may access a price negotiation database (e.g., over a remote price negotiation service or directly through the system).
- the database may include combinations of price negotiation criteria (e.g., number of users willing the purchase an item, quantity of item, purchasing history of users, purchasing likelihood, presence of competing items, price difference with competing items) and lower prices and/or other incentives (e.g., one or more based on the negotiation criteria met).
- the system may compare the information with the pre-defined price negotiation criteria to provide the user with a negotiated price upon determining information regarding the items posted to a social shopping trip (or other social shopping application or environment).
- the system may provide notifications to stores upon receiving a request from a user to obtain a better price or negotiate the price of goods.
