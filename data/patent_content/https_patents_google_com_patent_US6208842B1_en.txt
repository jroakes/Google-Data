Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to communication systems and, in particular, to a method and apparatus for estimating one or more radio channel parameters within a mobile communication system.
- Radio location techniques are widely used in many mobile transmitter systems. Among these location techniques are a) Time of Arrival (TOA), b) Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), and c) Angle of Arrival (AOA) methods. Each of these techniques requires either the measurement or estimation of one or more parameters of the communication channel utilized by the mobile transmitter.
- TOA Time of Arrival
- TDOA Time Difference of Arrival
- AOA Angle of Arrival
- CDMA code division multiple access
- Correlation with a reference waveform can also be interpreted as despreading followed by coherent averaging. Up to a point, the longer the correlation (coherent averaging length), the more despreading gain is obtained. Effects from noise and interference on these channel estimates, which are normally severe, can be made arbitrarily small so long as the despreading gain can be increased. In practice, the maximum despreading gain is limited by the non-stationarity of the communication channel. If the communication channel lacks sufficient stationarity, a longer averaging window will ultimately result in a decrease in despreading gain below the maximum achievable level. Thus, it is desirable to determine the optimal coherent averaging length and the corresponding maximum despreading gain for the radio channel conditions achievable at any given observation.

- the communication system 100 includes a number of network elements such as a base station 101 , a Centralized Base Station Controller (CBSC) 103 , and a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 104 .
- Suitable network elements are commercially available from Motorola, Inc. (Motorola, Inc. is located at 1301 East Algonquin Road, Schaumburg, Ill. 60196).
- a remote unit 113 is configured to operate within the system 100 . It is contemplated that the network elements within the communication system 100 are configured in well known manners with processors, memories, instruction sets, and the like, which function in any suitable manner to perform the functions set forth herein.

- PSTN public switched telephone network
- the base station 101 is configured as is well known to provide communications services to a plurality (typically three or six) communication sectors surrounding the base station 101 .
- the base station 101 has a common radio frequency (RF) front end 201 coupled to the receiver antenna array 203 .
- the RF front end 201 feeds baseband I, Q signals to the CDMA channel circuitry 205 and to a large storage buffer 207 .
- the CDMA channel circuitry 205 preferably provides for locking to at least three different received rays at least one PN chip time apart, and as such, is typical of most rake receivers utilized in CDMA systems.
- the CDMA channel circuitry 205 feeds the earliest PN offsets to a frequency domain searcher 209 .
- the channel circuitry 205 further feeds demodulated information bits to a duplicate mobile transmitter stage 211 , which re-modulates the information bits providing reference baseband I, Q signals to the searcher 209 .
- the searcher 209 further receives as an input the stored baseband I, Q signals from the storage buffer 207 .
- the searcher 209 as will be described, provides channel parameter estimates.
- a second or adjacent sector 202 of the base station 101 is similarly configured with an RF front end 213 coupled to an antenna array 214 , a large storage buffer 215 , a frequency domain searcher 217 , CDMA channel circuitry (not depicted) and a duplicate mobile transmitter stage (not depicted).
- the searcher 217 is further fed PN offset integration parameters from the searcher 209 in the serving sector 200 .
- serving sector and adjacent sector is for the purpose of clarifying the functions performed within the base station 101 , and that the adjacent sector may act as a serving sector and vice versa without departing from the principles of the invention.
- base station 102 is configured in a manner similar to the base station 101 serving a plurality of sectors.
- a single sector 300 is depicted and includes a RF front end 301 coupled to an antenna array 302 , a large storage buffer 303 , a duplicate mobile transmitter stage 305 , a frequency domain searcher 307 and CDMA channel circuitry (not depicted).

- the buffer 303 feeds stored baseband I, Q signals received from the remote unit 113 and for the same epoch of time corresponding to the reference baseband I, Q signals generated from the information bits.
- One application of the present invention is for location determination of the remote unit 113 operating within the communication system 100 .
- the remote unit 113 may also be adapted to use the principles of the invention to determine its own location within the communication system 100 .
- estimates of channel parameters, such as delay, amplitude and phase must be obtained for multiple signals.
- the searchers 209 , 213 and 307 are adapted to provide such estimates.
- discrete time sampled baseband I, Q representations are stored within the buffers 207 , 215 and 307 .
- the samples are collected in such a way that the precise instant that they were captured is known unambiguously in terms of the system time reference.
- Each buffer 207 , 215 and 307 is large, storing as much as a half-second or more of the received waveform, and may store between about 0.1 to about 2.0 seconds of the received waveform.
- the invention has application where the signal sample is of substantially shorter or substantially longer duration than the aforementioned range.
- Data collection at the serving sector 200 , adjacent sector 202 and remote sector 300 is synchronized so that the same time-span is represented in all of the buffers 207 , 215 and 307 at any instant.
- the CDMA channel circuitry 205 demodulates the baseband I, Q signals of interest and produces the information bits and corresponding time information. The information bits are collected and stored in memory within the base station 101 .
- the channel circuitry 205 may also provide its own searcher results that may be utilized to provide a search seed and/or to narrow the search window as described below. Techniques for narrowing the search window are described in the commonly assigned U.S. patent application entitled “METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR LOCATING A REMOTE UNIT WITHIN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM”, filed of even date herewith application Ser. No. 09/409,552 filed Sep. 30, 1999 the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, if a reverse-link pilot signal is available, then the described demodulation stage is not necessary.
- the invention also has application to the case of a remote unit determining its location (i.e., location based on forward link signals).
- pilot signals may be assumed to be available for the forward link signals of each of the base stations. Therefore, the demodulation would not be necessary.
- This configuration would only require the remote unit perform the downconversion, sampling and collection of complex baseband samples in a buffer for subsequent analysis, and remodulation of the known pilot sequence.
- the bits are re-modulated using the duplicate mobile transmitter stage 211 at the serving sector 200 and the duplicate mobile transmitter stage 305 at the remote sector 300 to produce reference baseband I, Q signals.
- the searchers 209 , 213 and 307 process the stored waveforms and the reference waveforms to produce channel parameter estimates, such as signal delay, gain and possibly the complex channel impulse response.
- each of the searchers 209 , 213 and 307 is identical and the following description with respect to the searcher 209 is applicable to each. It will be appreciated that the functionality of the searcher 209 may be implemented as software on magnetic or optical media, firmware, a programmable gate array or an application specific integrated circuit without departing from the fair scope of the invention.
- multipliers 401 - 405 point-by-point multiply the baseband I, Q signal stored within the buffer 207 by the reference baseband I, Q signal over a range of delay offsets 407 - 413 from D 0 to D(S-1), where S is an initial search window length.
- sub-group 4 is representative of one particular delay offset evaluated by the searcher.
- the term sub-group is used to refer to delay offsets; however, a sub-group may be any propagation path delay component, multipath delay component or other sub-portions of the received signal, including overlapping sub-portions, without departing from the invention.
- the search window length i.e., the number of sub-groups or delay offsets which require evaluation, may be shortened using searcher results from the channel circuitry 205 and/or using the techniques described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application “METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR LOCATING A REMOTE UNIT WITHIN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.”
- the delay shifts may be simply implemented by offsetting a read pointer in the buffer 207 . If the candidate PN offset Dj corresponds to an actual signal component, the resulting signal S 1 Dj(n) should correspond to a highly over sampled low pass waveform with significant additive white noise.
- a hypothetical one-sided spectrum for S 1 Dj(n) is depicted in FIG. 5 .
- Decimators 415 - 419 decimate the product signals S 1 Dj(n) by a factor N, and associated low pass anti-aliasing filters 421 - 425 introduce coherent averaging.
- the decimation may be completed efficiently (though suboptimally) by simply adding N samples together then skipping N samples. Other efficient decimation schemes are also possible.
- the sample rate should be decimated so that the component of the signal with the highest carrier frequency offset (including Doppler shift) is represented without frequency aliasing.
- the maximum allowable carrier frequency offset due to non-ideal characteristics of a remote unit in accordance with the IS-95 protocol is about 300 MHZ.
- the resulting waveform of total accumulated length iM is zero-padded (FIG. 7) to a length 2 L by zero-padding operators 427 - 431 .
- a 2 L point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is computed over the zero-padded signal waveform for each offset D j and each length iM using FFT operators 433 - 437 to generate an FFT output spectrum. Because the signal is highly decimated, the FFT operators 433 - 437 should require only moderate amounts of computation and storage.
- the FFT output S i,Dj for each nonzero input of length iM corresponds to iM-length coherent averaging.
- Each one of the 2 L FFT outputs corresponds to coherent averaging with frequency compensation for one of 2 L different possible carrier frequency offsets.
- a signal to noise energy metric E i,Dj /N i is computed by operators 439 - 443 .
- One of two computations may be used by the operators 439 - 443 as described below.
- a maximum and minimum frequency (F high and F low , respectively) spanning the range of signal spectral components is selected by applying a threshold to the spectrum. Square energy is integrated over this whole span to produce a signal energy metric E i,Dj .
- the concept is illustrated in FIG. 8 .
- the signal component frequency range is determined by finding the maximum and minimum frequency components with energies that clear a threshold, T i .
- T i is computed by multiplying the estimated noise energy N i by a scaling constant ⁇ . The computation of N i is described below.
- Signal components are only sought over a range below F max and above F min , which represents the realistic maximum carrier frequency offsets in positive and negative directions, and thus represents a region of the FFT output spectrum that might contain signal components.
- F max and F min would be set at +/ ⁇ 600 Hz.
- the value N i proportional to the accumulated noise energy is computed for each signal length iM, but only at one delay offset. This offset is arbitrarily chosen to be the one with the smallest delay.
- the single estimate N i is used in the ratios E i,Dj /N i for all delay offsets.
- N i is computed by summing the square energy of all frequency components above a maximum possible signal frequency, F max and below a minimum negative frequency offset F min , in a region of the FFT output spectrum that does not contain signal components.
- FIGS. 7 and 8, show F min as it would be located in an FFT output, with negative frequencies covering a range above Fs/2.
- the energy metrics E i,Dj are averaged to produce E i,avg for each index i by operators 445 - 449 .
- the maximum energy E i,Dmax is determined, and when for some i it exceeds the average energy for all offsets by a factor ⁇ , the search window is narrowed to a width 2W+1 (FIG. 10 ).
- Operator 451 accomplishes this by excluding all delay offsets D j from further examination that fall outside the range (Dmax ⁇ W,Dmax+W).
- the value W should be chosen to significantly reduce the total computation required to complete the analysis, but should be wide enough to span the whole channel impulse response.
- the values E i,Dj and N i are preferably retained in memory for all surviving offsets for each index i.
- the despread decimated waveform for all surviving offsets are preferably retained and accumulated until the entire contents of the storage buffer are processed.
- E i,Dj /N i energy to noise ratio metrics for surviving offset candidates
- the best metric is determined for each offset by maximizing over i. This maximization step is illustrated in FIG. 11 .
- the best metric may then be mapped back to an optimal coherent averaging length, carrier frequency offset and delay offset. Providing at least one metric exceeds a threshold T 2 , the operator 453 determines the earliest offset with maximum E i /N i exceeding the threshold T 2 . This offset is considered the earliest arriving component.
- the earliest delay offset with signal energy is known and the integration time iM that maximizes its energy-to-noise ratio is known.
- This offset immediately yields an estimate for time-of-arrival, which may be the only desired parameter.
- additional parameters may now be extracted from the data.
- the smallest delay offset satisfying the channel parameter threshold criteria is generally referred to as the “prompt ray,” i.e., the earliest arriving ray.
- the propagation delay of the “prompt ray” is typically the closest estimate to the distance between the mobile and the base station.
- the FFT peak value corresponding to the earliest delay yields an estimate of the complex channel gain for that signal component.
- the power spectrum and delay profile should be nearly identical on other antennas at the same site.
- corresponding complex gains for the earliest component can be obtained from either adjacent sector antennas or additional phase array antennas. These gain values can be used to compute a direction-of-arrival estimate.
- a suitable method is described in commonly assigned U.S.
- a channel impulse response is also desired.
- the FFT values must be collected for a specific frequency over a range of delays and a chosen length iM. That is, a series of FFT's must be recomputed using the length that was determined to be optimal, and the outputs collected for the desired frequency. Because the despread waveforms have been retained for a search window spanning the impulse response, this should only require a small amount of additional computation.
