general introduction
Usually, exemplary aspect of the present disclosure relates to and uses one or more computing equipment to identify the compass name that is associated with the traffic trip along traffic route to use in the departure time of such as dividing into groups to be associated with the traffic trip at traffic website place or time of arrival.As used herein, traffic route refers to the specific circuit of the such as public transportation system that rail system, subway system, bus system, ferry system or other public transportation system are such.Traffic route can be associated with one or more traffic website.Traffic website can refer to the station that one or more traffic route or other communications and transportation pattern arrive and/or leave or website.Traffic trip can refer to the example of advancing by one or more traffic route.Traffic trip can be associated with such as departure time and/or time of arrival such a or multiple traffic time.Traffic trip also can be associated with route plate.The route plate be associated with traffic trip can refer to the traffic website of the destination being used as traffic trip.
Traffic programme service can provide the train of such as each station or website, motorbus and other public transportation is set out and the information of the announcement timetable of time of arrival.Such as, the traffic programme service information that the list of setting out of the traffic trip at such as traffic website place can be provided such.First by traffic route and after this pass course board divides into groups to this list of setting out.
Fig. 1 depicts the example user interface 100 for providing in the upper display of computing equipment 102 (such as smart phone, panel computer, navigational system, the display with one or more processor, wearable computing equipment etc.).Such as present user interface 100 by public transport planning service.As directed, user interface 100 presents the multiple departure times be associated with the available traffic trip at traffic website (in this example " Sample website ") place.First by traffic route 110 (in this example " circuit A " traffic route), multiple departure time is divided into groups.After this pass course board divided into groups to the departure time.Such as, under first group of departure time 112 being grouped into route plate " route plate A ".Under being grouped into route plate " route plate B " second group of departure time 114.3rd group of departure time 116 to be grouped under route plate " route plate C " etc.
For some traffic websites and traffic route, there are the many route plates be associated from the different traffic trips on traffic route.Although there are many route plates, traffic trip can only typically advanced in the both direction of traffic route.Such as, the traffic trip along subway transportation circuit can be advanced on first direction or second direction.According to exemplary aspect of the present disclosure, divide into groups to simplify to the traffic time be associated with traffic trip (such as departure time or time of arrival) by the direction of the traffic trip along traffic route and the information strengthened to user presents.
Such as, Fig. 2 depict according to exemplary aspect of the present disclosure provide for display on the computing device, the example user interface 200 that presents by traffic programme service.As shown, user interface 200 presents and can be used for from traffic website (multiple departure times of being associated of each traffic trip of " Sample website ") in this example.User interface 200 presents first by departure time of dividing into groups in traffic route 210 and 240.After this by direction, the departure time is divided into groups.Such as, by direction 220 " towards X " and direction 230 " towards Y ", the departure time be associated with traffic route 210 is divided into groups.By direction 250 " towards X " and direction 260 " towards Z ", the departure time be associated with traffic route 240 is divided into groups.As further illustrated in fig. 2, after this by route plate, the departure time is divided into groups.
The compass name relevant to traffic trip can be pointed out according to important on traffic route or busy traffic website/destination (such as via " station 1 ", towards " station 2 " etc.).This information can not be that the typical public transportation data source of serving the data source of accessing such from such as traffic programme obtains.Exemplary aspect of the present disclosure relates to and automatically identifies important traffic website to be used as the basis of compass name of traffic trip.Compass name can be used for such as dividing into groups to the traffic time be associated with the traffic trip with reference to traffic website place.As following traffic website, will will determine that from described traffic website direction, traffic route and/or the departure time to described traffic website divide into groups with reference to traffic website.
More particularly, identifiable design goes out the multiple traffic websites along the traffic route be associated with reference to traffic website.May have access to the sequence (such as weak sequence) of rank is carried out in instruction to multiple traffic website data according to importance (such as being weighed by frequency of utilization or other proper standard).Important traffic website between the reference traffic website that the sequence of multiple traffic website can be used to identify be associated with traffic trip and terminal traffic website.The station name be associated with identified important traffic website can be used as the basis of the compass name be associated with the traffic trip at specific referenced stations place.
Such as, the departure time list of the traffic trip that the traffic programme services request that user can realize from the one or more computing equipment of use be associated with special traffic website (namely with reference to traffic website).Traffic programme service is divided into groups to the departure time by traffic route.According to exemplary aspect of the present disclosure, the sequence of the traffic website along traffic route identified to important traffic station to call the roll the compass name determining to be associated with traffic trip by using.After this traffic programme service by identified compass name and other parameter using such as route plate such the departure time is divided into groups.After this departure time through grouping can be presented to user in suitable user interface presented on the display device.
According to particular aspects of the present disclosure, the sequence of the multiple traffic websites along traffic route is carried out at least in part to the weak sequence of rank to traffic website based on the data of the frequency of utilization of instruction traffic website.Such as, weak sequence is at least in part based on the setting out and/or arrive number, at least based on the transfer number at each place of multiple traffic website and/or at least in part based on the passenger's number using this traffic website of each place of multiple traffic website.
In particular example realizes, sequence can be accessed and identify station name for the traffic website by identifying the rank being positioned at the downstream of the reference traffic website of traffic trip in this sequence the highest.The station name of the traffic website that rank is the highest can be used as the basis of compass name.
In some example implementation, traffic route can be associated from the multiple different traffic trip advancing to different traffic website.Such as, different directions can be branched to from the traffic trip that identical traffic route is associated so that different terminal traffic website.In this example, the traffic website that this sequence can be used to identify rank that multiple traffic trip shares is the highest.The station name that the traffic website that the rank shared with multiple traffic trip is the highest is associated can be used as the basis of the compass name of the traffic trip with reference to traffic website place.
for determining the flow process of the exemplary method of the compass name of the traffic trip with reference to traffic website place
figure
Fig. 3 depicts the process flow diagram of the illustrative methods (300) of the compass name for determining the traffic trip with reference to traffic website place according to exemplary aspect of the present disclosure.The step that Fig. 3 depict the object in order to illustrate and discuss and perform with particular order.Use the disclosure provided here, what it should be understood by one skilled in the art that is each mode can adapt, rearrange, omit, expand and/or revise each step of any method disclosed herein without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
In (302), the method comprises the multiple traffic trips identified with reference to traffic website.With reference to traffic website following traffic website, for that defining the compass name of traffic trip and/or dividing into groups to the traffic time be associated with traffic trip for it.Such as, in an example embodiment, user can from traffic programme services request and the information be associated of going on a journey from the special traffic of special traffic website.Can be reference traffic website by the special traffic station recognition of the theme being exactly this request.Each of multiple traffic trip can be associated with traffic time (such as departure time or time of arrival) and route plate.The title of the traffic website be associated with traffic trip that the destination that route plate is such as associated with traffic trip is such.
In (304), the method comprises by dividing into groups to multiple traffic trip with at least one traffic route be associated with reference to traffic website.At least one traffic route can be identified from public transportation network data.Such as, may have access to the data of instruction traffic schedule, traffic map and other data to identify from reference traffic station point and/or at least one traffic route arriving reference traffic website.
In (306), the method comprises the multiple traffic websites identified along at least one traffic route.Multiple traffic website can be gone out from the data identification of instruction traffic schedule, traffic map and traffic programme service other data addressable.This multiple traffic website can comprise all traffic websites that the special traffic circuit across one or more traffic trip goes to.
In (308), the method comprises the sequence of accessing multiple traffic website.To traffic website, rank is carried out based on the data of the frequency of utilization of the traffic website in instruction transportation network at least in part to the sequence of multiple traffic website.Such as, this sequence can be that such as following " sequence I " (is expressed as <=_I (a, b)) so weak sequence, described " sequence I " is corresponding with the importance classification of traffic website so that a<=_Ib indicates the importance of a to be less than or equal to the importance of b.In simple example, according to the most front traffic website of rank of sequence main traffic website (such as hinge) or the traffic website that is associated with airport.The traffic website be associated with second row name has the main traffic website of many traffic routes and transfer.The traffic website that the example of the traffic website that rank is lower is only served by single traffic route.
In an example implementation, sort based on the component form being less than or equal to the comparison with following multiple component, described multiple component comprises passenger's score, score of setting out and transfer to score.Passenger's score can at least in part based on passenger's number of the estimation at given period use traffic website.Score of setting out can at least in part based on the number that sets out in such as calendar week such period at this traffic website.Transfer to score can at least in part based on traffic website possible transfer to number.Such as, assuming that random arrival, transfer to number and can to equal within a period of time (such as 30 minutes) possible due to obvious route plate and transfer to number.Other suitable factor can be used for determining sequence without departing from the scope of the disclosure.Such as, can use arrival score, this arrival score is at least in part based on the number at a period of time exterior traffic website.
The cluster of certain form can be experienced so that for each component in each score determining to use in the process sorted or other component, have limited number equivalence class.Such as, if having 541 to set out at a traffic website and have 550 to set out at another traffic website, so these two traffic websites can have equivalence and to set out score.Such as relevant public statistics can be used to visit data for generation of sorting from public transportation data and with passenger.
In (310), the method comprises the compass name determining the traffic trip with reference to traffic website place at least in part based on this sequence.More specifically, can determine compass name based on the station name be associated with following traffic website at least in part, described traffic website identifies based on the sequence of multiple traffic website at least in part.Such as, compass name is " via station A ", wherein identifies traffic website " station A " based on the sequence to traffic website at least in part according to exemplary aspect of the present disclosure.As another example, compass name is " towards station B ", wherein identifies based on to the sequence of traffic website at least in part according to exemplary aspect traffic website " station B " of the present disclosure.
In a specific implementation, the compass name of traffic trip is that the traffic website that the rank in the ranking in the downstream by identifying the reference traffic website in traffic trip is the highest is determined.The station name that the traffic website the highest with rank is associated can be used as the basis of compass name.
Such as, Fig. 4 depicts the expression having and to advance on direction 414 and go to the example traffic circuit 410 of the traffic trip 412 of traffic website A, B, C, D and E.Traffic website E is used as the terminal traffic website 416 of traffic trip 412, because it is the last traffic website be associated with traffic trip 412.Traffic website A, B, C, D and E are associated from the different ranks in the sequence of traffic website.Such as, traffic website B is associated with the rank " 1 " in sequence.Traffic website C is associated with the rank " 3 " in sequence.Traffic website D is associated with the rank " 2 " in sequence.Traffic website E is associated with the rank " 1 " in sequence.Because sequence is weak sequence, therefore some traffic websites can share identical rank.
Can be identified as " via C " with reference to the compass name of the traffic trip 412 at traffic website A place, because the traffic website C traffic website that to be the rank that goes to reference to trip 412 downstream of traffic website A the highest.Also can be identified as " via C " with reference to the compass name of the traffic trip 412 at traffic website B place, because traffic website C is still the highest traffic website of rank that the traffic trip 412 with reference to the downstream of traffic website B goes to.Can be identified as " via D " with reference to the compass name of the traffic trip 412 at traffic website C place, because the traffic website D traffic website that to be the rank that goes to reference to the traffic trip 412 in the downstream of traffic website B the highest.Can be identified as " via E " with reference to the compass name of the traffic trip 412 at traffic website D place, because the only surplus traffic that the trip 412 that traffic website E is the downstream of reference traffic website D goes to.
As follows for carrying out automatically to determine an exemplary algorithm of the compass name of traffic trip in this manner.The compass name be associated with the traffic trip along traffic route l at traffic website s place is called stop_direction_name (I, s).
1. calculate sequence <=_I (a, b)
2. for each traffic trip of each traffic route l:
A. allow s_1, s_2 ..., s_n is traffic website along traffic trip
B. x=s_n is set, along the terminal traffic website of traffic trip
C. for i=n-1 to 1:
I., stop_direction_name (I, s_i)=" via "+s_x is set
If ii. x<=_Is_i, so arranges x=s_i.
It should be noted for last website s_n, do not calculate stop_direction_name, because setting out and therefore not direction not further along this trip.
In some example implementation, different traffic website can be gone to from the traffic trip that identical traffic route is associated.More particularly, traffic route can be associated with the first traffic trip and the second traffic trip, and wherein the first traffic trip goes at least one traffic website along the traffic route different from the second traffic trip.Such as, different traffic trips can be able to be the subsequence of another traffic trip along this traffic route along traffic route bifurcated or traffic trip.In this example, desirable is in the identification of the station name to traffic website, get rid of some traffic website using the basis as the compass name be associated with traffic trip.In order to realize this, by identify the first traffic trip and the second traffic trip are had and the traffic website that the rank in the downstream of reference traffic website in the first traffic trip and the second traffic trip is the highest to determine compass name.The station name that the traffic website the highest with the rank had the first traffic trip and the second traffic trip can be associated is identified as the compass name that special traffic is gone on a journey.
Such as, Fig. 5 depicts the expression of the example traffic circuit 420 of the first traffic trip 422 having and go to traffic website A, B, C, F and G and the second traffic trip 424 going to traffic website A, B, C, D and E.Traffic website G is used as the terminal traffic website 426 of the first traffic trip 422.Traffic website E is used as the terminal traffic website 428 of the second traffic trip 424.Traffic website A, B, C, D, E, F and G are associated from the different ranks in the sequence of traffic website.Such as, traffic website B is associated with the rank " 1 " in this sequence.Traffic website C is associated with the rank " 3 " in this sequence.Traffic website D is associated with the rank " 4 " in this sequence.Traffic website E is associated with the rank " 1 " in this sequence.Traffic website F is associated with the rank " 4 " in this sequence.Traffic website G is associated with the rank " 1 " in this sequence.
Can be identified as " via C " with reference to the compass name of first traffic trip 422 at traffic website A place, because traffic website C is to the first traffic trip 422 and the total and traffic website that rank that the is downstream of reference traffic website in the first traffic trip 422 is the highest of the second traffic trip 424.Similarly, the compass name of the second traffic trip 424 with reference to traffic website A place is " via C ", because traffic website C has the first traffic trip 422 and the second traffic trip 424 and the highest traffic website of the rank in the downstream of reference traffic website in the second traffic trip 424.
Can also be identified as " via C " with reference to the compass name of first traffic trip 422 at traffic website B place because traffic website C be still to the first traffic trip 422 and the second traffic trip 424 total and the traffic website that the rank in the downstream of reference traffic website in the first traffic trip 424 is the highest.Similarly, the compass name of the second traffic trip 424 with reference to traffic website B place is " via C ", because traffic website C has the first traffic trip 422 and the second traffic trip 424 and the highest traffic website of the rank in the downstream of reference traffic website in the second traffic trip 424.
Can be identified as " via F " with reference to the compass name of first traffic trip 422 at traffic website C place, because there is not more total traffic website and the traffic website F traffic website that to be the rank in the downstream of the reference traffic website being arranged in the first traffic trip 422 the highest between the first traffic trip 422 and the second traffic trip 424.Similarly, can be identified as " via D " with reference to the compass name of second traffic trip 424 at traffic website C place, because there is not more total traffic website and the traffic website D traffic website that to be the rank in the downstream of reference traffic website in the second traffic trip 424 the highest between the first traffic trip 422 and the second traffic trip 424.
Can be identified as " via G " with reference to the compass name of first traffic trip 422 at traffic website F place, because traffic website G is the only surplus traffic website be associated with the first traffic trip 422.The compass name of second traffic trip 424 at referenced stations D place " via E " because traffic website E is the only surplus traffic website be associated with the second traffic trip 424.
Fig. 6 depicts another example traffic circuit 430 with the first traffic trip 432 and the second traffic trip 434.First traffic trip 432 goes to traffic website A, B, C, D and E.Second traffic trip 434 goes to the subsequence of traffic website, i.e. traffic website B, C and D.Traffic website E is used as the terminal traffic website 436 of the first traffic trip 432.Traffic website D is used as the terminal traffic website 438 of the second traffic trip 424.Traffic website A, B, C, D and E are associated from the different ranks in the sequence of traffic website.Such as, traffic website B is associated with the rank " 1 " in this sequence.Traffic website C is associated with the rank " 3 " in this sequence.Traffic website D is associated with the rank " 2 " in this sequence.Traffic website E is associated with the rank " 5 " in this sequence.
Can be identified as " via E " with reference to the compass name of first traffic trip 432 at traffic website A place, because the traffic website E traffic website that to be rank that the first traffic trip 432 goes to the highest.Can be identified as " via C " with reference to the compass name of first traffic trip 432 at traffic website B place, because traffic website C is to the first traffic trip 432 and the total and traffic website that rank that the is downstream of reference traffic website in the first traffic trip 432 is the highest of the second traffic trip 434.Similarly, the compass name of the second traffic trip 434 with reference to traffic website B place is " via C ", because traffic website C has the first traffic trip 432 and the second traffic trip 434 and the highest traffic website of the rank in the downstream of reference traffic website in the second traffic trip 434.
Can be identified as " via D " with reference to the compass name of first traffic trip 432 at traffic website C place, because traffic website D is to the first traffic trip 432 and the total and traffic website that rank that the is downstream of reference traffic website in the first traffic trip 434 is the highest of the second traffic trip 434.Similarly, the compass name of the second traffic trip 434 with reference to traffic website C place is " via D ", because traffic website D has the first traffic trip 432 and the second traffic trip 434 and is the traffic website that the rank in the downstream of the reference traffic website in the second traffic trip 434 is the highest.Compass name with reference to first traffic trip 432 at traffic website D place is " via E ", because traffic website E is the only surplus traffic website be associated with the first traffic trip 432.
As follows for determining an exemplary algorithm of the compass name of traffic trip in this manner:
1. calculate sequence <=_I (a, b)
2. calculate traffic website S (I, a, b) set :={ x:x uses leg (a, decline T (the t of the trip t of circuit l b), b) the traffic website in common factor, wherein T (t, b) is the set of the traffic website along the trip t from traffic website b }
3. for each traffic trip of each traffic route l:
