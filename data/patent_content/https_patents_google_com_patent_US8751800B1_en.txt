Definitions
- the present embodiments relate generally to enabling access to protected content and, more particularly, but not exclusively, to using a trust relationship between a content provider and one or media player/content decryption module (CDM) providers to determine whether to send a license/decryption key to a client device having a media player/CDM from the media player/CDM provider to allow access to protected content.
- CDM media player/content decryption module
- Such media content may include virtually any format or form, including songs, videos, images, documents, games, books, articles, and/or other audio content, to name just a few examples of media content that some parties may wish to protect.

If the client device has not provided such information, then in one embodiment, processing may flow to block 704 , where a request is sent to the client device for such information. Processing then flows to decision block 706 . However, at decision block 702 , where no request is to be sent to the client device for information about a configuration of media player/CDM supported by the client device, then processing may also flow to decision block 706 .
- an application, user agent, or the like, within the client device may send a query to a media player/CDM requesting configuration information.
- the query may be performed automatically without having received a request for the information at block 704 , or in response to the request received at the client device from block 704 .
- the request at the application in the client device may employ various techniques, including, but not limited to a canPlayType( ) method, command, or the like. Other mechanisms may also be used.
- a review of existing trust relationships is performed to determine whether a trust relationship is established for the media player(s)/CDM(s) identified by configuration information received from the client device. It may be that several media player(s)/CDM(s) have trust relationships. In this instance, in one embodiment, each of the configurations where a trust relationship is established may be selected. In one embodiment, a subset of configurations with established trust relationships may be selected, based on various criteria, including a level of trust, a frequency of use, a business agreement with the MPPD/CDM providers, to limit a number of encryptions of licenses/decryption keys performed, or the like. Processing then flows to decision block 712 .
- a review of established trust relationships may indicate that one or more media players/CDMs may have established trust relationships.
- one or more configurations may be selected based on the established trusted relationships and criteria. Processing flows next to decision block 712 .
- verification/attestation may also employ public key encryption. In one embodiment, such verification may employ the same trust relationships and interoperability as used for encrypting of a license/decryption key(s), as discussed elsewhere.
- access to a requested license/decryption key(s) may be denied. In one embodiment, this may be performed by refusing to use public keys, encrypting, and/or sending encrypted license(s)/decryption key(s) to the client device. In one embodiment, sending of the protected content may also be denied, terminated, or access otherwise hindered. Processing then returns to a calling process to perform other actions.
- corresponding public keys for the trust relationships may be accessed.
- the public keys may then be used (in process 600 ) to encrypt the license(s)/decryption key(s). Processing then returns to a calling process to perform other actions.
- FIG. 8 illustrates one embodiment of a flow diagram usable by a client device for accessing license/decryption key(s) for use in accessing protected content.
- Process 800 of FIG. 8 may be implemented within a client device, such as illustrated in FIGS. 1-2 , and 5 , where at least a portion of the process may be implemented within a CDM, media player, and/or a user agent within the client device.
- Process 800 begins, after a start block, at block 802 , where a determination is made as to whether a license/decryption key(s) are needed by a client device to access content.
- determination may include information about where to access the license/decryption key(s), including information about a content provider's device, or the like.
- information might take the form of a Universal Resource Locator (URL), or other network address to the content provider's device, or repository for licenses/decryption key(s).
- a client device may have received the protected content, and attempted to display, play, or otherwise access the content, and received information from a CDM, media player, or the like, that a license, and/or decryption key(s) are needed.
- Processing may continue to decision block 804 , where a determination is made as to an integrity of the client device, the CDM attempting to access the content, a media player attempting to access the content, operating system, platform, software environment, or the like.
- the CDM may include one or more modules arranged to monitor an integrity of various components of the client device, and determine whether or not the integrity is confirmed, unverifiable, or otherwise fails an integrity analysis. If at decision block 804 , the integrity of the client device, CDM, and/or media player is confirmed, processing flows to block 806 ; otherwise, processing flows to block 818 .
- a request for a license(s)/decryption key(s) may be sent to a content provider device.
- the request may be sent from a CDM through a media player, and application or user agent to a CPD.
- a query may be performed within the client device to determine the configuration of media players/CDMs supported.
- the configuration information may then be sent to a CPD. Processing then flows to block 812 .
- one or more encrypted licenses and/or one or more decryption keys are received.
- another integrity check may be performed.
- the integrity checks may be performed concurrent with process 800 , such that an interrupt, or other action may be performed indicating whether the integrity of the media player, CDM, and/or client device is confirmed. If the integrity check returns a negative indication, then processing flows to block 818 ; otherwise, processing flows to block 816 , where private key(s) are accessed corresponding to the public key(s) used to encrypt the received license(s)/decryption key(s).
- the private key(s) may then be used to decrypt the license(s)/decryption key(s) and enable access to the protected content.
- the decrypted decryption key(s) may be used to subsequently decrypt one or more portions of the protected content, while the decrypted license(s) provide instructions indicating where, when, how, by whom, and the like, regarding rights and/or entitlements to the protected content.
- a selection of which license/decryption key to decrypt may be performed using any of a variety of mechanisms, including, but not limited to header information, tags, and/or any of a variety of other structures, indices, or the like. Processing then returns.
- the access to one or more private keys may be denied, such that decryption of the license(s)/decryption key(s) is denied.
- other actions may also be performed. Processing then returns.
- each block of the flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustration can be implemented by computer program instructions.
- These program instructions may be provided to a processor to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute on the processor, create means for implementing the actions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.
- the computer program instructions may be executed by a processor to cause a series of operational steps to be performed by the processor to produce a computer-implemented process such that the instructions, which execute on the processor to provide steps for implementing the actions specified in the flowchart block or blocks.
- the computer program instructions may also cause at least some of the operational steps shown in the blocks of the flowchart to be performed in parallel.
- steps may also be performed across more than one processor, such as might arise in a multi-processor computer system, a cloud system, a multi-server system, or the like.
- one or more blocks or combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustration may also be performed concurrently with other blocks or combinations of blocks, or even in a different sequence than illustrated without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.
- blocks of the flowchart illustration support combinations of means for performing the specified actions, combinations of steps for performing the specified actions and program instruction means for performing the specified actions. It will also be understood that each block of the flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware based systems, which perform the specified actions or steps, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.
