- the features of product-feature database 190 may be used for providing product comparisons to the user of the mobile device 110 . While products may have many features, the most relevant features may be presented to the user for comparison.
- Features relevant to comparing products or to categories of products may be identified and specified into the product-feature database 190 manually. Relevant features may also be identified in an automated fashion or refined/maintained in an automated fashion once manually specified. Feature relevance may be crowd sourced to identify what is most important to users. For example, features of products that are often mentioned in reviews, blogs, social media, or other online forums may be assumed to be features of high relevance or importance to users.
- Feature relevance may also be established through examination of differentiating features. For example, if television products selected by the user for comparison have different diagonal dimensions, then that size feature may be relevant in comparing the products. Alternatively, if the user has selected all fifty-inch television to be compared, it is a lower relevance to compare that identical size feature between those selected products.
- Feature relevance may also be prioritized through feedback from the particular user. For example, if the user always seems to request price or sort by price when comparing or searching wine products, then it may be established that price is an important and relevant feature of wine products to the particular user.
- the values or data for the features within the product-feature database 190 may be populated or specified manually. They may also be provided as a feed from the manufacturer or from one or more vendors. They may also be scraped from online, print, or other sources.

Description
- The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for enabling mobile device users to compare products. A user may capture images or videos of products to compare using a camera associated with a mobile device.
- A customer shopping in a store may be presented with a potentially overwhelming array of choices. The customer may desire to research the choices to compare various products and to guide their selection. Traditional technology required researching or looking up each item separately. Even with the assistance of mobile devices, manually entering the specific name, model number, or other relevant identifier for each item to be compared is prohibitively cumbersome, time consuming, and error prone.
- In addition to challenges in rapidly obtaining detailed information on various products to be compared, meaningfully comparing products requires knowledge of important differentiating features. Understanding these differentiating features allows a user to determine which features are worth comparing between the various products. Without significant knowledge of the type of products being compared, a user lacks the background to identify these differentiating features and thus meaningfully compare two or more products against one another.
- In certain example embodiments described herein, methods and systems can compare products in a marketplace. An image or video of the products may be captured using a camera associated with a mobile device. User input may be received to select two or more products within the image or video. Machine vision techniques may be applied to specifically identify the selected products. Product features associated with each of the identified products may be retrieved and formatted into a comparison of product features. The comparison may be presented to the user.
- These and other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated exemplary embodiments, which include the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently perceived.

FIG. 6 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. - Embodiments described herein enable comparing features of products in response to a user of a mobile device capturing an image or video of the products in a marketplace. The user may capture an image or a video of products in a marketplace, such as a store, using a camera associated with the mobile device. Products may be automatically identified within the image or video. The user may select two or more of the identified products for comparison. Alternatively, the user may specify portions of the image or video to be examined prior to the automatic identification of products.
- Automatic identification of the products may include machine vision processing to extract visual identifiers within the image or video. The visual identifiers may include machine vision features, text, barcodes, or other coded information for identifying the product. The extracted features, text, barcodes, or other coded information may be leveraged to identify products from a database of product identifiers. Identification of the products may be assisted by first identifying a product category for the products being compared.
- Products identified and selected within the image or video may be compared for the user. This comparison may include displaying one or more tables to the user where the tables compare features of the products. The features for comparing products may vary based on the type or category of product being compared. The featured may be manually specified or automatically determined as those features significant to comparing a given category of products.
- Aspects of embodiments will be explained in more detail in the following description, read in conjunction with the figures illustrating the program flow.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a system for comparing products within an image or video in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. While shopping in a marketplace, such as a store, a user can capture an image of products. The image may be captured using acamera 130 associated with amobile device 110. Themobile device 110 may also include avisual display 140. Themobile device 110 can execute computer instructions associated with one or moremobile modules 120 to implement some or all aspects of the technology presented herein. - The
mobile device 110 can communicate with a productimage comparison server 160 over anetwork 150. The productimage comparison server 160 can execute computer instructions associated with one ormore server modules 170 to implement some or all aspects of the technology presented herein. The productimage comparison server 160 can access an image-product database 180 as well as a product-feature database 190. It should be appreciated that themobile device 110, the productimage comparison server 160, and other computing machines associated with this technology may be any type of computing machine such as, but not limited to, those discussed in more detail with respect toFIG. 6 . Furthermore, themobile modules 120, theserver modules 170, and any other modules (software, firmware, or hardware) associated with the technology presented herein may by any of the modules discussed in more detail with respect toFIG. 6 . Also, thenetwork 150 may be any of the network technology discussed with respect toFIG. 6 . - The
camera 130 associated with themobile device 110 may be used to capture an image. Thecamera 130 may include one ore more optical lenses or filters. Thecamera 130 may include a charge-couple device (“CCD”), a photo array, a sensor array, or any other image/video capture technology. The image may depict one or more products that the user of themobile device 110 wishes to compare features for. The term “image” as used throughout this disclosure should be understood to include a single image, multiple images, a series of images, a video, or any collection of images. A collection of images may comprise a physical array (such as a mosaic of images), a temporal array (such as a video clip, or time sequence of images), or any other set of images, whether those images are continuous, overlapping, or disjoint in time, position, or both. Images within the set may also be from varying angles, directions, zooms, close-ups, or so forth. - A
visual display 140 associated with themobile device 110 may be used as part of the user interface for themobile device 110. Thedisplay 140 may incorporate a touch screen surface. According to one or more embodiments presented herein, thedisplay 140 may be used to present images collected from thecamera 130 to the user. Presenting images to the user can allow the user to interact with the image, such as selecting items or regions of the image to identify, search, or process as discussed herein. Thedisplay 140 may also be used to present product comparison information to the user. - The
mobile device 110 may communicate over thenetwork 150 to access the productimage comparison server 160. The productimage comparison server 160 can execute computer instructions associated with one ormore server modules 170 to implement some or all aspects of the technology presented herein. - The image-
product database 180 may include mappings of image elements to various products. The image elements may include visual identifiers as well as text or coded identifiers. These mapping from the image-product database 180 may be used to identify products from visual features, text, or coded information that is extracted from an image. Various machine vision feature detection techniques may be used to extract features from images. These machine vision techniques may include correlation, filtering, matching, edge detection, corner detection, texture matching, pattern matching, and so forth. Products may be identified from their visual shapes, patterns, outlines, textures, or other features. For example, bottles have shapes distinctive from boxes. - According to one or more embodiments, algorithms similar to, or including, the scale-invariant feature transform (“SIFT”) may be used to detect and describe image features. Such algorithms can extract structure within an image to provide feature descriptions of objects compared against training data. Training data may be provided within the image-
product database 180 by applying the algorithms to images of known objects. - The image-
product database 180 may include mappings of products to one or more text or coded identifiers. Visual feature functionality or algorithms may also extract text, barcodes, or other coded information from images. This information may be compared against data from the image-product database 180 to identify products or categories of products within the image. The text extracted form the image may also include product names, model numbers, manufacturer name, or any other text to use in searching the image-product database 180. - The product-
feature database 190 can provide a mapping between products (or categories of products) and features or aspects of those products. For example a television product may be associated with features such as dimensional size of the screen, resolution, display technology, input ports, manufacturer, user reviews, and so forth. The features of product-feature database 190 may be used for providing product comparisons to the user of themobile device 110. While products may have many features, the most relevant features may be presented to the user for comparison. - Features relevant to comparing products or to categories of products may be identified and specified into the product-
feature database 190 manually. Relevant features may also be identified in an automated fashion or refined/maintained in an automated fashion once manually specified. Feature relevance may be crowd sourced to identify what is most important to users. For example, features of products that are often mentioned in reviews, blogs, social media, or other online forums may be assumed to be features of high relevance or importance to users. - Feature relevance may also be established through examination of differentiating features. For example, if television products selected by the user for comparison have different diagonal dimensions, then that size feature may be relevant in comparing the products. Alternatively, if the user has selected all fifty-inch television to be compared, it is a lower relevance to compare that identical size feature between those selected products.
- Feature relevance may also be prioritized through feedback from the particular user. For example, if the user always seems to request price or sort by price when comparing or searching wine products, then it may be established that price is an important and relevant feature of wine products to the particular user.
- The values or data for the features within the product-
feature database 190 may be populated or specified manually. They may also be provided as a feed from the manufacturer or from one or more vendors. They may also be scraped from online, print, or other sources. - It should be appreciated that, according to certain embodiments, various divisions of labor may be established between the mobile device 110 (and associated mobile modules 120) and the product image comparison server 160 (and associated pervert modules 170). According to some example embodiments, various functionality of the technology presented herein may be differently allocated for performance between the
mobile device 110, the productimage comparison server 160, other servers, or other computing devices. According to one of various other embodiments, all of the functionality may be carried out in an off-line, mobile environment by performing all of the functionality at themobile device 110. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting a system for capturing an image ofproducts 215 in amarketplace 210 and selectingproducts 215 from within the image in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. - The
marketplace 210 may be any type of store, warehouse, grocer, or other similar establishment. According to the illustrated example, themarketplace 210 is a shelving display of wine bottles. As such, the wine bottles are theexample products 215. - The mobile device may be used for capturing an image of the
marketplace 210. The image may then be presented to the user on thedisplay 140 associated with themobile device 110. The user may then select some or all of theproducts 215 for comparison. For example, the user may use theirfinger 220 to circle the selected products on thedisplay 140.Lines 230 may be presented on the display to show the user where they have selectedproducts 215.Products 215 may also be selected for comparison by the user through clicking or touching on the products in thedisplay 140. - Other selection techniques may be used such as voice command. For example, the user may speak the command “compare the 2010 happy leaf merlot with the 2011 otter farms merlot” into a microphone associated with the
mobile device 110. According to one or more embodiments, a voice command might also be used in classifying objects within the image. For example, if a voice command indicated to “compare wine X with wine Y,” then the word “wine” can be used as a feature for identifying the product and/or the product category. - Upon evaluation of the selected products, other products may be suggested to the user. These other products may be suggested because they have a higher rating, a better price, are similar to the selected products or for any other reasons.
- After selection of
products 215 to be compared, the selected products may be specifically identified using machine vision techniques applied to the image. For example, visual feature extraction, text extraction, or various coding extractions may be used to identify the specific bottles of wine such as the year, vineyard, and variety. These specific products may then be compared feature by feature and a comparison result may be created to present to the user. The result may include a table of compared features to be presented to user on thedisplay 140. - The
products 215 to be compared may be classified into one or more categories for feature comparison. Theproducts 215 assigned to a particular category may share a set of features. For example, wine products may have volume, percentage of alcohol, color, sweetness, rating score, reviews, and so forth. However, some of these features may be meaningless for television products where instead other features such as diagonal dimension and resolution may be quite relevant. When a category cannot be automatically identified, one or more likely categories may be presented to the user for selection at themobile device 110. - According to one or more embodiments, global positioning satellite (“GPS”) or other positioning technology may be used to identify the location of the
mobile device 110 and thus the location or name of themarketplace 210. Such information may be used to narrow or determine the product category. - According to methods and blocks described in the embodiments presented herein, and, in alternative embodiments, certain blocks can be performed in a different order, in parallel with one another, omitted entirely, and/or combined between different example methods, and/or certain additional blocks can be performed, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, such alternative embodiments are included in the invention described herein.

The user may select the products using a touch screen associated with themobile device 110 or using any other input device. The user may select the products individually. For example, by circling a product, touching, or clicking on a product. The user may also select products in groups. For example, by circling an area containing multiple products or by multi-touching on multiple products. - According to one or more embodiments, the image may be presented to the user as captured for selection of
products 215 by the user. According to one or more other embodiments, theproducts 215 within the image may be automatically identified (for example according to method 400) prior to presentation to the user for selection of whichspecific products 215 to compare. Where the products are automatically identified first, the user selection display may include graphical or textual descriptive overlays to provide details as to the identity of eachproduct 215 thereby aiding the selection process. - After
block 320, the selectedproducts 215 or image areas may be identified according tomethod 400 as discussed in further detail with respect toFIG. 4 . After identifying products according tomethod 400, a comparison of product features may be formed according tomethod 500 as discussed in further detail with respect toFIG. 5 . - In
block 330, the comparison of product features may be presented to the user associated with themobile device 110. The comparison of product features may have been formed according tomethod 500.

For example, according to one or more of various other embodiments, all of the collected blocks ofmethods mobile device 110. -
FIG. 4 is a block flow diagram depicting amethod 400 for identifyingproducts 215 within an image or video in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. - In
block 410, information relating products with one or more visual identifiers may be provided as part of the image-product database 180. The image-product database 180 may include a mapping of visual identifiers, such as image features, to one or more products. This mapping from the image-product database 180 may be used to identifyproducts 215 from visual or image features extracted from an image. - In
block 420, information products with text or coded identifiers may be provided as part of the image-product database 180. The image-product database 180 may include a mapping of text or coded identifiers to one or more products. This mapping from the image-product database 180 may be used to identify products from text or codes extracted from an image. The text may include product names, model numbers, manufacturers, or any other text. The codes may include barcodes or other symbols. - In
block 430, features within the image may be extracted. Feature extraction may be performed according to various machine vision feature detection techniques such as SIFT algorithms, correlation, filtering, matching, or the detection of edges, corners, textures, blobs, ridges, wavelets, patterns, and so forth. - In
block 440, features from within the image may be identified as visual, text, or coded identifiers. Features extracted from the image inblock 430 may be identified or matched as visual features with the visual identifiers of products as discussed with respect to block 410. Furthermore, features extracted from the image inblock 430 may be identified or matched as text or coded identifiers of products as discussed with respect to block 420. This identification can provide a list of thespecific products 215 captured within an image or video of amarketplace 210. - In
block 450, identified features from the image may be used to classify objects in the image to one or more product categories. The features identified inblock 440 may be classified by size, shape, pattern, or other attributes into categories forproducts 215. For example, if features related to the shape of wine bottles are identified, the product category of wine bottles may be used to further refine the identification of products within that category from the image. The determined product category may also inform which features of the products are relevant for comparing the products. - In
block 460,products 215 within the categories may be identified from the identified features. The features identified inblock 440 may be used to identifyproducts 215 within the image according to visual, text, or coded identifiers within the image-product database 180. When possible, categories identified inblock 450 may be leveraged to inform, simplify, or improve product identification. - After
block 460, themethod 400 ends. Of course, product identification within images and videos may continue through repeated application ofmethod 400. -
FIG. 5 is a block flow diagram depicting amethod 500 for comparing product features in accordance with one or more embodiments presented herein. - In
block 510, the product-feature database 190 may be accessed. The product-feature database 190 can provide a mapping between products (or categories of products) and features. Theproducts 215, such as those selected for comparison according tomethod 300 and identified from an image according tomethod 400, may be compared according to the categories and features of the products - In
block 520, products within the product-feature database 190 may be categorized. These product categories may inform which features of the products are relevant for comparing the products. - In
block 530, features that are relevant for comparing selected products within a category may be identified and provided within the product-feature database 190. The relevant features for a category may have been specified manually into the product-feature database 190. Relevant features may also be determined from crowd sourcing, reviews, online forums, product specification, or so forth. The relevant features may be determined or ordered based on importance to users in general as well as preferences of the particular user of themobile device 110. - In
block 540, identities of two ormore products 215 may be provided for comparison. Information about theseproducts 215 may be retrieved from the product-feature database 190. - In
block 550, theproducts 215 provided inblock 540 may be categorized into a product category according to information provided within the product-feature database 190. For example, if the products are all laptop computers, the category of “computer” may be identified. Either a more specific category of “laptop computer,” or a broader category of “electronic device” may also be identified. - In
block 560, relevant features for comparing theproducts 215 provided inblock 540 may be extracted from the product-feature database 190. For example, if the products are televisions, features such as diagonal dimension, resolution, type of input ports, and so forth may be extracted from the product-feature database 190 for each one of the products. These features may be useful for comparing theparticular products 215. The product categories determined inblock 550 may inform which features are most relevant to compare for the products. Relevant features may also be determined or ordered based on differentiating features of the selected products. - In
block 570, response may be formed comparing the extracted features for the two or more products. The response may be provided as a table or other format of use to the user of themobile device 110. - In
block 580, the features of the comparison response may be ordered or filtered by relevance. For example, the features most relevance to users in general, or the particular user, may be placed at the top of the table or other results format. As another example, non-differentiating features may be filtered out entirely. For example, if five bottles of wine are being compared and they are all red wine, the comparison feature of color may not be highly relevant. - After
block 580, themethod 500 ends and the comparison results are communicated tomethod 300. Of course, the comparison of product features may continue through repeated application ofmethod 500. -
