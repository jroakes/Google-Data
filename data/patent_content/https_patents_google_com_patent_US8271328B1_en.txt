Definitions
- This disclosure relates to interactive media advertising.
- Interactive media e.g., the Internet
- advertisements e.g., the Internet
- some websites provide information search functionality that is based on keywords entered by a user seeking information. This user query can be an indicator of the type of information of interest to the user. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, it is possible to provide targeted ads to the user.
- ads targeted based on query keywords are sent to the user to be presented with search results responsive to the query.
- this advertising model does not vary how targeted ads are presented to the user. For example, for a given query and set of search results, the number of targeted ads and the positioning of the targeted ads on a search result page are the same for all users submitting the given query.
- a user does not exhibit behavior evidencing interest in the advertisements, then showing the user numerous advertisements in many various positions may not be the best use of the advertisers resources. Likewise, if a user exhibits behavior evidencing interest in advertisements, then showing the user numerous advertisements in many various positions will likely result in increasing brand recognition and/or selection of one or more of the advertisements by the user, which, in turn, is beneficial to the advertisers.
- the subject matter of this specification relates to systems and methods to provide user-based ad positioning.
- One aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method.
- the method includes receiving advertisements to be displayed to a user and accessing user history data that defines a set of past user events associated with the user and also defines an order in which the past user events occurred.
- the method also includes generating sequences of data from the set of past user events.
- the sequences include a first sequence and one or more successive sequences successive to the first sequence.
- the first sequence includes user history data defining a past user event from the set of past user events.
- Each successive sequence includes user history data of the previous sequence and user history data defining an additional past user event from the set of past user events.
- the additional past user event is selected according to the order in which the past user events occurred.
- the method further includes generating positioning data based on the sequences.
- the positioning data determines the number and/or positioning of the advertisements to be displayed to the user.
- the method also includes providing the advertisements for display to the user as determined by the positioning data.
- the system includes a positioning system configured to receive advertisements to be displayed to the user, access the user history data store, and generate sequences of data from the set of past user events.
- the sequences include a first sequence and one or more successive sequences successive to the first sequence.
- the first sequence includes user history data defining a past user event from the set of past user events.
- Each successive sequence includes user history data of a previous sequence and user history data defining an additional past user event.
- the additional past user event is selected according to the order in which the past user events occurred.
- the positioning system is also configured to generate positioning data based on the sequences and provide the advertisements for display to the user as determined by the positioning data. The positioning data determines the number and/or positioning of the advertisements to be displayed to the user.

- FIG. 2A is a block diagram of an example implementation of an advertising serving system of the advertising management system of FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 2B is a block diagram of an example implementation of a user-based advertisement serving module of the advertising serving system of FIG. 2A .
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an example query results page having query results and advertisements.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process for providing advertisements for display to a user based on user history information.
- the methods and systems described herein relate to modifying the number and/or positioning of ads presented to a user, in response to the user's query submission, based on the user's activity patterns (e.g., previous queries, query result selections, ad selections, etc.) and the order in which events constituting the activity patterns occurred.
- the order is defined by a data sequence that defines a set of past user events associated with the user and the order in which the past user events occurred.
- the activities of a user can be indicators of the commerciality of the user.
- the commerciality of a user is indicative of how a user's receptiveness and/or interests in advertisements and/or commercial offerings. For example, if a user's ordered activity patterns indicate that the user is a commercial user, e.g., often selects ads or evidences some other activity that indicates the user is interested in commercial offerings, then the number of ads provided for display to the user can be increased. Conversely, if a user's ordered activity patterns indicate that the user is a non-commercial user, e.g., the user rarely selects ads or is not interested in commercial offerings, then the number of ads provided for display to the user can be decreased.
- Predicting the commerciality of a user based on the user's ordered activity patterns can be accomplished by implementations utilizing, for example, Markov models. Such implementations permit modification of the number and/or positioning of ads presented to a user (based on the predicted commerciality of that user) to enhance the user's experience.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an on-line advertising environment 100 .
- a computer network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), wireless network, peer-to-peer network, the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects advertiser devices 102 (referred to hereafter as “advertisers 102 ) an advertising system 104 , publisher devices 106 (referred to hereafter as “publishers 106 ”), and user devices 108 .
- advertiser devices 102 referred to hereafter as “advertisers 102
- publisher devices 106 publisher devices 106
- user devices 108 user devices
- the advertisers 102 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track advertisement information in the advertising management system 104 .
- the ads may be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, ads combining one or more of any of such components, etc.
- the ads may also include embedded information, such as a links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- the publishers 106 may submit requests for ads to the system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending ads to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content).
- Other entities such as the user devices 108 and the advertisers 102 , can provide usage information to the system 104 , such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or click-through related to an ad has occurred.
- This usage information can include measured or observed user activity patterns related to ads that have been served.
- the system 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- a publisher 106 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the content server may submit a request for ads to an ad server in the system 104 .
- the ad request may include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request may also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page or other content document
- category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- the content server can combine the requested content with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 .
- This combined content and ads can be sent to the user device 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can transmit information about the ads back to the ad server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the ads are rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM)
- a search service can receive queries for search results.
- the search service can retrieve relevant query results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- Query results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) results.
- the search service can submit a request for ads to the system 104 .
- the request may include a number of ads desired. This number may depend on the query results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the query results, the size and shape of the ads, etc. In some implementations, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for ads may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the query results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the query results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.
- the search service can combine the query results with one or more of the ads provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then forwarded to the user device 108 that requested the content.
- the query results can be maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral query results.
- the search service can transmit information about the ad and when, where, and/or how the ad was to be rendered back to the system 104 .
- the advertising management system 104 can serve publishers 106 , such as content servers and search services.
- the system 104 permits serving of ads targeted to documents served by content servers.
- a network may include an ad server serving targeted ads in response to requests from a search service with ad spots for sale.
- the search service crawls much or all of the content.
- Some of this content will include ad spots (also referred to as “inventory”) available.
- one or more content servers may include one or more documents.
- Documents may include web pages, email, content, embedded information (e.g., embedded media), meta-information and machine executable instructions, and ad spots available.
- the ads inserted into ad spots in a document can vary each time the document is served or, alternatively, can have a static association with a given document.
- FIG. 2A is a block diagram of an example implementation of an ad serving system 200 of the advertising management system 104 of FIG. 1 .
- the advertising serving system 200 determines at least one of a number and positioning of the advertisements to be displayed to the user ad serving system 200 .
- the system 200 receives an ad request for one or more ads, and provides one or more positioned ad candidates in response to the ad request.
- a positioned ad is an ad that has been associated with a particular ad slot location that determines where the ad will be positioned on a page (e.g., a query results page or a requested content page) when the page is provided for display to a user.
- the ad request is submitted by a search service and specifies a number of ads desired to accompany search results for a user-submitted query. In other implementations, the ad request is submitted by a content server and specifies a number of ads desired to accompany content requested by a user.
- the ad request is received by an ad mixer 202 in the ad serving system 200 .
- the ad request can include the query and information about the query (e.g., time of submission).
- the ad mixer 202 In response to the ad request, the ad mixer 202 generates an ad candidates request and a user-based features request.
- the ad candidates request can include the query terms or keywords and the desired number of ads, if specified in the ad request.
- the user-based features request can include an identifier or anonymized identifier associated with the user submitting the query.
- An ad serving module 206 receives the ad candidates request.
- the ad serving module 206 uses the query terms or keywords to select one or more ad candidates (e.g., from an ad repository) that are related to the query terms or keywords.
- An ad candidate selected by the ad serving module 206 can exactly “match” a given keyword of the query, for example, if the advertiser of the ad candidate previously specified that the advertiser wants the ad candidate to be presented when a user-submitted query contains the given keyword.
- an ad candidate may not exactly “match” the given keyword but may still be selected, for example, if the advertiser previously specified that the advertiser wants the ad candidate to be presented when a user-submitted query contains a particular term, where the particular term is similar to (e.g., a synonym of) the given keyword.
- the ad serving module 206 includes a learning module 207 A.
- the learning module 207 A receives the ad candidates and one or more general features associated with the ad candidates or with the query.
- the general features include information about the type of ad candidates passed to the learning module or the type of query submitted by the user.
- the general features include statistics computed from data logs of user activity patterns, where the same query was submitted by other users or the same ad candidates were presented to and selected by other users.
- the learning module can use the general features and a statistical model to estimate the quality of individual ad candidates.
- CTR predicted click through rate
- a user selects an ad by clicking on it, embedded hypertext links typically direct the viewer to the advertiser's web site. Such a process is commonly referred to as a “click-through.”
- the term “click-through” is intended to cover any user selection.
- the ratio of the number of click-throughs to the number of impressions of the ad e.g., the number of times the ad is displayed
- the “click-through rate” of the ad e.g., a probability that an ad will be clicked/selected.
- the learning module generates a predicted CTR as a quality score for each ad candidate it receives.
- the ad serving module 206 includes an auction module 207 B.
- the auction module determines the best predetermined number of candidate ads to present to the user and the order in which to present the candidate ads based on the quality scores (e.g., CTR predictions) and target bids (e.g., specified by advertisers) for all the candidate ads.
- the predetermined number of candidate ads to be presented is the number of desired ads specified in the ad request sent to the ad serving system 200 .
- the set of ordered ad candidates or the set of ordered ads candidates and their respective CTR predictions can be passed from the ad serving module 206 to a positioning module 214 .
- the system 200 while the ad service system 200 generates a set of ordered ad candidates, the system 200 generates, in parallel or substantially in parallel, user-based positioning data.
- the user-based positioning data determines the number and/or positioning of the ordered ad candidates to be displayed on a page when the page is provided for display to a user.
- the positioning data are based on information associated with the user, e.g., patterns related to the user's past query activities and responses to returned query results pages, the pages including query results and/or ads (the past query activities and subsequent responses may be referred to as “past user events” herein).
- Generating the positioning data in parallel with the ordered set of ad candidates can prevent or minimize latency added to the ad serving process due to generation of the positioning data.
- the ad mixer 202 generates a user-based features request, which can include an identifier associated with the user responsible for the submitted query.
- the identifier can identify the user that submitted the query, e.g., using user login data provided to the search service.
- the identifier can also anonymously identify the device (e.g., a laptop or a mobile phone) from which the query originated.
- a device identifier can be, for example, a cookie or an Internet Protocol (IP) address.
- IP Internet Protocol
- the identity of the user is protected by use of one or more anonymization processes.
- the user history and login association, or device history and address association can be anonymized by use of collision-resistant hashes that hash the identification data. Additional privacy protection techniques can also be used, such as the use of one or more encryption processes.
- the user-based features request is sent from the ad mixer 202 to a user-based ad serving module 212 (the user-based serving module 212 and the positioning module 214 are collectively referred to as a positioning system 218 , as indicated by the dashed system border surrounding the user-based serving module 212 and the positioning module 214 ).
- the positioning system 218 can be configured to generate the positioning data based on the commerciality of the user, which can be predicted based on the user's past query-related activities (e.g., past user events) and the order of the activities stored in a user history data store 210 .
- Example data the is stored in the user history data store 210 can include queries submitted by users, actions taken by the users in response to a results page that includes search results and one or more advertisements, such as selections of particular advertisements, and the time between such actions, as described in more detail below.
- the user-based ad serving module 212 accesses the user history data store 210 that stores the data defining past user events to retrieve past user events specific to the user responsible for the user-based features request.
- the user-based ad serving module 212 also accesses a multiplier data store 216 storing positioning multipliers and selects one or more positioning multipliers corresponding to the retrieved past user events.
- Each positioning multiplier or set of positioning multipliers indicates the commerciality of a user that performed a particular past user event (or sequence of past user events in a specific order) based on previous user activity patterns of users from a user population. For example, based on previous activity patterns it may be known that users having a particular activity pattern (e.g., submit query and then select multiple ads presented with the query results page) tend to be users of high commerciality. Thus the positioning multiplier (commerciality score) corresponding to that particular activity pattern (e.g., a sequence of past user events) would associate that pattern with a highly commercial user. Based on the relevant positioning multipliers, the positioning module 214 can generate positioning data that defines the number and/or positioning of the ordered ad candidates received from the ad serving module 206 .
- positioning multipliers are based on a commercially neutral value of 1. As such, sequences indicating a commercial user correspond to positioning multipliers having a value greater than 1 and sequences indicating a non-commercial user correspond to positioning multipliers having a value less than 1.
- the proportionality of the positioning multiplier relative to the commerciality of the user can be logarithmic; in other implementations, the proportionality can be linear. Other functional relations can also be used.
- the value of a positioning multiplier for a particular sequence of events can be determined based on the differences in commerciality for that sequence as compared with a baseline or average commerciality. For example, a particular sequence of three searches with a top ad selection occurring after the third search can be selected as an event sequence for a commercially neutral user. As mentioned above, sequences indicating a commercially neutral user can correspond to a positioning multiplier value of 1. Accordingly any comparable sequences in which a user selects more than one ad during the course of three searches can be considered as indicating the user is a commercial user, and those sequences can be assigned positioning multiplier values greater than 1 (e.g., 1.1).
- sequences in which a user selects four ads during the course of three searches would correspond to a higher positioning multiplier value than a sequence in which a user selects three ads during the course of three searches.
- sequences in which users do not select any ads during the course of performing three searches would correspond to positioning multiplier values of less than 1.
- Other schemes to assign positioning multipliers to sequences can also be used.
- the values of positioning multipliers assigned to the sequences can be refined to optimize performance metrics such as click-through-rate or other return-on-investment measures.
- a positioning multiplier assigned to a sequence may indicate that users performing that sequence are non-commercial users (e.g., rarely select ads). Such a positioning multiplier can cause a decrease in the number of ordered ad candidates provided for display to users performing that sequence. However, if it is subsequently determined that users performing that sequence frequently select ads more often relative to other sequences that have a higher positioning multiplier, then the positioning multipliers assigned to the sequences can be adjusted to reflect these relative commercial behaviors. Likewise, if the positioning multipliers assigned to sequence result in an overall performance decrease (e.g., an overall lower ROI), then the positioning multiplies can be adjusted as needed until performance is optimized.
- an overall performance decrease e.g., an overall lower ROI
- the generation of positioning data by the positioning system 218 is based on a Markov model (MM).
- MM Markov model
- MM is a Markov model based on three events
- E3 is a sequence of data based on three past user events (e.g., from the user history data);
- T3 is a sequence of data based on time information associated with the three past user events (e.g., from the user history data);
- M3 is a sequence of data based on a display configuration of ads presented to a user in association with the three past user events (e.g., from the user history data);
- ET1 is a sequence of data based on a combination of the most recent of the three past user events and the time information associated with that event;
- EM1 is a sequence of data based on a combination of the most recent past user event and ad display configuration information associated with that event;
- TM1 is a sequence of data based on a combination of the time information from ET1 and the ad display configuration information from EM1;
- ETM1 is a sequence of data based on a combination of the most recent past user event and the time and ad display configuration information from TM1.
- Each sequence of data corresponds to a positioning multiplier.
- the positioning multipliers are indicative of the commerciality of the user
- the sequences of data can be used to predict the commerciality of a user.
- the positioning multipliers can be selected so that the final product is proportional to the probability a user will select advertisements.
- Markov models can be based on a different number of events, i.e., more or less than three user events, and need not be restricted to the component set (i.e., E3, T3, M3, ET1, EM1, ETM1) used by Equation 1.
- component set i.e., E3, T3, M3, ET1, EM1, ETM1
- FIG. 2B is a block diagram of an example implementation 250 of a user-based ad serving module 212 of the advertising serving system 200 of FIG. 2A .
- the user-based ad serving module 212 can access the user history data and construct, for example, the components of Equation 1.
- the example implementation 250 includes a user-based feature generator 252 , a sequence generator 254 , and a positioning multiplier generator 256 .
- Other implementations of user-based ad serving modules can have fewer or more generators, and the functions of the generators may be combined or separated.
- the user-based feature generator 252 can use the identifier associated with the user to retrieve or determine one or more user-based features associated with the user for personalizing ad positioning. For example, the user-based feature generator 252 can use the identifier to access user history data store 210 to retrieve information specific to the user (e.g., a set of past user events associated with the user). The user specific information can then be used to generate, for example, the component set of Equation 1.
- the identifier is a cookie and the user history data can be derived from the cookie data.
- the cookie data can include a key representing past user events associated with the user and the order in which the events occurred.
- the user-based ad serving module 212 can use the key to look-up (construct) user history data for the user from, for example, the user history data store 210 .
- the cookie can include the user history data (e.g., past user events) for the user instead of a key representing the past user events. In such an example the cookie occupies the role of the user history data store 210 , albeit on a per-user basis.
- user history data can be anonymously logged and stored in the user history data store 210 according to user.
- the user-based ad serving module 212 can use the identifier to identify a particular user and access the corresponding user history data for that user from the user history data store 210 .
- Past user events correspond, for example, to the actions of the user in response to a query submitted by the user or the action and the query.
- Example past user events include no query results or advertisements selected, one query result selected from a first set of query results (e.g., the results returned on the first results page in the first four positions), one query result selected from a second set of query results (e.g., the results returned on the first or subsequent results pages exclusive of the first four positions), multiple query results selected, a top advertisement selected, a right-hand-side (RHS) advertisement selected, multiple advertisements selected, both a query result and an advertisement selected, and no history available.
- the past user events defined by the user history data can generally be represented as e1, e2, e3, . . . eN; with e1 being the most recent past user event and eN being the first occurring past user event in the sequence or series of past user events. Such past user events can be used to generate component E3 of Equation 1.
- the user history data stored in the user history data store 210 can also include time data defining for each of the past user events a time associated with the event.
- the time associated with the past user event can be the duration between the queries associated with past user events. As such, if e1 occurred two minutes after e2 and e2 occurred twenty seconds after e3, then the time data t1 (representing the timing of the query associated with e1) is two minutes and the time data t2 (representing the timing of the query associated with e2) is twenty seconds.
- the time data can also define buckets corresponding to a minimum duration and a maximum duration between queries (e.g., a first bucket for query-to-query durations less than twenty seconds, a second bucket for query-to-query durations between twenty seconds and ninety seconds, etc.).
- the time data can be used to generate component T3 of Equation 1.
- the user history data stored in the user history data store 210 can further include impression type data defining for each of the past user events a display configuration of ads associated with the event.
- Exemplary display configurations include no ads displayed, all RHS ads slots occupied with displayed ads (e.g., eight RHS ads displayed), less than all RHS ads slots occupied with displayed ads and no top positioned ads, less than all RHS ads slots occupied with displayed ads and one or more top positioned ads (e.g., zero RHS ads and one or more top ads, or three RHS ads and one top ad), etc.
- the impression type data associated with a set of past user events can be represented as m1, m2, m3, . . . mN; with m1 being the impression type data associated with the most recent past user event (e1)) and mN being the impression type data associated with the first occurring past user event (eN).
- the impression type data can be used to generate component M3 of Equation 1.
- the user history data stored in the user history data store 210 can be partitioned according to impression type data (e.g., m1, m2, m3, etc.), past user events (e1, e2, e3, etc.), and time data (e.g., t1, t2, t3, etc.).
- impression type data e.g., m1, m2, m3, etc.
- past user events e.g., e2, e3, etc.
- time data e.g., t1, t2, t3, etc.
- the user history data store 210 can also be partitioned according to related past user events, impression type data, and time data (e.g., e1, m1, t1; e2, m2, t2; etc.)
- the sequence generator 254 of the user-based ad serving module 212 can generate sequences of data for one or more of the data constituting the user history data (e.g., past user events, time data, and impression type data). In some implementations, the sequences can be generated (constructed) in accordance with and for use in Markov models (e.g., Equation 1). For example, the sequence generator 254 can generate the sequences of data represented by the components of Equation 1 (i.e., E3, T3, M3, etc.), which are time-ordered sequences of data.
- the sequence generator 254 can generate sequences of data from the set of past user events that include a first sequence (which can be, for example, one event) and one or more successive sequences successive to the first sequence.
- the first sequence includes user history data defining a past user event, and each successive sequence includes user history data of a previous sequence and user history data defining an additional past user event.
- the additional past user event is selected according to the order in which the past user events occurred.
- the Markov model on which Equation 1 is based utilizes user history data defining a set of three events.
- the first sequence of E3 is e1 and the two successive sequences are e1 ⁇ e2 (first successive sequence) and e1 ⁇ e2 ⁇ e3 (second successive sequence), respectively.
- the first successive sequence includes the user history data of the previous sequence, i.e., e1 from the first sequence, and an additional element e2, which is selected because e2 occurs immediately before e1 as determined by the past user event order.
- the second successive sequence includes the user history data of the previous sequence, i.e., e1 ⁇ e2 from the first successive sequence and an additional element e3, which is selected because e3 occurs immediately before e2 as determined by the past user event order.
- E3 can be represented as follows: e1*e1 ⁇ e2*e1 ⁇ e2 ⁇ e3.
- Markov models utilizing user history data defining a set of N events would cause the sequence generator 254 to generate N sequences for a component EN.
- N sequences for a component EN For example, for a Markov model based on five events would include five sequences for E5 and be represented as e1*e1 ⁇ e2*e1 ⁇ e2 ⁇ e3*e1 ⁇ e2 ⁇ e3 ⁇ e4*e1 ⁇ e2 ⁇ e3 ⁇ e4 ⁇ e5.
- Each of the sequences is a string of data.
- These strings/sequences characterize the time-ordered sequence of a user's activities (e.g., past user events) according to the Markov model implementation.
- the sequences can be used to select positioning multipliers from the multiplier data store 216 (each multiplier indicating the commercial nature of corresponding time-ordered sequences of user activities characterized by the strings).
- the positioning multiplier generator 256 can be used to access the multiplier data store 216 and select positioning multipliers corresponding to each sequence.
- each user event type is indicated by an alphanumeric value.
- the past user event of not selecting a query result or an advertisement can be designated as “q”; the past user event of selecting one query result from the set of query results can be designated as “s”; and the past user event of selecting a top-positioned ad can be designated as “t”.
- a three-action user sequence including a first past user event of a query and top ad selection (e3); a second past user event occurring after the first past user event of a query and query result selection from the set (e2); and a most recently occurring past user event occurring after the second past user event of query and no selection of an advertisement or query result (e1)) can be represented by the following designator sequence (from most recently to first occurring) “q s t.”
- E3 can thus be represented by three sequences of data.
- the first sequence e1 includes user history data defining the most recent past user event, q; a first successive sequence successive to the first sequences includes user history data defining the most recent past user event and the second past user event, q ⁇ s; and a second successive sequence successive to the first successive sequence includes user history data defining the most recent past user event, the second past user event, and the first past user event, q ⁇ s ⁇ t.
- the positioning multiplier generator 256 can access the multiplier data store 216 and select a first positioning multiplier corresponding to the first sequence q, a second positioning multiplier corresponding to the second sequence q ⁇ s, and third positioning multiplier corresponding to the third sequence q ⁇ s ⁇ t. To determine the commerciality of a user as indicated by E3 (the commerciality score for E3), the first, second, and third positioning multipliers can be multiplied together to determine a product of positioning multipliers.
- each positioning multiplier corresponds to a sequence and is based on historical information about the commerciality of other users having executed the same sequence.
- the first positioning multiplier (corresponding to sequence q) indicates the commerciality of other users who have submitted a query and then failed to select either a query result or an ad display on the query results page.
- sequence generator can also generate sequence (each sequence being a string of data) for the other components of Equation 1 as shown in Table 1:
- the positioning multiplier generator 256 can access the multiplier data store 216 and select positioning multipliers corresponding to sequences representing, for example, T3, M3, ET1, EM1, TM1, and ETM1.
- EM1 is represented by sequence e1 ⁇ m1 or, equivalently, h ⁇ r.
- the positioning multiplier generator 256 can access the multiplier data store 216 and select a positioning multiplier corresponding to h ⁇ r (indicating the commerciality of other users having executed the same action on a query results page with the same ad display configuration).
- the positioning multiplier generator 256 multiplies the individual commerciality scores of each component together to generate an overall commerciality score for the user.
- the overall commerciality score characterizes the commerciality of the user based on the user's user history data (and the order of the events defined by the user history data). For example, an overall commerciality score can be proportional to a probability that the user will select a given advertisement based on that user's past activity patterns.
- the overall commerciality score can optionally also be based in part on an aggregate model using an aggregation of the user history data for a user.
- An aggregate model utilizes, for example, an aggregation of a set of past user events for a user (e.g., the last twenty past user events as defined by the user history data) but not the order in which the past user events occurred.
- an aggregate model does not give weight to or indicate the relative order in which, for example, the past user events took place, as does the Markov-based model described above.
- Q is the number of queries submitted by the user during a predetermined time period.
- A is the number of ad selections associated with the query results returned from the queries, Q.
- Qctr is the category of a query, and includes, for example, three categories: (1) a first page query (a query not associated with a request for a subsequent page of query results) that is not an exact duplicate of a recent query, e.g., a query in the last 10 queries in the last 30 minutes; (2) a first page query that is an exact duplicate of a recent query; and (3) a next page query, a query associated with a request for a subsequent page of query results.
- a first page query a query not associated with a request for a subsequent page of query results
- Q ⁇ A ⁇ Qctr can define in whole or in part an aggregate user history data set.
- Exp describes the number of expected ad selections of the user during a predetermined time. For example, based on an aggregation of the user's past events a user CTR can be determined and used to estimate the number of expected ad selections for the user during a time period.
- the Ignored Domains feature describes the preference of a user for a particular domain. For example, if a user tends to ignore (i.e., not select) ads associated with a particular domain then the Ignored Domains feature indicates that the user is unlikely to select ads from the domain.
- Each of Q ⁇ A ⁇ Qctr, Q ⁇ A ⁇ Qctr ⁇ Exp, and Ignored Domains can be a string of data. Once each has string has been constructed from information included in the user history data store 210 by the user-based ad serving module 212 , positioning multipliers corresponding to the strings can be looked up in, for example, the multiplier data store 216 . A product of the positioning multipliers can then be determined (e.g., a commerciality score for U). This process is similar to that descried above with reference to the components of Equation 1.
- the overall commerciality score can be based on a Markov model and an aggregate model.
- a product of commerciality scores e.g., positioning multipliers
- U, MM, and MM ⁇ A ⁇ Qctr can be used to determine the overall commerciality score corresponding to the model SM.
- other models generating the overall commerciality score can be based on only portions of the SM model.
- commerciality scores can initially be determined by an aggregate model, e.g., U, and then adjusted by the commerciality scores determined by a model that accounts for the relative order of the past user events, e.g., MM.
- the various models e.g., U and MM
- the commerciality scores from the two models can be combined to determine an overall commerciality score.
- the positioning module 214 can use the overall commerciality score to generate positioning data for determining how the ordered candidate ads are to be displayed to the user, such as modifying the number and/or positioning of the ordered candidate ads.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an example query results page 300 having query results 302 and advertisements 304 .
- a query results page 300 can be returned with query results 302 and ads 304 .
- the ads 304 can be displayed, for example, as top ads 304 b (e.g., three top ads) and RHS ads 304 a (e.g., eight RHS ads).
- Ads can also be positioned in other locations on a results page, e.g., along the left hand side or along the bottom of the page.
- advertisers desire to have their ads placed as one of the top ads 304 b , as such ads are more prominently displayed to a user than, for example, the RHS ads 304 a.
- the ad serving module 206 can generate, for example, the set of ordered candidate ads illustrated on query results page 300 (e.g., a three top ads, eight RHS ads, and the respective positioning of each ad).
- the positioning data generated by the positioning system 218 can alter the number and/or positioning of the set of ordered candidate ads according to the commerciality of the user submitting the query.
- the positioning system 218 can, for example, eliminate a number of RHS ads (e.g., Advertisement 7/Creative 7-Advertisement 11/Creative 11) and/or demote one or more of the top ads (e.g., Advertisement 1/Creative 1-Advertisement 3/Creative 3) to RHS ad positions.
- RHS ads e.g., Advertisement 7/Creative 7-Advertisement 11/Creative 11
- demote one or more of the top ads e.g., Advertisement 1/Creative 1-Advertisement 3/Creative 3
- the ad serving module 206 may generate a set of ordered candidate ads for display on a query results page having only one top ad and three RHS ads. If the user is determined to be a commercial user then the positioning system 218 can, for example, increase the number of RHS ads (e.g., from three to eight) and/or promote one or more of the RHS ads to top ad positions. Such an ad presentation may enhance the commercial user's experience.
- the positioning module 214 can use one or more thresholds to determine which ordered candidate ads are to be presented to the user (e.g., number of ads) and in what positions they will be presented.
- a promotion threshold can be one or more cutoffs for a predicted CTR associated with the ad candidate, the ad candidate's target bid, or some combination of the two.
- Candidate ads that exceed the promotion threshold can be eligible for promotion to the top ad slots (e.g., from the RHS ad slots/positions).
- the positioning module 214 can also use a disabling threshold, which can be one or more cutoffs for a predicted CTR associated with the ad candidate or other quality score. If an ad candidate is an exact match for a keyword in the user's query, the ad candidate can be automatically eligible for a RHS ad slot. However, if the ad candidate is not an exact match, the disabling threshold can be used to determine whether the ad candidate is eligible for a RHS ad slot.
- a disabling threshold can be one or more cutoffs for a predicted CTR associated with the ad candidate or other quality score. If an ad candidate is an exact match for a keyword in the user's query, the ad candidate can be automatically eligible for a RHS ad slot. However, if the ad candidate is not an exact match, the disabling threshold can be used to determine whether the ad candidate is eligible for a RHS ad slot.
- an ad candidate is not an exact match, it must be a close enough match to a query keyword (e.g., as determined by a predicted CTR that exceeds the disabling threshold) to be eligible to be displayed to the user in a RHS ad slot.
- a query keyword e.g., as determined by a predicted CTR that exceeds the disabling threshold
- Non-matching ad candidates that do not exceed the disabling threshold are disabled (e.g., eliminated from ad slot selection).
- a promotion threshold set at a predicted CTR of 8:1 i.e., the probability that an ad will be selected is twelve and one-half percent
- a disabling threshold set at predicted CTR of 20:1 i.e., the probability that an ad will be selected is five percent
- an ad candidate that has a user-independent predicted CTR of 10:1 i.e., the probability that the ad will be selected by any user is ten percent.
- the ad candidate would be included in the ads provided for display to a user (as the ad's user-independent predicted CTR exceeds that of the disabling threshold value) but would not be promoted (as the ad's user-independent predicted CTR does not surpass that of the promotion threshold value).
- the user-independent predicted CTR of the ad is modified to 4:1 (i.e., the probability that the ad will be selected is twenty-five percent) as a result of positioning data determined for that user (i.e., a user-dependent CTR is determined) then the ad would be promoted. In other words, the ad's position would be adjusted because the ad's user-dependent CTR exceeds the promotion threshold.
- the predicted CTR of the ad is modified to 25:1 (i.e., the probability that an ad will be selected is four percent) as a result of positioning data then the ad would no longer be provided for display to the user as the ad's user-dependent predicted CTR would no longer exceed the disabling threshold.
- the ad serving module 206 can provide a set of ordered candidate ads relevant to a user submitted query. Before user-based correction is applied (i.e., before the positioning data is used to modify the number and/or positioning of the set of ordered candidate ads), there are a certain number of ads that will be presented to the user. The actual number of ads presented to the user as determined by the positioning system 218 is based on a prediction of the CTR of the ad (i.e., the user-dependent predicted CTR), a probability.
- the user-dependent predicted CTR is based on both the commerciality of the user (e.g., as determined by Equation 1 or Equation 3) and the user-independent predicted CTRs (e.g., quality scores) of the ordered ad candidates.
- the commerciality of the user and the user-independent predicted CTRs are also probabilities. These probabilities are multiplied together and used to determine the actual number of ads presented to the user.
- the probability that the ad will be selected is ten percent (e.g., user-independent predicted CTR).
- the user that submitted the query is a commercial user and is twice as likely to select an ad as opposed to not selecting an ad (e.g., overall commerciality score for that user).
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for providing advertisements for display to a user based on user history information.
- the process 400 can be implemented in the advertising serving system 200 of FIG. 2A .
- Advertisements to be displayed to a user are received ( 402 ).

- User history data is accessed ( 404 ).

- the additional past user event can be selected according to the order in which the past user events occurred (e.g., the additional past user occurring before the past user event of the first sequence).
- Positioning data based on the sequences are generated ( 408 ).
- the positioning module 214 can generate positioning data.
- the positioning data determines the number and/or positioning of advertisements to be displayed to the user.
- the positioning data can, for example, be generated by selecting positioning multipliers in the multiplier data store 216 , the selection being based on the sequences, and the generation of the positioning data being based on the positioning multipliers.
