- Communicating with other people in the Internet age has never been easier. People may communicate through various messaging platforms, including, but not limited to, SMS, iMessage, social networking systems such as FACEBOOK and TWITTER, as well as other messaging applications like SNAPCHAT, WECHAT, LINE, and so forth. While text messaging remains the predominate method of communication, more and more pictorial messaging has emerged. Messaging applications may be configured to transmit and receive text messages that include pictorial content, with the text conveys information from one person to another, in at least some implementations.
- the information conveyed may use pictorial content as a communication medium that need not rely on text as symbols alone, but rather imagery presented concurrently or sequentially (e.g., over a timeline) that includes animated text, images, image movement, and other substantive pictorial content that conveys a larger idea, concept, expressive statement, emotion, and even one or more semi-structured sentences.
- Pictorial content is usually originally formatted as a video file.
- compression techniques may be implemented in one or more examples to transform one or more images into an animated GIF (Graphical Interchange Format) content item.
- GIF Graphical Interchange Format
- various examples may be implemented to reduce the file size of the content item to enable relatively fast loading of the GIFs in a mobile interface.
- various examples of implementations described herein may provide techniques for searching and detecting an appropriate image (e.g., GIF) that optimally conveys a “concept” a user wishes to convey with relatively reduced or negated impacts on user experience than otherwise might be the case.
- a communicating-user may detect (e.g., browse collections of content items) and import (e.g., by copying and pasting) a particular content item that optimally communicates a user's expressive intent (e.g., using one or more subsets animated imagery, such as one or more animated GIFs, with minimal or no numeric or alphabetic characters).
- FIG. 1A is a block diagram depicting a system configured to preprocess media content items for automated generations of effects, according to some embodiments.
- Media content management system 100 may receive a content item 104 from a media content source 102 .
- a preprocessing module 106 may include an image recognition module 108 and a canvas mapping module 110 .
- An image recognition module 108 may be configured to detect one or more facial features (e.g., pixelated facial portions) and may implement facial recognition algorithms, color difference value algorithms, and/or other algorithms to detect moving and non-moving (“static”) images across multiple frames (e.g., over multiple frames 122 a - 122 f ) in the received content item 104 .
- facial features e.g., pixelated facial portions
- static moving and non-moving
- a canvas mapping module 110 may be configured to identify data representing one or more regions of one or more images with which visual modifications may be implemented, such as adding graphical imagery, such as sunglasses over regions associated with “eyes,” as facial features.
- Canvas mapping module 110 may be configured to use data representing the images, such as faces, eyes, and/or static spaces (e.g., one or more two dimensional areas of the content item in which little to no movement is detected), whereby such spaces or regions may be used to define a canvas region based on that data.
- the canvas region may be configured to include special effects, such as captioning, animated text, animated images (e.g., superimposed sunglasses), and the like.
- Preprocessing module 106 may generate a processed content item 112 and a canvas mapping object 114 .
- the canvas mapping object 114 may include the data defining the canvas region, such as location coordinates as indicated by pixel location, or a subset of pixel locations specifying a perimeter of canvas mapping object 114 or a surface representing one or more portions of canvas mapping object 114 .
- a canvas region may be selected from one or more static spaces identified by preprocessing module 106 .
- a canvas region may include data representing regions (e.g., bounded regions of an image) that may be characterized by, or implemented with, a minimum threshold of area, such as a threshold representing a minimum number of pixels (e.g., a pixel region threshold).
- a minimum threshold of area may be configured to include an amount of text characters at a specified font size on, or associated with, the content item.
- a canvas region may be dynamically selected upon receiving a request to generate special effects on a processed content item 112 .
- the data representing the one or more canvas regions may be stored in a canvas mapping object 114 .
- a canvas mapping object 114 may be a data arrangement, data object, or otherwise instantiated data representation as known in the state of the art.
- the canvas mapping object 114 may be stored as a metadata attribute of the processed content item 112 . Metadata attributes may be data items that may be stored within data objects, or in other data representations as known in the state of the art.
- the canvas mapping object 114 may be stored in association with the processed content item 112 in a media content store 120 .
- a search interface module 116 may receive search requests from a dynamic keyboard interface module 118 , such as keywords and/or emoji associated with media content items stored in the media content store 120 .
- the dynamic keyboard interface module 118 may be configured to retrieve two or more media content items from the media content store 120 through the search interface module 116 to display the two or more media content items in animation concurrently.
- the dynamic keyboard interface module 118 enable users to add special effects, such as electronic stickers, animated text, sounds, graphics, and other user-generated content. Through a user device, users may create meme-like captioning on a processed content item 112 retrieved through the search interface module 116 .
- modified processed content item 126 may be stored in the media content store 120 , in one embodiment. Or, modified processed content item 126 may be transmitted via a text messaging application. Examples of multiple frames 122 of an example modified processed content item 126 is illustrated in FIG. 1A . Multiple frames 122 may be perceived, for example, as an animated GIF-based image.
- FIG. 1A and the other figures use like reference numerals to identify like elements.
- Only six frames 122 are illustrated in FIG. 1A in order to simplify and clarify the description, though additional frames 122 may be used to form a modified processed content item 126 .
- frame 122 a represents a start frame of a media content item, such as a GIF
- frame 122 f represents the final frame of the media content item.
- Bounded region 190 of the modified processed content item 126 may be modified to include animated text as the caption, “SLAY QUEEN, SLAY!” and is stacked vertically in three lines, each of which may be sequentially displayed.
- the animated caption remains within the bounded region, or the canvas region.
- font size of the text “QUEEN,” is smaller than the font size of the words “SLAY” and “SLAY!” while “SLAY!” is smaller in font size than the word “SLAY”, indicating that font size may be altered based on the length of the word and the size of the bounded region.
- user-generated captions may be animated and then divided amongst the frames 122 of the modified processed content item 126 .
- FIG. 1B depicts an example of the operation of a preprocessing module, according to an embodiment.
- preprocessing module 106 may be configured to perform image processing on a content item (e.g., a frame 122 a or multiple frames) including an image.
- Preprocessing module 106 of FIG. 1B may further be configured to identify a canvas region, or multiple canvas regions.
- preprocessing module 106 can detect pixel data representing a face 184 a and a limb 184 b (e.g., a hand and a portion of an arm).
- preprocessing module 106 can detect pixel data representing regions 186 associated with “eyes,” pixel data representing a region 187 representing a “nose,” pixel data representing a region 188 representing a mouth 188 , and pixel data representing a region 189 representing a torso (e.g., a clothed torso).
- preprocessing module 106 of FIG. 1B can determine regions 184 a , 184 b , 186 , 187 , and 188 constitute a person, such a person and associated pixel data may be characterized as a foreground.
- background 181 can represent a canvas region on which animated imagery (or a portion thereof) may be superimposed. As shown in FIG. 1A , animated text may be added in boundary 190 .
- preprocessing module 106 of FIG. 1B can perform sentiment analysis by identifying metadata (e.g., text describing attributes or collections, such as “happy,” “cool,” “funny,” “angry,” etc.) and contextual information (e.g., location of sender, time of day, recipient of modified content item, etc.) to determine one or more expressive states of an image automatically (e.g., without user or manual intervention).
- preprocessing module 106 of FIG. 1B can analyze facial features to predicate an expressive state of the image. Further, preprocessing module 106 of FIG. 1B can automatically present a subset of special effects (e.g., stored in special effects content store 216 of FIG.
- preprocessing module 106 of FIG. 1B may select special effect data 197 representing glasses associated with “cool” rather than special effect data 195 , which is associated with “funny” or “laughter.”
- content items 104 may include data representing various types of content, such as animated GIFs (a series of images), a static image, an audio-visual content item/video, as well as composite content items, such as multiple animated GIFs and/or image content. Further, content items may include data representing audio or any other media that may be perceived by any of the human senses, such as tactile (e.g., touch) senses, olfactory senses, etc., according to some examples.
- a user of the media content management system 100 may, through a user device, add content to a media content management system 100 .
- a user may have installed an application extension onto the user device such that the user can “save” a content item found through browsing a web page using a browser on the user device.

- the user may browse to the web page, access a menu through the browser, and select an option to save one or more content items that have been presented on the web page.
- the application extension is a mobile application that enables mobile browsers to perform this functionality.
- the application extension may be a browser extension application or applet that may be downloaded through the browser on a mobile device or desktop computer.
- the application extension may enable users to directly upload content items to the media content management system 100 . Use of the application extension, among other functions described here, are further elaborated in the aforementioned applications incorporated by reference above.
- Content items presented on web pages or otherwise accessible through web servers, may be procured by administrators of the media content management system 100 in other ways, in an embodiment.
- content generators, developers, and or owners such as movie studios, television studios, brand owners, and other content generators, may partner with administrators of the media content management system 100 such that licensed content may be delivered to the media content management system 100 .
- content owners may provide content items 104 as mentioned above.
- a media content source 102 such as a content owner, may include content stores or databases on servers maintained and operated by the third-party sources or websites, for example.
- a dynamic keyboard user interface 132 may be rendered on a device (e.g., a user device, such as a mobile computing device or phone) through a dynamic keyboard application 130 installed on the user device.
- the dynamic keyboard application 130 may install a dynamic keyboard user interface 132 that enables a dynamic keyboard interface 128 to be accessed throughout the user device as a third-party keyboard.
- a messaging user using a messaging application 140 such as the APPLE IMESSAGE, SMS, texting, or other messaging platform such as FACEBOOK MESSENGER, TWITTER, EMAIL, and the like, may access the dynamic keyboard interface 128 from within the messaging application 140 .
- FIG. 1C is a block diagram depicting a process of modifying a selected media content item from animated inputs in a dynamic interface to automatically add effects to (or otherwise modify) the selected media content item, according to at least one an embodiment.
- processed content items 112 are rendered in the dynamic keyboard interface 128 through the dynamic keyboard user interface 132 communicating with the search interface module 116 .
- a set of collections may be selected for display on the dynamic keyboard interface 128 .
- selection may refer to a grouping of content items (e.g., grouped based on attributes or characteristics describing expressive intent), according to some examples.
- a collection may be generated by administrators of the media content management system 100 , in one embodiment.
- a collection may be automatically generated, in one embodiment, based on one or more attributes shared by the content items 104 in the collection.
- a content association, or a unique identifier may be used to denote a collection in the media content management system 100 .
- a media content item 104 may be “content associated” as part of the “#happy” collection in the media content management system 100 .
- a user or an administrator may classify or otherwise associated media content item 104 as part of the a grouping having similar attributes associated with an expressive state, such as a “#happy” collection.
- a first content item 104 may be automatically associated (e.g., via a content association) with one or more other content items 104 using content associations stored in the media content management system 100 .
- content may be procured and categorized using content associations, such as “#happy,” in the media content management system 100 .
- Individual collections, or set of files, may each be labeled or identified with a content association in the media content management system 100 .
- a particular file may be associated with one or more content associations, according to at least one embodiment.
- the dynamic keyboard interface 128 may be configured to present groups of related content, such as “#PLEASE,” “#HAPPY,” “#RUDE,” and a “#FACEPALM” collections.
- groups of related content such as “#PLEASE,” “#HAPPY,” “#RUDE,” and a “#FACEPALM” collections.
- hashtag symbol ‘#’
- content associations need not necessarily include a hashtag.
- the searching user is searching the media content management system 100 by using the selected content association, such as “#HAPPY.”
- the retrieved collection of processed media content items 112 may be rendered within the dynamic keyboard interface 128 . Because the “#HAPPY” collection may be updated and added to in real-time, a user who is searching for certain content may be presented with different media content items as items (e.g., new items) are added to the collection.
- processed content items 112 may be processed (e.g., preprocessed) to identify one or more canvas regions, as stored in one or more canvas mapping objects 114 , thus enabling the processed media content items 112 to be relatively quickly annotated with one or more special effects (e.g., via dynamic keyboard interface 128 ).
- processed content item may refer, at least in some cases, to a media content item for which regions (e.g., canvas regions) are identified, such as described in FIG. 1B and other drawings.
- a processed content item includes identified characteristics or attributes of the content item (e.g., identify metadata and context) with which files (e.g., GIF files) may be grouped into collections or which an expressive intent may be associated.
- a user may select a processed content item 134 , while searching for content with certain expressive intent, from the dynamic keyboard interface 128 by touching or otherwise interacting with the dynamic keyboard user interface 132 .
- the selected processed content item 134 may then be modified using a captioning module 138 and/or a special effects (“FX”) module 124 accessible through the dynamic keyboard user interface 132 on the dynamic keyboard application 130 .
- modified content item 136 may be transmitted or pasted into the messaging user interface 142 of the messaging application 140 as a selected modified content item 144 .
- the selected modified content item 144 may be selected by clicking, tapping, or touching the dynamic keyboard interface 128 and holding the selected modified content item 144 to “copy” the content so that it can be “pasted” into the messaging application 140 through the messaging user interface 142 .
- This copy and paste method may take advantage of the operating system of the user device, in one embodiment, such that the selected modified content item 144 need not be stored permanently onto the user device.
- messaging application 140 may be configured to automatically select modified content item 144 (e.g., based on priority or probability), and to automatically import the selected modified content item 144 in user interface 142 . The user may select another content item or may desire to transmit selected modified content item 144 to a recipient.

Additionally, special effects, such as adding animated pixelated sunglasses, or shades, may be superimposed on the image frame to cover the detected eyes within the content item.
- facial detection data 312 which may be derived from pixel data representing features of a face 312 a , may be used to locate the eyes in pixel data of the frames including the content item.
- the pixelated sunglasses, or “shades,” may incorporate an additional meaning beyond eyewear that provides sun-protection.
- facial detection data 312 may be used to enable conveyance of these non-textual and non-verbal communications through the medium of content items in the media content management system 100 .
- Eye tracking detection module 304 may generate eye tracking detection data 314 derived from pixel data representing eyes 314 a to be stored in a canvas mapping object 114 . While facial detection data 312 may include a general location of the eyes within the region designated as a face, eye tracking detection data 314 may identify one or more locations, through pixel coordinates, of an outline of the eyes and tracking the eyes in each frame of the content item over the timeline of the content item. Additionally, the eye tracking detection data may identify portions of the eyes, such as pupils or areas around pupils, such as white areas, as well as movement tracking of the eyes to predict, for example, a direction of a subject's gaze (e.g., a directionality in three-dimensional space towards an object within or outside of the image).
- a direction of a subject's gaze e.g., a directionality in three-dimensional space towards an object within or outside of the image.
- eye tracking data 314 may further include more subtle movements, such as an eye roll, a glare, a stare, and the like, that may be associated with various emotional states and/or expressive statements, described as content associations above and further described in the application referenced above and incorporated by reference.
- eye tracking data 314 may be used to predict various searching-user intents, such as an intent to find a content item that expresses disgust or a desire to “throw shade” or otherwise insult the receiving-user of the content item.
- An emoji depicting an umbrella on a beach that provides shade may be associated with the colloquial use of the term “throwing shade,” “shady,” “shade,” and the like in the media content management system 100 as content associations.
- an emoji depicting a face with wide eyes and hands on the face may be associated with the content associations of “OMG”, “WOW”, and/or eyes glaring in appreciation.
- non-verbal cues such as eye rolls, glares, stares, blinks, and dismissive glances, may be captured in the eye tracking data 314 , in one embodiment, and used to communicate one or more ideas that cannot be expressed in words or symbols alone. Non-textual symbolism of the content item is thus enhanced by the eye tracking data 314 .
- Static space detection module 306 may generate static space detection data 316 to be stored in a canvas mapping object 114 .
- the static space detection data 316 may include a bounded region, identified by multiple pixel coordinates, that may be rectangular, in one embodiment.

- a static space 330 e.g., static spaces 330 a and 330 b
- a bounded region identifying the bounds of the static space may be identified by pixel locations in the frame and stored as the static space detection data 316 .
- static space detection data 316 may reference more than one static spaces 330 a and 330 b in the processed content item 112 .
- static space 330 a may be relatively narrower and smaller than static space 330 b in terms of bounded regions.
- a static space 330 may refer to a bounded area of an image frame that includes “background” imagery (e.g., de-emphasized portions of the frame) relative to “foreground” imagery (e.g., portions of a frame for which the content item communicates an idea, thought, or concept).
- Static spaces 330 may be identified to include a canvas region into which text or non-text symbols may be inserted or added. As illustrated in FIG. 3 , selected canvas region 332 identifies static space 330 b as having space to add text or non-text symbols into the content item, even though static space 330 b may include background imagery that has moving figures. The background imagery need not be emphasized, and as a result, may be designated as a “static space” for which a canvas region may be included.
- a movement analyzer module 308 may generate movement analysis data 318 to be stored in a canvas mapping object 114 .
- Movement analysis data 318 may identify pixel data in portions of the frame that have movement as indicated, for example, by high levels of color difference values from frame to frame, in one embodiment.
- the movement analyzer module 308 may implement a third party application 206 .
- movement analysis data 318 may include one or more portions of a face 312 a that has been identified as moving, such as facial portion 319 (e.g., a mouth).
- facial portion 319 e.g., a mouth
- the eyebrows 317 of the face may be detected to be moving based on the facial detection data 312 or otherwise have certain orientations (e.g., an eyebrow orientation can be used to predict an expressive state (e.g., raised eyebrows may correlate with an expressive state of “surprise”).
- an eyebrow orientation can be used to predict an expressive state (e.g., raised eyebrows may correlate with an expressive state of “surprise”).
- a canvas mapping module 110 may store at least one of the facial detection data 312 , the eye tracking detection data 314 , the static space detection data 316 and the movement analysis data 318 in the canvas mapping object 114 .
- the canvas mapping object 114 may be implemented as a metadata attribute of the processed content item 112 , in one embodiment.
- Metadata attributes may be data items attached or otherwise associated with a data object.
- a data item may be a text file including extensible markup language (XML) for each metadata attribute.
- a data item may include a data value associated with the data object, such as in a header file of an HTML webpage, and so forth.
- data items may include data values stored in a data store (e.g., a database or file including the data values) associated with the data object, such that the data items are referenced by a uniform resource locator (URL) and/or linked to the data object to enable the data items to be accessed by the data object.
- a metadata attribute may represent a characteristic of a content item or image. For example, an image may be “tagged” as being related to expressive state of “happy,” which may be used to group the image or select the image for modification.
- the canvas mapping module 110 may select a canvas region from among the identified static spaces in the content item. Canvas region selection data 320 may be stored in the canvas mapping object 114 based on the selection of the canvas region by the canvas mapping module 110 , as described herein.
