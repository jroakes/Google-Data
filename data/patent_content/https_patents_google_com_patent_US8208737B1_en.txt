Definitions
- Embodiments of the present invention relate to computer-aided analysis of media material.
- Layout analysis techniques and systems have been used to analyze the location, relative arrangement and relationship of text and images in a document.
- Such document layout analysis can be important in many document imaging applications.
- document layout analysis can be used to identify the location and relative arrangement of captions and associated images in a media material.
- Caption identification based on existing techniques, generally works best on simple documents, but may be difficult or even unworkable when caption placements are complex or variable.
- traditional automated or semi-automated document layout analysis often fails on complex layouts and resort must be made to manual analysis.
- OCR optical character recognition
- media material creators may use a variety of features—such as type fonts, capitalization, specific identifying tag words and abbreviations (e.g., fig., figure, caption), type sizes, type styles (boldface, italics, underline, etc.) and caption position relative to the image.
- features such as type fonts, capitalization, specific identifying tag words and abbreviations (e.g., fig., figure, caption), type sizes, type styles (boldface, italics, underline, etc.) and caption position relative to the image.
- Each piece of media material may use a different combination of these features, and also may have different caption identification features in use simultaneously.
- Traditional methods of caption identification do not analyze the multitude of different textual, proximity and content features available to assist in an accurate identification of captions.
- Automated methods of identifying captions have generally relied on text position, document layouts and other proximity features alone and hence make many mistakes, as there is no consistent, adaptive method of identifying captions that works across a wide variety of media material. Such limited automated methods have further difficulty analyzing captions and images that continue across two or more pages of a media material.
- a computer-implemented captioner for analyzing data representative of image captions in media material includes a selector module that identifies text-blocks potentially associated with images in the media material and a caption identifier module that determines which ones of the identified text-blocks are captions associated with one or more identified images in the media material based on features of the text-blocks and the images.
- the captioner may further include a caption feedback module to process feedback about determined captions, and this processed feedback may be used to modify the determining of the caption identifier module.
- a computer-implemented method for analyzing data representative of image captions includes identifying the text-blocks potentially associated with images in media material, and electronically determining, for each identified text-block, whether it is a caption of one or more images in the media material based on features of the text-blocks and the images. The method further includes storing information corresponding to the linkages between the determined captions and their associated images.
- the computer-implemented method for analyzing data representative of image captions may further include accepting feedback about determined captions and using the feedback to modify the determining stage.

- Output data for display may include displays of the media material analyzed to show the identified captions according to the analysis of captioner 100 .
- Other types of information may be displayed as would be apparent to a person skilled in the art given this description.
- Captioner 100 (including its component modules), as described further in the discussion of FIG. 11 below, can be implemented in software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof, including the distribution of functions across several linked or clustered computers. As will be discussed further, in embodiments, captioner 100 may be implemented to run on any type of processing device including, but not limited to, a computer, workstation, distributed computing system, embedded system, stand-alone electronic device, networked device, mobile device, set-top box, television, or other type of processor or computer system.

Further description of embodiments that include feedback are described below with respect to FIGS. 4 and 7 A- 7 D.
- FIG. 2A illustrates a more detailed view of the selector module 110 according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- Selector module 110 includes a media component detector 225 , a proximity feature analyzer 230 and a proximity score filter 235 .
- Selector module 110 may also be communicatively coupled to two external components: an image detector 210 and a text block detector 220 .
- the selector module 110 shall now be described in greater detail with reference to a data flow diagram as shown in FIG. 5 and the method described in FIG. 10 .
- selector module 110 may receive or access data 150 .
- media component detector 225 receives data 150 and sends it to an image detector 210 and a text block detector 220 .
- image detector 210 could use any one or combination of image detection and placement approaches.
- Such components typically analyze material to identify images and their placement within the material. Once the images have been identified in the media material, information corresponding to these images and their placement may be sent back to media component detector 225 .
- text block detector 210 could use any one or combination of text block detection approaches.
- An example component that performs text block identification may use established text block segmenter technology. Other approaches to text block detection would be apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art.
- the text block detector also may determine a classification for the identified text, e.g., body text, heading text, or potential caption text. Once the text blocks have been identified in the media material, information corresponding to these text blocks and their placement on the media page may be sent back to media component detector 225 .
- proximity feature analyzer 230 determines one or more proximity scores 535 for each text block relative to each detected image based on the relative proximity and orientation of the text block to the analyzed image, and other page features, such as identified heading text or body text. These proximity features analyzed are described further in the discussion of FIG. 2C below, and an example flowchart depicting the stages of proximity feature analysis 900 as illustrated in FIG. 9 .
- each set of generated proximity scores 535 are forwarded, with their associated text block and image pairs, to the caption identifier module 120 , for use in determining a caption score for each pair. These text block and image pairs outputted by the proximity feature analyzer 230 will now be referred to herein as “image caption candidate pairs.”
- the proximity feature analyzer 230 outputs all image caption candidate pairs 530 with their associated proximity scores 535 directly to caption identifier module 120 .
- proximity score filter 235 receives all image caption candidate pairs 530 , and selects one or more image caption candidate pairs based on the proximity scores 535 of each. These filtered image caption candidate pairs 420 may then be forwarded to caption identifier module 120 .
- the proximity score filter 235 may select only a portion of the image caption pairs corresponding to a top number of scores, e.g., the top 10 pairs per page.
- the proximity score filter 235 may take all pairs having proximity scores 535 above a specified or determined threshold, e.g., all pairs where the proximity scores 535 are above 20.
- FIG. 2B illustrates detection aspects that may be performed by text block detector 220 .
- the text block detector 220 may differentiate between at least four different page features of the media material, including: body text, heading text, text blocks 520 and images 510 .
- Body text has a definition well-used in the art: text that makes up the main body of an article rather than headlines, subheads, titles, or image captions.
- Headlines, subheads, titles also has a definition well-known in the art: text that is not body text, and is used to introduce, for example, chapters, sections, and other portions of the media material.
- the text block detector 220 may distinguish between the body text, heading text, text blocks 520 and images 510 , and analyze these further in successive stages of the captioner process.
- data 150 may include a media material page 240 containing heading text 241 , body text 242 , potential captions 245 , 243 and an image 244 .
- Image detector 210 detects image 244
- text block detector 220 detects caption candidates 243 and 245 .
- text block detector 220 may not differentiate between text blocks 241 , 242 , 243 and 245 , considering them text blocks that are all potentially caption candidates.
- FIG. 2C illustrates various proximity features analyzed by the proximity feature analyzer 230 .
- An example flowchart depicting the stages of proximity feature analysis 900 is also illustrated in FIG. 9 , and this figure will be referenced in this section.
- the diagram in FIG. 2C shows five identified potential captions (TEXT A, B, C, D and E) for Image A.
- proximity feature analyzer 230 evaluates one or more of the following proximity features for each of the text blocks relative to the image:
- each detected image 510 and each text block 520 The vertical distance 251 between each detected image 510 and each text block 520 , the determination of which as also may be performed in stage 910 . In another example, this value may be calculated from different points on the caption or the image, e.g., from the center of the caption to the center of the image.
- the proximity of the text blocks 520 to likely non-caption candidates e.g., the proximity relationship of a text block 520 to an identified heading, the determination of which as may be performed in stage 960 .
- these generated proximity scores 535 may be used by proximity score filter 235 to limit the image caption candidate pairs sent to the caption identifier.
- these generated proximity scores 535 may be forwarded with the filtered image caption candidate pairs 420 to the caption identifier module 120 , where they may be used as a factor in the determination of a caption score for the image caption candidate pair.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a more detailed view of the caption identifier module 120 according to an embodiment of the present invention.
- Caption identifier module 120 includes a textual feature analyzer 310 , a weight applier 330 , a caption score generator 340 and a threshold applier 350 .
- the caption identifier module 120 shall now be described in greater detail with reference to an example flowchart depicting the basic stages of textual feature analysis 800 as illustrated in FIG. 8 , and with reference to a data flow diagram as shown in FIG. 6 .
- the textual feature analyzer 310 receives image caption candidate pairs from the selector module 110 . As described in the stages of textual feature analysis 800 , the textual features of each received caption candidate are analyzed by the textual feature analyzer 310 , and one or more scores that relate to the textual features of the caption candidate are generated. In different embodiments, these scores may be varied measures of a feature, e.g., a number, percentage, rating or other type of score.
- textual feature analyzer 310 includes the visual features of the text. These visual features relate to the peculiar appearance aspects of the text, and the composition of the text block, e.g., in terms of letters, symbols, numbers and spaces. In an example, as enumerated in stage 810 , textual feature analyzer 310 may analyze and quantify the following visual features:
- V 1 The number of symbols in a text block.
- V 2 The average font size in a text block.
- V 3 The percentage of symbols in serif.
- V 4 The percentage of symbols in sans serif.
- V 5 The percentage of symbols in monospace.
- V 6 The percentage of symbols in bold.
- V 7 The percentage of symbols in italics.
- V 8 The percentage of symbols underlined in a text block.
- V 9 The percentage of symbols striked-out in a text block.
- V 10 The percentage of symbols subscripted in a text block.
- V 11 The percentage of symbols superscripted in a text block.
- V 12 The percentage of symbols in caps.
- V 13 The percentage of symbols in small caps.
- V 14 The percentage of symbols that are numbers in a text block
- V 15 The percentage of symbols that are not alphabetic.
- V 16 The percentage of symbols that are punctuation marks.
- V 17 The percentage of symbols that are spaces.
- Textual feature scores 610 may comprise one or more of the scores based on aspects V 1 -V 17 .
- other visual aspects, characteristics and features may be used to analyze caption candidates, headings, images and other page features so as to help identify potential captions.
- textual feature analyzer 310 may analyze and quantify the following content features of a potential caption:
- Analysis of this feature may also include the analysis of patterns related to context, such as n-word patterns or by context-tree analysis.
- media material page 240 includes several different types of page features, e.g., images, captions, body text and headings.
- textual feature analyzer 310 or another similar component, analyzes the textual features of these page features, and compares and contrasts them with the caption candidate.
- heading text may be in a different font from body text, emboldened and set off from other parts of the page. These characteristics may be similar to captions in the same media material, as with examples 243 , 245 .
- the caption identifier may reduce the likelihood of falsely identifying a heading 241 as a potential caption 243 .
- conjunctions of individual textual and proximity features may be created to provide additional points of analysis.
- feature “bold” and feature “5 cm horizontally from image” can be combined as a conjunction, and the conjunction may also have a relevance.
- these conjunctions of features may have individual scores applied based on their characteristics.
- Weight applier 330 may apply weights to the textual feature scores described above, and the proximity feature scores generated by selector module 110 . Applying weights to the textual and proximity feature scores creates a combined set of weighted feature scores 620 . As discussed above, feature conjunctions may be also analyzed at this weight application phase. The example feature “bold” and feature “5 cm horizontally from image” conjunction may have a different weight applied based on the combination.
- Varying weights may be given to each feature score based on thresholds and confidence levels associated with each attribute.
- a confidence level may be based on a variety of factors including, for example, the likelihood that a feature is indicative of a caption.
- different sets of feature weights may be applied for each type of media material examined, based on the varying significance of different features for that type of material, e.g., a type of book always labels its captions as starting with “Fig.,” a magazine generally places its captions below, and to the right of the image, a treatise places its image captions above an image, and has generally has caption type set in boldface italics.
- the weight applier 330 may output a combined set of weights to be used, as described below, to generate a caption score 630 .
- caption score generator 340 may use the combined set of weighted feature scores 620 , to produce a caption score 630 for each compared caption candidate/image pair.
- this caption score 630 is a weighted linear combination of the feature scores described above, and may be any representation relating to how likely it is that a candidate caption of an image is a caption of that image.
- the confidence score may be a normalized weighted linear combination of the feature scores.
- the confidence score may have a different range, may be a vector, or may be determined from a different type of algorithm without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
- the textual feature variables above are defined as follows: % serif is set equal to the percentage of serif font characters contained in a caption candidate, % sans_serif is set equal to the percentage of sans serif font characters contained in a caption candidate, % monospace is set equal to the percentage of monospace (e.g., non-proportional, fixed-width) font characters contained in a caption candidate, % bold is set equal to the percentage of bold font characters contained in a caption candidate, % italic is set equal to the percentage of italicized font characters contained in a caption candidate, % underlined is set equal to the percentage of underlined font characters contained in a caption candidate, % strikeout is set equal to the percentage of strikeout font characters (e.g., font characters with a single line horizontally down the center) contained in a caption candidate, % subscript is set equal to the percentage of subscript font characters contained in a caption candidate, % superscript is set equal to the percentage of superscript font characters contained in a caption candidate
- page_boost is used to favor image caption candidate pairs that are on the same page.
- this page_boost value is proportional to the total of page distance between the identified image and the caption candidate.
- the decay_factor is used to modify the caption score of a caption candidate based on the number of words in the caption candidate.
- the threshold applier 350 is configured to aggregate identified caption pairs from media pages having a caption score that exceeds a caption score threshold. In an example, this threshold score may be adjusted to change the output results of the captioner.
- the aggregated identified caption pairs may be stored in storage device 130 for further use, as is shown generally in stage 1030 . In different embodiments, the identified caption pairs may be directly stored without applying a threshold.
- captioner 100 may include caption feedback module 170 that collects and processes feedback associated with identified caption pairs to assess 460 .
- This set of identified caption pairs to assess 460 may include a portion of the stored determined caption pairs.
- Manual or automatic techniques may be used to select the identified caption pairs to assess 460 .
- feedback regarding the data output 100 may be provided, and the results of this feedback may be used to modify the analysis performed by captioner 100 .
- feedback regarding the identified caption pairs to assess 460 may be provided, and the results of this feedback may be used to modify the analysis performed by captioner 100 , an embodiment of this function described herein at stages 1040 and 1050 .
- a feedback user 410 may interact with captioner 100 through caption feedback module 170 to review identified caption pairs to assess 460 .
- a user may select positive and negative examples of identified captions paired with an image in a given media material, and this feedback 470
- feedback 470 may be sent to the caption identifier module 120 to improve the caption identification processing.
- FIGS. 7B , 7 C, 7 D An example embodiment of this feature are shown in FIGS. 7B , 7 C, 7 D where a block diagram showing a determined caption image pair is presented to a user.
- paired Image 761 and caption 762 are highlighted in the user interface with a thick line.
- Note in the example at FIG. 7B there is potentially a portion of the caption 763 that was not identified. This type of result is expected from embodiments, and this feedback stage takes this incomplete result into account.
- feedback User 410 is requested to give the following feedback to the example shown in FIG. 7B : “YES—press Y, NO—press N and UNKNOWN—press U.” Further instructions may be given to a user to assist in making the above choice:
- a quality assurance application 722 or user feedback interface may be used to present the image/caption pairs and collect the user feedback.
- FIG. 7A illustrates a more detailed view of how the caption feedback module 170 may interact with other aspects of embodiments.
- the textual feature scores generated by the textual feature analyzer 310 and the proximity feature scores generated by the proximity feature analyzer 230 may be weighted using standard weights 750 .
- the determined image caption pairs may be analyzed, and a feedback collector 720 may receive caption feedback 180 on these matches, as is shown in stage 1040 .
- a weight determiner 710 is then able to determine different feedback weights 740 to be used by the weight applier 330 in advance of the caption score generator 340 .
- this feedback loop may be used one or more times to calibrate and increase the feedback weights 740 , thereby increasing the accuracy of the caption identification, as is shown in stage 1050 .
- a weight booster 730 may use any combination of many adaptive boosting approaches, as would be apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art, to further increase the usefulness of the caption feedback 180 .
- the weight booster 730 uses a boosting algorithm to generate modified feedback weights that may impart an improved level of accuracy over feedback weights that are not so boosted.
- the weight booster 730 may use a Martingale Boosting approach to create a weight model based on a weighted linear combination of the analyzed features.

Examples of computer useable mediums include, but are not limited to, primary storage devices (e.g., any type of random access memory), secondary storage devices (e.g., hard drives, floppy disks, CD ROMS, ZIP disks, tapes, magnetic storage devices, and optical storage devices, MEMS, nanotechnological storage device, etc.).
Abstract
Description
-
- Example Equations
Caption Score=page_boost+decay_factor*((% serif+% sans_serif+% monospace)/3+(% bold+% italic+% underlined+% strikeout)/4+(% subscript+% superscript)/2+(% caps+% small_caps)/2+(4−% numeric−% nonalpha−% punct−% space)/4+proximity_score)/6 Equation (1)
decay_factor=1 if word_length>=5 and word_length<=14
decay_factor=word_length/100 if word_length<5
decay_factor=0.1−(word_length−60)/100 if word_length>=15 and word_length<30
decay_factor=0.0001 if word_length>=30
Essentially, in this example, decay_factor discounts the caption score value for text blocks that are too long or too short.
-
- If picture detection is good, and caption detection is good, and finally the caption detected is related to the picture, an answer is YES.
- If picture detection is bad, most of the time an answer is NO.
- If caption detection is bad, most of the time an answer is NO.
- If picture detection is good, and caption detection is good, but caption is vaguely related to the picture, an answer could be UNKNOWN.
- If picture detection is good, and caption detection is good, and caption is mostly related to the picture, an answer is YES.
- Tables, if properly enclosed in an image box, may be considered good picture detections.
In the case where it is in a foreign language, a user may use their best judgment by looking at the layout, symbol, font differences, to see if it looks like a caption. The user may only select UNKNOWN when they are really unsure about their decision.
