Definitions
- This invention relates generally to handwriting recognition, and more particularly to recognition of large characters sets where each character includes one or more strokes.
- keyboard entry Traditional methods, such as keyboard entry, of inputing data and text supplied in one of these types of large character based languages is often very difficult; inpart because of the large number and complexity of the character set. Additionally, many of these such languages resort to phonetic based representations using Western characters in order to enter the characters with a keyboard. Hence, keyboard-type entry of such characters is difficult.
- An example of the difficulty of keyboard entry for a large character set based language is keyboard entry of the Chinese language.
- Western Characters such as the English, anglo-saxon alphabet are used to phonetically represent the characters of the Chinese language. This is referred to as Pin-yin. Therefore, for a person wishing to enter data or text in Chinese through a keyboard, the person must first know Pin-yin, and the corresponding English character representation for the phoentic equivalent of the chinese character they are trying to enter via the keyboard.

- Such devices typically include one or more microprocessors or other digital processing devices. As such, these devices comprise computational platforms that can be readily adapted in accordance with the teachings presented herein.
- Handwritten input in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is represented as a sequence of (x,y,pen) values where x and y represent the (x,y) coordinates of an ink point with respect to some coordinate system and pen is a binary variable that represents the pen state with respect to the input surface of a device.
- a pen value can either be a pen-up (pen is not in contact with the writing or input surface) or a pen-down (pen is in contact with the writing or input surface).
- handwritten input may be captured electronically using a digitizing tablet, or alternatively may be derived from a scanned or faxed image through a process of line detection in the image.
- a digitizing tablet or alternatively may be derived from a scanned or faxed image through a process of line detection in the image.
- PDA personal digital assistant
- Other devices that function to receive handwritten input include, but are not limited to, the following: computers, modems, pagers, telephones, digital televisions, interactive televisions, devices having a digitizing tablet, facsimile devices, scanning devices, and other devices with the ability to capture handwritten input.
- the handwritten input (ink) that is presented to the recognizer corresponds to that of a single character. If two or more characters need to be recognized, then the ink corresponding to each character must be supplied to the recognizer separately in time and preferably in the desired sequential order in order to determine the identity of and preferred order of each of the characters.
- the recognizer (102) performs a series of operations on the input ink (104) and produces a list of candidate characters (106) that correspond to and represent the handwritten input (20).
- a list of candadate characters (106) is provided from which selection is made of the candidate character that most likely corresponds to and represents the handwritten input.
- the list may be variable in the number of candidate characters presented to choose from.
- the candidate character that most represents and corresponds to the handwritten input can then be selected. The selection can occur through various methods, including but not limited to such methods as user selection, or language modeling, or the like.
- the recognizer of the present invention is adapted and configured to recognize individual characters which are a part, or subset, of large character sets where preferably each character includes one or more strokes and the character set comprises hundreds or even thousands of individual characters, and more preferably whose individual characters have a preponderance of straight line pieces.
- large character sets include but are not limited to the ideographic character symbols of several of the asian languages, including but not limited to Chinese, Japanese, etc.
- recognition of handwritten input in accordance with the present invention is accomplished with respect to the character set of the simplified Chinese language, in particular, of the characters defining the category of GB1 simplified Chinese characters.
- a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes access to a preprocessing module (122), a character matching module (140), and a set of reference templates (160).
- the preprocessing module converts the handwritten input(20), or raw input data, i.e. sequence of (x,y,pen) (104) values into a sequence of "strokes.”
- a "stroke” is defined as a basic unit of pen movement. Any handwritten input can then be represented as a sequence of strokes.
- a preferred representation for a "stroke” is a straight line parametrized is by using a four dimensional vector having the following dimensions: 1) tax, 2) my, 3) len, 4) ang.
- mx is the x coordinate of the mid point of the stroke
- my is the y coordinate of the mid point of the stroke
- len is the length of the straight line stroke
- ang is the angle made by the straight line stroke with respect to some reference axis (like the x axis).
- other definitions of "stroke” and other parametrizations of straight line “stroke” may used in accordance with the preprocessing module (122) of the present invention.
- the preprocessing module (122) reduces the amount of data that needs to processed by the recognizer (102) and it also serves to correlate multiple instances of the same handwritten character that look similar, and provides the recognizer (102) with a preferred quality of input.
- An embodiment of the preprocessing module is described in related U.S. patent application entitled METHOD AND MICROPROCESSOR FOR PREPROCESSING HANDWRITING HAVING CHARACTERS COMPOSED OF A PREPONDERANCE OF STRAIGHT LINE SEGEMENTS filed concurrently, and on the same day as the present application, having U.S. Ser. No. 08/463,366.
- the recognizer includes the character matching module (140).
- the character matching module (140) correlates and compares the handwritten input of the present invention to one or more sets of stored reference templates (160) and then provides a corresponding list of preferred candidate characters that have the most probablity of representing the original handwritten input(20).
- the reference templates (160) of the present invention include one or more templates or sets of templates for each character in the large character set.
- the recognizer (102) was implented for Simplified Chinese Characters (the character set used in premise China) and has a vocabulary size of 3755 characters. This character set is commonly referred to as GB1, where simplified Chinese Characters consist of character sets GB1 and GB2.
- GB1 where simplified Chinese Characters consist of character sets GB1 and GB2.
- several templates are referred to, or accessed, by the recognizer (102) for each character in the preferred GB1 Character set vocabulary.
- the multiple templates for each character are provided to balance diversity among writer to writer variations of the complex characters; and balance diversity of forms, i.e.
- the reference templates (160) of candidate characters are developed from empirical data The empirical data is compiled and statistical analysis is performed on hundreds of samples of actual handwritten input representing each of the potential characters to be recognized. These candidate characters are then provided in accordance with the present invention and are selectable as the corresponding and representative recognized character of the handwritten input.
- a preferred format of the reference templates (160) is similar to that of the preprocessed ink that is produced by the preprocessing module (122). Accordingly, each "stroke” is parametrized in some fashion. In accordance with the present invention a "stroke” is simply a straight line parameterized is some fashion. As discussed previously a preferred way of parameterizing a "stroke” is by using a four dimensional vector having the following dimensions: 1) mx, 2) my, 3) len, 4) ang. Where mx is the x coordinate of the mid point of the stroke, my is the y coordinate of the mid point of the stroke, len is the length of the "stroke”and ang is the angle made by the "stroke” with respect to some reference axis (like the x axis). Referring to the preferred reference templates accessed by the present invention, each "stroke”in addition to being parametrized in some fashion, has a weight associated with it which indicates how important the stroke is to describe the character; the weight associated with each stroke is determined from analysis of the empirical data.
- the reference templates are obtained by gathering empirical data and performing statistical analysis.
- the format for storing the reference templates in the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 3; where the number of characters in the vocabulary is denoted by M.
- the number of templates (304) is stored.
- the number of "strokes” (308) is then stored.
- a parametrized description of the stroke and the weight associated with the stroke is stored (312).
- the preferred parametrization i.e. the four dimensional vector mx, my, len, ang! is shown. However, other parametrizations may also be used.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a block diagram of operation of a preferred embodiment of character matching is shown.
- the character matching module (140) as shown in FIG. 2 includes two distinct components. The components, a fast matching module (600), and a detailed matching module (1000) of the character matching module (140) that resides within recognizer (102) are shown in FIG. 2 and 4.
- the input to the character matching module is the sequence of straight line strokes (125) that is produced by the selected preprocessing module (122).
- the "strokes" (125) represent the preprocessed handwritten input (20).
- the first stage, or component, of the character matching module (140) is the fast matching module (600).
- the fast matching module (600) component functions to quickly provide a short list (625) of candidate characters that most likely includes a corresponding and representative match to the handwritten input (20) as illustrated in FIG. 5.
- the second stage or component of the character matching module (140) is the detailed matching module (1000).
- the detailed matching module (1000) functions to provide a detailed matching of the handwritten input (20) with only those reference templates (160) of candidate characters provided on the short list (625) produced by the fast matching module (600)0
- the short list (625) produced from the fast matching module (600) ensures that the detailed matching module can quickly and accurately provide a corresponding representative candidate character to the handwritten input.
- the combination of the fast matching module (600) and the detailed matching module (1000) provide a method and apparatus for recognition of handwritten input that can be done in real time (i.e. the amount of time it takes to write, or input, a character).
- the fast matching module 600
- the input to the fast matching module is the above discussed preprocessed handwritten input that is described by a sequence of straight line strokes (125).
- the output of the fast matching module is a short list of candidate characters (625) that most probably corresponds and represents, or matches, the handwritten input (20).
- the index i refers to the i th character of the preferred character set
- the index (620) j refers to the j th template of the character.
- the symbol Ti is the number of templates for the character whose index is i
- the quantity ms is the minimum string matching distance between the input and all the templates of one character.
- the minimum matching distance is initialized to a large number at the start of each new character (604).
- Fast matching starts by attempting to match the input with the first template of the first character in the vocabulary (i.e. the character whose index is 1).
- the absolute difference d between the number of straight line strokes in the input and the number of straight line strokes in the jth template of character i is then computed (606).
- the difference d is compared against a threshold (608).
- the threshold can be fixed one or can be variable that depends on the number of strokes in the input and the template.
- the minimum string matching distance ms is updated (612) based on the newly computed fast string matching distance s (610).
- the steps 606, 608, 610, and 612 are repeated until all the Ti templates for character i are exhausted. Note that if the difference d is greater than the threshold, steps 610 and 612 are omitted and the next template for the character is considered.
- the current shortlist of characters that best match the input is updated (618).
- the minimum fast string matching distances for matching the input with the templates for each character in the shortlist are also stored. The shortlist is sorted using the minimum fast string matching distances.
- the current shortlist is updated by inserting the new character index into the shortlist at the location dictated by the new minimum fast string matching distance. If the new minimum fast string matching distance is greater than the last entry in the current list of minimum fast string matching distances, then the current shortlist does not need to be updated (622). After updating the current short list of candidate characters that best match the input, the next character in the vocabulary, if one such exists, is considered by starting again at step 604. After all the characters in the vocabulary have been considered, the short list of candidate characters that best match the input is forwarded to the detailed matching stage of the character matching module.
- the fast string matching in 610 is based on a single stroke feature.
- more than one stroke feature may be used for fast string matching.
- a preferred stroke feature to use for fast string matching is the angle of the stroke.
- the fast string matching distance is the distance between two one dimensional strings.
- a one dimensional string is simply a string of one dimensional quantities (like a single stroke feature). Note that the lengths of the two strings need not be the same.
- the technique used to compute the fast string matching distance is illustrated using a simple example.
- the length of string S1 is 5 and the length of string S2 is 4.
- the mth element of string S2 be paired with the nth element of string S1.
- the three immediate neighboring pairs (m+1,n), (m+1,n+1), and (m,n+1) are compared (see 706). The pair that has the least distance is picked as the next matching pair and the distance between the two elements in the new pair is added to the current fast string matching distance.
- the table 802 shows the first elements of the two strings forming a matching pair with a score of 5.
- the three pairs and (5(m+1), 10(n)); (5(m+1), 25(n+1)); and (15(m), 25(n+1)) illustrated in FIGS. 1, 1a, and 12 are considered.
- the pair (5,10) has the least distance of 5.
- the processes of finding the best matching pairs in the two strings is repeated until the last element of string S1 is paired with the last element of string S2. These steps are illustrated in tables 806, 808, 810, and 812.
- the accumulated fast string matching distance when the last elements of the two strings are paired is the final fast string matching distance.
- the final string matching distance between the two strings S1 and S2 is 70.
- Table 814 in FIG. 8 shows the sequence of best matching pairs that was used to compute the fast string matching distance between the two strings S1 and S2.
- FIG. 9 shows the computational blocks of the detailed matching module.
- the inputs to the detailed matching module are the preprocessed handwritten input (sequence of strokes) and the shortlist of candidate characters that is produced by the fast matching module.
- the output of the fast detailed matching module (1000) is the final sorted list of candidate characters that best match the input.
- the detailed matching module comprises of two major computational blocks.
- the first block (902) finds a detailed matching distance between the input and the templates for all the characters included in the shortlist of candidate characters produced by the fast matching module.
- the output of 902 is a first detailed match list of candidate characters.
- the second detailed matching block (904) re-sorts the first detailed match list of candidate characters to produces the final sorted list of candidate characters that best match the handwritten input (106).
- the index i refers to the ith entry in the shortlist of candidate characters produced by the fast matching module (1002).
- the index of the character stored as the i th entry in the fast match short list is denoted by fi.
- the index j refers to the j th template of character fi and T(fi) is the number of templates stored for character fi.
- the symbol F is used to denote the size of the fast match short list.
- the quantity ms is the minimum dynamic programming matching distance between the input and all the templates of one character. The minimum dynamic programming matching distance is initialized to a large number at the start of each new character in the fast match shortlist (1004).
- Detailed matching starts by attempting to match the input with the first template of the first character in the fast match short list.
- a matching distance s is computed between the input and the jth template of character fi (see 1006) using the technique of dynamic programming.
- the technique of dynamic programming is known to one of ordinary skill in the art and can be found in the paper by Sakoe and Chiba. (H. Sakoe and S. Chiba, "Dynamic Programming Algorithm Optimization for Spoken Word Recognition” in Readings in Speech Recognition, A. Waibel and K-F Lee, editors. Morgan Kaufrnann, San Mateo, Calif., USA. 1990.).
- dynamic programming is used to find a matching distance between two sequences of "strokes".
- a stroke is defined to be a straight line parametrized in some fashion.
- a preferred parametrization of the straight line strokes is by the four dimensional vector mx, my, ten, ang! where mx is the x coordinate of the mid point of the stroke, my is the y coordinate of the mid point of the stroke, len is the length of the stroke, and ang is the angle made by the straight line stroke with respect to some reference axis.
- mx is the x coordinate of the mid point of the stroke
- my is the y coordinate of the mid point of the stroke
- len is the length of the stroke
- ang is the angle made by the straight line stroke with respect to some reference axis.
- other definitions and parametrizations of strokes may be used.
- a preferred stroke distance to use between two strokes parameterized as mx1, my1, len1, ang1! and mx2, my2, len2, ang2! is:
- the quantities w -- x, w -- y, w -- l and w -- a are the weights associated with different dimensions of vector describing a straight line stroke.
- the function abs(x) is the absolute value of x
- cabs(x) is the absolute value x assuming circular symmetry of x. Note that there is circular symmetry in the stroke angles, since 0 degrees is same as 360 degrees.
- the minimum dynamic programming matching distance, ms is updated (1008) based on the newly computed dynamic programming matching distance s (1006). The steps 1006 and 1008 are repeated until all the T(fi) templates for character fi are exhausted (1012). Once the minimum dynamic programming matching distance between the input and the templates for character fi has been computed, the current first detailed match list of characters that best match the input is updated (1014). In addition to the first detailed match list of candidate characters that best match the input, the minimum dynamic programming matching distances for matching the input with the templates for each character in the list are also stored. The first detailed match list is sorted using the minimum dynamic programming matching distances.
- the current first detailed match list is updated by inserting the new character index into the first detailed match list at the location dictated by the new minimum dynamic programming matching distance (1016). If the new minimum dynamic programming matching distance is greater than the last entry in the current list of minimum dynamic programming matching distances, then the current first detailed match list does not need to be updated (1018). After updating the current first detailed match list of candidate characters that best match the input, the next character in the fast match list, if one such exists, is considered by starting again at step 1004. After all the characters in the fast match list have been considered, the first detailed match list of candidate characters that best match the input is forwarded to the module that resorts the first detailed match list of candidate characters in order to produce the final sorted list of candidate characters that best match the input.
- FIG. 11 is a flow chart describing the module that re-sorts the first detailed match list of candidate characters.
- the index i refers to the i th entry in the first detailed match list of candidate characters produced by the dynamic programming based matching module (1102).
- the index of the character stored as the i th entry in the first detailed match list is denoted by li.
- the index j refers to the j th template of character li and T(li) is the number of templates stored for character li.
- the symbol L is used to denote the size of the first detailed match list.
- the quantity ms is the minimum weighted dynamic programming matching distance between the input and all the templates of one character.
- the minimum weighted dynamic programming matching distance is initialized to a large number at the start of each new character in the first detailed match list (1104). Re-sorting the first detailed match list starts by attempting to compute a minimum weighted dynamic programming matching distance between the input and the first template of the first character in the first detailed match list. A weighted dynamic programming matching distance s is computed between the input and the jth template of character li (see 1106) using the technique of dynamic programming and then weighting individual stroke errors in order to produce the final matching distance.
- Traditional dynamic programming methods also produce a "best path" which gives the pairing of the input strokes and the strokes in the template. The concept of best path is known to one of ordinary skill in the art.
- the normal dynamic programming matching distance is simply the sum of the inter-stroke distances along the best path.
- a weighted sum of the inter-stroke distance along the best path is used.
- the weight used for each inter-stroke distance in the best path is weight stored for each template stroke.
- the rationale for using a weighted dynamic programming matching distance is that some strokes in a handwritten character may be more consistent than other strokes when multiple instance of the same character are considered Hence the more consistent strokes need to be weighted more in order to get robust recognition of handwritten input.
- the minimum weighted dynamic programming matching distance, ms is updated (1108) based on the newly computed weighted dynamic programming matching distance s (1106).
- the steps 1106 and 1108 are repeated until all the T(li) templates for character li are exhausted (1110).
- the minimum weighted dynamic programming matching distance between the input and the templates for character li has been computed (1112)
- the current sorted list of characters that best match the input is updated (1114).
- the minimum weighted dynamic programming matching distances for matching the input with the templates for each character in the list are also stored.
- the final sorted match list is sorted using the minimum weighted dynamic programming matching distances.
- the current sorted match list is updated by inserting the new character index (1116) into the sorted match list at the location dictated by the new minimum weighted dynamic programming matching distance. If the new minimum weighted dynamic programming matching distance is greater than the last entry in the current list of minimum weighted dynamic programming matching distances, then the current sorted match list does not need to be updated (1118). After updating the current sorted match list of candidate characters that best match the input, the next character in the first detailed match list, if one such exists, is considered by starting again at step 1104. After all the characters in the first detailed match list have been considered, the sorted match list of candidate characters becomes the final sorted list of candidate characters that best match the input
- One obvious advantage is ease of data, or text, input over traditional key-board entry methods, including the obvious advantage of the ease of entry of scanned or "off-line" handwritten input into printed data, or text.
- Another obvious advantage is recognition of handwritten input where the input represents a single character, data point, or other unitary identifying graphically representation, that is a subset of a large complex set of characters, data points, or other graphical representation.
