Embodiment
This document describes for automatically switching for technology, method, system and the mechanism of the profile (equipment arranges and collects) of mobile computing device (such as mobile phone, smart phone (such as IPHONE, BLACKBERRY), personal digital assistant (PDA), portable electronic device (such as IPOD) etc.).About when, the determination of switching device profile can based on the situation associated with the mobile computing device user of mobile computing device (and/or with).Such as, when the situation associated with the mobile computing device user of mobile computing device (and/or with) indicates mobile computing device to be physically located at position (such as in meeting room, medium in the office of doctor) of second profile (vibrate open, ringer close) of user's preferred illustrative, this mobile computing device can automatically switch to this second profile from exemplary the first profile (maximum ringer volume, vibration are opened).
Because mobile computing device has become more centered by the daily life of user, so his/her mobile computing device is carried in each place that user almost goes to he or she.Such as, user often stays at home, at place of working and the mobile computing device carrying with them at doings.But user remembers the profile (equipment that such as ringer is arranged, display is arranged, loud speaker is arranged, microphone is arranged, automatic telephone call response is arranged etc. arrange collect) of the equipment adjusting them all the time when may being difficult to move between the two positions.The profile that cannot suitably adjust equipment according to the current context of equipment may bring problem to user.Such as, cell phone ringer to sound the attendant that may bother meeting and make the cellular owner poverty-stricken in the session.In addition, adjust equipment arrange may provide because of equipment become loaded down with trivial details for carrying out the user interface of such adjustment.
The technology described in this article, method, system and mechanism allow mobile computing device suitably adjust its profile at the current context of equipment to timing automatic and do not rely on user and do like this.Mobile computing device can determine when based on the current context associated with the mobile computing device user of mobile computing device (and/or with) and how switch its profile and guide without explicit user when determining.Current context for mobile computing device can comprise the much information with mobile computing device and/or the user-association with mobile computing device.Such information can be arranged in device external and can by the sensor identification of equipment, near such as computing equipment is positioned at (be such as positioned at wireless network " testnet2010 " near etc.), the direction that equipment is advanced and velocity's (such as 20 miles of north row per hour), current geographic position (such as on the turning in Marquette main road the 10th street), the support type (such as the support of automobile adaptation) that mobile computing device is docked with, ambient noise (such as low pitch buzz, music etc.) and from the present image of mobile computing device camera.This information can also be used to identify the location expression (such as family, place of working, automobile, school, meeting room, personal office etc.) residing for mobile computing device.
Situation can be positioned at device interior, such as equipment is to the determination of the following: time and date on the same day (such as 2 pm on July 29th, 2010), coming and/or recent calendar reservation (such as meeting with John in 2 pm on July 29th, 2,010 half), recent device activity (such as sending the Email about 2 half-sessions to John), from the history image not being reflected in the current state around equipment of mobile computing device camera and the state (present battery status of mobile computing device, the application that current mobile computing device runs).
Such as, mobile computing device can advance based on the equipment detected two-forty (such as use the arbitrary motion transducer in multi-motion transducer, these motion sensors are standarized components of equipment), be docked with based on equipment in the mobile device support of automobile adaptation and (such as detect the pin arrangement be connected for the physical electronic between mobile computing device with support) and/or determine that it is currently advanced in the car based on the current navigation application (example states of mobile computing device) run on equipment.Mobile computing device can determine the suitable profile that will be used for equipment based on this current context.Such as, above for automobile, mobile computing device can be determined should use " hands-free " profile, such as unlatching speaker-phone feature (activating the loud speaker and microphone that are used for equipment) and close display (for security reasons) when equipment is arranged in automobile.
Mobile computing device learn position can describe (such as automobile, family, place of working etc.) and will be used for determining when to switch the profile switching law of the profile that mobile computing device uses.Can based on User Activity (or inertia) and the situated leaning location expression associated with mobile device.Such as, based in the middle meeting arranged of electronic calendar (can be accessed by mobile computing device) for meeting room, mobile computing device can infer that meeting room is location expression.At the duration of meeting period, mobile device can learn the situation associated with meeting room (location expression), such as can wireless network, the wireless network signal strength of association and ambient noise level.Then mobile computing device can mate detecting the situation of situation with the study for meeting room or know it in threshold similarity internal clock and be arranged in meeting.And if by mobile computing device, such mark can be used for determining whether the current context of switching device then determines to select which new profile like this.
Mobile computing device can learn with service regeulations to determine whether the profile of switching device and should select which new profile.According to the situation of equipment position change in the inner, learning rules can be carried out based on the user action (or attonity) arranging (such as ringer, display, network connection etc.) about equipment.Such as, if when equipment at night between 7 and at 10 in evening near wireless network " homenet " time user habit ground max volume open his ringer, then select the rule of the profile corresponding with maximum ringer volume when equipment can learn for being included in situation and being positioned near " homenet " between at 7 in evening and evening 10.Mobile computing device can wait for learning rules, until run into situation (comprising the location expression of mark) and/or similar movement (or attonity) pattern at least threshold number detected for given situation.
Mobile computing device can continue to use the profile automatically selected until the appearance of multiple End Event, and the current context such as mobile computing device changes (such as user removes mobile computing device from automobile), user indicates them to want the power step-down (such as remaining the charge volume of less than 10% when use has the profile of maximum screen brightness battery) using different profile (such as user manually vetos the automatic equipment selected and arranges) and/or store when using and drawing the profile of a large amount of power for the battery of mobile computing device.
As described more specifically below, mobile computing device learn position can describe Sum fanction and local and/or to automatically switch in combination profile with the computer system away from mobile computing device on a mobile computing device.Such as, mobile computing device can determine it current context, learning rules and/or location expression, determine whether to switch profile and as autonomous device (such as equipment is not mutual by network and other) and/or by switching profile alternately with other computing equipment (such as remote server system) based on current profile.
Figure 1A-C is for based on the exemplary mobile computing device 100,130 of situation automatic switchover profile and the concept map of 172a-d.With reference to Figure 1A, this diagram depicts rule that mobile computing device learn position describes and switch for profile, then time afterwards switch the profile that mobile computing device uses example based on the situation detected.
In steps A (102), mobile computing device 100 learn position describes.According to given situation, carry out learn position based on user about the various actions (or attonity) that mobile computing device performs and describe.Location expression can correspond to multiple position, such as physical location/structure (such as family, place of working, automobile etc.) and/or with any position in the connection (be such as connected to " homenet " wireless network, plug in the support of particular type) of mobile computing device and/or connection.
As shown in daily record 104, mobile computing device 100 can record various user action (and/or attonity) and the situation 106a-n associated.Actions and the situation 106a-n associated of these records can be used for learn position by mobile computing device 100 and describe and the rule that switches for profile of study.For each action and the situation that records can correspond to perform user action time or near situation.Daily record also can indicate the contact between recorded user action, thus mobile computing device 100 can rebuild user action when learn position description and profile switching law and situation changes sequence.The user action of record can correspond to the adjustment to the setting of mobile computing device, such as closes ringer, adjusts the brightness of display and be connected to wireless network.
User also can be contained in daily record 104 about the attonity of setting changing mobile computing device 100 and to be used for the rule that learn position describes and/or switch for profile.Such as, whether daily record 104 can comprise the entry arranged for or not any equipment when the situation associated with mobile device 100 changes user.Similarly, daily record 104 can comprise the entry corresponding with the time period when the situation for equipment and/or the setting for equipment do not change.Such as, such entry can indicating positions describe (such as equipment 100 situation and be arranged on evening/or early morning during keep identical can indicating equipment 100 during this period, be positioned at the family of user).Daily record 104 also can comprise following information, and when this information indicating user does not change over its current profile and action in response to equipment 100 automatically.Such attonity of user can indicate the silent approvement that changes profile and provide (viewpoint from user) automatically to change and be executed correctly such prompting.
User action and the exemplary entries 106a-n associating situation is depicted in daily record 104.The session of the arrangement of entry 106a indicating user when the current context of mobile computing device 100 is included in the scope of wireless network " workwifi " and in meeting room closes the ringer of mobile computing device.Entry 106a also indicates the intensity of " workwifi " signal when closing ringer to be 90%.Entry 106n instruction the scope that the current context of mobile computing device 100 is included in " workwifi " network in, be physically connected to there is title " working computer " computing equipment (being such as docked with " working computer " computing equipment), when unlatching ringer without meeting and operationally between (such as point) in 9 points-afternoon 5 in the morning perform time user open the ringer of mobile computing device 100.Entry 106n also indicates 20% signal strength signal intensity when opening ringer for " workwifi " signal.
Based on these entry 106a-n, mobile computing device 100 learn position can describe 108a-n.Such as, mobile computing device 100 can carry out learn position based on entry 106a and describe " meeting room " 108a, and the user of this location expression marking equipment 100 and/or association may be arranged in meeting room in the time or the large time about closing ringer of closing ringer and participate in a conference.In another example, mobile computing device 100 can carry out learn position based on entry 106n and describe " working computer " 108n, and the user of this location expression indicating equipment 100 and/or association is positioned at the working computer place of user when opening ringer.
Learn position can describe 108a-n and describe 108a-n with memory location, various situation partial association ground, these situation part indicating equipments 100 are in the position described by location expression.Such as, " workwifi " wireless network high signal intensity (be such as greater than 50%, be greater than 75% etc.) and/or the meeting that arranges is current is holding the location expression 108a that can indicate for meeting room.Location expression 108a can be created to comprise such station location marker situation.In another example, the low signal intensity (be such as less than 50%, be less than 25% etc.) being physically connected to the computing equipment of called after " working computer " and/or " workwifi " wireless network can describe 108n by indicating positions.Location expression 108n can be created to comprise such station location marker situation.
Although profile switching law can be learnt and do not consider that location expression (such as, regardless of location expression, the rule of study can indicate should close ringer during the event of some arrangement), but these location expressions 108a-n can be used as the anchor of study profile switching law.When learning profile switching law, can divide into groups to action according to the location expression of association, and can from such group to regular modeling.More than one rule can be associatedly learnt with location expression.
In step B (110), mobile computing device 100 can learn the rule switched for profile.And if the rule switched for profile can be used for determining when that the profile profile that switching mobile device 100 uses switches applicable, determine which profile equipment 100 should use.Profile for mobile computing device 100 comprises the various features (such as the tinkle of bells device, display, loud speaker, microphone etc.) that should combinationally use for mobile computing device.Such as, exemplary speaker-phone profile can indicate and open loud speaker, open microphone and other setting of mobile computing device remains unchanged.
Mobile computing device 100 can carry out learning rules based on the user action of record with the location expression 108a-n associating situation 106a-n and study.In the example described, mobile computing device 100 learns exemplary profile switching law 112a-n.Profile switching law 112a indicates the ringer of the closing device 100 when mobile computing device 100 is arranged in meeting room (the location expression 108a of study).Can learn this regular 112a based on multiple user action 106a-n, these user actions comprise and indicate the mobile computing device 100 when closing ringer and be arranged in the action 106a of meeting room (location expression 108a).Can learning rules in case by situation important/correlated characteristic is linked to profile.Such as, the learning rules that (can use machine learning algorithm) are so that how all the position in situation and time factor " dim display brightness when battery status is below 5% ".In the example present, in the situation being linked to display light modulation profile, the battery status of less than 5% can be designated key character.
Profile switching law 112n indicates mobile computing device 100 to open ringer when equipment 100 is positioned at working computer (location expression 108n) place.Can learn this regular 112a based on multiple user action 106a-n, these user actions comprise and indicate the user when mobile computing device 100 is positioned at working computer (being connected to working computer) place and open the user action 106n of ringer.
In this article, simplify to demonstrate above about the example of location expression Sum fanction study.Such as, equipment 100 can be waited for learn position description and/or profile switching law, until have enough user behavior patterns for supporting such location expression and/or rule.Such as, equipment 100 can not create location expression and/or profile switching law, unless there is the action of the threshold number (such as 10,50,100,1000 etc.) supporting such position and/or rule.
Equipment 100 can within the time period (such as one week, one month, 1 year etc.) extended continuously execution steps A and B (being respectively 102 and 110) with learn position description and profile switching law.Even if after have learned some position Sum fanction, equipment 100 still can continue to perform steps A and B to find reposition Sum fanction and the location expression Sum fanction previously learnt of refining.
In addition, mobile computing device 100 locally and/or with remote computing device (such as remote server system) can also perform steps A (102) and/or step B (110) in combination.Such as, the code that mobile computing device 100 can locally run on the appliance 100 for machine learning algorithm describes and/or profile switching law with learn position.In another example, mobile computing device 100 can provide the daily record 104 of user action to remote server system (such as providing the server system of phone and/or data, services to mobile computing device) and can receive from remote server system the information that home position describes 108a-n and/or profile switching law 112a-n as return.
