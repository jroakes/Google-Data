- the present invention relates to a method and system for gathering and disseminating data between a group of users.
- the present invention further relates to using a hierarchical expert tree to manage data.
- a user When seeking to gather and disseminate data from a group of networked users containing many expert users, a user may seek to communicate on a one-on-one basis or a one-to-many, or broadcast, basis.
- the communications may be a text or voice message.
- Group communications may be integral to social networks where an individual user or device may simultaneously communicate with a group of users or devices.
- the current group communication systems may be based on “flat lists”, providing the same connectivity to all users, that are defined either statically, such as instant message groups, or dynamically, such as a selective dynamic group call (SDGC).
- SDGC selective dynamic group call
- a connection interface may receive a query.
- a processor may select an initial expert from the hierarchical expert tree based upon the query and direct the query towards the initial expert.
- a session initiation protocol server may generate a hierarchical expert tree from an expert pool.

- FIG. 11 illustrates in a block diagram one embodiment of an ANSWER that an expert would send in response to a user.
- FIG. 12 illustrates a possible configuration of a computing system to act as a mobile telecommunications apparatus or electronic device to execute the present invention.
- the present invention comprises a variety of embodiments, such as a method, an apparatus, and an electronic device, and other embodiments that relate to the basic concepts of the invention.
- the electronic device may be any manner of computer, mobile device, or wireless communication device.
- a method, apparatus, and electronic device for hierarchical communications are disclosed.
- a connection interface may receive a query.
- a processor may select an initial expert from the hierarchical expert tree based upon the query and directs the query towards the initial expert.
- a session initiation protocol server may generate a hierarchical expert tree from an expert pool.
- the hierarchical group communication system may be used to process a query.
- a query may be a request seeking an answer to a data query, such as locating information residing with one or more members of the group.
- the hierarchical group communication may arrange the users in a tree structure such that the original root node is the communication initiator.
- a communication message may propagate through other nodes based on the level of the node in the tree.
- the hierarchical group communication may be transmitted as a text message, a voice message, a multimedia message, or other message medium.
- a hierarchical group may contact a node or nodes, propagating the communication to lower or higher level nodes as required.
- the hierarchical group may optimize the call and network overhead associated with a group call for the purpose of accomplishing a specific task, such as answering a question.
- the communication may resume at each contacted node and propagate further in the tree, instead of terminating on the contact node or nodes in a “flat list”.
- the hierarchical groups may be statically defined and maintained in a common directory accessible to all the nodes or may be dynamically published by the node that initiates or propagates the call.
- the hierarchical group may be dynamically formed based on the user specified criteria and contact node characteristics, rather than relying on the user selection of nodes required by the selective dynamic group call feature.
- the hierarchical group may be initially based on the organizational chart for the overall group.
- the hierarchical group may be continuously monitored for any data events, such as node timeout triggered by a failure of the contact node to respond after a given set of time. These data events may trigger adjustments to the tree, including tree regeneration, branch regeneration, the addition or removal of contact nodes, re-layout of the tree, and other tree adjustments. Due to reduced network overhead, the hierarchical groups may be scaled up or down depending upon the query context.
- FIG. 1 illustrates in a block diagram one example of a hierarchical communications tree 100 .
- the chief executive officer (CEO) 110 of a company may be looking for information about a certain technology.
- the CEO 110 may initiate a query about this information retrieval task with a subordinate officer 120 , such as a vice president (VP), asking for information.
- the VPs 120 in turn may initiate a search within the VPs' organizations if necessary to complete the given query.
- the information may be made available by one of the nodes, such as a director 130 (Dir 3 ), under a VP 120 (VP 2 ).
- the information may then be forwarded to the CEO 110 therefore completing the “search” process workflow.

- the response may be the answer to the query, may be to establish a real-time communication session with the user 202 , or may be to schedule a real-time communication session with the user 202 .
- the real-time communication session may be a text session, voice session, video session, hybrid voice and data session, or other types of communication. If the peer expert of the first level peer group 210 thinks that a peer expert in a second level peer group 216 may be better suited to respond to the query, then peer expert of the first level peer group 210 may forward the query to the second level peer group 216 (Arrow 218 ). The peer expert of the second level peer group 216 may send a response either directly to the user 202 or via the first level peer group 210 (Arrow 220 ).
- a variety of external systems 222 may provide services beyond the routing of queries.
- the user 202 may send feedback to an external rating system 222 (Arrow 224 ).
- the external rating system 222 may forward that feedback to the peer expert that answered the query (Arrow 226 ). If the system is a pay-per-query system, the user 202 may send payment to an external billing system 222 (Arrow 228 ).
- the external billing system 222 may send a disbursement to the answering peer expert (Arrow 230 ).

- FIG. 7 illustrates in a flowchart one embodiment for a method 700 of responding to a query using the SQF.
- the SQF server 204 may receive a query from a user 202 (Block 702 ).
- the SQF server 204 may generate a HET from a pool of experts based upon the query (Block 704 ). Each expert from among the expert pool may be associated with an expert profile that the SQF server 204 may use to generate the HET.
- the SQF server 204 may select an initial expert or set of initial experts from among the HET based upon the query (Block 706 ).
- the SQF server 204 may select the initial expert or experts based upon the associated expert profiles that best match the query.
- the SQF server 204 may also select the initial expert or experts based upon location or availability.
- the SQF server 204 may direct the query to the selected initial expert or experts (Block 708 ).
- the query may be directed to one or more devices associated with the selected expert. If the reply period for the selected expert expires without a response being received (Block 710 ), the SQF server 204 or a SIP UA 310 resident on the initial expert device may forward the query to an expert device of a successive expert on a higher or lower level of the HET (Block 712 ).
- the SQF server 204 may forward the query to a successive expert device on a higher or lower level of the HET (Block 712 ). If the SQF server 204 receives a response to the query (Block 714 ), the SQF server 204 may forward the response to the user 202 (Block 716 ).
- the response may be the answer to the query, may be to establish a real-time communication session with the user 202 , or may be to schedule a real-time communication session with the user 202 .
- the real-time communication session may be a text session, voice session, video session, or other type of communication.
- the SQF server 204 may adjust the expert profile of a responsive expert based upon the expert response to reflect that expert's familiarity with the subject matter of the query (Block 718 ).
- the SQF server 204 may adjust the reply period for interacting with a responsive or non-responsive expert to reflect the expert response time (Block 720 ). For example, the SQF server 204 may extend the reply period if a response is received after the reply period has expired.
- FIG. 8 illustrates in a block diagram one embodiment of an expert profile 800 .
- the expert profile 800 may have a tree type 802 showing the subject matter of the HET, the tree identifier (ID) 804 identifying the tree and its design goal statement 500 , an expert ID 806 identifying an expert in the HET, a reply period 808 for the expert, the expert location 810 , and the periods 812 during which that expert is available, or expert availability.
- ID tree identifier
- FIG. 9 illustrates in a flowchart one embodiment for a method 900 of constructing a hierarchical communications tree.
- the method 900 may use user preferences and node properties.
- the user preferences may include tree depth, layout, acceptable redundancy, node timeout, inclusion of a specific node, exclusion of a node or nodes, and other user preferences.
- the node properties may include presence, location, and other node properties.
- the tree designer 402 may receive a query from a user (Block 902 ).
- the goal generator 408 may derive a set of tree criteria based upon the query (Block 904 ).
- the set of tree criteria may include contact nodes, tree depth, and other characteristics of the HET.
- the tree designer 402 may then check the tree history database 406 (Block 906 ). If a tree matching a pre-defined percentage of the tree criteria, including required criteria if any, is available in the tree history database 406 (Block 908 ), the tree designer 402 may retrieve the previously defined tree from the database (Block 910 ). The pre-defined percentage may be a default percentage, a percentage set by the user, an evolutionary percentage determined by the tree manager 400 to be optimum, or some other percentage. If the previously defined tree is an exact match to the set of tree criteria (Block 912 ), the tree designer 402 may reuse the previously defined tree (Block 914 ).
- the tree designer 402 may construct a hierarchical communications tree based on the previously defined tree (Block 916 ). If a tree matching a pre-defined percentage of the tree criteria, and the required criteria if any, is not available in the tree history database 406 (Block 908 ), the tree designer may select a sub-group of contact nodes from the group of contact nodes available through the node manager 404 based upon the query (Block 918 ). The tree designer 402 may use the nodes to construct the hierarchical communications tree (Block 920 ).
- the position of a node in the group hierarchy may be determined based on the relative importance of the node for a given task as well as the acceptable redundancy.
- the tree designer 402 may determine node timeout policies based on the query (Block 922 ). The timeout policies for each contact node may determine how long the process may wait for the contact node to respond before continuing to the next available contact node in the tree. Based on a given tree and the associated timeout policies, the tree designer 402 may orchestrate the communication between the nodes (Block 924 ). The communication process may wait for a contact node response based on the timeout policies. The tree designer 402 may manage the start, restart, and termination of the communication process. The tree designer 402 may report the dynamic state of the communication process to a tree manager.
- the tree designer 402 may have access to incremental knowledge about the completion status of the query at hand, and use this information to guide the tree adaptation.
- the tree adaptation may be based on timeout status, stated goal, and knowledge state, and other metrics evaluating the effectiveness of the communication and performance of the query.
- the tree adaptation may include tree optimization in terms of network flow, structure, and membership. For example, to meet the design goal new nodes may be dynamically added to the tree if one of the intermediate nodes does not respond.
- the tree adaptation method may be implemented as an evolutionary search, leveraging existing techniques, including genetic algorithms and tabu searches.
- the tree designer 402 may use trees present in the tree history to “seed” a population of candidate solutions for an evolutionary search.
- the evaluation function may be used to guide the selection of the historical trees to be included in the set of candidate solutions.
- new trees may be included in the set of candidate solutions. These may be generated by randomized changes, including swapping one node for another, changing the timeout value associated with the link between two nodes, and swapping one sub-tree for another.
