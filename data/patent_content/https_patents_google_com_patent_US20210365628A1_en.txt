- the present disclosure is generally directed to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of information transmission and processing over disparate computing resources. It is challenging for disparate computing resource to efficiently process, and consistently and accurately parse audio-based instructions in a voice-based computing environment. For example, the disparate computing resources may not have access to the same voice models, or may have access to out of date or unsynchronized voice models that can make it challenging to accurately and consistently parse the audio-based instructions.
- Systems and methods of the present disclosure are generally directed to a data processing system that routes packetized actions via a computer network.
- the data processing system can process the voice-based input using specifically voice models that are trained based on aggregate voice to parse the voice-based instructions and create an action data structure.
- the data processing system can transmit the action data structure to one or more component of the data processing system or third-party provider devices, which can also be referred to as service provider computing device, thereby allowing the third-party provider device to process the action data structure without having to process the voice-based input.
- third-party provider devices can also be referred to as service provider computing device, thereby allowing the third-party provider device to process the action data structure without having to process the voice-based input.
- the present solution can reduce resource consumption, processor utilization, battery consumption, bandwidth utilization, size of an audio file, or amount of time consumed by a speaker by parsing voice-based instructions from an end user, constructing an action data structure using a template, and routing the action data structure to a corresponding third-party provider.

The data processing system can transmit, via a network interface, the second audiovisual content element to the client device for insertion by the client device in a content slot of the online document, responsive to the selection of the second audiovisual content element.
- At least one aspect is directed to a method of extracting audiovisual features from online document elements. A recognition engine executing on a data processing system having one or more processors can identify a first audiovisual content element on an online document, the first audiovisual content element including image data. The recognition can retrieve a second audiovisual content element from a content provider database, the second audiovisual content element including image data. The recognition engine can extract an image feature from the first audiovisual content element by applying an image feature detection to the image data of the first audiovisual content element. The recognition engine can extract an image feature from the second audiovisual content element by applying the image feature detection to the image data of the second audiovisual content element. The recognition engine can determine an image feature match between the image feature of the first audiovisual content element and the image feature of the second audiovisual content element. The recognition engine can select the second audiovisual content element for display by the client device on the online document based on the image feature match. The data processing system can transmit, via a network interface, the second audiovisual content element to the client device for insertion by the client device in a content slot of the online document, responsive to the selection of the second audiovisual content element.

The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways.
- The present disclosure is generally directed to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of information transmission and processing over disparate computing resources. It is challenging for disparate computing resource to efficiently process, and consistently and accurately parse audio-based instructions in a voice-based computing environment. For example, the disparate computing resources may not have access to the same voice models, or may have access to out of date or unsynchronized voice models that can make it challenging to accurately and consistently parse the audio-based instructions.
- Systems and methods of the present disclosure are generally directed to a data processing system that routes packetized actions via a computer network. The data processing system can process the voice-based input using specifically voice models that are trained based on aggregate voice to parse the voice-based instructions and create an action data structure. The data processing system can transmit the action data structure to one or more component of the data processing system or third-party provider devices, which can also be referred to as service provider computing device, thereby allowing the third-party provider device to process the action data structure without having to process the voice-based input. By processing the voice-based input for a plurality of third-party provider devices, the data processing system can improve the reliability, efficiency, and accuracy with which voice-based instructions are processed and performed.
- The present solution can reduce resource consumption, processor utilization, battery consumption, bandwidth utilization, size of an audio file, or amount of time consumed by a speaker by parsing voice-based instructions from an end user, constructing an action data structure using a template, and routing the action data structure to a corresponding third-party provider.
- A digital component or a content item may refer to any form of communication in which one or more products, services, ideas, messages, people, organizations, or other items are identified and promoted or otherwise communicated. The digital components are not limited to commercial promotions or other communications. a digital component may be a public service announcement or any other type of notice, such as a broadcast or a public notice published in printed or electronic press. In some implementations, a digital component may be referred to or included in sponsored content. A digital component can include one or more content items. A digital component can be a content item. The digital component can be any type of digital file or document, such as a webpage, image file, video file, audio file, or action data structure.
- Digital components (or promotional or digital content items generally) may be communicated via various mediums and in a number of forms. In some examples, digital components may be communicated through an interactive medium, such as the Internet, and may include graphical digital components (e.g., banner digital components), textual digital components, image digital components, audio digital components, video digital components, digital components combining one of more of the foregoing formats, or any form of electronically delivered digital component. Digital Components may include embedded information, such as embedded media, links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions. Digital Components also may be communicated through RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, radio channels, television channels, print media, and other media.
- The term “digital component” can refer to both a single “creative” and a “digital component group.” A creative can refer to any entity that represents one digital component impression. a digital component impression can refer to any form of presentation of a digital component, such that the digital component is viewable or receivable by a user. In some examples, a digital component impression may occur when a digital component is displayed on a display device of a user access device. a digital component group can refer, for example, to an entity that represents a group of creatives that share a common characteristic, such as having the same digital component targeting criteria. Digital Component groups can be used to create a digital component campaign. For convenience, digital components, creatives, content items, and other digital content can be collectively referred to as “digital components” herein.
- Digital Components may be included on resources provided by content provider computing devices, which can also be referred to as publisher computing devices. For example, a content provider computing device may specify one or more areas on a resource, such as a webpage, where digital components are to be displayed. A content provider computing device may also provide a resource such as an application to user devices, and may allow digital components to be displayed in the application. Relevant digital components may be identified based on text content included on the resource. Some resources include more multimedia content, such as image content, audio content, or video content, than text content. The text content may not be related to the multimedia content. Thus, irrelevant digital components may be provided. Further, certain resources include no text content. Embodiments identify relevant digital components based on multimedia content included on a resource provided by a content provider computing device.

Eachdigital component 106 may be associated with one or more digital component keywords. For example,digital component 106C is associated withdigital component keyword 109C. Further, eachdigital component 106 may be associated with one or more text labels for a digital component multimedia element associated with a digital component. For example,digital component 106D may be associated withimage 107D, which is associated with a text label. - In one embodiment, the multimedia elements are sent with the request for digital components to the
data processing system 102. In another embodiment, text labels associated with the multimedia elements are sent to thedata processing system 102.Recognition engine 104 may identify a text label associated with video 161. Text labels associated with images and multimedia elements may be, for example and without limitation, query terms input by a user, which resulted in the images or other multimedia elements being displayed to a user and selected by the user. Text labels may also include metadata associated with a multimedia element. Further, text labels or keywords associated withdigital components 106, or text labels associated with multimedia elements associated withdigital components 106 may be identified. For example,recognition engine 104 may identifykeyword 109C as being responsive to a text label associated with video 161. For example, text label “daisy” can match keyword “daisy”, or be identified as responsive to keyword “flower”. Based on the identification of responsiveness,digital component 106C may be identified as a relevant digital component and provided to the content provider computing device to be displayed onwebpage 160 in one of thedigital component slots -

Thedata processing system 102 can communicate with one or more of a contentprovider computing device 106, serviceprovider computing device 210, orclient computing device 206 via anetwork 105. Thenetwork 105 can include computer networks such as the Internet, local, wide, metro, or other area networks, intranets, satellite networks, and other communication networks such as voice or data mobile telephone networks. Thenetwork 105 can be used to access information resources such as web pages, web sites, domain names, or uniform resource locators that can be presented, output, rendered, or displayed on at least onecomputing device 206, such as a laptop, desktop, tablet, personal digital assistant, smart phone, portable computers, or speaker. For example, via the network 105 a user of thecomputing device 206 can access information or data provided by aservice provider 210 orcontent provider 106. Thecomputing device 206 may or may not include a display; for example, the computing device may include limited types of user interfaces, such as a microphone and speaker. In some cases, the primary user interface of thecomputing device 206 may be a microphone and speaker. - The
network 105 can include or constitute a display network, e.g., a subset of information resources available on the internet that are associated with a content placement or search engine results system, or that are eligible to include third-party content items as part of a content item placement campaign. Thenetwork 105 can be used by thedata processing system 102 to access information resources such as web pages, web sites, domain names, or uniform resource locators that can be presented, output, rendered, or displayed by theclient computing device 206. For example, via the network 105 a user of theclient computing device 206 can access information or data provided by the contentprovider computing device 106 or the serviceprovider computing device 210. - The
network 105 may be any type or form of network and may include any of the following: a point-to-point network, a broadcast network, a wide area network, a local area network, a telecommunications network, a data communication network, a computer network, an ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) network, a SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) network, a SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) network, a wireless network and a wireline network. Thenetwork 105 may include a wireless link, such as an infrared channel or satellite band. The topology of thenetwork 105 may include a bus, star, or ring network topology. The network may include mobile telephone networks using any protocol or protocols used to communicate among mobile devices, including advanced mobile phone protocol (“AMPS”), time division multiple access (“TDMA”), code-division multiple access (“CDMA”), global system for mobile communication (“GSM”), general packet radio services (“GPRS”) or universal mobile telecommunications system (“UMTS”). Different types of data may be transmitted via different protocols, or the same types of data may be transmitted via different protocols. - The
system 100 can includedata processing system 102. Thedata processing system 102 can include at least one logic device such as a computing device having a processor to communicate via thenetwork 105, for example with thecomputing device 206, the content provider device 106 (content provider 106), or the service provider device 210 (or service provider 210). Thedata processing system 102 can include at least one computation resource, server, processor or memory. For example, thedata processing system 102 can include a plurality of computation resources or servers located in at least one data center. Thedata processing system 102 can include multiple, logically-grouped servers and facilitate distributed computing techniques. The logical group of servers may be referred to as a data center, server farm or a machine farm. The servers can also be geographically dispersed. A data center or machine farm may be administered as a single entity, or the machine farm can include a plurality of machine farms. The servers within each machine farm can be heterogeneous—one or more of the servers or machines can operate according to one or more type of operating system platform. - Servers in the machine farm can be stored in high-density rack systems, along with associated storage systems, and located in an enterprise data center. For example, consolidating the servers in this way may improve system manageability, data security, the physical security of the system, and system performance by locating servers and high-performance storage systems on localized high-performance networks. Centralization of all or some of the
data processing system 102 components, including servers and storage systems, and coupling them with advanced system management tools allows more efficient use of server resources, which saves power and processing requirements and reduces bandwidth usage. - The
system 100 can include, access, or otherwise interact with at least oneservice provider device 210. Theservice provider device 210 can include at least one logic device such as a computing device having a processor to communicate via thenetwork 105, for example with thecomputing device 206, thedata processing system 102, or thecontent provider 106.

For example,service provider device 210 can include a plurality of computation resources or servers located in at least one data center. Theservice provider device 210 can include one or more component or functionality of thedata processing system 102. - The content
provider computing device 106 can provide audio based content items for display by theclient computing device 206 as an audio output content item. The content item can include an offer for a good or service, such as a voice based message that states: “Would you like me to order you a taxi?” For example, the contentprovider computing device 222 can include memory to store a series of audio content items that can be provided in response to a voice based query. The contentprovider computing device 106 can also provide audio based content items (or other content items) to thedata processing system 102 where they can be stored in thedata repository 124. Thedata processing system 102 can select the audio content items and provide (or instruct the contentprovider computing device 222 to provide) the audio content items to theclient computing device 206. The audio based content items can be exclusively audio or can be combined with text, image, or video data. - The
service provider device 210 can include, interface, or otherwise communicate with at least one service provider naturallanguage processor component 142 and aservice provider interface 144. The serviceprovider computing device 210 can include at least one service provider natural language processor (NLP)component 142 and at least oneservice provider interface 144. The service provider NLP component 142 (or other components such as a direct action API of the service provider computing device 210) can engage with the client computing device 206 (via thedata processing system 102 or bypassing the data processing system 102) to create a back-and-forth real-time voice or audio based conversation (e.g., a session) between theclient computing device 206 and the serviceprovider computing device 210. Theservice provider NLP 142 can include one or more function or feature as theNLP component 171 of thedata processing system 102. For example, theservice provider interface 144 can receive or provide data messages to thedirect action API 116 of thedata processing system 102. The serviceprovider computing device 210 and the contentprovider computing device 106 can be associated with the same entity. For example, the contentprovider computing device 106 can create, store, or make available content items for a car sharing service, and the serviceprovider computing device 210 can establish a session with theclient computing device 206 to arrange for a delivery of a taxi or car of the car share service to pick up the end user of theclient computing device 206. Thedata processing system 102, via thedirect action API 116, theNLP component 171 or other components can also establish the session with the client computing device, including or bypassing the serviceprovider computing device 210, to arrange for example for a delivery of a taxi or car of the car share service. - The
computing device 206 can include, interface, or otherwise communicate with at least onesensor 134,transducer 136,audio driver 138, orpre-processor 140.

The audio driver can execute the audio file or other instructions provided by thedata processing system 102 to control thetransducer 136 to generate a corresponding acoustic wave or sound wave. The pre-processor 140 can be configured to detect a keyword and perform an action based on the keyword. The pre-processor 140 can filter out one or more terms or modify the terms prior to transmitting the terms to thedata processing system 102 for further processing. The pre-processor 140 can convert the analog audio signals detected by the microphone into a digital audio signal, and transmit one or more data packets carrying the digital audio signal to thedata processing system 102 via thenetwork 105. In some cases, the pre-processor 140 can transmit data packets carrying some or all of the input audio signal responsive to detecting an instruction to perform such transmission. The instruction can include, for example, a trigger keyword or other keyword or approval to transmit data packets that can include the input audio signal to thedata processing system 102. - The
client computing device 206 can be associated with an end user that enters voice queries as audio input into the client computing device 206 (via the sensor 134) and receives audio output in the form of a computer generated voice that can be provided from the data processing system 102 (or the contentprovider computing device 106 or the service provider computing device 210) to theclient computing device 206, output from the transducer 136 (e.g., a speaker). The computer generated voice can include recordings from a real person or computer generated language. - The
data repository 124 can include one or more local or distributed databases, and can include a database management system. Thedata repository 124 can include computer data storage or memory and can store one ormore parameters 126, one ormore policies 128,content data 130, ortemplates 132 among other data. Theparameters 126,policies 128, andtemplates 132 can include information such as rules about a voice based session between theclient computing device 206 and the data processing system 102 (or the service provider computing device 210).

Thecontent data 130 can include, for example, historical performance of a content campaign. - The
interface 170, naturallanguage processor component 171,session handler 114,direct action API 116,content selector component 118, or audiosignal generator component 122 can each include at least one processing unit or other logic device such as programmable logic array engine, or module configured to communicate with the database repository ordatabase 124. Theinterface 170, naturallanguage processor component 171,session handler 114,direct action API 116,content selector component 118, audiosignal generator component 122 anddata repository 124 can be separate components, a single component, or part of thedata processing system 102. Thesystem 100 and its components, such as adata processing system 102, can include hardware elements, such as one or more processors, logic devices, or circuits. - The
data processing system 102 can obtain anonymous computer network activity information associated with a plurality ofcomputing devices 206. A user of acomputing device 206 can affirmatively authorize thedata processing system 102 to obtain network activity information corresponding to the user'scomputing device 206. For example, thedata processing system 102 can prompt the user of thecomputing device 206 for consent to obtain one or more types of network activity information. The identity of the user of thecomputing device 206 can remain anonymous and thecomputing device 206 can be associated with a unique identifier (e.g., a unique identifier for the user or the computing device provided by the data processing system or a user of the computing device). The data processing system can associate each observation with a corresponding unique identifier. - A
content provider 106 can establish an electronic content campaign. The electronic content campaign can be stored ascontent data 130 indata repository 124. An electronic content campaign can refer to one or more content groups that correspond to a common theme. A content campaign can include a hierarchical data structure that includes content groups, content item data objects, and content selection criteria. To create a content campaign,content provider 106 can specify values for campaign level parameters of the content campaign. The campaign level parameters can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content item objects, a value of resources to be used for the content campaign, start and end dates for the content campaign, a duration for the content campaign, a schedule for content item object placements, language, geographical locations, type of computing devices on which to provide content item objects. In some cases, an impression can refer to when a content item object is fetched from its source (e.g.,data processing system 102 or content provider 106), and is countable. In some cases, due to the possibility of click fraud, robotic activity can be filtered and excluded, as an impression. Thus, in some cases, an impression can refer to a measurement of responses from a Web server to a page request from a browser, which is filtered from robotic activity and error codes, and is recorded at a point as close as possible to opportunity to render the content item object for display on thecomputing device 206. In some cases, an impression can refer to a viewable or audible impression; e.g., the content item object is at least partially (e.g., 20%, 30%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or more) viewable on a display device of theclient computing device 206, or audible via aspeaker 136 of thecomputing device 206. A click or selection can refer to a user interaction with the content item object, such as a voice response to an audible impression, a mouse-click, touch interaction, gesture, shake, audio interaction, or keyboard click. A conversion can refer to a user taking a desired action with respect to the content item objection; e.g., purchasing a product or service, completing a survey, visiting a physical store corresponding to the content item, or completing an electronic transaction. - The
content provider 106 can further establish one or more content groups for a content campaign. A content group includes one or more content item objects and corresponding content selection criteria, such as keywords, words, terms, phrases, geographic locations, type of computing device, time of day, interest, topic, or vertical. Content groups under the same content campaign can share the same campaign level parameters, but may have tailored specifications for particular content group level parameters, such as keywords, negative keywords (e.g., that block placement of the content item in the presence of the negative keyword on main content), bids for keywords, or parameters associated with the bid or content campaign. - To create a new content group, the content provider can provide values for the content group level parameters of the content group. The content group level parameters include, for example, a content group name or content group theme, and bids for different content placement opportunities (e.g., automatic placement or managed placement) or outcomes (e.g., clicks, impressions, or conversions). A content group name or content group theme can be one or more terms that the
content provider 106 can use to capture a topic or subject matter for which content item objects of the content group is to be selected for display. For example, a car dealership can create a different content group for each brand of vehicle it carries, and may further create a different content group for each model of vehicle it carries. Examples of the content group themes that the car dealership can use include, for example, “Make A sports car” “Make B sports car,” “Make C sedan,” “Make C truck,” “Make C hybrid,” or “Make D hybrid.” An example content campaign theme can be “hybrid” and include content groups for both “Make C hybrid” and “Make D hybrid”, for example. - The
content provider 106 can provide one or more keywords and content item objects to each content group. Keywords can include terms that are relevant to the product or services of associated with or identified by the content item objects. A keyword can include one or more terms or phrases. For example, the car dealership can include “sports car,” “V-6 engine,” “four-wheel drive,” “fuel efficiency,” as keywords for a content group or content campaign. In some cases, negative keywords can be specified by the content provider to avoid, prevent, block, or disable content placement on certain terms or keywords. The content provider can specify a type of matching, such as exact match, phrase match, or broad match, used to select content item objects. - The
content provider 106 can provide one or more keywords to be used by thedata processing system 102 to select a content item object provided by thecontent provider 106. Thecontent provider 106 can identify one or more keywords to bid on, and further provide bid amounts for various keywords. Thecontent provider 106 can provide additional content selection criteria to be used by thedata processing system 102 to select content item objects.Multiple content providers 106 can bid on the same or different keywords, and thedata processing system 102 can run a content selection process or ad auction responsive to receiving an indication of a keyword of an electronic message. - The
content provider 106 can provide one or more content item objects for selection by thedata processing system 102. The data processing system 102 (e.g., via content selector component 118) can select the content item objects when a content placement opportunity becomes available that matches the resource allocation, content schedule, maximum bids, keywords, and other selection criteria specified for the content group. Different types of content item objects can be included in a content group, such as a voice content item, audio content item, a text content item, an image content item, video content item, multimedia content item, or content item link. Upon selecting a content item, thedata processing system 102 can transmit the content item object for rendering on acomputing device 206 or display device of thecomputing device 206. Rendering can include displaying the content item on a display device, or playing the content item via a speaker of thecomputing device 206. Thedata processing system 102 can provide instructions to acomputing device 206 to render the content item object. Thedata processing system 102 can instruct thecomputing device 206, or anaudio driver 138 of thecomputing device 206, to generate audio signals or acoustic waves. - The
data processing system 102 can include aninterface component 170 designed, configured, constructed, or operational to receive and transmit information using, for example, data packets. Theinterface 170 can receive and transmit information using one or more protocols, such as a network protocol. Theinterface 170 can include a hardware interface, software interface, wired interface, or wireless interface. Theinterface 170 can facilitate translating or formatting data from one format to another format. For example, theinterface 170 can include an application programming interface that includes definitions for communicating between various components, such as software components. - The
data processing system 102 can include an application, script or program installed at theclient computing device 206, such as an app to communicate input audio signals to theinterface 170 of thedata processing system 102 and to drive components of the client computing device to render output audio signals. Thedata processing system 102 can receive data packets or other signal that includes or identifies an audio input signal. For example, thedata processing system 102 can execute or run theNLP component 171 to receive or obtain the audio signal and parse the audio signal. For example, theNLP component 171 can provide for interactions between a human and a computer. TheNLP component 171 can be configured with techniques for understanding natural language and allowing thedata processing system 102 to derive meaning from human or natural language input. TheNLP component 171 can include or be configured with technique based on machine learning, such as statistical machine learning. TheNLP component 171 can utilize decision trees, statistical models, or probabilistic models to parse the input audio signal. TheNLP component 171 can perform, for example, functions such as named entity recognition (e.g., given a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is, such as person, location, or organization), natural language generation (e.g., convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into understandable human language), natural language understanding (e.g., convert text into more formal representations such as first-order logic structures that a computer module can manipulate), machine translation (e.g., automatically translate text from one human language to another), morphological segmentation (e.g., separating words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes, which can be challenging based on the complexity of the morphology or structure of the words of the language being considered), question answering (e.g., determining an answer to a human-language question, which can be specific or open-ended), semantic processing (e.g., processing that can occur after identifying a word and encoding its meaning in order to relate the identified word to other words with similar meanings). - The
NLP component 171 converts the audio input signal into recognized text by comparing the input signal against a stored, representative set of audio waveforms (e.g., in the data repository 124) and choosing the closest matches. The set of audio waveforms can be stored indata repository 124 or other database accessible to thedata processing system 102. The representative waveforms are generated across a large set of users, and then may be augmented with speech samples from the user. After the audio signal is converted into recognized text, theNLP component 171 matches the text to words that are associated, for example via training across users or through manual specification, with actions that thedata processing system 102 can serve. - The audio input signal can be detected by the
sensor 134 or transducer 136 (e.g., a microphone) of theclient computing device 206. Via thetransducer 136, theaudio driver 138, or other components theclient computing device 206 can provide the audio input signal to the data processing system 102 (e.g., via the network 105) where it can be received (e.g., by the interface 170) and provided to theNLP component 171 or stored in thedata repository 124. - The
NLP component 171 can obtain the input audio signal. From the input audio signal, theNLP component 171 can identify at least one request or at least one trigger keyword corresponding to the request. The request can indicate intent or subject matter of the input audio signal. The trigger keyword can indicate a type of action likely to be taken. For example, theNLP component 171 can parse the input audio signal to identify at least one request to leave home for the evening to attend dinner and a movie. The trigger keyword can include at least one word, phrase, root or partial word, or derivative indicating an action to be taken. For example, the trigger keyword “go” or “to go to” from the input audio signal can indicate a need for transport. In this example, the input audio signal (or the identified request) does not directly express an intent for transport, however the trigger keyword indicates that transport is an ancillary action to at least one other action that is indicated by the request. - The
NLP component 171 can parse the input audio signal to identify, determine, retrieve, or otherwise obtain the request and the trigger keyword. For instance, theNLP component 171 can apply a semantic processing technique to the input audio signal to identify the trigger keyword or the request. TheNLP component 171 can apply the semantic processing technique to the input audio signal to identify a trigger phrase that includes one or more trigger keywords, such as a first trigger keyword and a second trigger keyword. For example, the input audio signal can include the sentence “I need someone to do my laundry and my dry cleaning.” TheNLP component 171 can apply a semantic processing technique, or other natural language processing technique, to the data packets comprising the sentence to identify trigger phrases “do my laundry” and “do my dry cleaning”. TheNLP component 171 can further identify multiple trigger keywords, such as laundry, and dry cleaning. For example, theNLP component 171 can determine that the trigger phrase includes the trigger keyword and a second trigger keyword. - The
NLP component 171 can filter the input audio signal to identify the trigger keyword. For example, the data packets carrying the input audio signal can include “It would be great if I could get someone that could help me go to the airport”, in which case theNLP component 171 can filter out one or more terms as follows: “it”, “would”, “be”, “great”, “if”, “I”, “could”, “get”, “someone”, “that”, “could”, or “help”. By filtering out these terms, theNLP component 171 may more accurately and reliably identify the trigger keywords, such as “go to the airport” and determine that this is a request for a taxi or a ride sharing service. - In some cases, the NLP component can determine that the data packets carrying the input audio signal includes one or more requests. For example, the input audio signal can include the sentence “I need someone to do my laundry and my dry cleaning.” The
NLP component 171 can determine this is a request for a laundry service and a dry cleaning service. TheNLP component 171 can determine this is a single request for a service provider that can provide both laundry services and dry cleaning services. TheNLP component 171 can determine that this is two requests; a first request for a service provider that performs laundry services, and a second request for a service provider that provides dry cleaning services. In some cases, theNLP component 171 can combine the multiple determined requests into a single request, and transmit the single request to aservice provider device 210. In some cases, theNLP component 171 can transmit the individual requests to respectiveservice provider devices 210, or separately transmit both requests to the sameservice provider device 210. - The
data processing system 102 can include adirect action API 116 designed and constructed to generate, based on the trigger keyword, an action data structure responsive to the request. Processors of thedata processing system 102 can invoke thedirect action API 116 to execute scripts that generate a data structure to aservice provider device 210 to request or order a service or product, such as a car from a car share service. Thedirect action API 116 can obtain data from thedata repository 124, as well as data received with end user consent from theclient computing device 206 to determine location, time, user accounts, logistical or other information to allow theservice provider device 210 to perform an operation, such as reserve a car from the car share service. Using thedirect action API 116, thedata processing system 102 can also communicate with theservice provider device 210 to complete the conversion by in this example making the car share pick up reservation. - The
direct action API 116 can execute a specified action to satisfy the end user's intention, as determined by thedata processing system 102. Depending on the action specified in its inputs, thedirect action API 116 can execute code or a dialog script that identifies the parameters required to fulfill a user request. Such code can look-up additional information, e.g., in thedata repository 124, such as the name of a home automation service, or it can provide audio output for rendering at theclient computing device 206 to ask the end user questions such as the intended destination of a requested taxi. Thedirect action API 116 can determine necessary parameters and can package the information into an action data structure, which can then be sent to another component such as thecontent selector component 118 or to the serviceprovider computing device 210 to be fulfilled. - The
direct action API 116 can receive an instruction or command from theNLP component 171, or other component of thedata processing system 102, to generate or construct the action data structure. Thedirect action API 116 can determine a type of action in order to select a template from thetemplate repository 132 stored in thedata repository 124. Types of actions can include, for example, services, products, reservations, or tickets. Types of actions can further include types of services or products. For example, types of services can include car share service, food delivery service, laundry service, maid service, repair services, or household services. Types of products can include, for example, clothes, shoes, toys, electronics, computers, books, or jewelry. Types of reservations can include, for example, dinner reservations or hair salon appointments. Types of tickets can include, for example, movie tickets, sports venue tickets, or flight tickets. In some cases, the types of services, products, reservations or tickets can be categorized based on price, location, type of shipping, availability, or other attributes. - The
direct action API 116, upon identifying the type of request, can access the corresponding template from thetemplate repository 132. Templates can include fields in a structured data set that can be populated by thedirect action API 116 to further the operation that is requested of the service provider device 210 (such as the operation of sending a taxi to pick up an end user at a pickup location and transport the end user to a destination location). Thedirect action API 116 can perform a lookup in thetemplate repository 132 to select the template that matches one or more characteristic of the trigger keyword and request. For example, if the request corresponds to a request for a car or ride to a destination, thedata processing system 102 can select a car sharing service template. The car sharing service template can include one or more of the following fields: device identifier, pick up location, destination location, number of passengers, or type of service. Thedirect action API 116 can populate the fields with values. To populate the fields with values, thedirect action API 116 can ping, poll or otherwise obtain information from one ormore sensors 134 of thecomputing device 206 or a user interface of thedevice 206. For example, thedirect action API 116 can detect the source location using a location sensor, such as a GPS sensor. Thedirect action API 116 can obtain further information by submitting a survey, prompt, or query to the end of user of thecomputing device 206. The direct action API can submit the survey, prompt, or query viainterface 170 of thedata processing system 102 and a user interface of the computing device 206 (e.g., audio interface, voice-based user interface, display, or touch screen). Thus, thedirect action API 116 can select a template for the action data structure based on the trigger keyword or the request, populate one or more fields in the template with information detected by one ormore sensors 134 or obtained via a user interface, and generate, create or otherwise construct the action data structure to facilitate performance of an operation by theservice provider device 210. - The
data processing system 102 can select the template based from thetemplate data structure 132 based on various factors including, for example, one or more of the trigger keyword, request, serviceprovider computing device 210, type of serviceprovider computing device 210, a category that the serviceprovider computing device 210 falls in (e.g., taxi service, laundry service, flower service, or food delivery), location, or other sensor information. - To select the template based on the trigger keyword, the data processing system 102 (e.g., via direct action API 116) can perform a look-up or other query operation on the
template database 132 using the trigger keyword to identify a template data structure that maps or otherwise corresponds to the trigger keyword. For example, each template in thetemplate database 132 can be associated with one or more trigger keywords to indicate that the template is configured to generate an action data structure responsive to the trigger keyword that the serviceprovider computing device 210 can process to establish a communication session. - In some cases, the
data processing system 102 can identify a serviceprovider computing device 210 based on the trigger keyword. To identify the serviceprovider computing device 210 based on the trigger keyword, thedata processing system 102 can perform a lookup in thedata repository 124 to identify a serviceprovider computing device 210 that maps to the trigger keyword. For example, if the trigger keyword includes “ride” or “to go to”, then the data processing system 102 (e.g., via direct action API 116) can identify the serviceprovider computing device 210 as corresponding to Taxi Service Company A. Thedata processing system 102 can select the template from thetemplate database 132 using the identify serviceprovider computing device 210. For example, thetemplate database 132 can include a mapping or correlation between serviceprovider computing device 210 or entities to templates configured to generate an action data structure responsive to the trigger keyword that the serviceprovider computing device 210 can process to establish a communication session. In some cases, the template can be customized for the serviceprovider computing device 210 or for a category of serviceprovider computing device 210. Thedata processing system 102 can generate the action data structure based on the template for the serviceprovider computing device 210. - To construct or generate the action data structure, the
data processing system 102 can identify one or more fields in the selected template to populate with values. The fields can be populated with numerical values, character strings, Unicode values, Boolean logic, binary values, hexadecimal values, identifiers, location coordinates, geographic areas, timestamps, or other values. The fields or the data structure itself can be encrypted or masked to maintain data security. - Upon determining the fields in the template, the
data processing system 102 can identify the values for the fields to populate the fields of the template to create the action data structure. Thedata processing system 102 can obtain, retrieve, determine or otherwise identify the values for the fields by performing a look-up or other query operation on thedata repository 124. - In some cases, the
data processing system 102 can determine that the information or values for the fields are absent from thedata repository 124. Thedata processing system 102 can determine that the information or values stored in thedata repository 124 are out-of-date, stale, or otherwise not suitable for the purpose of constructing the action data structure responsive to the trigger keyword and request identified by the NLP component 171 (e.g., the location of theclient computing device 206 may be the old location and not be the current location; an account can be expired; the destination restaurant may have moved to a new location; physical activity information; or mode of transportation). - If the
data processing system 102 determines that it does not currently have access, in memory of thedata processing system 102, to the values or information for the field of the template, thedata processing system 102 can acquire the values or information. Thedata processing system 102 can acquire or obtain the information by querying or polling one or more available sensors of theclient computing device 206, prompting the end user of theclient computing device 206 for the information, or accessing an online web-based resource using an HTTP protocol. For example, thedata processing system 102 can determine that it does not have the current location of theclient computing device 206, which may be a needed field of the template. Thedata processing system 102 can query theclient computing device 206 for the location information. Thedata processing system 102 can request theclient computing device 206 to provide the location information using one ormore location sensors 134, such as a Global Positioning System sensor, WIFI triangulation, cell tower triangulation, Bluetooth beacons, IP address, or other location sensing technique. - The
direct action API 116 can transmit the action data structure to a third-party provider device (e.g., service provider device 210) to cause the serviceprovider computing device 210 to invoke a conversational application programming interface (e.g., service provider NLP component 142) and establish a communication session between the serviceprovider computing device 210 and theclient computing device 206. Responsive to establishing the communication session between theservice provider device 210 and theclient computing device 206, theservice provider device 210 can transmit data packets directly to theclient computing device 206 vianetwork 105. In some cases, theservice provider device 210 can transmit data packets to theclient computing device 206 viadata processing system 102 andnetwork 105. - In some cases, the service
provider computing device 210 can execute at least a portion of theconversational API 142. For example, the serviceprovider computing device 210 can handle certain aspects of the communication session or types of queries. The serviceprovider computing device 210 may leverage theNLP component 171 executed by thedata processing system 102 to facilitate processing the audio signals associated with the communication session and generating responses to queries. In some cases, thedata processing system 102 can include theconversational API 142 configured for the serviceprovider computing device 210. In some cases, the data processing system routes data packets between the client computing device and the third-party provider device to establish the communication session. Thedata processing system 102 can receive, from the serviceprovider computing device 210, an indication that the third-party provider device established the communication session with theclient device 206. The indication can include an identifier of theclient computing device 206, timestamp corresponding to when the communication session was established, or other information associated with the communication session, such as the action data structure associated with the communication session. - In some cases, the conversational API can be a second NLP that includes one or more component or function of the
first NLP 171. Thesecond NLP 142 can interact or leverage thefirst NLP 171. In some cases, thesystem 100 can include asingle NLP 171 executed by thedata processing system 102. Thesingle NLP 171 can support both thedata processing system 102 and the serviceprovider computing device 210. In some cases, thedirect action API 116 generates or constructs an action data structure to facilitate performing a service, and the conversational API generates responses or queries to further a communication session with an end user or obtain additional information to improve or enhance the end user's experience or performance of the service. - The
data processing system 102 can include, execute, access, or otherwise communicate with asession handler component 114 to establish a communication session between theclient device 206 and thedata processing system 102. The communication session can refer to one or more data transmissions between theclient device 206 and thedata processing system 102 that includes the input audio signal that is detected by asensor 134 of theclient device 206, and the output signal transmitted by thedata processing system 102 to theclient device 206. The data processing system 102 (e.g., via the session handler component 114) can establish the communication session responsive to receiving the input audio signal. Thedata processing system 102 can set a duration for the communication session. Thedata processing system 102 can set a timer or a counter for the duration set for the communication session. Responsive to expiration of the timer, thedata processing system 102 can terminate the communication session. - The communication session can refer to a network-based communication session in which the
client device 206 provides authenticating information or credentials to establish the session. In some cases, the communication session refers to a topic or a context of audio signals carried by data packets during the session. For example, a first communication session can refer to audio signals transmitted between theclient device 206 and thedata processing system 102 that are related to (e.g., include keywords, action data structures, or content item objects) a taxi service; and a second communication session can refer to audio signals transmitted between theclient device 206 anddata processing system 102 that are related to a laundry and dry cleaning service. In this example, thedata processing system 102 can determine that the context of the audio signals are different (e.g., via the NLP component 171), and separate the two sets of audio signals into different communication sessions. Thesession handler 114 can terminate the first session related to the ride service responsive to identifying one or more audio signals related to the dry cleaning and laundry service. Thus, thedata processing system 102 can initiate or establish the second session for the audio signals related to the dry cleaning and laundry service responsive to detecting the context of the audio signals. - The
data processing system 102 can include, execute, or otherwise communicate with acontent selector component 118 to receive the trigger keyword identified by the natural language processor and select, based on the trigger keyword, a content item via a real-time content selection process. The content selection process can refer to, or include, selecting sponsored content item objects provided by third-party content providers 106. The real-time content selection process can include a service in which content items provided by multiple content providers are parsed, processed, weighted, or matched in order to select one or more content items to provide to thecomputing device 206. Thecontent selector component 118 can perform the content selection process in real-time. Performing the content selection process in real-time can refer to performing the content selection process responsive to the request for content received via theclient computing device 206. The real-time content selection process can be performed (e.g., initiated or completed) within a time interval of receiving the request (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 20 minutes). The real-time content selection process can be performed during a communication session with theclient computing device 206, or within a time interval after the communication session is terminated. - For example, the
data processing system 102 can include acontent selector component 118 designed, constructed, configured or operational to select content item objects. To select content items for display in a voice-based environment, the data processing system 102 (e.g., via NLP component 171) can parse the input audio signal to identify keywords (e.g., a trigger keyword), and use the keywords to select a matching content item based on a broad match, exact match, or phrase match. For example, thecontent selector component 118 can analyze, parse, or otherwise process subject matter of candidate content items to determine whether the subject matter of the candidate content items correspond to the subject matter of the keywords or phrases of the input audio signal detected by the microphone of theclient computing device 206. Thecontent selector component 118 may identify, analyze, or recognize voice, audio, terms, characters, text, symbols, or images of the candidate content items using an image processing technique, character recognition technique, natural language processing technique, or database lookup. The candidate content items may include metadata indicative of the subject matter of the candidate content items, in which case thecontent selector component 118 may process the metadata to determine whether the subject matter of the candidate content item corresponds to the input audio signal. -
Content providers 106 may provide additional indicators when setting up a content campaign that includes content items. Thecontent provider 106 may provide information at the content campaign or content group level that thecontent selector component 118 may identify by performing a lookup using information about the candidate content item. For example, the candidate content item may include a unique identifier, which may map to a content group, content campaign, or content provider. Thecontent selector component 118 may determine, based on information stored in content campaign data structure indata repository 124, information about thecontent provider 106. - The
data processing system 102 can receive, via a computer network, a request for content for presentation on acomputing device 206. Thedata processing system 102 can identify the request by processing an input audio signal detected by a microphone of theclient computing device 206. The request can include selection criteria of the request, such as the device type, location, and a keyword associated with the request. The request can include the action data structure or action data structure. - Responsive to the request, the
data processing system 102 can select a content item object fromdata repository 124 or a database associated with thecontent provider 106, and provide the content item for presentation via thecomputing device 206 vianetwork 105. The content item object can be provided by a contentprovider computing device 222 different from theservice provider device 210. The content item can correspond to a type of service different from a type of service of the action data structure (e.g., taxi service versus food delivery service). Thecomputing device 206 can interact with the content item object. Thecomputing device 206 can receive an audio response to the content item. Thecomputing device 206 can receive an indication to select a hyperlink or other button associated with the content item object that causes or allows thecomputing device 206 to identifyservice provider 210, request a service from theservice provider 210, instruct theservice provider 210 to perform a service, transmit information to theservice provider 210, or otherwise query theservice provider device 210. - The
data processing system 102 can include, execute, or communicate with an audiosignal generator component 122 to generate an output signal. The output signal can include one or more portions. For example, the output signal can include a first portion and a second portion. The first portion of the output signal can correspond to the action data structure. The second portion of the output signal can correspond to the content item selected by thecontent selector component 118 during the real-time content selection process. - The audio
signal generator component 122 can generate the output signal with a first portion having sound corresponding to the first data structure. For example, the audiosignal generator component 122 can generate the first portion of the output signal based on one or more values populated into the fields of the action data structure by thedirect action API 116. In a taxi service example, the values for the fields can include, for example, 123 Main Street for pick-up location, 1234 Main Street for destination location, 2 for number of passengers, and economy for the level of service. The audiosignal generator component 122 can generate the first portion of the output signal in order to confirm that the end user of thecomputing device 206 wants to proceed with transmitting the request to theservice provider 210. The first portion can include the following output “Would you like to order an economy car from taxi service provider A to pick two people up at 123 Main Street and drop off at 1234 Main Street?” - In some cases, the first portion can include information received from the
service provider device 210. The information received fromservice provider device 210 can be customized or tailored for the action data structure. For example, the data processing system 102 (e.g., via direct action API 116) can transmit the action data structure to theservice provider 210 before instructing theservice provider 210 to perform the operation. Instead, thedata processing system 102 can instruct theservice provider device 210 to perform initial or preliminary processing on the action data structure to generate preliminary information about the operation. In the example of the taxi service, the preliminary processing on the action data structure can include identifying available taxis that meet the level of service requirement that are located around the pick-up location, estimating an amount of time for the nearest available taxi to reach the pick-up location, estimating a time of arrival at the destination, and estimating a price for the taxi service. The estimated preliminary values may include a fixed value, an estimate that is subject to change based on various conditions, or a range of values. Theservice provider device 210 can return the preliminary information to thedata processing system 102 or directly to theclient computing device 206 via thenetwork 105. Thedata processing system 102 can incorporate the preliminary results from theservice provider device 210 into the output signal, and transmit the output signal to thecomputing device 206. The output signal can include, for example, “Taxi Service Company A can pick you up at 123 Main Street in 10 minutes, and drop you off at 1234 Main Street by 9 AM for $10. Do you want to order this ride?” This can form the first portion of the output signal. - In some cases, the
data processing system 102 can form a second portion of the output signal. The second portion of the output signal can include a content item selected by thecontent selector component 118 during a real-time content selection process. The first portion can be different from the second portion. For example, the first portion can include information corresponding to the action data structure that is directly responsive to the data packets carrying the input audio signal detected by thesensor 134 of theclient computing device 206, whereas the second potion can include a content item selected by acontent selector component 118 that can be tangentially relevant to the action data structure, or include sponsored content provided by acontent provider device 106. For example, the end user of thecomputing device 206 can request a taxi from Taxi Service Company A. Thedata processing system 102 can generate the first portion of the output signal to include information about the taxi from the Taxi Service Company A. However, thedata processing system 102 can generate the second portion of the output signal to include a content item selected based on the keywords “taxi service” and information contained in the action data structure that the end user may be interested in. For example, the second portion can include a content item or information provided by a different taxi service company, such as Taxi Service Company B. While the user may not have specifically requested Taxi Service Company B, thedata processing system 102 may nonetheless provide a content item from Taxi Service Company B because the user may choose to perform an operation with Taxi Service Company B. - The
data processing system 102 can transmit information from the action data structure to the Taxi Service Company B to determine a pick-up time, time of arrival at the destination, and a price for the ride. Thedata processing system 102 can receive this information and generate the second portion of the output signal as follows: “Taxi Service Company B can pick you up at 123 Main Street in 2 minutes, and drop you off at 1234 Main Street by 8:52 AM for $15. Do you want this ride instead?” The end user ofcomputing device 206 can then select the ride provided by Taxi Service Company A or the ride provided by Taxi Service Company B. - Prior to providing, in the second portion of the output signal, the sponsored content item corresponding to the service provided by Taxi Service Company B, the
data processing system 102 can notify the end user computing device that the second portion corresponds to a content item object selected during a real-time content selection process (e.g., by the content selector component 118). However, thedata processing system 102 can have limited access to different types of interfaces to provide the notification to the end user of thecomputing device 206. For example, thecomputing device 206 may not include a display device, or the display device may be disabled or turned off. The display device of thecomputing device 206 may consume greater resources than the speaker of thecomputing device 206, so it may be less efficient to turn on the display device of thecomputing device 206 as compared to using the speaker of thecomputing device 206 to convey the notification. Thus, in some cases, thedata processing system 102 can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of information transmission over one or more interfaces or one or more types of computer networks. For example, the data processing system 102 (e.g., via the audio signal generator component 122) can module the portion of the output audio signal comprising the content item to provide the indication or notification the end user that that portion of the output signal comprises the sponsored content item. - The data processing system 102 (e.g., via
interface 170 and network 105) can transmit data packets comprising the output signal generated by the audiosignal generator component 122. The output signal can cause theaudio driver component 138 of or executed by theclient device 206 to drive a speaker (e.g., transducer 136) of theclient device 206 to generate an acoustic wave corresponding to the output signal. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of anexample system 100 in which adata processing system 102 manages digital component distribution services. Theexample system 100 includes one ormore networks 105, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 105 connectsuser devices 206,websites 208, serviceprovider computing devices 210, and thedata processing system 102. Thesystem 100 may include many thousands ofuser devices 206,websites 208, and serviceprovider computing devices 210. - A
website 208 is one ormore resources 212 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 208 is maintained by a contentprovider computing device 222, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 208. - A
resource 212 is any data that can be provided over thenetwork 105. Aresource 212 is identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 212. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts). - A
user device 206 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over thenetwork 105.Example user devices 206 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 105. Auser device 206 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 105.User devices 206, such as mobile communication devices, may also include other user applications, such as text message applications, gaming applications, news applications, book and magazine reader applications, and other applications provided by contentprovider computing devices 222. Applications provided by contentprovider computing devices 222 may also be known as resources. - A
user device 206 can requestresources 212 from awebsite 208. In turn, data representing theresource 212 can be provided to theuser device 206 for presentation by theuser device 206. The data representing theresource 212 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a webpage) in which digital components can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as digital component slots. - To facilitate searching of these resources, the environment can include a
search system 214 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content provider computing devices on thewebsites 208. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources are stored in anindexed cache 216. -
User devices 206 can submitsearch queries 220 to thesearch system 214 over thenetwork 105. In response, thesearch system 214 accesses the indexedcache 216 to identify resources that are relevant to thesearch query 220. Thesearch system 214 identifies the resources in the form ofsearch results 218 and returns the search results 218 to theuser devices 206 in search results pages. Asearch result 218 is data generated by thesearch system 214 that identifies a resource that is responsive to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource. Anexample search result 218 can include webpage title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the webpage, and the URL of the webpage. Search results pages can also include one or more digital component slots in which digital components can be presented. - When a
resource 212 provided by a contentprovider computing device 222 orsearch results 218 are requested by auser device 206, thedata processing system 102 receives a request for digital components to be provided with theresource 212, from a contentprovider computing device 222, or search results 218. The request for digital components can include characteristics of the digital component slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to thedata processing system 102. - For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the digital component slot is defined, a size of the digital component slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the digital component slot can be provided to the
data processing system 102. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or asearch query 220 for which search results are requested can also be provided to thedata processing system 102 to facilitate identification of digital components that are relevant to the resource orsearch query 220. Further, images and multimedia elements that are associated with the resource may be provided to thedata processing system 102. - Based on data included in the request for digital components, the
data processing system 102 can select digital components that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible digital components”). For example, eligible digital components can include digital components having characteristics matching the characteristics of digital component slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 220. In some implementations, digital components having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or thesearch query 220 are selected as eligible digital components by thedata processing system 102. As described with respect to embodiments, digital components associated with digital component images with features matching images associated with a resource or webpage may be selected as eligible digital components by thedata processing system 102. - A targeting keyword can match a resource keyword or a
search query 220 by having the same textual content (“text”) as the resource keyword orsearch query 220. For example, a digital component associated with the targeting keyword “daisy” can be an eligible digital component for a digital component request including the resource keyword “daisy.” Similarly, the digital component can be selected as an eligible digital component for a digital component request including the search query “daisy.” - A targeting keyword can also match a resource keyword or a
search query 220 by having text that is identified as being relevant to a targeting keyword orsearch query 220 despite having different text than the targeting keyword. For example, a digital component having the targeting keyword “daisy” may also be selected as an eligible digital component for a digital component request including a resource keyword or search query for “flowers” because daisy is a type of flower, and therefore, is likely to be relevant to the term “flowers.” - As described herein with reference to embodiments, the digital component system can use features of multimedia elements provided in the request for digital components from the content provider computing device to identify relevant digital components. The digital component system may also use text labels associated with multimedia elements provided in the request for digital components to identify relevant digital components.
-
Search system 214 may provide functionality to users including image search functionality, audio search functionality, and video search functionality. A user may search for images by entering asearch query 220 including one or more keywords. For example, the user may enter the search query “handbag” and be presented with a selection of one or more images of handbags or purses. Upon selecting an image, the image may then be associated with the search query term “handbag” as the text label for that image. The image may be provided as part of a content provider computing device webpage. Accordingly, the digital component system may use this text label to identify relevant digital components in response to a request for digital components. - Similarly, a user may search for audio content or video content by entering a
search query 220 including one or more keywords. For example, the user may enter the search query “sports car” and be presented with a selection of one or more videos of sports cars or race cars. Upon selecting a video, the video may then be associated with the search query term “sports car” as the text label for that video. The video may be provided as part of a content provider computing device webpage. Accordingly, the digital component system may use this text label to identify relevant digital components in response to a request for digital components. - The
data processing system 102 can select the eligible digital components that are provided for presentation in digital component slots of a resource based on results of an auction. For example, thedata processing system 102 can receive bids from service provider computing devices and allocate the digital component slots to the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction. The bids are amounts that the service provider computing devices are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their digital component with a resource or search results page. For example, a bid can specify an amount that a service provider computing device is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the digital component, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the service provider computing device is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the digital component or a “conversion” following selection of the digital component. The highest bidders can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from digital component performance, landing page scores, and the like. - Service Provider Computing Devices can also specify budgets for their digital component campaigns. A budget is a specified amount that a service provider computing device is willing to pay for distribution of content over a specified budget period. The specified period can be, for example, a specified time (e.g., one day, one week, or one year), a specified number of events (e.g., a number of impressions or clicks), or some other delineation of time or events. Once the amount the service provider computing device is charged for distribution of content during the budget period matches or exceeds the budget amount, the campaign can be prevented from providing content for the remainder of the budget period unless the service provider computing device increases or overrides its specified budget.
- A conversion occurs when a user performs a particular action related to a digital component provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a digital component, is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by a service provider computing device to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or webpage, or registering on a website. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- In one embodiment, digital components may be computer display digital components. a service
provider computing device 210 may provide data associated with one or more digital components, such as a service provider computing device name, text to be included in a digital component, keywords, and other information. Thedata processing system 102 may generate computer display digital components based on the received data. For example, thedata processing system 102 may combine the received data into a creative for the digital component, and generate a computer display digital component responsive to the keywords specified by the service provider computing device. In another embodiment, computer display digital components may be provided by serviceprovider computing devices 210. - In embodiments, data processing system 102 (and its recognition engine 104) may be implemented in software, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof on one or more computing devices. For example,
data processing system 102 may be part of or may be implemented with a computing device, such as, a processor-based computing device. A computing device can be any type of device having one or more processors. For example, a computing device can be a workstation, mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone, personal digital assistant, tablet or laptop), computer, server, compute cluster, server farm, game console, set-top box, kiosk, embedded system or other device having at least one processor and memory. Embodiments may be software executed by a processor, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof in a computing device. - Examples of providing image digital components based on the content of a resource are described with reference to
FIGS. 3-5 . A system that can be used to implement these examples is then described with reference toFIG. 6 . -
FIG. 3 illustrates anexemplary method 300 for providing computer display digital components based on multimedia element content of a resource, according to an embodiment. Theprocess 300 can be implemented, for example, by therecognition engine 104 and/or thedata processing system 102 ofFIG. 2 . In some implementations, therecognition engine 104 is a data processing apparatus that includes one or more processors that are configured to perform actions of theprocess 300. In other implementations, a computer readable medium can include instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to perform actions of theprocess 300. - In
step 302, a request for digital components for a content provider computing device resource is received. The request for digital components may be received in response to a user requesting a content provider computing device webpage from the content provider computing device, or requesting a resource from a content provider computing device such as an application. The request for digital components may include one or more multimedia elements displayed on the content provider computing device resource, as well as keywords associated with the content of the content provider computing device resource. - In
step 304, one or more multimedia elements displayed on the resource are identified. Further, features of each of the one or more multimedia elements may be extracted. Multimedia elements may include, but are not limited to, images, audio data, video data, animation data, interactive elements of the resource, or other data that may be included on a content provider computing device resource. Feature extraction is further described below. - In
step 306, a digital component associated with a digital component multimedia element is identified. As described with reference to step 304, digital component multimedia elements may include, but are not limited to, image, audio data, video data, animation data, interactive elements, or other data. The digital component can be identified by matching features of the digital component multimedia element with features of the one on more multimedia elements displayed on the resource. For example, if the multimedia element is an image, one or more edges, corner features, line features, interest points, blobs, regions of interest, or ridges in an image displayed on the content provider computing device resource may match one or more of such features in a digital component image. Based on this matching, the digital component associated with the digital component image may be identified. - In one embodiment, features may be extracted from the images displayed on the content provider computing device's resource using a feature detection technique. Features may include, but are not limited to, edges, corner features, interest points, blobs or regions of interest, or ridges. Feature detection techniques may include, but are not limited to, canny edge detection, scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), speeded up robust feature (SURF), and other known feature detection techniques. Further, in one embodiment, features may be extracted from digital component images when a digital component with an associated digital component image is provided by a service provider computing device, such that the features can be matched in response to a request for digital components.
- In one embodiment, a digital component may be identified if the number of features that match between an image on a content provider computing device resource and a digital component image meets a threshold. For example, a digital component may be identified only if five or more features match between a digital component image associated with the digital component and an image on the content provider computing device resource. Defining such a threshold may, increase the likelihood that the identified digital component corresponds to the image content of the content provider computing device resource.
- In one embodiment, features of the multimedia elements displayed on the content provider computing device's resource may include text label data. As described above, when a user performs a query for images, video, audio, or other content, the query terms that result in the multimedia element may be associated with the multimedia element after the user selects or clicks on the multimedia element. The query terms may become text label data associated with the multimedia element.
- In one embodiment, features of audio data included on a content provider computing device resource may be matched with features of audio data associated with a digital component. For example, features of the audio data included on the content provider computing device resource may be matched with features of audio data associated with a digital component by using audio search technique. Such a technique may extract a feature, such as a unique fingerprint of the audio data included on the content provider computing device resource, and compare the unique fingerprint to a fingerprint of audio data associated with a digital component. If the unique fingerprint matches the fingerprint of audio data associated with a digital component in part or in whole; the digital component associated with the audio data may be identified.
- In one embodiment, features of video data included on a content provider computing device resource may be matched with features of video data associated with a digital component. For example, features of video data included on the content provider computing device resource may be extracted and matched with features of video data associated with a digital component, using a video matching technique. Such a technique may extract individual still frames of each video and compare the still frames to determine whether a video on a content provider computing device resource matches a video associated with a digital component. If a threshold number of frames matches between the videos, the digital component associated with the video may be identified. Similarly, image matching techniques as described herein may match individual flames of video data associated with a digital component to images displayed on a content provider computing device resource. If edges, corner features, or other features of the individual frames of video data are associated with a digital component that match features in the image displayed on the content provider computing device resource, the digital component may be identified.
- In one embodiment, the format of the digital component multimedia element is the same as the format of the multimedia element displayed on the content provider computing device resource. For example, a digital component associated with a video as its digital component multimedia element may be identified in response to a request for digital components from a content provider computing device resource displaying a video. In another embodiment, the format of the digital component multimedia element is different than the format of the multimedia element displayed on the content provider computing device resource. Thus, for example, a digital component associated with an image of shoes as its digital component multimedia element may be identified in response to a request for digital components from a content provider computing device resource displaying a video of sports players wearing the same or similar shoes. Such a digital component may be identified using image matching techniques as described above.
- In
step 308, the digital component is provided to the content provider computing device associated with the content provider computing device resource. The digital component may be provided over a computer network to the content provider computing device. The digital component may then be displayed on the content provider computing device resource along with the content of the content provider computing device resource, -
FIG. 4 illustrates a furtherexemplary method 400 for providing computer display digital components based on multimedia content of a resource, according to an embodiment. - In
step 402, a request for digital components for a content provider computing device resource is received. The request for digital components may be received in response to a user requesting a content provider computing device resource from the content provider computing device, or requesting a resource from a content provider computing device such as an application, and may include one or more multimedia elements displayed on the content provider computing device resource or other content of the content provider computing device resource. - In
step 404, text label data associated with each of the one or more multimedia elements is identified. As described above, query terms associated with a multimedia element may be used as text label data for the multimedia element. Text label data may further be a label associated with the multimedia element which describes the multimedia element. For example, metadata or data associated with the image may be used as text label data. For example, the “alt” or “title” attribute of an HTML, image tag may allow a content provider computing device to specify text that is displayed instead of an image or along with an image. Text included in the “alt” attribute may be used to find relevant digital components. - In
step 406, a digital component associated with a keyword responsive to the text label data is identified. The digital component can be identified by matching text label data of the multimedia element displayed on the content provider computing device resource to keywords of a digital component. For example, the digital component may be associated with a keyword that exactly matches the text label data. Additionally, the digital component may be associated with a keyword related to the text label data. - In
step 408, the digital component is provided to a content provider computing device associated with the content provider computing device resource. The digital component may then be displayed on the content provider computing device resource along with the content of the content provider computing device resource. - In one embodiment, the content provider computing device associated with the content provider computing device resource is compensated for displaying the digital component. For example, the content provider computing device associated with the content provider computing device resource may be compensated an amount corresponding to the bid amount of the provided digital component.
- According to an embodiment, steps 302, 304, 306, and 308 may be performed by the
recognition engine 104. Further, steps 402, 404, 406 and 408 may be performed by therecognition engine 104. -

FIG. 7 is an illustration of thesystem 100 to route packetized actions via a computer network. The system can include one or more component ofsystem 100 depicted inFIG. 1C . AtACT 705, theclient computing device 206 can transmit data packets carrying the input audio signal detected by a microphone or other sensor of thecomputing device 206. Theclient computing device 206 can transmit the input audio signal to thedata processing system 102. Thedata processing system 102 can parse the input audio signal to identify a keyword, request or other information to generate an action data structure responsive to the request. - At
ACT 710, thedata processing system 102 can transmit the action data structure to the service provider device 210 (or service provider computing device 210). Thedata processing system 102 can transmit the action data structure via a network. Theservice provider device 210 can include an interface configured to receive and process the action data structure transmitted by thedata processing system 102. - The service provider device 210 (e.g., via a conversational API) can respond to the action data structure at
ACT 715. The response from theservice provider device 210 can include an indication of a service to perform corresponding to the action data structure. The response can include a confirmation to proceed with performing the operation. The response can include a request for further information to perform the operation corresponding to the action data structure. For example, the action data structure can be for a ride, and theservice provider 210 can respond with a request for further information such as a number of passengers for the ride, a type of car desired by the passenger, desired amenities in the car, or preferred pick up location. The request for additional information can include information that may not be present in the action data structure. For example, the action data structure can include baseline information to perform the operation, such as the pick-up location, destination location, and number of passengers. The baseline information can be the standard data set used by a plurality of serviceprovider computing devices 210 within the taxi service category. However, a certaintaxi service provider 210 can choose to customize and improve the operation by requesting additional information or preferences from theclient computing device 206. - The
service provider device 210 can transmit one or more data packets carrying the response to thedata processing system 102 atACT 715. Thedata processing system 102 can parse the data packets and identify a source of the data packets and a destination for the data packets. AtACT 720, thedata processing system 102 can, accordingly, route or forward the data packets to theclient computing device 206. Thedata processing system 102 can route or forward the data packets vianetwork 105. - At
ACT 725, theclient computing device 206 can transmit an instruction or command to thedata processing system 102 based on the forwarded response. For example, the response forwarded at 725 can be a request for a number of passengers and a confirmation to proceed with scheduling the taxi ride. The instruction at 725 can include the number of passengers and the instruction to proceed with scheduling the pickup. Theclient device 206 can transmit one or more data packets carrying the instruction to thedata processing system 102. Thedata processing system 102 can route or forward the data packets carrying the instructions to theservice provider device 210 atACT 730. - In some cases, the
data processing system 102 can route or forward the data packets atACT 720 orACT 730 as-is (e.g., without manipulating the data packets). In some cases, thedata processing system 102 can process the data packets to filter out information, or encapsulate the data packets with information to facilitate processing of the data packets by theservice provider device 210 or theclient computing device 206. For example, thedata processing system 102 can mask, hide, or protect the identity of theclient computing device 206 from theservice provider device 210. Thus, thedata processing system 102 can encrypt identifying information using a hash function such that theservice provider 210 cannot directly identify a device identifier or username of theclient computing device 206. Thedata processing system 102 can maintain a mapping of the proxy identifier provided to theservice provider device 210 for use during the communication session to the identifier or username of theclient computing device 206. -
FIG. 8 is an illustration of thesystem 100 to route packetized actions via a computer network. The system can include one or more component ofsystem 100 depicted inFIG. 1C . At 805, theclient computing device 206 can transmit data packets carrying the input audio signal detected by a microphone or other sensor of thecomputing device 206. Theclient computing device 206 can transmit the input audio signal to thedata processing system 102. Thedata processing system 102 can parse the input audio signal to identify a keyword, request or other information to generate an action data structure responsive to the request. - At
ACT 810, thedata processing system 102 can transmit the action data structure to the service provider device 210 (or service provider computing device 210). Thedata processing system 102 can transmit the action data structure via a network. Theservice provider device 210 can include an interface configured to receive and process the action data structure transmitted by thedata processing system 102. - The service provider device 210 (e.g., via a conversational API) can respond to the action data structure at
ACT 815. The response from theservice provider device 210 can include an indication of a service to perform corresponding to the action data structure. The response can include a confirmation to proceed with performing the operation. The response can include a request for further information to perform the operation corresponding to the action data structure. For example, the action data structure can be for a ride, and theservice provider 210 can respond with a request for further information such as a number of passengers for the ride, a type of car desired by the passenger, desired amenities in the car, or preferred pick up location. The request for additional information can include information that may not be present in the action data structure. For example, the action data structure can include baseline information to perform the operation, such as the pick-up location, destination location, and number of passengers. The baseline information can be the standard data set used by a plurality of serviceprovider computing devices 210 within the taxi service category. However, a certaintaxi service provider 210 can choose to customize and improve the operation by requesting additional information or preferences from theclient computing device 206. - The
service provider device 210 can transmit one or more data packets carrying the response directly to theclient computing device 206 via anetwork 105. For example, instead of routing the response through thedata processing system 102, theservice provider device 210, via a conversational API executed by theservice provider device 210, can respond directly to theclient computing device 206. This can allow the service provider to customize the communication session. - At
ACT 820, theclient computing device 206 can transmit an instruction or command toservice provider device 210 based on the response. For example, the response provided at 815 can be a request for a number of passengers and a confirmation to proceed with scheduling the taxi ride. The instruction at 820 can include the number of passengers and the instruction to proceed with scheduling the pickup. Theclient device 206 can transmit one or more data packets carrying the instruction to theservice provider device 210 instead of routing the data packets through thedata processing system 102. - The
data processing system 102 can facilitate theservice provider device 210 and theclient computing device 206 establishing a communication session independent of thedata processing system 102 by passing communication identifiers to the respective devices. For example, thedata processing system 102 can forward an identifier of thedevice 206 to the serviceprovider computing device 210; and thedata processing system 102 can forward an identifier of the serviceprovider computing device 210 to thedevice 206. Thus, the serviceprovider computing device 210 can establish the communication session directly with thedevice 206. - In some cases, the service
provider computing device 210 ordevice 206 can separately forward information, such as status information, about the communication session to thedata processing system 102. For example, the serviceprovider computing device 210 can provide, to the data processing system, an indication that the serviceprovider computing device 210 successfully established the communication session with theclient device 206. -
FIG. 9 illustrates a block diagram of anexample method 900 to extract image features from input requests. Themethod 900 can include receiving a first request that includes a first image (ACT 902). Themethod 900 can include retrieving image data for a plurality of images (ACT 904). Themethod 900 can include extracting an image feature from the first image (ACT 906). Themethod 900 can include selecting candidate images (ACT 908). Themethod 900 can include selecting a second image from the candidate images (ACT 910). Themethod 900 can include transmitting the second image (ACT 912). - The
method 900 can include receiving a first request that includes a first image (ACT 902). The first image can be included in the request. The first image can be captured by a camera associated with the first computing device. For example, the computing device can include a built-in camera with which a user can capture an image. The first request can also include an audio-based input signal. For example, the audio-based input signal can be “Ok, what is this?” The audio-based input signal can be transmitted by the first computing device to thedata processing system 102 with an image the user wants to know more information about. In some implementations, theNLP component 171 can also process the first image to determine requests that are associated with the first image. For example, theNLP component 171 can analyze a picture of an item and determine the request is to know where the item can be purchased. The first image can be a video image. The first image can be a frame or series of frames from a video input file. The video can be captured at the computing device. - The
method 900 can also include receiving the request by the natural language processor component that is executed by thedata processing system 102. The request can be received as a plurality of packets that are received via a packet based protocol. The natural language processor component can parse the request identify a trigger keyword in the request. For example, the request can include the input audio-signal “Ok, where can I buy this?”. The trigger keyword in this example can be “buy,” indicating the user may want to purchase the item contained in the first image that is received with the request. - The
method 900 can include retrieving image data for a plurality of images (ACT 904). Themethod 900 can include retrieving the image data for each of the plurality of images. Themethod 900 can include retrieving content data from a plurality of content items. The content items can be digital components that can include other or additional types of content besides images. For example, the content items can include text, video, or audio content. The images data can include image features for of the respective images. The plurality of images can be digital components that thedata processing system 102 can select from to provide to the first computing device in response to receiving the request. - The
method 900 can include extracting an image feature from the first image (ACT 906). The recognition engine of thedata processing system 102 can apply image feature detection to the first image to extract the image feature. Thedata processing system 102 can also use the recognition engine to apply the image feature detection to each of the plurality of images. The recognition engine can extract one or more image features from each of the images. The image features can include edges, corner features, interest points, blobs or regions of interest, or ridge features. The image features can be an identification of the subject matter contained in the images. For example, for an image of a shirt, the recognition engine can determine the image includes a shirt. The image features can also include identification of colors in the images. The recognition engine can use machine learning or computer vision to identify the images features of each of the images. - The
method 900 can include selecting candidate images (ACT 908). Themethod 900 can include selecting the candidate images by determining matches between the image feature of the first image and the image features from each of the plurality of images. When the recognition engine identifies a plurality of image features for each of the images, the selection of the candidate images can be based on matching a predetermined number of the image features between the first image's image features and the image feature of the plurality of images. In one example, the image feature of the first image can be the identification that the first image represents or otherwise includes a purse. The recognition engine can select candidate images that also represent or otherwise include a purse. In some implementations, meta data, such as keywords associated with the plurality of images can also be used select the candidate images. For example, thedata processing system 102 can select each of the plurality of images as candidate images that are tagged with the keyword “purse.” - The
method 900 can include selecting a second image from the candidate images (ACT 910). The second image can be selected based on the request from the computing device. The second image can also be selected from the candidate images based on the trigger keyword that was identified by theNLP component 171. In some implementations, thedata processing system 102 can select a template based on the trigger keyword. Thedata processing system 102 can generate an action data structure. Thedata processing system 102 can populate fields in the template with the first or second images. Thedata processing system 102 can also request a value from a sensor associated with the computing device. The value can be used to select the second image. The value can be populated into an action data structure template. For example, the sensor can be a GPS sensor and the value can be a location. The action data structure can be generated by a direct action application programming interface. - The
method 900 can include transmitting the second image (ACT 912). The second image can be transmitted to a second computing device. The second computing device can be a computing device that is associated with the first computing device. For example, the first and the second computing device can be linked through a user logging into a common account on each of the computing devices. The second image can be transmitted to the computing device by thedata processing system 102 or by a service provider computing device. - In some implementations, the
method 900 can include transmitting, by the direct action application programming interface, the action data structure to a service provider computing device to cause the service provider computing device to invoke a conversational application programming interface. The service provider computing device can establish a communication session between the service provider computing device and the first computing device. Through the communication session, the service provider computing device can request information from the computing device. Thedata processing system 102 can receive an indication that the service provider computing device established the communication session with the first computing device. - Although an example computing system has been described, the subject matter including the operations described in this specification can be implemented in other types of digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
- For situations in which the systems discussed herein collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's location), or to control whether or how to receive content from a content server or other
data processing system 102 that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed when generating parameters. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, postal code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about him or her and used by the content server. - The subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, e.g., one or more circuits of computer program instructions, encoded on one or more computer storage media for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatuses. Alternatively, or in addition, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. A computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. While a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium can also be, or be included in, one or more separate components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices). The operations described in this specification can be implemented as operations performed by a data processing apparatus on data stored on one or more computer-readable storage devices or received from other sources.
- The terms “data processing system” “computing device” “component” or “data processing apparatus” encompass various apparatuses, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, a system on a chip, or multiple ones, or combinations of the foregoing. The apparatus can include special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). The apparatus can also include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, a cross-platform runtime environment, a virtual machine, or a combination of one or more of them. The apparatus and execution environment can realize various different computing model infrastructures, such as web services, distributed computing and grid computing infrastructures. For example, the
direct action API 116,content selector component 118, orNLP component 171 anddata processing system 102 components can include or share one or more data processing apparatuses, systems, computing devices, or processors. - A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, app, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can correspond to a file in a file system. A computer program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs (e.g., components of the data processing system 102) to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatuses can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto optical disks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- The subject matter described herein can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or a combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system such as
system 100 or system 500 can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network (e.g., the network 165). The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, a server transmits data (e.g., data packets representing a content item) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server (e.g., received by thedata processing system 102 from thecomputing device 206 or the contentprovider computing device 222 or the service provider computing device 210). - While operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, such operations are not required to be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, and all illustrated operations are not required to be performed. Actions described herein can be performed in a different order.
- The separation of various system components does not require separation in all implementations, and the described program components can be included in a single hardware or software product. For example, the
NLP component 171 or thecontent selector component 118, can be a single component, app, or program, or a logic device having one or more processing circuits, or part of one or more servers of thedata processing system 102. - Having now described some illustrative implementations, it is apparent that the foregoing is illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by way of example. In particular, although many of the examples presented herein involve specific combinations of method acts or system elements, those acts and those elements may be combined in other ways to accomplish the same objectives. Acts, elements and features discussed in connection with one implementation are not intended to be excluded from a similar role in other implementations or implementations.

Such references used in conjunction with “comprising” or other open terminology can include additional items.
- Where technical features in the drawings, detailed description or any claim are followed by reference signs, the reference signs have been included to increase the intelligibility of the drawings, detailed description, and claims. Accordingly, neither the reference signs nor their absence have any limiting effect on the scope of any claim elements.
- The systems and methods described herein may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the characteristics thereof. For example, the
data processing system 102 can select a content item or digital component for a subsequent action (e.g., for the third action) based in part on data from a prior action in the sequence of actions of the thread, such as data from the second action indicating that the second action is complete or about to begin. The foregoing implementations are illustrative rather than limiting of the described systems and methods. Scope of the systems and methods described herein is thus indicated by the appended claims, rather than the foregoing description, and changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are embraced therein.
