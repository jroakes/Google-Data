4.3.3 refine with alternative
Get back to the operation 410 of Fig. 4, correlation information can video documents (for example broadcasting, multicast, clean culture, transmission or the like) is preceding to be provided by video distribution person distributing.If video documents before was saved (for example before writing down), then before distributing it, can analyze (and may distribute and/or playback duration is analyzed once more) to it.If video documents is just distributed in real time, then can analyze it distributing at that time (may client terminal device and before playing soon) its coding.
Get back to the operation 420 of Fig. 4, before distributing video documents, can provide advertisement position dividually with video documents by video distribution person.Alternatively, or extraly, can based on the information in the video documents of being coded in determine advertisement position (for example before advertisement position occurs for a long time, or just in time before advertisement position).Thereby, for example, video documents can be in the early stage with in the document of encoding in the fact of locating to exist three two minutes advertisement positions in 20 minutes, 40 minutes and 55 minutes into.As another example, video documents can be in the fact of locating to exist two minutes advertisement positions in 19 minutes 50 seconds after following 10 seconds be encoded into document.Such coding can be with the text message in mark, video packets or the stream of video packets, the form that is used to call out the executable code (for example Javascript) or the like of Advertisement Server.
Note, in some cases because foradownloaded video document as required, thus the length of video documents may change, to hold more or less advertisement position.For example, if there are many very relevant advertisements, and/or the glad cost of advertiser be used to more flash, the more advertisement position time then can be provided.Thereby, can be based on the one or more ratios that reduce or increase video content time and time spot in following: the degree of (A) advertisement correlativity, (B) have the income interests of more advertisement positions, (C) user's effectiveness reduces (for example user's worry) when having more advertisement positions, (D) user is to the desired level of content, and (E) terminal user is to degree of the subsidy of content or the like.Thereby, terminal user's effectiveness and advertising income can be made balance.
If video documents before was saved (for example before being recorded), then can be before distributing video documents (for example broadcasting, multicast, clean culture, transmission or the like) be used for determining the ruling of the advertisement distributed at various advertisement positions.If video documents is just distributed in real time, then the ruling can when distributing video documents, take place (may client terminal device to its coding and the broadcast before soon).If foradownloaded video document (for example using certain transportation protocol such as FTP) (for example starts when playing) executable code that is used to start the advertisement ruling when then document can be included in the displaying video document.Under any circumstance, after ruling, advertisement can utilize (for example being inserted into) video documents (for example carrying the stream of video content) to provide.If video documents before was saved, then can once decide all advertisement positions in the video documents.By this way, the advertisement position that has a high requirements (for example beginning of video documents) at the each several part of video documents can be filled the advertisement than high score.
Video documents can be divided into sections, each sections comprises advertisement position.In such embodiments, can be construed to be video documents self to each sections.Can with particular video frequency sections or particular video frequency sections (for example weighting is more) and video documents as a whole (for example weighting still less) serve as that relevant advertisements is determined on the basis.Similarly, can be based in sections or the time weighting correlation information of in video documents, transcribing.For example, more can go up theme further from advertisement position (may in identical sections) than the time near the theme of advertisement position on the time is weighted more.
Advertising message can comprise whether the advertiser wants or surpass once with being intended to distribute in the given video documents (example) its advertisement.For example, the advertiser can specify in and distribute its advertisement in the example (for example unicast video stream) of video documents and be no more than N time.Alternatively, or extraly, advertising network and/or video documents publisher can realize being limited in the strategy that can distribute the number of times of given advertisement in the example of video documents.
Although in the context of bid (or best bid) that flashes, described a plurality of examples at every turn, but embodiment according to the invention can consider other bid, such as each user's selection (or calling or message or the like) bid (or best bid), each conversion (for example call, project purchase, project order or the like) bid (or best bid).Similarly, score value can be the function of one or more bids and may be the possibility of one or more user behaviors.Although ad score can reflect the expected cost of at every turn flashing (bid price that for example at every turn flashes, at every turn select bid price * selection rate or probability, change bid price * conversion ratio or probability or the like at every turn), can use other technology that is used for advertisement is marked.Such technology can be considered terminal user's effectiveness (for example correlativity, worried factor or the like) of advertisement.
Although embodiment more according to the invention have described video ads is inserted in the video documents, advertisement can be with the form of other form and can utilize video documents to distribute.For example can utilize video documents to play text advertisements, image ad, pure audio advertisement or the like.Thereby, though the form of advertisement can be distributed the format match of its video documents, the form of advertisement needn't with the format match of video documents.Can (for example contiguous video content) present advertisement in the screen position identical or in different screen positions with video content.Video ads can comprise video component and extra assembly (for example text, audio frequency or the like).Can present so extra assembly on the display device identical and/or on certain other output unit at client terminal device with video component.Similarly, can utilize non-video document (for example in the iframe of webpage) to come playing video advertisement in mode according to the invention.
Although Fig. 4 and 10 has described the relevant advertisements that is identified for given video documents, can use embodiment according to the invention to determine the video documents relevant (or its advertisement position) with given advertisement.For example, can show the video documents of thinking relevant to the advertiser with its advertisement.Use such correlativity can be with document ordering.The advertiser can select to make as far as possible and utilize video documents or document (or utilizing its advertisement position) to come serve ads.The advertiser can be expressed as such selection the bid that utilizes document to distribute its advertisement.Other advertiser can do same thing.When distributing video documents, can decide that (for example use auction) is eligible and utilize contention between the advertisement that video documents distributes.
Can between ad serve network and video distribution person, share income based on advertisement.Video distribution person can be based on subscribing to, collecting money based on each download and/or based on present to the terminal user at every turn.Can use the advertising income of sharing with video distribution person to subsidize (for example reducing or eliminating) user cost.In fact, can use advertising income (for example share of advertising network and/or audio frequency publisher's share) to pay user's download or present the video documents that comprises advertisement.For example, if the user usually usually $1.00 come the down-load music video, then the user may be collected still less (or do not need, or in fact pay) and be downloaded the music video with one or more advertisements.Can use advertising income to subsidize other content and/or service, such as video-voice-mail, video-online chatting, music video, music video broadcast, video frequency program (for example TV programme collection, TV programme season (season), film or the like) download, video program play, video-communication service or the like.
Can be based on each broadcasting (or each multicast) or based on distribute or download the ruling of carrying out in embodiment according to the invention at every turn at every turn.Based on distribute or download and carry out the potentiality that ruling has the generation more revenue at every turn at every turn.For example, under each situation of broadcasting the video documents of agreeing to have 100,000 advertisement positions, if advertiser A is ready that be ready $5.00/ flashes, Ju You $50,000.00 budget constraints, advertiser B is ready that be ready $2.00/ flashes, Ju You $60,000.00 budget constraints, and advertiser C is ready that be ready $1.00/ flashes, Ju You $100,000.00 budget constraints, then with serve ads C 100,000 time, net income $ 100,000.00.On the other hand, under the situation of each advertisement position ruling, with serve ads A 10,000 times, with serve ads B 30,000 times and with serve ads C 60,000 times, Jing Shouru $170,000.00 ($50,000.00+$60,000.00+$60,000.00).
Notice that existence can utilize many video documents source of its serve ads.As first example, advertising network self can the trustship video server.As second example, provide video content bigger and less website can with the advertising network cooperation.As the 3rd example, other provider of document (for example webpage, Email or the like) can come video advertisement with the advertising network cooperation.Will be described below the exemplary business method that in these various contexts, uses.
Advertising network self can provide the video server of trustship third party video (for example Google video).Content supplier on the advertising network of trustship website and advertising network self can be benefited by the advertising income share.As another example, advertising network can obtain all advertising incomes, and content supplier obtains making its video by free trustship or in the interests of subsidizing or be reduced to this aspect.
Provide video content bigger website can with the advertising network cooperation.For example, ABCnews.com can play with at the cumulative relevant newsworthy clips of frequency of hurricane recent years.Suppose that the website is the co-worker of advertising network, advertising network will provide relevant advertisements to this newsworthy clips.For example, can position-based Red Cross's advertisement be directed to the viewer, and can comprise the telephone number of office of the nearest Red Cross.This also allows the Red Cross to use its local CATV (cable television) advertisement on Web.In this case, ABCnews.com is the video content of trustship its oneself, but exists the outer server of Advertisement Server of advertising network to call out, and will and be inserted into the ABCnews.com video flowing from the advertisement of Advertisement Server retrieve video.Bigger website and advertising network self can be benefited by the advertising income share.
Provide video content less website can with the advertising network cooperation.The trouble of the video of trustship its oneself may not wished to experience in less website.Advertising network can be on less website trustship video (may suppose that it satisfies various Terms of Use), and make then among the iframe of video on littler website with advertisement and show.Less website and advertising network self can be benefited by the advertising income share.As another example, advertising network can obtain all advertising incomes, and less website obtains making its video by free trustship or in the interests of subsidizing or be reduced to this aspect.
Can utilize content rather than video content to use embodiment according to the invention.In this case, can use the non-video content to come directed video ads.For example, relate to the webpage of automobile comment (for example Forbes year limousine comment) can trustship from flash (animation) video ads of General Motor corporation (GM) about up-to-date Cadillac model.
In at least some embodiment, can be in (for example flash) player with " broadcast ", " stopping " and " time-out " function playing video advertisement.The amount of money by advertisers pay can depend on that various user-video ads are mutual.For example, if stopped video ads in a N (for example N=5) second, then it can not be considered to flashing to advertiser's charge.
Can use such as being what on March 30th, 2005 submitted to, name is called " NETWORKING ADVERTISERS AND AGENTS FOR ADAUTHORING AND/OR AD CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT (web advertisement commission merchant that advocates peace who is used for advertisement creation and/or advertising campaign management) ", and with the U.S. Patent application No.11/093 of RossKoningstein and Sumit Agarwal classify as the inventor, 422 (be called " ' 422 application " and by reference integral body incorporate this paper into) described in technology help less, the advertiser who lacks experience is to produce video ads.For example, consider that local Italian restaurant wants in the context of Italian dish cook-in to show that it is at local directed video ads.Regrettably, the restaurant is on a shoe string and does not have the experience that generates television advertising.When it removed signatory video ads, it is easier that advertising network can make with the relation such as the company of local company, and this can help to generate and can be uploaded to the video intention that advertising network is used to distribute.
In at least some embodiment according to the invention, upload video file and/or video ads and can suffer automatic speech recognition, transcoding, thumbnail (thumbnail) to generate, ratify and/or add index to.
4.3.3.1 generate the estimation of video ads effect and use such estimation
Can use various " keys " to determine the click-through rate of the prediction of advertisement (or user behavior rate of some other prediction) (being described below).Extraly, or alternatively, use is the context component of the document of playing video advertisement (for example video, webpage or the like) thereon, more specifically distributes the user behavior (rate) that relevant one or more other parameters (for example distributing parameter) and/or the parameter relevant with the video ads of having distributed can be used to determine prediction with video ads.Other parameter like this can comprise one or more in following: the video ads selection rate, video ads CPM, video ads playback rate, partly or entirely video ads is play, the number percent of the duration of displaying video, the time of video playback, employed video player application, the length of video, the size of initial video frame (for example rectangular pixels size), whether size is extended, the size amplification degree, whether size is reduced, the size minification, the size that size enlarges or dwindles, other operation of adjusting size is (for example full frame, minimize or the like), size with respect to window size, size with respect to available screen size, audio mute whether, volume reduces, volume increases, volume changes, whether reset, the playback rate, whether suspend, the time-out rate, whether free draw runner, F.F. time draw runner, rewind down time draw runner, the user is to the comment of the video of serve ads, whether the video of serve ads is given friend by mailing, whether the user adds the mail relevant with video sends tabulation or the like.These parameters can be average, or comprise average.The value of these parameters can be (be or not) qualitatively, or quantitative (quantity).
Can come the user behavior of definite prediction to estimate parameter weighting and combination.Can (for example use machine learning system) and adjust weighting.
Determining whether to user's show candidate video ads and/or how during show candidate video ads (for example with which kind of order), can consider to estimate the user behavior rate of predicting (for example estimating the CTR of prediction).
Note, " key " that is used for predictive user behavior rate also can comprise be independent of the advertisement attributes of distributing that triggers advertisement (for example search inquiry, webpage or the like) one or more " label " (being described below).Other element like this can comprise Time of Day, language, country, personal profiles (under the situation of personalization) or the like.For example, can learn these other elements by data mining.
Can make in all sorts of ways (methods described in ' 581 applications) to predict the user behavior of estimation.Figure 20 that is described below-23 is corresponding with Fig. 5-8 of ' 581 applications.Video ads parameter (such as the above-mentioned parameter of listing) can be used as " key ", will be described below.
Figure 20 is used for estimating process flow diagram about the exemplary method of advertisement (it can utilize video documents to distribute) user behavior rate in mode according to the invention.In response to the user inquiring that is received, this method can be moved and discern, rank and display ads.At first, after receiving inquiry, with in real time or the mode of extracting from the history log of past inquiry, the advertisement (in the past under Cha Xun the situation) (frame 2000) that this method is discerned one group of candidate's advertisement (under the situation of new inquiry) or distributed.For example, keyword orientation, contextual analysis or the like can be used to determine relevant advertisements.In case discerned one group of candidate's advertisement, then can discern the one group key (frame 2002) relevant with characteristic, inquiry or both combinations of advertisement.
Although can distribute candidate's advertisement, should be appreciated that and also can use non-Query Information (such as therein or utilize its demonstration (for example in the webpage) network documentation of advertisement or the content of other document to determine candidate's advertisement in response to the inquiry that is received.In so non-inquiry realized, the key of being discerned can relate to the feature of candidate's advertisement, show its feature of document (for example webpage) and/or other attribute relevant with distributing of video ads thereon.Generally speaking, the web document that is used for display ads can be called as " advertisement triggering " with the inquiry that is received, and each starts advertising results estimation procedure described here.
As defined in this, " key " can be the arbitrary string of information, and described information is relevant with following content: with the inquiry that is received, be identified as any discernible feature or combination of features and/or attribute or the feature relevant with distributing of advertisement that the advertisement distributed is associated.Should further understand, " inquiry " can comprise the extra information of the search terms that exceeds user's input.For example the inquiry that each received also can comprise and following content-related information: the other or theme of the more width variety that is associated with inquiry, initiate the user's of inquiry geographic position, the searching preferences that the user uses, be used for starting the web browser of search or the type of other application, user's language preference, user's Internet protocol (IP) address, click or user behavior history with user and/or user's IP address associated advertisement, user's search history, receive the date and time of inquiry, or other ad serve parameter.
Except that the inquiry correlated characteristic, each key can be extraly or is comprised the feature relevant with the advertisement of being discerned alternatively.The advertisement correlated characteristic can comprise geographic position, Advertisement Language of purpose URL (URL(uniform resource locator)), the advertiser of the text of keyword orientation, advertisement of advertiser's title, advertisement or content, advertisement or the like.
It is right key table can be shown one group of label-value then, and wherein the specific characteristic type (for example distributing parameter) of tag recognition is discerned corresponding eigenwert and be worth.For example, representation " user_country:Canada (user country: Canada) " expression label-value is Canadian to indication user's residence country.Right key can be written as the tabulation of drawing together in bracket to comprise (for example being made up of it) a plurality of label-values.For example, (user_country: ＂ Canada ＂, query_test: can represent by the key of two label-values that ＂ camping gear ＂) select given key in order to make, these two label-values are to all satisfying to forming.
First example of suitable key can be that (query_word: ＂ free ＂), it has indicated user's search inquiry to comprise speech " free (freely) ".Second example can be (user country=USA; User language: (user country=U.S. ＂ English ＂); User language=" English "), it has indicated the user who submits inquiry to be positioned at the U.S. and its browser is set to English.The 3rd example can be (destination_page_text: ＂ swimming pool ＂, query_word: ＂ pool ＂, browser: ＂ Safari ＂), it has indicated the purpose page of advertisement link to comprise phrase " swimming pool (swimming pool) ", user's search comprises speech " pool (pond) ", and the user is using the Safari browser.Other a large amount of examples are possible.
By using this extra information, the advertisement selection system can be the improved estimation that the advertisement discerned generates user behavior rate (UAR) in response to the inquiry that is received.
In a realization of principle according to the invention, keyset can comprise the broad range of advertisement and/or query characteristics or characteristic.Alternatively, keyset can comprise the combination of the predetermined or appointment of inquiry and/or characteristic of advertisement or characteristic.In one implementation, can be based on coming options button with the predetermined association of advertisement triggering.For example, be search inquiry if rule can specify advertisement to trigger, then will be for every pair in user's the search inquiry adjacent speech options button.According to this rule, search inquiry " anniversary flowers seattle " will generate two keys (query_phrase: ＂ anniversary flowers ＂; Query_phrase: ＂ flowers seattle ＂).Can be by triggering with advertisement, generating extra key with advertisement itself and/or with other the Else Rule that parameter correlation joins of distributing.Although this technology can cause discerning a plurality of keys, it can be used to the type of indication information, and it is considered to useful and therefore is suitable for being included in and is used for triggering/the right keyset of advertisement.As the ground of more detailed description below, the selection of applicable or relevant key can further be refined from first initial set, to reduce the possibility that comprises uncorrelated or unnecessary key in the UAR estimation procedure.
After initial key is selected, from be associated with the advertisement selection system such as the memory search of memory storage historical data (frame 2004) about each key.In a realization of principle according to the invention, historical data can comprise information or the statistics that relates to the number that flashes that is associated with key, user behavior number that is associated with key (for example click, sort or the like) or the like.As described above, term " flashes " and relates to the number of times that advertisement is shown with other key feature.In addition, term " user behavior " relates to the number of times of the specific user's behavior that is associated with the advertisement that occurs.For example, can determine: for such as (user_country: ＂ USA ＂; Advertiser_country: key ＂ Canada ＂), the advertisement of coupling have been shown 1000 times and have had and worked for 30 times, represent that historical user behavior rate is 3.33.In one embodiment, can from server maintenance such as the such historical information of retrieval the various daily records of inquiry log and user behavior daily record.
The historical information of each key of identification can be by compiling (for example in real-time basically mode) in frame 2002.Can come to be user behavior rate (UAR) or the user behavior probability (frame 2006) of each inquiry/advertisement to its applied forcasting model then to the generation estimation.Estimated UAR can be used to selection, rank or classified advertisement then, is used for presenting (frame 2008) in response to the inquiry that is received potentially to the user.
Forecast model according to the invention can have following structure.To given triggering/advertisement concerning the given user behavior estimation possibility that will occur can be the function of the behavior possibility formerly that will occur and one or more model parameters of being associated with the right selected key of given triggering/advertisement.Can use the iterative process of attempting to obtain parameter value to come the computation model parameter then, described parameter value produces the best-fit to the user behavior probability of the actual, historical data that is used to train.
The constant that the possibility formerly of user behavior can be set to be scheduled to or its can depend on and triggering/advertisement one or more in the various features that are associated, such as the position of IR (information retrieval) score value, shown advertisement and size or the like.For example, the advertisement that occurs at the result of page searching top can be assigned with the possibility formerly that higher user behavior occurs than the similar advertisement that occurs in the result of page searching bottom.
The model parameter that is associated with each key can comprise (for example being made up of it) single parameter, such as the probability that occurs about desirable user behavior or the multiplier of probability.Alternatively, each key can have a plurality of model parameters that are associated with it, and it can influence the prediction probability of user behavior in more complicated mode.
In the following description, various probability and probability have been used.Pass through expression formula: probability=probability/(probability+1) is with the probability of incident generation and the probability correlation of incident generation.For example, if the probability that incident takes place is 1/2 (that is, be recorded usually as it, probability is " 1:2 "), then the corresponding probability of incident generation is 1/3.According to this agreement, it is interchangeable that probability and probability can be considered to.Words with probability rather than probability are expressed convenience of calculation, because probability can have any non-negative value, yet probability must be between 0 and 1.Yet, should be appreciated that probability of use ad hoc, or use such as certain other similar expression of log (probability) and carry out following realization, only need carry out small variation to following description.
Figure 21 is used for being the process flow diagram of each triggering/advertisement to the exemplary method of the UAR of generation estimation in mode according to the invention.Although final UAR can define with the probability that user behavior occurs, the right estimation UAR of given triggering/advertisement can be expressed as user behavior probability (1) as described above comparably.According to an embodiment according to the invention, can pass through user behavior probability (q formerly
0) multiply by and each selected key (k
i) model parameter (m that is associated
i) calculate the user behavior probability, after this be called the probability multiplier.This kind scheme can be represented as:
q＝q
0.m
1.m
2.m
3....m
m。
The probability multiplier of each key can be the statistical representation of the prediction dynamics of this key in whether definite user behavior occurs.In an embodiment according to the invention, the probability multiplier of each key can be represented the change of the user behavior rate that the viewed triggering/advertisement that is used to select this key (assembling) on historical data is right, wherein can't use any other key to simulate (model) or " explanation " this key.
In an embodiment according to the invention, above-mentioned model parameter can be revised continuously to reflect the relative influence of each key to the UAR that is used for the right estimation of each given triggering/advertisement.Can by with predicted no matter given key why user behavior all the probability that takes place and measured historical user behavior rate are compared and carry out such modification.By this way, can discern and the relative value of the key analyzed of refining.
Forward Figure 21 especially to, for each selected key (k
i), can initial calculation or discern the average probability of eliminating certainly (Pi) (frame 2100). in an embodiment according to the invention, from getting rid of probability (Pi) is the value of having represented the correlativity of selected key, and can be at the model parameter (m that removes selected key from estimated UAR calculates
i) time, measure the right user behavior rate of triggering/advertisement that is caused.For example, for key 3, this can be expressed as:
P
3n+((q
0.m
1.m
2.m
3....m
n)/m
3/(((q
0.m
1.m
2.m
3....m
n)/m
3+1)。
In an embodiment according to the invention, each key get rid of (moving) average that probability can be retained as change certainly.This doing will guarantee after the model parameter of having discerned each selected key that the probability of being discerned of eliminating is certainly restrained quickly.The average of such change can be expressed as:
P
in(avg)＝αP
i(n-1)(avg)+(1-α)P
in，
Wherein α is approach the very much 1 statistical definition variable of (for example 0.999), is used to control the half life period of change average.Shown in above-mentioned expression formula, by last flashing (for example, n-1) in determined P
iValue is to the flash P of (n) of current number purpose
iIt is average that value is weighted and asks.
Next, can be with average from getting rid of probability (P
i(avg)) with the viewed number that flashes and be used for the relevant historical information of the number of the viewed viewed user behavior that flashes compare (frame 2102).Can relatively generating or model parameter (frame 2104) that modification is associated with selected key based on frame 2102.
Figure 22 is the process flow diagram that is used for the exemplary method of mode generation model parameter according to the invention.This method can be used to realize the processing of the frame 2102-2104 of Figure 21.At first, can determine the fiducial interval relevant (frame 2200) with the probability of user behavior.When use has the key of more a spot of historical data, use the fiducial interval technology to improve degree of accuracy and stability estimation.In an one exemplary embodiment according to the invention, fiducial interval comprises low value L
iWith high value U
i, and be based on the observed (n that flashes of selected key
i) and user behavior (j
i) number.For example, fiducial interval can be based on viewed flashing and the quantity of user behavior is calculated in a conventional manner 80% fiducial interval [L
i, U
i].
After calculating fiducial interval, then can determine average from getting rid of probability (P
i(avg)) whether drop on (frame 2202) in this interval.If then can determine selected key (k
i) to not influence of click-through rate, and can be with model parameter (m
i) be set to 1, effectively it is removed (frame 2204) from estimated UAR calculates.Yet, if determine (P
i(avg)) drop on outside this interval, then can be with selected key (k
i) model parameter be set to be used for making average from getting rid of probability (P
i(avg)) necessary minimum adjusted value (frame 2206) in this fiducial interval.This calculating can mathematically be expressed as:
m
i＝[L
i(1-P
i(avg))]/[P
i(avg)(1-L
i)]
Consider following example.Suppose to relate in the U.S. and inquiry the key (k of the fact of used car for the expression user
i), observed 200 user behavior (j
i) and 10000 (n that flash
i).In addition, suppose the average probability of the eliminating certainly (P that is predicted that these flash
i(avg)) (not comprising the influence of this key) is 0.015.10000 flash in 80% fiducial interval of 200 user behaviors are [0.0182,0.0219], so m
iTo be set to be converted into 0.0182 needed model parameter with 0.015.When using in above expression formula, this value is 1.217.In other words, the existence of this key is interpreted as meaning when satisfying the condition of this key user and has an appointment and 20% bigger may carry out measured behavior.
Get back to Figure 21 now,, then can determine whether to remain pending (that is k whether, of extra key in case calculated the model parameter of selected key
i＜k
m) (frame 2106).If residue has extra key pending, then can increase counting variable i (frame 2108), and process can turn back to frame 2100 to handle next key.In case calculated or revised the model parameter of all keys, then can use equation q=q
0.m
1.m
2.m
3... .m
mCalculate the estimation probability (frame 2110) of user behavior.Can use aforesaid conversion agreement probability to be converted to the user behavior probability or the user behavior rate (2112) of estimation subsequently.
In an embodiment according to the invention, can by when daily record data arrives with its processing and accumulate above-mentioned statistic (for example, flash, user behavior, get rid of probability etc. certainly) and train the UAR forecast model.Along with the extra appearance of flashing, it is more accurate that the fiducial interval that is associated with each key can be shunk and parameter estimation can become.In other realization, can the will data quicken training by handle again former days.When handling daily record data again, can use the value of up-to-date parameter or probability multiplier to recomputate the click probability of estimation.This can restrain forecast model quickly.
In alternative embodiment according to the invention, can use Bayesian Estimation to calculate the model parameter of each key.In Bayesian realization, can initially determine the distribution formerly (g) of model parameter, make the given key of g (log m) expression have the probability formerly of model parameter m.Then can given model parameter mi be set to value with the maximized m of product:
f(log?m)＝g(log?m)h(log?m)
Wherein h (log m) comes at n with the value of using given m
iObserve k in individual the flashing
