Definitions
- the invention relates to acoustic devices and more particularly, but not exclusively, to loudspeakers incorporating resonant multi-mode panel acoustic radiators, e.g. of the kind described in parent application Ser. No. 08/707,012, and counterpart International application WO97/09842. Loudspeakers as described in WO97/09842 have become known as distributed mode (DM) loudspeakers.
- DM distributed mode
- DML Distributed mode loudspeakers
- the product may with advantage be light, thin and unobtrusive.
- an acoustic device comprises a resonant multi-mode acoustic resonator or radiator panel having opposed faces, means defining a cavity enclosing at least a portion of one panel face and arranged to contain acoustic radiation from the said portion of the panel face, wherein the cavity is such as to modify the modal behaviour of the panel.
- the cavity may be sealed.
- a vibration exciter may be arranged to apply bending wave vibration to the resonant panel to produce an acoustic output, so that the device functions as a loudspeaker.
- the cavity size may be such as to modify the modal behaviour of the panel.
- the cavity may be shallow.
- the cavity may be sufficiently shallow that the distance between the internal cavity face adjacent to the said one panel face and the one panel face is sufficiently small as to cause fluid coupling the panel.
- the resonant modes in the cavity can comprise cross modes parallel to the panel, i.e. which modulate along the panel, and perpendicular modes at right angles to the panel.
- the cavity is sufficiently shallow that the cross modes (X,Y) are more significant in modifying the modal behaviour of the panel than the perpendicular modes (Z).
- the frequencies of the perpendicular modes can lie outside the frequency range of interest.
- the ratio of the cavity volume to panel area may be less than 10:1, say in the range about 10:1 to 0.2:1.
- the panel may be terminated at its edges by a generally conventional resilient surround.
- the surround may resemble the roll surround of a conventional pistonic drive unit and may comprise one or more corrugations.
- the resilient surround may comprise foam rubber strips.
- edges of the panel may be clamped in the enclosure, e.g. as described in our co-pending PCT patent application PCT/GB99/00848 dated Mar. 30, 1999.
- Such an enclosure may be considered as a shallow tray containing a fluid whose surface may be considered to have wave-like behaviour and whose specific properties depend on both the fluid (air) and the dimensional or volume box geometry.
- the panel is placed in coupled contact with this active wave surface and the surface wave excitation of the panel excites the fluid. Conversely the natural wave properties of the fluid interact with the panel, so modifying its behaviour. This is a complex coupled system with new acoustic properties in the field.
- the invention is a method of modifying the modal behaviour of a resonant panel loudspeaker or resonator, comprising bringing the resonant panel into close proximity with a boundary surface to define a resonant cavity therebetween.

- FIG. 28 illustrates equalisation using filters.
- a sealed box loudspeaker 1 comprises a box-like enclosure 2 closed at its front by a resonant panel-form acoustic radiator 5 of the kind described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/707,012 to define a cavity 13 .
- the radiator 5 is energised by a vibration exciter 4 and is sealed to the enclosure round its periphery by a resilient suspension 6 .
- the suspension 6 comprises opposed resilient strips 7 , e.g. of foam rubber mounted in respective L-section frame members 9 , 10 which are held together by fasteners 11 to form a frame 8 .
- the interior face 14 of the back wall 3 of the enclosure 2 is formed with stiffening ribs 12 to minimise vibration of the back wall.
- the enclosure may be a plastics moulding or a casting incorporating the stiffening ribs.
- the panel in this embodiment may be of A2 size and the depth of the cavity 13 may be 90 mm.
- the loudspeaker embodiment of FIG. 3 is generally similar to that of FIGS. 1 and 2, but here the radiator panel 5 is mounted on a single resilient strip suspension 6 , e.g. of foam rubber, interposed between the edge of the radiator 5 and the enclosure to seal the cavity.
- the radiator panel size may be A5 and the cavity depth around 3 or 4 mm.
- FIGS. 1 to 3 relate to loudspeakers, it would equally be possible to produce an acoustic resonator for modifying the acoustic behaviour of a space, e.g. a meeting room or auditorium, using devices of the general kind of FIGS. 1 to 3 , but which omit the vibration exciter 4 .
- a panel in this form of deployment can provide a very useful bandwidth with quite a small enclosure volume with respect to the diaphragm size, as compared with piston speakers.
- the mechanisms responsible for the minimal interaction of this boundary with the distributed mode action are examined and it is further shown that in general a simple passive equalisation network may be all that is required to produce a flat power response. It is also demonstrated that in such a manifestation, a DML can produce a near-ideal hemispherical directivity pattern over its working frequency range into a 2 Pi space.
- a closed form solution is presented which is the result of solving the bending wave equations for the coupled system of the panel and enclosure combination.
- the system acoustic impedance function is derived and is in turn used to calculate the effect of the coupled enclosure on the eigen-frequencies, and predicting the relevant shifts and additions to the plate modes.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a typical polar response of a free DML. Note that the reduction of pressure in the plane of the panel is due to the cancellation effect of acoustic radiation at or near the edges.
- a free DML is brought near a boundary, in particular parallel with the boundary surface, acoustic interference starts to take place as the distance to the surface is reduced below about 15 cm, for a panel of approximately 500 cm 2 surface area.
- the effect varies in its severity and nature with the distance to the boundary as well as the panel size.
- the result nonetheless is invariably a reduction of low frequency extension, peaking of response in the lower midrange region, and some aberration in the midrange and lower treble registers as shown in the example of FIG. 5 . Because of this, and despite the fact that the peak can easily be compensated for, application of a ‘free’ DML near a boundary becomes rather restrictive.
- FIG. 7 The system under analysis is shown schematically in FIG. 7 .
- the front side of the panel radiates into free space, whilst the other side is loaded with an enclosure.
- This coupled system may be treated as a network of velocities and pressures are shown in the block diagram of FIG. 8 .
- the components are, from left to right; the electromechanical driving section, the modal system of the panel, and the acoustical systems.
- the normal velocity of the bending-wave field across a vibrating panel is responsible for its acoustic radiation.
- This radiation in turn leads to a reacting force which modifies the panel vibration.
- the radiation impedance which is the reacting element, is normally insignificant as compared with the mechanical impedance of the panel.
- the effect of acoustic impedance due to its rear radiation is no longer small, and in fact it will modify and add to the scale of the modality of the panel.
- This coupling is equivalent to a mechanoacoustical closed loop system in which the reacting sound pressure is due to the velocity of the panel itself.
- This pressure modifies the modal distribution of the bending wave field which in turn has an effect on the sound pressure response and directivity of the panel.
- L B is the bending rigidity differential operator of fourth order in x and y
- v is the normal component of the bending wave velocity
- ⁇ is the mass per unit area
- ⁇ is the driving frequency. The panel is disturbed by the mechanical driving pressure, p m , and the acoustic reacting sound pressure field, p a , FIG. 7 .
- Each term of the series in equation (1) is called a modal velocity, or, a “mode” in short.
- the model decomposition is a generalised Fourier transform whose eigen-functions ⁇ pi share the orthogonality property with the sine and cosine functions associated with Fourier transformation.
- the orthogonality property of ⁇ pi is a necessary condition to allow appropriate solutions to the differential equation (2).
- the set of eigen-functions and their parameters are found from the homogenous version of equation (2) i.e. after switching off the driving forces. In this case the panel can only vibrate at its natural frequencies or the so-called eigen-frequencies, ⁇ 1 , in order to satisfy the boundary conditions.
- ⁇ pi(x,y) is the value of the i th plate eigen-function at the position where the velocity is observed.
- ⁇ pi (xo,yo) is the eigen-function at the position where the driving force F pi (j ⁇ ) is applied to the panel.
- the driving force includes the transfer functions of the electromechanical components associated with the driving actuator at (x o ,y o ), as for example exciters, suspensions, etc. Since the driving force depends on the panel velocity at the driving point, a similar feedback situation as with the mechanoacoustical coupling exists at the drive point(s), albeit the effect is quite small in practice.
- FIG. 10 gives an example of the velocity magnitude distribution of a single eigen-function across a DML panel.
- the black lines are the nodal lines where the velocity is zero. With increasing mode index the velocity pattern becomes increasingly more complex. For a medium sized panel approximately 200 modes must be summed in order to cover the audio range.
- the modal admittance, Y pi(j ⁇ ) is the weighting function of the modes and determines with which amplitude and in which phase the i th mode takes part in the sum of equation (1).
- Y pi as described in equation (3), depends on the driving frequency, the plate eigen-value and, most important in the context of this paper, on the acoustic impedance of the enclosure together with the impedance due to the free field radiation.
- Y pi ⁇ ( s ) 1 R pi ⁇ s p ⁇ d pi s p 2 + s p ⁇ d pi + ⁇ pi ⁇ ⁇ v 2 ( 3 )
- ⁇ pi is a scaling factor and is a function of the i th plate eigen-value ⁇ pi and the total radiation impedance Z mai as described in equation (4).
- ⁇ pi ⁇ ( s ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ pi 4 ⁇ + ⁇ s p ⁇ ⁇ Z ma ⁇ ⁇ i ⁇ ( j ⁇ ) ⁇ ⁇ 1 K p ⁇ M p ( 4 )
- FIG. 11 shows the magnitudes of the frequency response of the in-vacuum Y pi(j ⁇ ) for the first ten modes of a panel, when clamped at the edges. The panel eigen-frequencies coincide with the peaks of these curves.
- the frequency response graphs of FIG. 13 shows the effect of the enclosure on the panel velocity spectrum.
- the two frequency response curves are calculated under identical drive condition, however, the left-hand graph displays the in-vacuum case, whilst the right hand graph shows the velocity when both sides of the panel are loaded with an enclosure.
- a double enclosure was used in this example in order to exclude the radiation impedance of air.
- the observation point is at the drive point of the exciter.
- the mechanical radiation impedance is the ratio of the reacting force, due to radiation, and the panel velocity.
- the radiation impedance can be regarded as constant across the panel area and may be expressed in terms of the acoustical radiated power P ai of a single mode.
- ⁇ v i > is the mean velocity across the panel associated with the i th mode. Since this value is squared and therefore always positive and real, the properties of the radiation impedance Z mai are directly related to the properties of the acoustical power, which is in general a complex value.
- the real part of P ai is equal to the radiated far-field power, which contributes to the resistive part of Z mai , causing damping of the velocity field of the panel.
- the imaginary part of P ai is caused by energy storing mechanisms of the coupled system, yielding to a positive or negative value for the reactance of Z mai .
- a positive reactance is caused by the presence of an acoustical mass. This is typical, for example, of radiation into free space.
- a negative reactance of Z mai is indicative of the presence of a sealed enclosure with its equivalent stiffness.
- a ‘mass’ type radiation impedance is caused by a movement of air without compression, whereas a ‘spring’ type impedance exists when air is compressed without shifting it.
- the principal effect of the imaginary part of the radiation impedance is a shift of the in-vacuum eigen-frequencies of the panel.
- a positive reactance of Z mai causes a down-shift of the plate eigen-frequencies, whereas a negative reactance (stiffness) shifts the eigen-frequencies up.
- the pane-mode itself dictates which effect will be dominating. This phenomenon is clarified by the diagram of FIG. 14, which shows that symmetrical mode shapes cause compression of air, ‘spring’ behaviour, whereas asymmetrical mode shapes shift the air side to side, yielding an acoustical ‘mass’ behaviour. New modes, which are not present in either system when they are apart, are created by the interaction of the panel and enclosure reactances.
- FIG. 15 shows the frequency response of the imaginary part of the enclosure radiation impedance.
- the left-hand graph displays a ‘spring-type’ reactance, typically produced by a symmetrical panel-mode. Up to the first enclosure eigen-frequency the reactance is mostly negative. In-vacuum eigen-frequencies of the panel, which are within this frequency region, are shifted up. In contrast the right diagram displays a ‘mass-type’ reactance behaviour, typically produced by an asymmetrical panel mode.
- the mechanical radiation impedance for the i th -plate mode is (5):
- Z mai - j ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ a ⁇ A 0 2 A d ⁇ ⁇ k , l ⁇ ⁇ ( i , k , l ) 2 k z ⁇ ( k , l ) ⁇ tan ⁇ ( k z ⁇ ( k , l ) ⁇ L dz ) ( 6 )
- ⁇ (i,k,l) is the coupling integral which takes into account the cross-sectional boundary conditions and involves the plate and enclosure eigen-functions.
- the index, i, in equation (6) is the plate mode-number; L dz is the depth of the enclosure; and k z is the modal wave-number component in the z-direction (normal to the panel).
- the indices, k and l are the enclosure cross-mode numbers in x and y direction, where L dx and L dy are enclosure dimensions in this plane.
- a 0 is the area of the panel and
- a d is cross-sectional area of the enclosure in the x and y plane.
- Equation (6) is a complicated function, which describes the interaction of the panel modes and the enclosure modes in detail.
- Z ma0 - j ⁇ Z a ⁇ A 0 2 A d ⁇ cot ⁇ ( k Z ⁇ L dz ) ( 8 )
- Equation (8) is the well known driving point impedance of a closed duct ( 6 ). If the product k z .L dz ⁇ 1 then a further simplification can be made as follows.
- Z ma0 A 0 2 ⁇ 1 j ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ C ab ( 9 )
- the first set ‘A’ was selected as a small A5 size panel of 149 mm ⁇ 210 mm with three different bulk mechanical properties. These were A5-1, polycarbonate skin on polycarbonate honeycomb; A5-2 carbon fibre on Rohacell; and A5-3, Rohacell without skin.
- Set ‘B’ was chosen to be eight times larger, approximately to A2 size of 420 mm ⁇ 592 mm.
- A2-1 was constructed with glass fibre skin on polycarbonate honeycomb core, whilst A2-2 was carbon fibre skin on aluminium honeycomb.
- Panels were mounted onto a back enclosure with adjustable depth using a soft polyurethane foam for suspension and acoustic seal.
- the enclosure depth was made adjustable on 16,28,40 and 53 mm for set ‘A’ and on 20,50,95 and 130 mm for set ‘B’ panels.
- Various measurements were carried out at different enclosure depths for every test case and result documented.
- Panel velocity and displacement were measured using a Laser Vibrometer.
- the frequency range of interest was covered with a linear frequency scale of 1600 points.
- the set-up shown in FIG. 16 was used to measure the panel mechanical impedance by calculating the ratio of the applied force to the panel velocity at the drive point.
- Z m F V
- the applied force was calculated from the lump parameter information of the exciter.
- FIGS. 18 a to f show the mechanical impedance of the A5-1 and A5-2 panels, derived from the measurement of panel velocity and the applied force measured by the Laser Vibrometer. Note that the impedance minima for each enclosure depth occur at the system resonance mode.
- a special jig was made to allow the measurement of the internal pressure of the enclosure at nine predetermined points as shown in FIG. 21 .
- the microphone was inserted in the holes provided within the back-plate of an A5 enclosure jig at a predetermined depth, while the other eight position holes were tightly blocked with hard rubber grommets.
- the microphone was mechanically isolated from the enclosure by an appropriate rubber grommet during the measurement.
- FIG. 25 a shows the log-velocity spectrum of a free radiating, A5-1 panel clamped in a frame, radiating in free space equally from both sides.
- the solid line represents the simulation curve and the dashed line is the measure velocity spectrum.
- the panel goes in resonance with the exciter.
- the discrepancy in the frequency range above 1000 Hz is due to the absence of the free field radiation impedance in the simulation model.
- FIG. 25 b shows the same panel as in FIG. 25 a but this time loaded with two identical enclosures, one on each side of the panel, with the same cross-section as the panel and a depth of 24 mm.
- a double enclosure was designed and used in order to exclude the radiation impedance of free field on one side of the panel and make the experiment independent of the free field radiation impedance. It is important to note that this laboratory set-up was used for theory verification only.
- FIG. 28 a shows where a band-stop passive filter has been incorporated for equalisation. Further examples may be seen in FIGS. 28 b and c that shows simple pole EQ as a capacitor used in series with the loudspeakers.
- an A2 size panel with 50 mm enclosure depth can be designed to have a bandwidth extending down to about 120 Hz, FIG. 24 .
- the directivity of the enclosed system changes substantially from a dipolar shape to a near cardioid behaviour as shown in FIG. 17 . It is envisaged that the directivity associated with a closed-back DML may find use in certain applications where stronger lateral coverage is desirable.
- Power response measurements were found to be most useful when working with the enclosed DM system, in order to observe the excessive energy region that may need compensation. This is in line with other work done on DM loudspeakers, in which it has been found that the power response is the most representative acoustic measurement correlating well to the subjective performance of a DML. Using the power response, it was found that in practice a simple band-pass or a single pole high-pass filter is all that is needed to equalise the power response in this region.
