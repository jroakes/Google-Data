Definitions
- Autonomous vehicles use various computing systems to aid in the transport of passengers from one location to another. Some autonomous vehicles may require some initial input or continuous input from an operator, such as a pilot, driver, or passenger. Other systems, for example autopilot systems, may be used only when the system has been engaged, which permits the operator to switch from a manual mode (where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle) to an autonomous mode (where the vehicle essentially drives itself) to modes that lie somewhere in between.
- a manual mode where the operator exercises a high degree of control over the movement of the vehicle
- autonomous mode where the vehicle essentially drives itself
- autonomous vehicles are equipped with various types of sensors in order to detect objects in the surroundings.
- autonomous vehicles may include lasers, sonar, radar, cameras, and other devices which scan and record data from the vehicle's surroundings. These devices in combination (and in some cases alone) may be used to build three dimensional or “3D” models of the objects detected in the vehicle's surrounding.

- FIG. 5 depicts vehicle 300 approaching an intersection.

- vehicle 300 is driving along a section of roadway collecting data about its surroundings using the laser.
- the vehicle appears as a “disturbance” in the shape of the laser lines 630 .
- the collected data may also include information about the vehicle's surroundings such as the location of a curb.
- Reference line 620 connects the distance and location readings 625 of the edge of the curb and is not part of the laser data.

- FIG. 6 includes distance and location readings 640 representing solid double yellow lane lines as well as distance and location readings 650 representing white lane lines.
- the laser may take multiple measurements of a single geographic area. For example, a small patch of the roadway may be measured several times as the vehicle approaches the patch, passes the patch, and moves away from the patch. Thus, from a single pass, the laser information may include many different (intensity and range) data points for the same location.
- This data may be transferred to another computer for further processing as described above or processed at the vehicle.
- the data points may be processed to generate a 3D map of the roadway from the intensity and range information.
- the map may include objects such as the roadway, lane lines, curbs, sidewalks, intersections, traffic signals, etc. as described above.
- This map may also include unwanted objects based on data points collected from other moving objects such as passing cars or trucks.
- the data point collected along the roadway may be used to reconstruct the roadway in three dimensions.
- curb 720 may be generated, based on the distance and locations readings 625 of the edge of the curb, is visible.
- the data points collected from the various locations of vehicle 610 may appear as a bright streak 730 in an intensity map.
- a 2D map grid may be generated. For example, all of the data points for a given area may be projected into cells of the grid.
- the cells may be of various sizes, for example, 12 cm by 12 cm or larger or smaller. In another example, the cells may vary slightly within the same grid.
- the cell sizes may vary by the geographic position of the vehicle and depending upon the map projection of the map or map product used by the vehicle.
- the map projection may be lined up pixel for pixel with the vehicle's projection into the cells of the 2D grid.
- the size of the grid pixels may vary with latitude (but not longitude). Thus, for example in the San Francisco Bay area, the size of the cells may be approximately 11-12 cm.
- Each cell may contain data points generated from different portions of the unwanted object as well as the roadway. For example, as the driver's side of vehicle 610 passes over the area of roadway corresponding to a particular cell, measurements may be collected for a range of different heights. For example, different sections of the vehicle may pass over cell 805 at different times (T 1 , T 2 , and T 3 ) as shown in FIG. 8A .
- the same cell may include a data point from the top of a headlight 811 at about 0.6 meters, the top of the roof 812 at about 1.45 meters, the driver and passenger doors 813 - 814 at between about 0.15 and 0.8 meters, etc. (all relative to the roadway 820 ).
- the same cell may also have several measurements of the elevation of the area of roadway. Accordingly a cell of 12 cm by 12 cm may have from 0 to several hundred or more data points depending upon the number of passes through the area, speed of the laser (and vehicle), etc.
- the data points for each cell may be evaluated to identify the data point associated with the lowest elevation. This data point may be assumed to be the closest to the actual roadway (the ground). Once this lowest elevation has been identified, all of the data points within the cell with an elevation greater than some threshold distance may be assumed to be associated with an unwanted object.
- the threshold distance may be based on the accuracy of the sensors. If the sensors are highly accurate, the threshold distance may be very small, such as a few centimeters, or nothing. If the sensors are less accurate, the threshold may be greater. This threshold may also be a fixed number for each cell, such as 15 cm, or may be determined for each individual cell, for example, by calculating a mean difference in elevation among all or some portion of the data points in a cell.
- each cell may include a set of data points. Any data points identified as being associated with an unwanted object may be removed from the set, or a new set may be generated which does not include the data points associated with an unwanted object.
- the result may be a plurality of data points which reflects the elevation of the roadway beneath the unwanted object.
- a particular cell may include at least 2 data points.
- the new map may no longer include bright streak 730 of FIG. 7 . If the processing is performed remotely, the map may be transmitted or transferred to the vehicle's computer and used as a tool to maneuver the autonomous vehicle as described above.
- Flow diagram 900 is an exemplary embodiment of some of the aspects described above.
- a computer receives sensor data collected by a laser.
- the sensor data includes data points describing the location and elevation of particular locations along a roadway.
- a 2D grid of the roadway is generated.
- the 2D grid includes a plurality of cells each representing an area of the roadway.
- the data points are sorted into the cells based on the location of the data points.
- the data point associated with the lowest elevation is identified.
- any data points with an elevation above some threshold above the lowest elevation of the particular cell are removed.
- a 3D map of the roadway is generated based on the remaining data points.
- the map may be transmitted or otherwise sent to an autonomous vehicle to be used to navigate the vehicle along the roadway.
