Definitions
- This invention relates generally to speech coding, including but not limited to preparation of excitation source gain information for transmission, and receiving such information.
- Radio frequency channels are, at least at the present time, limited in quantity. Notwithstanding this limitation, communication needs continue to rapidly increase. Dispatch, selective call, and cellular communications, to name a few, are all being utilized by an increasing number of users. Without appropriate technological advances, many users will face either impaired service or possibly a complete lack of available service.
- CELP Code Excited Linear Prediction
- VSELP Vector Sum Excited Linear Prediction
- CELP type speech coders derive an excitation signal by summing a long term prediction vector with one or more codebook vectors, with each vector being scaled by an appropriate gain prior to summing.
- a linear predictive filter receives the resultant excitation vector and introduces spectral shaping to produce a resultant synthetic speech.
- the synthetic speech provided by such a speech coder will realistically mimic the original voice message.
- the excitation vectors are scaled by an appropriate gain prior to summing. These gains are typically originally calculated at the time of coding the speech, and are then transmitted to the receiver that will synthesize the speech as described above.
- Various methods of gain quantization prior to such transmission are used in the art, including scalar quantization and vector quantization (the latter being more efficient).
- the bits used to code this gain information are sensitive to bit errors. If the gain values are decoded incorrectly due to channel errors, the error, in addition to detrimentally affecting the current subframe's excitation, will propagate forward in time as well since the corrupted excitation vector will also be fed into the long term prediction state for later use in developing subsequent long term prediction vectors.
- VSELP Vector Sum Excited Linear Prediction
- a method for providing information such as gain information, by first providing a plurality of coding modes for speech coding input speech samples, wherein at least two of the coding modes correspond to at least substantially voiced input speech signals, and by then selecting one of the coding modes as a function, at least in part, of periodicity of the input speech signal.
- this method utilizes pitch related information as corresponds to an input speech signal for a plurality of coding subframes. Based upon this information, error information is developed on a subframe by subframe basis, which error information reflects the periodicity of the input speech signal. Based upon this periodicity, one of the coding modes is then selected and subsequently utilized to provide coding of gain quantization for the excitation sources.
- At least one of the coding modes may correspond to a primarily unvoiced input speech signal.
- a plurality of excitation sources can be provided, which excitation sources can include both VSELP excitation codebooks and at least one excitation source that represents pitch related information. Selection of these excitation sources for use in synthesizing speech for a particular frame can be directed by a coding mode indicator, which coding mode indicator is developed in the same manner as set forth above.

- a radio transmitter having speech coding capabilities in accordance with this invention can be seen in FIG. 1 as generally depicted by reference numeral 100.
- a microphone (101) receives an acoustically transmitted speech signal input.
- An analog to digital convertor (102) receives an electrically transduced analog version of this input signal and renders a digital representation thereof at an output.
- a digital signal processor (103) such as a DSP 56000 family device (as manufactured and sold by Motorola, Inc.) receives this digitized representation and performs a variety of functions, including coding of the speech information and framing of this coded information in preparation for transmission.
- a memory (104) couples to the digital signal processor (103), and retains various elements of information utilized by the digital signal processor (103) when performing the above noted functions.
- the output of the digital signal processor (103) couples to a transmitter (105), which utilizes the framed speech coding information as a modulation signal for a radio frequency carrier signal (107) that radiates from an antenna (106).
- FIG. 2 a block diagram depicts a VSELP speech synthesis platform (200).
- VSELP speech synthesis platform 200.
- the block diagram depicted is representative of the functioning of the digital signal processor (103), and that the particular functions and signal routing depicted are accomplished through appropriate programming of the digital signal processor itself, all in accordance with well understood prior art technique.
- a synthesis filter such as a linear predictive filter, spectrally shapes an input excitation signal.
- This excitation signal typically comprises the sum (221) of two or more excitation sources.
- Typical prior art platforms will provide a long term prediction state and one or two other codebooks. In this particular embodiment, one long term prediction state (201) and three VSELP codebooks (203-205) are provided, though only two of the above are typically used at any given moment.
- the long term prediction state (201) receives lag information (202), while the VSELP codebooks (203-205) receive an input (206-208) that designates particular codebook entries.
- the resultant excitation signals are then scaled (211-214) by gain factors (216-219).
- the gain factors (216-219) are determined during the initial voice coding process, and provided to the speech synthesizing platform depicted here, along with other relevant speech coding information, such as the lag information (202) and synthesis filter (222) settings. (More will be said regarding these gains (216-219) below, as this invention is particularly concerned with providing this gain information in a manner that is particularly sparing of coding requirements, supports good speech quality, and is relatively robust during channel traversal.)
- the resultant scaled excitation signals are then summed and provided to the synthesis filter (222) as an excitation source.
- the resultant excitation signal feeds back to the long term prediction state (201) to update the state.
- an error in gain (216-219) will not only result in an immediately distorted synthesized speech output, but will also propagate forward in time, since the long term prediction state (201) will be basing subsequent excitation signal production on the corrupted excitation signal as well.
- an illustrative input speech signal (301) can be seen as parsed into a plurality of segments, each segment representing a predetermined period of time, such as 5 ms.
- each subframe represents a segment of the original speech information (301).
- subframe A represents the segment denoted by reference numeral 304.
- each subframe also includes a lag parameter, which lag parameter may be any of a plurality of discrete levels.
- lag parameter may be any of a plurality of discrete levels.
- subframe A has a lag parameter value as denoted by reference numeral 303.
- This lag value (303) represents a period of time (306) prior to the subframe A segment (304) where the long term prediction state (201) can locate an earlier processed segment (307) that substantially conforms to the information contained in the current segment (304).
- Speech, and particularly voiced speech tends towards periodicity. This being the case, significant coding benefits are attained by sending such lag information each subframe, since typically a similar pitch representation can be found in recent history that will serve the needs of the speech synthesizer.
- lag information for the above described purpose, and the manner of selecting such lag information, is generally understood in the art. What is particularly important here, however, is that the lag information as initially calculated in the transmitting speech coder also functions, when viewed appropriately, to reflect periodicity of the input signal (periodicity in turn typically reflecting the degree of voicing in the speech sample itself). In particular, when selecting the lag values for each subframe, the speech coder can readily determine an error value representing how well (or how poorly) the selected lag value identifies a recent history sample that correlates well with the present sample. When only small errors are found, a high degree of periodicity is apparent.
- a gain coding mode then be selected (402) as described below, following which the lag adjustment process pursuant to the closed-loop process can continue (403) for all subframes. Following this (and following completion of determining all other speech coding information), the gain and mode information can then be framed along with other speech coding information (404), as also described below in more detail.
- this coding mode selection process (402) first provides for a plurality of coding modes (501). Although any desired number of coding modes can be provided, in the present embodiment, the applicants have selected four (these coding modes will be described in more detail below). Generally speaking, the process then receives information reflecting the periodicity of the speech signal (502), and selects one of the coding modes based on this periodicity (503). Effectively, this method achieves its goal of reducing the number of bits used for quantizing excitation source gain information, decreasing the sensitivity of the gain bits to channel errors, and maintaining good speech quality by essentially classifying a speech frame (using the degree of voicing as the criterion), and utilizing a particular gain quantizer for each class.
- FIG. 7A represents coding mode 1
- FIG. 7B represents coding mode 2
- FIG. 7C represents coding mode 3
- FIG. 7D represents coding mode 4.
- Coding mode 1 (FIG. 7A) is appropriate for use in representing the gain information of primarily unvoiced speech.
- coding mode 4 represents gain quantization coding appropriate for use with primarily voiced speech.
- Coding modes 3 and 2 are for use with progressively less voiced speech, respectively.
- each graph depicted in (FIGS. 7B-D) represents that part of total excitation that is due to the long term prediction state component.
- the horizontal axis for all of the graphs depicted represents a scaling factor to allow adjustment of an average frame energy value for each subframe (which average frame energy value is sent at the frame rate).
- the vertical axis represents that portion of excitation which is due to a particular pre-identified VSELP codebook.
- Each coding mode provides 32 index points (with only a few of these 32 index points being depicted here for purposes of clarity). Each index point corresponds to a related horizontal axis and vertical axis value. By selecting one of the index points, and representing this index point as a 5 bit expression, a gain quantized value is thereby available for inclusion in the relevant subframe.
- the receiver can reverse the process to determine the particular gain values to be applied to the excitation source signals. (The precise manner in which the relevant gain information can be extracted at the receiver is described in detail in copending U.S. Ser. No. 422,927, filed Oct.
- this 5 bit field in each subframe will represent a first set of quantized gain values when decoded with respect to, for example, coding mode 2 (FIG. 7B), and will represent a different set of quantized gain values when compared to the values that will result when decoded with respect to, for example, coding mode 4 (FIG. 7D). Consequently, fewer bits are required to ultimately represent a wide variety of gain quantized values, since these same 32 indexes can each represent any of four specific gain quantized values by referring to a particular coding mode. The latter result constitutes an important benefit of this embodiment.
- the process next receives error information regarding the coding of pitch information on a subframe by subframe basis (601). More particularly, let x(n) be the spectrally weighted input speech, blocked into subframes that each consist of N samples. M subframes constitute a frame (here, there are four subframes per frame, though of course this value can vary as desired).
- each subframe has associated with it a long term predictor lag value L i where i is an index to the subframe within the frame. L i is the delay, in samples, which for voiced speech typically corresponds to the pitch period or a multiple of the pitch period, as discussed generally above with respect to FIG. 3.
- the open-loop long term prediction gain at the ith subframe may be calculated.
- the optimal error energy at the ith subframe E i is defined as: ##EQU1## E i is a function of x, i, L i , and ⁇ i .
- ⁇ i is the optimal first order long term prediction coefficient for the ith subframe, and is computed by setting the partial derivative E i with respect to ⁇ i equal to zero in solving the resulting equation.
- ⁇ i is given explicitly by: ##EQU3##
- e i (n) is the error sequence left after optimal first order prediction of the sequence x(n+(i-1)N) by the sequence x(n+(i-1)N-L i ).
- S i to be the input signal energy at the ith subframe: ##EQU4##
- This ratio may be expressed in dB as the open-loop long term prediction gain for the ith subframe, as given by this equation: ##EQU5##
- the open-loop prediction gain for the frame may be expressed as: ##EQU6## Therefore, the following values are available: P i for each subframe (these being the subframe open-loop long term predictor prediction gains) and P f (this being the frame open-loop long term predictor prediction gain), all as expressed in dB.
- the P i values indicate the degree of periodicity at each subframe, while P f indicates the degree of periodicity present in the entire frame.
- the higher the dB prediction gain the more periodic the signal. For example, a strongly voiced (quasi-periodic) subframe of sampled speech might yield a P i greater than 10 dB. A frame that is not voiced is likely to have a P f less than 2 dB.
- coding mode 3 is selected (608).
- P f is greater than or equal to 2 dB and any of P i is less than 4 dB, thereby indicating a mixed voicing mode
- the mode and gain information is then framed (610) and the process concluded (611).
- the gain quantized information is represented by 5 bits (802) per subframe (801) as specified earlier.
- 5 bits are utilized per frame to represent an average energy value for the entire frame.
- 2 bits are utilized per frame (800) to represent which of the four coding modes has been selected for use with the present frame. These bits, representing average energy and coding mode, are positioned in a header (803).
- the above developed gain quantized information, along with other speech coding parameters, is then further encoded and transmitted by the transmitter (105) described earlier in FIG. 1.
- an antenna (901) receives the transmitted signal (107) and a coupled radio receiver (902) demodulates the signal to recover the coding information.
- a digital signal processor (903) which includes an appropriate speech synthesis platform (as described above in FIG. 2), utilizes this coding information to synthesize a digitized representation of the original speech information.
- a digital to analog convertor (905) converts this digitized representation into analog form, which a power amplifier (906) then amplifies and a speaker (907) renders audible.
- a memory (904) can be utilized to store programming information and other data utilized by the digital signal processor (903) to effectuate the synthesis process.
- the platform described in FIG. 9 functions, as indicated, to receive the speech coded signal (1001) and to extract the speech coding information on a frame by frame basis (1002).
- the receiver can determine the coding mode (1003) and thereafter interpret the excitation gain information using the appropriate coding mode (1004). For example, if the coding mode indicated coding mode 3, and the excitation gain value represented index 22, the receiver would apply that index value to the information contained in the mode 3 information as described earlier to thereby determine the appropriate gain values to be utilized for the excitation sources.
- VSELP codebooks (203-205) are provided, in addition to the long term prediction state (201).
- the voice information constitutes a primarily unvoiced signal. Consequently, it may, in some applications, be advantageous to disable the long term prediction state (201) during a coding mode 1 frame, and reallocate the bits which would have been used by the long term prediction state (201) for an additional excitation codebook. For example, with reference to FIG.
- mode 1 in mode 1, the receiver could know, by prearrangement, to utilize VSELP codebooks 2 and 3 (204 and 205) to best accommodate a primarily unvoiced message, whereas modes 2-4 could indicate the use of the long term prediction state (201) and VSELP codebook 1 (203) excitation sources to better accommodate speech information containing at least a reasonable amount of voicing. Therefore, refering again to FIG. 10, the coding mode can also be used to indicate selection of particular excitation sources (1005).
- voicing classification is based on the open-loop prediction gain computed from the input speech, this does not preclude a closed-loop search of the long term prediction codebook at each subframe.
- the use of multiple coding modes reduces the number of bits required to represent an adequate variety of quantized gain values. Speech quality is maintained because an adequate quantity of gain quantizers are in fact provided. And lastly, the gain quantizer sensitivity to bit errors has been reduced, because if the bits specifying the voicing class are received correctly, errors in subframe gain bits result in a selection of a gain vector that still remains at least representative of its voicing class. In essence, the subframe gain bits are made less sensitive to bit errors, while the coding mode bits, introduced to specify the frame voicing mode, are more sensitive. This sensitivity trade-off works well because the subframe gain bits significantly outnumber the frame voicing mode bits by 10 to 1 in the described embodiment. Therefore, the voicing bits may be efficiently protected without unduly increasing the total number of bits required to represent the information.
