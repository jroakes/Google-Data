Associated ACL can determine the access authority for attempting to access that the user of electrical form.
Cloud computing service can provide a user a variety of function for creating, manipulating and showing the data on electrical form
Energy.One such function is known as filtering.Filtering may include according to one or more criterion (for example, alphabet sequence or pressing
Number) it sorts the data, and may include and hide certain data values, row or column from display.Filter can be stored as several
According to transformation model, Regression Transformation Models map before showing it or the bottom data of conversion electron table is (for example, for display
Cell data are assigned to the transformation of new cell by purpose on the screen).Fig. 5, which is shown, to be stored on cloud computing service
The example of the filter menu of the worksheet 500 of cooperation electrical form.Worksheet 500 includes column heading, and column heading includes " age "
" score ".When user opens filter option, each column can show dropdown arrow 504.When user selects dropdown arrow,
It can show the filter menu 502 for the column.For example, when selection is used for the filter dropdown arrow of " age " column, mistake
Filter menu 502 occurs, and gives the user for using the number for carrying out filtration table 502 to the criterion of " age " column application
According to several modes.Filter menu 502 includes the sequence function that it can be ranked up by row of the particular order to worksheet 502
Energy 506.For example, can be arranged according to the number in " age " column row 1-6 if user's selection " sorting from small to large "
Sequence, so that the row with the minimum value age occurs first, and the row with the greatest measure age finally occurs.Filter dish
Single 502, which also allow the user to use data check box 512, carrys out hiding data.Data check box 512 shows all in " age " column
The data value of record.When data value is unselected, any row comprising the data value is hidden from the display of worksheet 500.
Filter menu 502 can be provided for selecting all data values or remove from data check box 512 to all data values

Filtering can not also be only applied to arrange, but be applied to capable or cell selection.User highlights user and wants filtering
Cell, row or column, and then call filter function.Filter menu 502 may include unshowned other numbers in Fig. 5
According to sequence and filtering option.
The example through filtering worksheet in cooperation electrical form is shown in Fig. 6.For example, the worksheet 400 of Fig. 4 is considered as
Non- filtration table.Filter menu of user's selection for " age " column, and the age is ranked up from small to large, and
The data check box of non-selected data value " 18 ".This filter will arrange the row of worksheet 400 according to the age, and hide it
Middle age value is 18 any row.Worksheet 600 in Fig. 6 shows the knot to this filter of non-filtration table 400 application
Fruit.As can be seen, the row of worksheet 600 be arranged as so that the smallest age up front, and the maximum age exists
Finally.In addition, because age value associated with name " Tyrone " is 18, the entire row of " Tyrone " entry is from worksheet 600
It is hidden in display.By omitting the row number of the hidden rows in linage-counter, worksheet 600 can indicate that row is filtered
Device is hidden.For example, there is no row " 5 " in Fig. 6.By selecting the filter dropdown arrow of the column, user can edit or cancel
Filter on " age " column.User can also create another filter using filter dropdown arrow appropriate.
In general, when editing the user of the cooperation electrical form stored on cloud computing service to worksheet application filter,
Filter be transferred to cloud computing service and its also in any other teamworker for checking worksheet.To at any one
Worksheet can be applied to by carving only one filter, and multiple teamworkers cannot apply filter independently of one another.Such as
The multiple teamworkers of fruit wish to filter overlapped data collection in different ways, then this may be problematic, because worksheet will be only aobvious
Show newest filter.It saves multiple filters in addition, cloud computing service can not provide a user and allows multiple teamworkers only
The ability of these filters saved of habitat location.
The system and method for the application provide independently to teamworker to the worksheet application filter of cooperation electrical form
Ability.For each worksheet in cooperation electrical form, cloud computing service stores multiple mistakes associated with the worksheet
Filter.When the user on client computer accesses the worksheet of cooperation electrical form, cloud computing service is calculated to client
Machine provides the local replica of worksheet and the copy of multiple filters associated with the worksheet.Access cooperation electrical form
Other teamworkers also receive the local replica of worksheet and filter.When user selects filter to be applied to worksheet,
Filter converts the data on the local replica of worksheet, and shows to user through filtering worksheet.Unlike normal variant, use
Family will not be communicated to other teamworkers to the selection of filter.To which filter will not be automatically applied to teamworker's client meter
Worksheet shown by calculation machine.Each teamworker can independently be stored on cloud computing service cooperation electrical form it is same
Worksheet applies different filters.User can be communicated to cloud computing service to the selection of filter, or can be basic
It does not convey.

Lattice.UI 700 includes for the sidebar window 702 to worksheet application filter.Sidebar window 702, which is shown, can be applied to work
Make the filter list of table.For example, filter 704 is " no filter " option, when selected, moved from the display of worksheet
Except all filters.Being named as the filter 706 " more than 20 " may be implemented the filter described about Fig. 6, i.e. " age " column
It sorts from small to large and any age value equal to 18 is removed from display.Another filter 710 is named as " filter 2 ".
Each filter can have its drop-down menu 708 that can be selected.Drop-down menu 708 includes for replica filter, again
Name filter deletes filter or makes filter order of the selected filter as default filter.Filter 704,
706 or 708 can mark the symbol of asterisk etc, to indicate which filter is default filter.For positive work
The current filter for making table application can be highlighted or overstriking, to indicate which filter is active.There is also for creating
The filter order 712 of new filter.Selection filter order 712 can be generated similar to filter menu 502 shown in fig. 5
Filter editor, allow user to define filter.User can create filter without saving filter, or
Filter can be saved and name, filter will be added to filter list shown in sidebar window 702 in this case.
Sidebar window 702 may include unshowned other filter orders in Fig. 7.For example, drop-down menu 708 can have for making
Filter is privately owned or common option.If keeping filter privately owned, filter can be used without other teamworkers.UI 700 is also
Independent ranking function independently of filter function can be provided.When user uses the ranking function pair opposite with filter function
When worksheet data is ranked up, it can be considered as making a variation.To sequentialize commands be sent to cloud computing service and other
Teamworker shows their data to be automatically updated.If user arranges worksheet data using filter function
Sequence, order are not sent to other teamworkers.In any option, when the cell value influenced by ranking criteria changes, work
The display for making table can be automatically updated to reflect new sequence.
When user is from menu selection filter option on UI 700, sidebar window 702 can occur, or work as user
Sidebar window 702 can be called when editing filter.Filter, sidebar window are enlivened simply by the presence of applied to worksheet

In figure hide also be to maintain it is visible.Filter model can also include the list for excluding data, check box 512 in tracing figure 5
User selection.Filter model can also include the mark of the user of its creation or last modification filter.Unlisted its
Its information may also be included in that in filter model.Each associated data structure of filter, and when load association
When making the worksheet of electrical form, this data structure is sent to client computer from cloud computing service.To filter
Editor changes data structure, and is communicated to cloud computing service and other teamworkers.
The user action inputted to sidebar window 702 can be communicated to cloud computing service.For example, if user creation or
Duplication is used for the new filter of worksheet, and client computer can create filter model and send it to cloud computing clothes
Business is to be stored as filter associated with worksheet.If user deletes filter associated with worksheet, client meter
Calculation machine can send request to cloud computing service to delete the correspondence primary copy of filter.If user edits or renames filtering
Device, client computer changes the filter model of its storage, and sends cloud computing clothes for compiled filter model
Business, then cloud computing service will update the primary copy of filter model.If filter is set default filter by user,
Client computer can send request to cloud computing service to set default filter for the primary copy of the filter.Then
The copy of non-filtration table will be received from any teamworker of cloud computing service access worksheet, and defaulting filter will be certainly
Dynamic application.If user carries out write access (for example, pass through ACL determine) electrical form, user can be created, Bian Jihuo
Delete filter.If user carries out read access to electrical form, cloud computing service can permit user using filter, but
It is that may not allow user's creation, editor or delete filter.User is to the creation of filter, editor or deletes and can be sent
To other teamworkers of cloud computing service and current accessed electrical form.So while rearranging data not using filter
It can be communicated to teamworker, but teamworker is communicated to the change of filter itself.
It, can reference unit lattice --- reference in two ways when to the worksheet application filter of cooperation electrical form
Non- filtration table or through filter worksheet.For example, working as ginseng in the case where application " more than 20 " filter in UI 700
When examining through filtering worksheet, name entries " Ni Ke " are appeared in cell A4.However, when referring to non-filterer shown in Fig. 4
When making table, name " Ni Ke " is actually in cell A2.Filter is considered the cell in non-filtration table
Mapping or transformation between the cell through filtering worksheet.Process is generated and to non-filtration table application filter
Worksheet is filtered, and is shown through filtering worksheet by client computer.When editor or variation of user's input to worksheet,
Variation can refer to the cell of non-filtration table or can refer to the cell through filtering worksheet.In addition, user is in
Existing information can be sent to other teamworkers.For example, if user highlights cell A1-A5, teamworker's client
User interface on computer can show that user has been highlighted those cells.Information is presented in variation and user can be with
It is referred to as user action.Fig. 8 shows the system for handling the user action for being directed to cooperation electrical form, wherein with reference to not filtering
Worksheet makes user's input.System 800 includes the cloud computing service 802 of the primary copy of storage cooperation electrical form 804.Cooperation
Electrical form 804 may include one or more worksheets, and each worksheet can be related to one or more filters
Connection.Two client computers 806 and 812 are connected to cloud computing service 802 to access the electrical form 804 that cooperates.As each visitor
When family end computer access cooperation electrical form, the local replica of cooperation electrical form 804 is loaded into each client and calculates
On machine, it is shown as local replica 810 and 816.Local replica includes the copy of at least one worksheet and associated for the work
Make the filter of table.
Local replica 810 application of the user to its electrical form that cooperates on client computer 806 is named as " filter
1 " filter 808.Filter converts the cell of non-filtration table, and rearrangement unit lattice to user to show.
Similarly, user's selection on client computer 812 is shown as " filter 2 " of filter transformation 814 to be applied to its cooperation
The local replica 816 of electrical form.Each client computer will not be communicated to other client meters to the selection of filter
Calculation machine, and so that each user not will receive the influence of other users to the selection of filter.806 He of client computer
812, which can send filter to cloud computing service 802, selects information.User on client computer is to 810 He of local replica
816 take user action.It is with reference to non-filtration table or through filtering worksheet, by client computer according to user action
User action is handled with cloud computing service 802.
Fig. 8 is shown when user action is with reference to non-filtration table through filtering showing for the user action processing of electrical form
Example.In this case, what the local replica 810 and 816 stored on client computer always stored worksheet does not filter pair
This, any filter 808 or 814 that may be applied to worksheet but regardless of user.User initiates it and refers to non-filtration table
Cell user action 818.Only when showing worksheet to user, filter 808 and 814 is applied to not filter local
Copy 810 and 816.For example, it is assumed that filter is by the data permutation in the cell A1 of worksheet to cell D5.When with
When the filter is applied to worksheet in family, the bottom that filter will not change the worksheet stored on client computer is local secondary
This.More precisely, client computer never filter local replica calculate worksheet through filtering version, and show process
Filter worksheet.This is stored in temporary storage through filtering worksheet, and whenever showing that the worksheet on screen refreshes,
It can be recalculated.To which although client computer screen shows data in cell D5, the local pair of worksheet
Originally it stores data in cell A1.When user inputs user action, reference work table does not filter local replica quilt
Storage.For example, client computer is actually when user edits the content as the cell D5 in display that user sees
The cell A1 to make a variation in its local replica, rather than cell D5.Only when the display of worksheet then refreshes, client is calculated
Variation of the machine into local replica application filter and Cell display D5.Because storage user is dynamic with reference to non-filtration table
Make, user action can be sent straight to cloud computing service and teamworker's client computer, without any transformation.Cloud meter
User action is recorded in the primary copy of its worksheet by the service of calculation, and sends current accessed worksheet for user action
Every other teamworker.At teamworker's client computer, what user action was applied to store on the client computer
Local replica is not filtered.If teamworker is to local replica application filter, in the screen of teamworker's client computer
Before showing on curtain, user action is converted by filter.Teamworker's client is calculated for example, teamworker can receive
The variation of the cell A1 of local replica on machine and updating unit lattice A1.If teamworker uses the number in cell A1
According to the filter for transforming to cell B3, variation carries out the cell in transformation and teamworker's computer screen by filter
B3 is updated.
Cooperation electrical form can have the computing engines of its computing unit lattice value.This engine shows work with to user
The UI engine of table is discrete.It when user action is with reference to non-filtration table, calculates and formula is affected, and and if only if display
When, filtration table.It calculates and the number found in the one or more cells rearranged by filter can be used in formula
According to.It when formula or calculates when it is displayed on the screen, it can refer to the cell of non-filtration table, and worksheet itself is
It is rearranged.This may be chaotic for user checks.In order to solve this problem, filter can also be applied
It is referred in calculating with the cell in formula.To which when calculating and formula is displayed on the screen, they are with reference to through filtration
The cell of table, and the cell of the practical calculating stored in memory or the non-filtration table of formula reference.Client calculates
Machine can also limit the ability that user creates new formula.For example, if user highlight will be in worksheet used in formula
Through the sequential cells lattice collection in filtered view, cell collection may not be continuous actually in unfiltered view.Client
End computer can not allow such movement.
In alternative design, user action can be with reference to the cell through filtering worksheet on client computer.Fig. 9
The example to the variation processing through filtering electrical form when user action is referred to through filtering worksheet is shown.System 900 is wrapped
Include the cloud computing service 902 of the primary copy of storage cooperation electrical form 904.The electrical form 904 that cooperates may include one or more
A worksheet, and each worksheet can be associated with one or more filters.Two client computers 906 and 912
Cloud computing service 902 is connected to access the electrical form 904 that cooperates.When each client computer accesses cooperation electrical form
When, the local replica of cooperation electrical form 904 is loaded on each client computer, is shown as local replica 910 and 916.
Local replica includes the copy and the associated filter for the worksheet of at least one worksheet.Client computer
User on 906 applies " filter 1 " to the local replica 910 of its electrical form that cooperates.Similarly, client computer 912
On user to its cooperate electrical form local replica 916 apply " filter 2 ".
In Fig. 9,910 He of local replica that is stored when selecting user or changes filter, on client computer
916 are updated.To which unlike the case where Fig. 8, filter changes the local replica of worksheet, and the local replica is then straight
It connects to user and shows.To 918 cell of the reference through filtering worksheet of user's variation of worksheet.It is calculated to work as by client
When machine receives user action, user action is applied to being filtered local replica and directly being shown to user for worksheet.So
And before user action is sent to cloud computing service, user action is converted by the inverse of filter, so that user is dynamic
Make to refer to non-filtration table.When the user on client computer 906 is to worksheet application filter 1, client is calculated
Machine 906 determines and stores the inverse of " filter 1 " 908, and the cell through filtering worksheet is mapped to non-filtration table
Cell.Similarly, client computer 912 determines and stores the inverse of " filter 2 " 914.For example, user's variation refers to client
The cell D5 through filtering local replica stored on the computer of end, wherein the data in cell D5 correspond to non-filtration
Data in the cell A1 of table.Before variation is sent to cloud computing service, inverse according to filter makes a variation to convert, and makes
Obtain transformed variation reference unit lattice A1.This user action is sent to cloud computing service to be recorded in the non-mistake of worksheet
It filters in primary copy.Cloud computing service also sends user action to other teamworkers of current accessed worksheet.In teamworker visitor
At the computer of family end, user action is converted by any filter used by teamworker, and is then saved as this
Local replica on client computer.For example, if teamworker transforms to cell B3 using by the data in cell A1
Filter, then variation passes through the sheet of the worksheet that filter is converted and is stored on teamworker's client computer
In the cell B3 of ground copy.Formula and calculating can also be converted in a manner of identical with user action, therefore cell
There is logical meaning with reference to for each teamworker.
In another alternative design, client calculate service can track each teamworker currently using filter.
In Fig. 9, the local replica of worksheet can be changed by filter, and user action is referred to and deposited through filtering worksheet
Storage.User action can be sent directly to cloud computing service by client computer, and cloud computing service executes inverse filter and converts
To obtain the user action with reference to non-filtration table.Cloud computing service can also send teamworker client for user action
Before holding computer, user action is converted by the filter used by teamworker.Thus with situation described in Fig. 9
In contrast, the calculating of filter transformation and inverse transformation is completed in cloud computing service rather than on client computer.Pass through tracking
Which filter teamworker is just using, and cloud computing service can also allow for some mutual filters of teamworker's mirror image, and allow
Filter is used independently in other teamworkers.For example, user A is to filter if user A and user B selects mirror images of each other
Any application the worksheet view of user B is automatically updated.Another user C selection independently works, and so user C
Worksheet view not will receive the influence of selection of the user A to filter.
