- the system 200 can generate and display price information in the form of the prices 202 in the calendar 206 .
- Each displayed price 202 can be provided adjacent to a calendar date in respective calendar months 206 a and 206 b .
- a day 230 is “5”
- a corresponding price 202 a is $727.
- the displayed months e.g., November and December
- controls 232 can be used to cycle among months, e.g., advancing forward or backward while displaying two months at a time. In some implementations, other ways for displaying and cycling through the months are possible, and a different number of months other than two can be presented. In some implementations, other information, such as best value prices, described below, can be provided in the calendar 206 , and also represented in the graph 208 , e.g., using different colors or other presentation techniques. Each day in the calendar 206 can display one or more prices. In some implementations, price information provided in the calendar 206 can represent total travel costs, such as including attending fees (e.g., bag fees for airlines, or resort fees for hotels, fuel surcharges for various carriers, or site-specific fees).
- attending fees e.g., bag fees for airlines, or resort fees for hotels, fuel surcharges for various carriers, or site-specific fees.
- the user 204 has initially specified November 23 as a start date. This date can be confirmed by the user, but at this point the price information that is generated assumes a measure of flexibility in the user and as such calculates price data for various configurations of travel that are not specifically tied to this date.
- the user interface 210 has placed a box around an entry 234 (e.g., for November 23) in the calendar 206 .
- the entry 234 can include, for example, the calendar day (e.g., 23), and beneath that is displayed the price 202 (e.g., $309).
- a box surrounds an entry 236 in the calendar 206 , the date of which corresponds to the date (e.g., December 5) specified in the date control 226 .
- the price in the entry 234 can represent the lowest price determined from plural service providers (e.g., airline carriers) for a trip leaving Boston on November 23 and arriving in San Francisco on a day that is in a predetermined window, e.g., a trip having a length of 15 days (e.g., November 23 to December 6), plus or minus a delta (e.g., two days) relative to December 6.
- the price of $309 is the lowest price for flights leaving that day for trips of 13-17 days, and following the parameters specified in the controls and fields 214 .
- Saturday 235 e.g., November 30, the cheapest flight leaving that day and having a trip length of 15 plus or minus two days is $599.
- user selection of one of the entries in the calendar 206 can result in an updated display that provides updated price information relative to the selected day.
- the graph 208 includes graph elements (e.g., bars), each of which can correspond to (and have a height associated with) a price 202 on a given day.
- elements 238 a correspond one-to-one to days in November
- elements 238 b correspond one-to-one to days in December.
- month separators 240 shown in FIG. 2B with dotted lines, can be used to separate graph 208 entries by month.
- Month labels 242 can indicate the names of the months for which entries between month separators 240 correspond.
- low and high price labels 244 e.g., $170 and $821, respectively
- hovering over a bar in the graph 208 can cause the corresponding entry in the calendar 206 to be highlighted, and clicking on a bar in the graph 208 can cause the corresponding entry in the calendar 206 to be selected.
- the graph 208 can generally contain at least the entries corresponding to all of the displayed entries in the calendar 206 .
- the graph 208 can also display other data (e.g., outside the date range shown in the calendar). In this way, the user 204 can be presented with additional price information not contained in the present view of the calendar 206 .
- Other ways of presenting graph information are possible, including using multiple colors, shading and other ways of differentiating values in the graph. Referring again to FIG. 2A , prices 202 and the presentation of the calendar 206 and the graph 208 can be determined, for example, in the following stages.
- the user interface engine 121 can receive an indication of initial travel preferences of the user 204 for a trip (e.g., an airline trip) including a starting location, a starting travel date, a destination, and an arrival date.
- a length of time from the starting travel date to the arrival date can constitute a proposed trip length.
- the user interface engine 121 can receive the user travel preferences 250 from the user interface 210 .
- the user 204 can specify Boston as the starting location using the starting point control 222 , and specify November 23 as the starting travel date in the departure date control 226 .
- the user can also specify San Francisco as the destination using the destination control 224 , and specify December 6 as the arrival date in the arrival date control 228 .
- the pricing engine 223 can calculate a length of time of 15 days, e.g., the number of days from November 23 to December 6. Other ways of specifying travel preferences can be used.
- the user interface engine 121 can present at least two months in a calendar, including at least a month associated with the starting travel date. As an example, the user interface engine 121 can identify the months November and December as the months associated with the user's input in the user interface 210 . The user interface engine 121 can provide the two months 252 to the user interface 210 , e.g., for display in the calendar 206 (e.g., as prices 202 ).
- the pricing engine 122 can determine initial pricing information including a price for one or more days from the starting travel date, where each price is associated with a cost of originating travel on a respective day for the trip. Determining the price can include, for example, determining a lowest price of a ticket to travel on a trip starting on the respective day that lasts a projected number of days, wherein the projected number of days is the proposed trip length plus or minus a predetermined number of days. For example, the pricing engine 122 can determine the prices 254 as described above for prices 202 with respect to FIG. 2B .
- each of the prices 202 can be a lowest price for a given day for all trips of a projected number of days (e.g., 13-17) that is determined from the proposed trip length (e.g., 15 days), plus or minus a delta number of days (e.g., two days).
- a projected number of days e.g. 13-17
- the proposed trip length e.g. 15 days

- the user interface engine 121 can present the lowest price for each day in a graph in the first user interface.
- the graph includes one axis that represents price and one axis that represents days.
- the user interface engine 121 can provide the lowest prices for the graph 208 , e.g., for determining the heights of the bars in the graph 208 .
- the left (y) axis in the graph 208 can be labeled with low and high price labels 244
- the bottom (x axis) of the graph 208 can represent the days in the calendar 206 .
- FIG. 2C provides a detailed example of the user interface 210 that is updated after selection of a particular starting travel date. For example, if the user 204 selects a particular date (e.g., November 20), the graph 208 can be updated with new price information including the prices 202 shown in FIG. 2C . In another example, the same result can occur if the user 204 selects (e.g., clicks on) the graph element in the graph 208 that corresponds to the November 20 entry in the calendar 206 . Other ways at arriving at the updated calendar 206 and prices 202 are possible, including, for example, manual entry of a date or selection of a date from a list.
- a particular date e.g., November 20
- the graph 208 can be updated with new price information including the prices 202 shown in FIG. 2C .
- the same result can occur if the user 204 selects (e.g., clicks on) the graph element in the graph 208 that corresponds to the November 20 entry in the calendar 206 .
- Changes in the calendar 206 can include changes to the prices 202 .
- the values of the prices can change, as they now represent the lowest price of returning on the trip on that day, given the selection of the particular starting travel date (e.g., November 20).
- the graph 208 can also be updated, e.g., with graph elements having new heights that represent the corresponding updated prices 202 in the calendar 206 .
- fewer total graph elements can exist, e.g., in elements 238 a , as dates before November 20 have been eliminated.
- selection of an ending date or some other input on the calendar 206 , the graph 208 , or elsewhere in the user interface 210 can result in the dismissal of the calendar 206 and the graph 208 .
- the user 204 can be navigated to next steps in planning a trip, e.g., using the dates that have been selected.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process 300 for providing price information, e.g., for an air travel trip.
- the pricing system 110 can perform stages of the process 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.
- FIGS. 1-2C are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of the process 300 .
- a length of time from the starting travel date to the arrival date can constitute a proposed trip length.
- the user interface engine 121 can receive the user travel preferences 250 from the user interface 210 .
- the user 204 can specify Boston as the starting location, November 23 as the starting travel date, San Francisco as the destination, and December 6 as the arrival date.
- the pricing engine 223 can use these inputs, for example, to calculate a length of time of 15 days, e.g., the number of days from the starting travel date (e.g., November 23) to the arrival date (e.g., December 6).
- At least two months are presented in a calendar, including at least a month associated with the starting travel date ( 304 ).
- the user interface engine 121 can select November and December for the calendar months 206 a and 206 b , respectively, in the calendar 206 , with the month of November being selected because it includes the starting travel date of November 23.
- a price is determined that is associated with a cost of originating travel on a respective day for the trip ( 306 ). Determining the price can include determining a lowest price of a ticket to travel on a trip starting on the respective day and that lasts a projected number of days, wherein the projected number of days is the proposed trip length plus or minus a predetermined number of days. For example, as described above, the pricing engine 122 can determine lowest prices 254 for each of the days presented in the calendar 206 . The prices 254 can be determined, for example, as the lowest prices from the prices 131 .
- the service provider interface engine 123 can request price information from service providers 107 (e.g., airline carriers), the request being a request for lowest carrier prices associated with the days presented in the calendar 206 and associated with the inputs provided by the user 204 using trip type controls 218 and travel class controls 220 .
- service providers 107 e.g., airline carriers
- Other ways of requesting and/or receiving price information from service providers can be used.
- prices can be provided by third-party systems that interface with service providers 107 to provide travel information and prices to consumers and/or to plan trips or for other purposes.
- the trip can include air travel
- the price can be a price associated with the air travel.
- the prices 254 determined by the pricing engine can be for an airline trip being planned for the user 204 .
- the system 200 can be used for other purposes, e.g., for hotel accommodations, car rentals, or other trips and/or user needs.
- the predetermined number of days can be two (e.g., forming a window of 5 days).
- the pricing engine 122 can determine prices for various trip lengths of 15 days plus or minus two days, as described above.
- the delta number of days can be two by default, or a different number can be selected (e.g., 3-5).
- the number of days selected and used can depend on various factors, e.g., including holiday/peak pricing periods and/or characteristics of the user (e.g., to extend the delta to find cheaper prices more distant from the calculated duration).
- the user can be presented with an option to specify a different number of days, e.g., when the system 200 determines that a significant price savings opportunity exists.
- the number of days in the window is unbalanced, including more days after than before a target arrival date.
- determining a price for a respective day can include determining a price for each day in a window of time defined by the proposed trip length less the predetermined number of days, and the proposed trip length plus the predetermined number of days, wherein determining the price includes determining a lowest price in the window. For example, given a trip length of 15 days and a number of two days, the pricing engine 122 can calculate, for any given day in the calendar 206 , the lowest price for trips leaving that day and having a trip length of between 13 and 17 days.
- determining a lowest price can include determining a lowest price and determining a price that reflects a best value (e.g., absolute cheapest price) based on a number of predetermined criteria and presenting both the lowest price and best value price for a given day.
- the pricing engine 122 can calculate a lowest price 202 for a given day in the calendar 206 , and also calculate a best value price, e.g., based on predetermined criteria used by the pricing engine 122 and/or using inputs provided by the user 204 .
- the predetermined criteria can be objective and set by a service (e.g., the pricing engine 122 ) doing the determining of a lowest price.
- the predetermined criteria can be objective and/or subjective and selected by the user. For example, the user can specify that travel at night is preferred, travel in the morning is to be avoided, and certain airports are to be avoided as lay-overs. Other criteria are possible.
- the lowest price for each day of the one or more days in the calendar is presented in a first user interface ( 308 ).
- the prices 254 determined by the pricing engine 122 can be presented to the user 204 as prices 202 in the calendar 206 , as described above.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, including a method for providing price information. Travel preferences are received from a user for a trip including a starting location, starting travel date, destination and arrival date. At least two months are presented in a calendar, including a month associated with the starting travel date. For one or more days from the starting travel date, a price is determined that is associated with a cost of originating travel on a respective day. A lowest price is determined of a ticket to travel on a trip starting on the respective day that lasts a projected number of days equal to a proposed trip length plus or minus a predetermined delta number of days. The lowest price for each day is presented in the calendar and in a graph that includes axes representing price and days.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- When making travel plans, a user can select dates and locations associated with travel, e.g., including airline travel, hotel accommodations, car rental and the like. Prices associated with the user's selections can be presented. Conventional systems can provide, for example, a range of prices associated directly with the user's selections so that the user can view prices corresponding to exactly the inputs that the user entered.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for presenting price information. The method includes receiving an indication of travel preferences of a user for a trip including a starting location, a starting travel date, a destination and an arrival date, wherein a length of time from the starting travel date to the arrival date constitutes a proposed trip length. The method further includes presenting, in a calendar, at least two months including at least a month associated with the starting travel date. The method further includes determining, by one or more processors, for one or more days from the starting travel date, a price associated with a cost of originating travel on a respective day for the trip, including determining a lowest price of a ticket to travel on a trip starting on the respective day that lasts a projected number of days, wherein the projected number of days is the proposed trip length plus or minus a predetermined delta number of days. The method further includes presenting, in a first user interface, the lowest price for each day of the one or more days in the calendar. The method further includes presenting, in the first user interface, the lowest price for each day in a graph, wherein the graph includes one axis that represents price and one axis that represents days.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The trip can include air travel and the price is a price associated with the air travel. The predetermined delta number of days can be two. Presenting the calendar can include presenting two months including a month of and a month following the arrival date. The method can further include receiving a selection of a starting travel date in association with the presentation of the first user interface, updating price data for the calendar including determining a lowest price to complete a trip that starts on the selected starting travel date and ends on a respective day, and updating the calendar including presenting updated price data for each respective day of the one or more days. The method can further include updating the graph to reflect the updated price data. The method can further include receiving a selection of an arrival travel date in association with the presentation of the first user interface without receiving a selection of the starting date, updating price data for the calendar including determining a lowest price to complete a trip that ends on the selected arrival date, and updating the calendar including presenting updated price data for each respective day of the one or more days. The method can further include receiving a selection of an arrival date, presenting a selection to the user of a lowest fare for the selected starting date and selected arrival date including presenting the user with a filter to receive preference selections for filtering trips based on one or more trip parameters. The trip parameters can be selected from the group comprising number of stops, length of trip, type of airplane, on-time performance, configuration of airplane, service provider or rating of airplane or service provider. The method can further include surfacing to the user a lower cost alternative that approximates the user's selection of the travel preferences as compared to a price associated with a trip that is based on the user's selection of the starting travel date and arrival date. The method can further include receiving a selection of a day in the graph, and selecting a corresponding day in the calendar as either the starting travel date or the arrival date. The graph can include more months than a number of months shown in the calendar. The calendar can include a tab for designating fixed or flexible schedule, and wherein the method further includes determining days to price based on a received selection of fixed or flexible. Determining a price for a respective day can include determining a price for each day in a window of time defined by the proposed trip length less the predetermined number of days and the proposed trip length plus the predetermined number of days, and determining the price can include determining a lowest price in the window. Determining a lowest price can include determining a lowest price and determining a price that reflects a best value based on a number of predetermined criteria and presenting both the lowest price and best value price for a given day. The predetermined criteria can be objective and set by a service doing the determining a lowest price. The predetermined criteria can be objective and/or subjective and selected by the user. The method can further include presenting a control for selecting a filter criteria for use in selecting a lowest cost trip, and wherein, upon receipt of the user input indicating the filter criteria, updating a price for a given day with a lowest priced trip that conforms with indicated filter.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by one or more processors, cause the processor to: receive an indication of travel preferences of a user for a trip including a starting location, a starting travel date, a destination and an arrival date, wherein a length of time from the starting travel date to the arrival date constitutes a proposed trip length; present, in a calendar, at least two months including at least a month associated with the starting travel date; determine, for one or more days from the starting travel date, a price associated with a cost of originating travel on a respective day for the trip, including determining a lowest price of a ticket to travel on a trip starting on the respective day that lasts a projected number of days, wherein the projected number of days is the proposed trip length plus or minus a predetermined delta number of days; present, in a first user interface, the lowest price for each day of the one or more days in the calendar; and present, in the first user interface, the lowest price for each day in a graph, wherein the graph includes one axis that represents price and one axis that represents days.
- In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems, including a system comprising: a user interface engine for receiving user input from a user interface and providing pricing information for presentation within the user interface; a pricing engine for determining the price information for a plurality of days based on a combination of traveler preferences including starting point, start date, arrival date, destination; and a service provider interface engine for requesting service provider price information from plural service providers.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Users can be provided with a visual representation of price information that makes it easier to identify and select economical pricing to travel. Presented prices can automatically include prices associated with user-specified ranges (e.g., specific dates) and further include prices that are outside of the specified ranges. The user can be presented with price information for travel dates, for example, that include dates and/or travel parameters that the user may not have considered and that may be significantly lower in cost.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- This document describes systems, methods, computer program products and mechanisms for providing price information. For example, the price information can include prices associated with airline travel or for other purposes. In some implementations, a pricing system can receive an indication of travel preferences from a user for a planned trip that includes a starting location, a preferred starting travel date, a destination, and an arrival date. The system can compute a length of time from the starting travel date to the arrival date as a proposed trip length. A calendar can be presented to the user, and the calendar can include at least two months, including at least a month associated with the starting travel date. Initial pricing information be determined for commencing travel with one or more carriers on various dates to the destination where the trip length is varied (e.g., one or more days from a respective starting travel date). For a given calendar date (start date), a plurality of trips are evaluated, each starting on the calendar date and ending on a date that is within a threshold window of the arrival date provided by the traveler. Each determined price can be associated with a cost of originating travel on a respective day for the trip. Determining the price information for a specific day can include determining a lowest price of a ticket to travel on a trip starting on a respective day that terminates in the window. For example, the window can be the proposed trip length plus or minus a predetermined number of days. The lowest price for each day of the one or more days in the calendar can presented in a user interface, e.g., in a calendar that includes at least two months. The lowest price for each day can also be presented in a graph, for example, that includes a vertical axis representing price and a horizontal axis representing days.
- In some implementations, after a user selects a specific starting travel day after presentation of the initial pricing information, second pricing information can be computed and presented in the calendar and graph. The second pricing information can represent, for a given day, the lowest travel cost for a trip that ends on the respective day. Implementations of the subject matter may include other features for assisting the user in selecting optimum travel accommodations as discussed in further detail below.

provider interface engine 123, for example, can request price information from service providers 107 (e.g., airline carriers). For example, the requests can be for the lowest prices associated with particular days and meeting other selection criteria. - A
user device 106 can be an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving information over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers, televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. Theuser device 106 can also include a front end application that includes some or all of thepricing system 110. - A
user device 106 can be used to access resources such aswebsites 104. In turn, data from the resources can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. In some implementations, thewebsites 104 can include travel- and airline-related websites. -
FIG. 2A shows an example system 200 for presentinglowest prices 202 associated with an itinerary. In some implementations, itinerary can include air travel, and the prices can be prices associated with the air travel. For example, the system 200 can present the lowest available daily airfare prices to auser 204 in acalendar 206, and further represent the lowest prices in agraph 208, such as in auser interface 210. The information can be presented, for example, when theuser 204 uses an application or visits a web site in order to determine prices for a potential purchase of airline tickets. Other uses of the system 200 can include presenting prices for hotel or other accommodations, automobile rentals, rail, other travel- or business-related or daily priced commodities, or combinations thereof. In some implementations, theuser interface 210 can be presented when theuser 204 visits a travel-related web page using abrowser 212 or when theuser 204 executes a travel-related application on auser device 106. Other ways for presenting theuser interface 210 are possible. An example sequence of stages for the system 200 is provided below. -
FIG. 2B provides a detailed example of theuser interface 210 that presentslowest prices 202 in thecalendar 206 and in thegraph 208. For example, theuser interface 210 can be presented after the user selects a destination (e.g., Boston) for a planned airplane trip. - The
user interface 210 can include controls andfields 214 for selecting options and specifying information for which theprices 202 are generated. In some implementations, the controls andfields 214 can include high-level browser options 216, e.g., from which the user can select an option for obtaining flight information and making reservations. In some implementations, similar options can exist for hotel accommodations, automobile rentals, or for other purposes. When the controls andfields 214 are related to airline flights, for example, trip type controls 218 can include controls for user options related to a round trip, a one-way trip, a multi-city trip, or other types of trips or airfares. Travel class controls 220 can provide theuser 204 with options to select one or more acceptable types of travel class, e.g., business class, coach class, first class, or other classes. Astarting point control 222 can be used to enter (or select form a list) a starting point (e.g., Boston) for the proposed airplane trip. Adestination control 224 can be used to enter (or select form a list) a destination (e.g., San Francisco) for the proposed airplane trip. Date controls 226 and 228 can be used to designate preferred travel dates, e.g., departure and arrival dates, respectively. In some implementations, dates entered in the date controls 226 and 288 can be changed using date scrolling controls 229. In some implementations, the dates and destination are pre-loaded in thefields 214, such as when a user has been redirected from another property after having already provided such information. The travel dates provided can be target, or approximate, as the user will be provide with the opportunity to select specific dates as discussed further below, such as when theuser 204 selects specific dates based on presented price information. - Based on a combination of user inputs and selections in the controls and fields 214, the system 200 can generate and display price information in the form of the
prices 202 in thecalendar 206. Each displayedprice 202, for example, can be provided adjacent to a calendar date inrespective calendar months November calendar month 206 a, aday 230 is “5” and a corresponding price 202 a is $727. The displayed months (e.g., November and December) can be chosen, for example, based on a date (e.g., November 23) specified by theuser 204 in thedate control 226. In some implementations, controls 232 can be used to cycle among months, e.g., advancing forward or backward while displaying two months at a time. In some implementations, other ways for displaying and cycling through the months are possible, and a different number of months other than two can be presented. In some implementations, other information, such as best value prices, described below, can be provided in thecalendar 206, and also represented in thegraph 208, e.g., using different colors or other presentation techniques. Each day in thecalendar 206 can display one or more prices. In some implementations, price information provided in thecalendar 206 can represent total travel costs, such as including attending fees (e.g., bag fees for airlines, or resort fees for hotels, fuel surcharges for various carriers, or site-specific fees). - In the example shown in
FIG. 2B , theuser 204 has initially specified November 23 as a start date. This date can be confirmed by the user, but at this point the price information that is generated assumes a measure of flexibility in the user and as such calculates price data for various configurations of travel that are not specifically tied to this date. In the example shown, theuser interface 210 has placed a box around an entry 234 (e.g., for November 23) in thecalendar 206. Theentry 234 can include, for example, the calendar day (e.g., 23), and beneath that is displayed the price 202 (e.g., $309). Similarly, a box surrounds anentry 236 in thecalendar 206, the date of which corresponds to the date (e.g., December 5) specified in thedate control 226. - The price in the
entry 234 can represent the lowest price determined from plural service providers (e.g., airline carriers) for a trip leaving Boston on November 23 and arriving in San Francisco on a day that is in a predetermined window, e.g., a trip having a length of 15 days (e.g., November 23 to December 6), plus or minus a delta (e.g., two days) relative to December 6. Thus, the price of $309 is the lowest price for flights leaving that day for trips of 13-17 days, and following the parameters specified in the controls and fields 214. Referring to the followingSaturday 235, e.g., November 30, the cheapest flight leaving that day and having a trip length of 15 plus or minus two days is $599. As will be described in detail with reference toFIG. 2C , user selection of one of the entries in thecalendar 206 can result in an updated display that provides updated price information relative to the selected day. - The
graph 208 includes graph elements (e.g., bars), each of which can correspond to (and have a height associated with) aprice 202 on a given day. In this example,elements 238 a correspond one-to-one to days in November, andelements 238 b correspond one-to-one to days in December. In some implementations,month separators 240, shown inFIG. 2B with dotted lines, can be used toseparate graph 208 entries by month. Month labels 242 can indicate the names of the months for which entries betweenmonth separators 240 correspond. In some implementations, low and high price labels 244 (e.g., $170 and $821, respectively) can indicate, by their vertical placement relative to thegraph 208, minimum and maximum prices that are contained in the graph. Other values can be chosen for the range labels. - In some implementations, hovering over a bar in the
graph 208 can cause the corresponding entry in thecalendar 206 to be highlighted, and clicking on a bar in thegraph 208 can cause the corresponding entry in thecalendar 206 to be selected. Thegraph 208 can generally contain at least the entries corresponding to all of the displayed entries in thecalendar 206. For example, thegraph 208 can also display other data (e.g., outside the date range shown in the calendar). In this way, theuser 204 can be presented with additional price information not contained in the present view of thecalendar 206. Other ways of presenting graph information are possible, including using multiple colors, shading and other ways of differentiating values in the graph. Referring again toFIG. 2A ,prices 202 and the presentation of thecalendar 206 and thegraph 208 can be determined, for example, in the following stages. - At
stage 1, for example, theuser interface engine 121 can receive an indication of initial travel preferences of theuser 204 for a trip (e.g., an airline trip) including a starting location, a starting travel date, a destination, and an arrival date. A length of time from the starting travel date to the arrival date can constitute a proposed trip length. For example, theuser interface engine 121 can receive theuser travel preferences 250 from theuser interface 210. For example, using theuser interface 210, theuser 204 can specify Boston as the starting location using thestarting point control 222, and specify November 23 as the starting travel date in thedeparture date control 226. The user can also specify San Francisco as the destination using thedestination control 224, and specify December 6 as the arrival date in thearrival date control 228. Using these inputs, for example, the pricing engine 223 can calculate a length of time of 15 days, e.g., the number of days from November 23 to December 6. Other ways of specifying travel preferences can be used. - At
stage 2, for example, theuser interface engine 121 can present at least two months in a calendar, including at least a month associated with the starting travel date. As an example, theuser interface engine 121 can identify the months November and December as the months associated with the user's input in theuser interface 210. Theuser interface engine 121 can provide the twomonths 252 to theuser interface 210, e.g., for display in the calendar 206 (e.g., as prices 202). - At
stage 3, for example, thepricing engine 122 can determine initial pricing information including a price for one or more days from the starting travel date, where each price is associated with a cost of originating travel on a respective day for the trip. Determining the price can include, for example, determining a lowest price of a ticket to travel on a trip starting on the respective day that lasts a projected number of days, wherein the projected number of days is the proposed trip length plus or minus a predetermined number of days. For example, thepricing engine 122 can determine theprices 254 as described above forprices 202 with respect toFIG. 2B . As an example, each of theprices 202 can be a lowest price for a given day for all trips of a projected number of days (e.g., 13-17) that is determined from the proposed trip length (e.g., 15 days), plus or minus a delta number of days (e.g., two days). - At
stage 4, for example, theuser interface engine 121 can present the lowest price for each day of the one or more days in the calendar in a first user interface. For example, theuser interface engine 121 can provide the lowest prices for thecalendar 206, e.g., for populatingprices 202 in thecalendar 206. - At
stage 5, for example, theuser interface engine 121 can present the lowest price for each day in a graph in the first user interface. The graph includes one axis that represents price and one axis that represents days. For example, theuser interface engine 121 can provide the lowest prices for thegraph 208, e.g., for determining the heights of the bars in thegraph 208. In this example, the left (y) axis in thegraph 208 can be labeled with low andhigh price labels 244, and the bottom (x axis) of thegraph 208 can represent the days in thecalendar 206. -
FIG. 2C provides a detailed example of theuser interface 210 that is updated after selection of a particular starting travel date. For example, if theuser 204 selects a particular date (e.g., November 20), thegraph 208 can be updated with new price information including theprices 202 shown inFIG. 2C . In another example, the same result can occur if theuser 204 selects (e.g., clicks on) the graph element in thegraph 208 that corresponds to the November 20 entry in thecalendar 206. Other ways at arriving at the updatedcalendar 206 andprices 202 are possible, including, for example, manual entry of a date or selection of a date from a list. - Changes in the
calendar 206, e.g., relative to that shown inFIG. 2B , can include changes to theprices 202. For example, the values of the prices can change, as they now represent the lowest price of returning on the trip on that day, given the selection of the particular starting travel date (e.g., November 20). Also, noprices 202 exist in thecalendar 206 for days before November 20. Thegraph 208 can also be updated, e.g., with graph elements having new heights that represent the corresponding updatedprices 202 in thecalendar 206. Also, fewer total graph elements can exist, e.g., inelements 238 a, as dates before November 20 have been eliminated. - In some implementations, selection of an ending date or some other input on the
calendar 206, thegraph 208, or elsewhere in theuser interface 210 can result in the dismissal of thecalendar 206 and thegraph 208. For example, theuser 204 can be navigated to next steps in planning a trip, e.g., using the dates that have been selected. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for providing price information, e.g., for an air travel trip. In some implementations, thepricing system 110 can perform stages of theprocess 300 using instructions that are executed by one or more processors.FIGS. 1-2C are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of theprocess 300. - An indication is received of travel preferences of a user for a trip (e.g., including air travel) including a starting location, a starting travel date, a destination and an arrival date (302). A length of time from the starting travel date to the arrival date can constitute a proposed trip length. As an example, the
user interface engine 121 can receive theuser travel preferences 250 from theuser interface 210. For example, as described above and using controls 222-228 in theuser interface 210, theuser 204 can specify Boston as the starting location, November 23 as the starting travel date, San Francisco as the destination, and December 6 as the arrival date. The pricing engine 223 can use these inputs, for example, to calculate a length of time of 15 days, e.g., the number of days from the starting travel date (e.g., November 23) to the arrival date (e.g., December 6). - At least two months are presented in a calendar, including at least a month associated with the starting travel date (304). For example, the
user interface engine 121 can select November and December for thecalendar months calendar 206, with the month of November being selected because it includes the starting travel date of November 23. - For one or more days from the starting travel date, a price is determined that is associated with a cost of originating travel on a respective day for the trip (306). Determining the price can include determining a lowest price of a ticket to travel on a trip starting on the respective day and that lasts a projected number of days, wherein the projected number of days is the proposed trip length plus or minus a predetermined number of days. For example, as described above, the
pricing engine 122 can determinelowest prices 254 for each of the days presented in thecalendar 206. Theprices 254 can be determined, for example, as the lowest prices from theprices 131. In some implementations, in order to updateavailable prices 131, the serviceprovider interface engine 123 can request price information from service providers 107 (e.g., airline carriers), the request being a request for lowest carrier prices associated with the days presented in thecalendar 206 and associated with the inputs provided by theuser 204 using trip type controls 218 and travel class controls 220. Other ways of requesting and/or receiving price information from service providers can be used. In some implementations, prices can be provided by third-party systems that interface withservice providers 107 to provide travel information and prices to consumers and/or to plan trips or for other purposes. - In some implementations, the trip can include air travel, and the price can be a price associated with the air travel. For example, the
prices 254 determined by the pricing engine can be for an airline trip being planned for theuser 204. In some implementations, the system 200 can be used for other purposes, e.g., for hotel accommodations, car rentals, or other trips and/or user needs. - In some implementations, the predetermined number of days can be two (e.g., forming a window of 5 days). For example, the
pricing engine 122 can determine prices for various trip lengths of 15 days plus or minus two days, as described above. In some implementations, the delta number of days can be two by default, or a different number can be selected (e.g., 3-5). In some implementations, the number of days selected and used can depend on various factors, e.g., including holiday/peak pricing periods and/or characteristics of the user (e.g., to extend the delta to find cheaper prices more distant from the calculated duration). In some implementations, the user can be presented with an option to specify a different number of days, e.g., when the system 200 determines that a significant price savings opportunity exists. In some implementations, the number of days in the window is unbalanced, including more days after than before a target arrival date. - In some implementations, determining a price for a respective day can include determining a price for each day in a window of time defined by the proposed trip length less the predetermined number of days, and the proposed trip length plus the predetermined number of days, wherein determining the price includes determining a lowest price in the window. For example, given a trip length of 15 days and a number of two days, the
pricing engine 122 can calculate, for any given day in thecalendar 206, the lowest price for trips leaving that day and having a trip length of between 13 and 17 days. - In some implementations, determining a lowest price can include determining a lowest price and determining a price that reflects a best value (e.g., absolute cheapest price) based on a number of predetermined criteria and presenting both the lowest price and best value price for a given day. For example, the
pricing engine 122 can calculate alowest price 202 for a given day in thecalendar 206, and also calculate a best value price, e.g., based on predetermined criteria used by thepricing engine 122 and/or using inputs provided by theuser 204. In some implementations, the predetermined criteria can be objective and set by a service (e.g., the pricing engine 122) doing the determining of a lowest price. In some implementations, the predetermined criteria can be objective and/or subjective and selected by the user. For example, the user can specify that travel at night is preferred, travel in the morning is to be avoided, and certain airports are to be avoided as lay-overs. Other criteria are possible. - The lowest price for each day of the one or more days in the calendar is presented in a first user interface (308). For example, the
prices 254 determined by thepricing engine 122 can be presented to theuser 204 asprices 202 in thecalendar 206, as described above. - In some implementations, the calendar can include a tab for designating fixed or flexible schedule, and the method can further include determining days to price based on a received selection of fixed or flexible. For example, the
user interface 210 can include additional controls (not shown inFIG. 2B ) by which theuser 204 can specify a degree by which traveling is to strictly or not so strictly follow a schedule represented by the departure date and/or the arrival date. Example controls can allow theuser 204 to specify, for example, that “I must leave after Date X, return by Date Y, or not be traveling on Date Z. - The lowest price for each day is presented in a graph in the first user interface (310). The graph includes one axis that represents price and one axis that represents days. For example, the
user interface engine 121 can provide price information and/or instructions for generating thegraph 208 in theuser interface 210. In some implementations, thegraph 208 can include a vertical price axis represented by low and high price labels 244 (e.g., $170 and $821, respectively), and a horizontal axis associated with days and indicated by month labels 242. - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include receiving a selection of a day in the graph, and selecting a corresponding day in the calendar as either the starting travel date or the arrival date. For example, theuser interface 210 can allow the user to select, e.g., by clicking, a date in thegraph 208 as either the starting travel date or the arrival date. Theuser 204 may do this, for example, after noticing a relatively short height of the bar representing the day in the graph, e.g., indicating a relatively cheaper price associated with that particular day. In some implementations, by hovering over bars in thegraph 208 representing particular days, or by hovering over corresponding days in thecalendar 206, theuser 204 can be presented with a popup that includes detailed information associated with the day and without changing the displayedprices 202 in either of thecalendar 206 or thegraph 208. Other ways of interfacing with the graph are possible. - In some implementations, the graph can further include more months than a number of months shown in the calendar. For example, while the
calendar 206 may display just two months of information (e.g., November and December), thegraph 208 can be extended, as shown inFIG. 2B , to include price information for October and January. By selecting individual graph elements corresponding to these additional months, for example, the user can be presented with the corresponding price information. In some implementations, selecting either October or January, for example, can cause thecalendar 206 to be shifted by a month to include that selected month as one of the two months displayed. - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include steps for updating the displayed price information based on a user selection of a specific start date, as described above with reference toFIG. 2C . A selection of a starting travel date can be received (e.g., by the user interface engine 121) in association with the presentation of the first user interface. For example, theuser 204 can select November 20 on thecalendar 206 by selecting (e.g., clicking on) the corresponding entry in thecalendar 206 or on the corresponding bar in thegraph 208. Price information (e.g., prices) for the calendar can be updated, including determining a lowest price to complete a trip that starts on the selected starting travel date and ends on a respective day. For example, the pricing engine can calculate new price information, different from theprices 254, and this time based on November 20 as being the specified departure date. Each of the prices for Day N calculated for display in thecalendar 206, then, can indicate the lowest airline price for a leaving on November 20 and returning on Day N. Thus, the only dates and prices that appear in thecalendar 206 andgraph 208 inFIG. 2C are for November 20 and later. The calendar can be updated, including presenting updated price data for each respective day of the one or more days. For example, theuser interface engine 121 can present theprices 202, as shown inFIG. 2C . - In some implementations, the graph can also be updated to reflect the updated price information. For example, whenever the
calendar 206 is updated withnew prices 202, the corresponding elements in thegraph 208 can also be updated. - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include receiving a selection of an arrival travel date in association with the presentation of the first user interface without receiving a selection of the starting date. For example, this selection can be made by theuser 204 by selecting an arrival date using thearrival date control 228 and leaving the departure date blank using thedeparture date control 224. The price information can be updated for thecalendar 206, including determining a lowest price to complete a trip that ends on the selected arrival date. For example, the trip duration of 15 days plus or minus two days can be used to determine prices, relative to a preferred arrival date of December 6. Thecalendar 206 can be updated, including presenting updated price data for each respective day of the one or more days. For example,prices 202 presented on that day and days before and after can provide the user with information allowing the user to save money by selecting the same or different travel days. Similarly, the user may have a strict departure date with an open-ended starting date. In this situation, the calendar may be used to present price information that is associated with windows (similar to a fixed starting date), so as to enable a user to select a travel option that is best suited to both price and the fixed departure date input received. - In some implementations, the process 300 (e.g., after receipt of the starting travel date and presentation of the initial price information) can further include receiving a selection of an arrival date, and presenting a selection to the user of a lowest fare for the selected starting date and selected arrival date including presenting the user with a filter to receive preference selections for filtering trips based on one or more trip parameters. Example trip parameters can include number of stops, length of trip, type of airplane, on-time performance (e.g., of the airline), configuration of airplane, service provider (e.g., specific airline), or a rating of the airplane or the service provider. Other trip parameters are possible. In some implementations, users can be provided with controls for identifying and/or ranking which trip parameters are important to them and should be used in the selection of best value prices. In some implementations, the filtering step can be performed before selection of either the starting or arrival dates as desired by the individual user.
- In some implementations, the
user interface 210 can provide additional information associated with parameters. For example, theuser interface 210 provide information that can quantify a parameter setting provided by the user, e.g., with a message in a popup that says, “Note, this setting will cost you $50.” In another example, for parameters associated with selecting a particular airline, for example, theuser interface 210 can provide a message that says, “you should try to fly Example Airlines” or receive from theuser 204 input that specifies that the user wants to fly Example Airlines, whenever possible. In another example, theuser interface 210 can provide a message that says, “Return flights on Sundays are generally more expensive.” - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include surfacing to the user a lower cost alternative that approximates the user's selection of the travel preferences as compared to a price associated with a trip that is based on the user's selection of the starting travel date and arrival date. For example, in addition to presentingprices 202 based on the user's inputs for travel dates and locations, thepricing engine 122 can search for and identify other prices that are excluded from, but lower than, theprices 202, e.g., including an absolute lowest price. - In some implementations, the
process 300 can further include presenting a control for selecting filter criteria for use in selecting a lowest cost trip. Upon receipt of the user input indicating the filter criteria, a price for a given day can be updated with a lowest priced trip that conforms with the indicated filter. For example, after initial display ofprices 202 in thecalendar 206, theuser 204 can use controls to make selections associated with a number of stops, trip length, airplane type, on-time performance, airplane configuration, service provider, or a rating of airplane or the service provider. Thepricing engine 122, for example, can use the filtering information from the user's selections in order to update theprices 202. -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram ofexample computing devices Computing device 400 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers.Computing device 400 is further intended to represent any other typically non-mobile devices, such as televisions or other electronic devices with one or more processers embedded therein or attached thereto.Computing device 450 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, and other computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be examples only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document. -
Computing device 400 includes aprocessor 402,memory 404, astorage device 406, a high-speed controller 408 connecting tomemory 404 and high-speed expansion ports 410, and a low-speed controller 412 connecting to low-speed bus 414 andstorage device 406. Each of thecomponents processor 402 can process instructions for execution within thecomputing device 400, including instructions stored in thememory 404 or on thestorage device 406 to display graphical information for a GUI on an external input/output device, such asdisplay 416 coupled to high-speed controller 408. In other implementations, multiple processors and/or multiple buses may be used, as appropriate, along with multiple memories and types of memory. Also,multiple computing devices 400 may be connected, with each device providing portions of the necessary operations (e.g., as a server bank, a group of blade servers, or a multi-processor system). - The
memory 404 stores information within thecomputing device 400. In one implementation, thememory 404 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, thememory 404 is a volatile memory unit or units. In another implementation, thememory 404 is a non-volatile memory unit or units. - The
storage device 406 is capable of providing mass storage for thecomputing device 400. In one implementation, thestorage device 406 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, thestorage device 406 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices, including devices in a storage area network or other configurations. In one implementation, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions that, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as those described above. The information carrier is a computer- or machine-readable medium, such as thememory 404, thestorage device 406, or memory onprocessor 402. - The high-
speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for thecomputing device 400, while the low-speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is an example only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled tomemory 404, display 416 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 410, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 412 is coupled tostorage device 406 and low-speed bus 414.
