Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to information retrieval systems and, more particularly, to systems and methods for performing point-of-view searching.
- One technique permits a user to specify one or a set of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) as “authoritative.” Similarly, another set can be specified as lacking in authority. This technique is based on finding hubs and authorities via the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm.
- HITS Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search
- the underlying information used for the computation is a co-citation index.
- the goal of the technique is to modify the co-citation index in such a way that the “authority” increases for positive examples and decreases for negative examples. Thus, the authority of other URLs can be changed.
- the co-citation index must be computed, which limits the size of the underlying link graph.
- the link graph is restricted to documents in the neighborhood of documents containing search query terms.
- the likelihood that a “good” or “bad” example URL is in this small neighborhood is remote.
- the underlying HITS algorithm has numerous shortcomings (e.g., topic drift and spammability) which may affect the performance of this technique.
- a search query is to be interpreted broadly to include any type of paper or electronic data or file, including audio, video, image, text data/files, etc.
- a document as used herein, may be a single file or a combination of files with or without embedded links to other files.
- a system provides search results relating to a point-of-view (POV).
- POV point-of-view
- the system obtains a search query and POV data.
- the system generates a list of documents based on the search query and filters the list of documents based on the POV data.
- the system then presents the filtered list as a result of the search.
- a system provides search results relating to a POV.
- the system receives a search query from a user, obtains POV data, and uses the POV data to augment the search query.
- the system identifies documents based on the augmented search query and presents the identified documents to the user.
- a method for performing a search from a POV includes receiving a request for a search; obtaining POV data that defines the POV for the search; performing a search of documents based on the POV data; generating a list of documents as a result of the search; and presenting the list of documents.

- information may include a user's browsing history (including information such as sites or documents visited and amount of time spent), categories specified by a user or otherwise derived from user interactions such as search history, browsing history, etc., word vectors derived from sites or documents visited and various well-known information retrieval (IR) techniques, etc.
- POV searching may also be thought of as personalized searching, in which case POV data may correspond to personalization data, such as the types of information described above or many other types of data. As a result, the user is presented with more relevant results than obtained by conventional information retrieval systems.

- the operating system 310 may include conventional operating system software, such as the Windows, Unix, or Linux operating systems.
- the search engine software 320 may include software for implementing the search engine 125 .
- the search engine 125 may identify one or more documents or a list of documents in response to a request, such as one or more search terms, from a user. For example, the search engine 125 may receive a search query from a user and respond by returning relevant information or a list of relevant information to the user.
- users may ask the server 120 to locate web documents relating to a particular topic that are stored at other devices or systems connected to network 140 or another network.
- the search engine 125 may access a database to obtain results from a document corpus, stored in the database, by comparing the terms in the user's search query to the documents in the corpus.
- the information in the document corpus may be gathered by the spider software 330 .
- the spider software 330 may include software that “crawls” web documents on network 140 based on their hyperlinks. As a result, the spider software 330 generates a tree or directed graph of linked web documents.
- the crawled documents may be stored in the database as an inverted index in which each term in the corpus is associated with all the crawled documents that contain that term.
- FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating relations between an exemplary set of web documents that may be gathered by the spider software 330 .
- Documents 410 - 430 contain links to each other.
- An anchor specifies the URL of the document being linked.
- browsers display anchors as text distinct from the main text using, for example, underlining or different colors. A user, by selecting the anchor, causes the browser to retrieve the web document specified by the URL.
- documents 410 - 430 contain various links.
- document 410 contains one backlink to document 430 and two forward links (i.e., one to document 420 and one to document 430 ).
- Document 420 contains two backlinks (i.e., one to document 410 and one to document 430 ).

- the miscellaneous other software 340 and miscellaneous data 350 may include programs and data used by the server 120 to perform searching-related and non-searching-related operations.
- the miscellaneous data 350 may include the document corpus gathered by the spider software 330 .
- the corpus is stored in a memory external to the server 120 .
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of exemplary processing for performing POV searching in accordance with an implementation consistent with the present invention. Processing may begin with a user accessing the server 120 ( FIG. 1 ) using, for example, web browser software on a client, such as client 110 . The user may then provide a query that includes one or more search terms to the search engine 125 maintained by the server 120 (act 510 ).
- the search engine 125 may obtain POV data from the user, the browser software, or elsewhere (act 520 ).
- the POV data may include a set of URLs that act as examples of on-topic or off-topic documents.
- a user may specify URLs related to jaguars, but add negative URLs related to Jaguar brand cars.
- the URL of the document currently displayed by the browser software may be used as an example of an on-topic URL.
- the browser software may provide the URLs included in the user's “bookmarks” or “favorites” list to the search engine 125 for use as examples of on-topic URLs. In this case, the browser software may automatically provide the list of URLs to the search engine 125 or may present the list to the user for selection of one or more of the URLs prior to providing the list to the search engine 125 .
- a database may include URLs that the user has previously selected (e.g., clicked on), that were returned in the top N results of a previous query by the user, that the user has visited recently or in some time period, etc., or that can be determined to be related to such URLs.
- the term “recently” may refer to an absolute time period (such as within the last M minutes, where M can be a predetermined number or a number that is calculated dynamically, e.g., according to the user's browsing habits and browsing history). Alternatively, “recently” may also be a relative measure. For example, recently viewed documents may refer to the last Y number of documents viewed, regardless of the time when the documents were viewed.
- URLs can be added to the POV data.
- the URLs can first be filtered to determine whether they are on-topic. Those URLs that are on-topic can be added to the POV data.
- the URLs in the database can be clustered by topic. When the user performs the POV search, the clusters that are relevant to the topic of the search can be identified and the URLs from the relevant clusters can be added to the POV data.
- the search engine 125 may perform one or more operations to expand the set of on-topic URLs. For example, the search engine 125 may obtain a few key words, either from the examples of on-topic URLs or from the user. The search engine 125 may then perform a search to obtain a collection of additional on-topic URLs. The search engine 125 may then add these additional URLs to the set of on-topic URLs. According to another implementation, the search engine 125 may identify URLs that are co-cited with the set of on-topic URLs. The search engine 125 may then add the co-cited URLs to the set of on-topic URLs.
- the POV data may include one or more words that identify on-topic or off-topic documents.
- the search engine 125 may obtain the words from an example set of URLs, from the user (either explicitly or implicitly), from personalization data, or from various techniques, such as those disclosed previously. For example, a user may specify positive and/or negative key words that identify URLs that are on-topic or off-topic.
- the POV data may include a category or list of categories.
- the category may correspond to categories within a hierarchical directory, such as an open directory, maintained by the search engine 125 or by another device or server.
- the search engine 125 may maintain a hierarchical directory based on periodic crawling of the network 140 by the spider software 330 .
- the search engine 125 may record a list of URLs and other information that correspond to that category.
- the search engine 125 may present a selectable list of categories to the user.
- the POV data may include data relating to one or more searches that the user has previously performed and/or key words from documents (e.g., web pages or their anchor text) that the user has selected (e.g., clicked on) or that were returned in the top N results for a search by the user.
- This data may be stored in a database.
- the key words can be used to automatically augment the query. For example, if the user has previously performed a search for “tigers” and “elephants,” then “mammals” might be one of the key words extracted based on the search. When the user later performs a POV search “jaguar,” then “mammals” might be automatically added to the search query.
- FIG. 6 is a diagram of an exemplary graphical user interface (GUI) 600 that may be presented to the user to facilitate the providing of POV data.
- the GUI 600 may prompt the user to enter one or more search terms/words to include (box 610 ) or exclude (box 620 ) in the search results.
- the GUI 600 may also prompt the user to provide on-topic URLs and off-topic URLs (box 630 ) or a category (box 640 ) for use in determining the set of on-topic and off-topic URLs.
- the category may correspond to categories within a hierarchical directory, such as an open directory, maintained by the search engine 125 or by another device or server.
- the GUI 600 may further prompt the user as to whether the user desires to include previously stored data (e.g., data derived from previous search-related activities of the user) (box 650 ).
- the search engine 125 may generate data that contains the search results in a conventional manner (act 530 ).
- the search engine 125 provides the search results as an HTML document, similar to search results provided by conventional search engines.
- the search engine 125 may provide the search results according to a protocol agreed upon by the server 120 and the client 110 .
- the search results include references (e.g., links) to documents (e.g., web pages) and possibly a textual description of the links.
- the search results include references (e.g., links) to directory nodes within a hierarchical directory and possibly textual descriptions for the directory nodes.
- the search results include a combination of these references or the documents themselves.
- the search engine 125 may filter the result links to present links related to the POV data (act 540 ). While the filtering is being described as an act separate from the act of generating the list of result links, these two acts may be concurrently performed as part of the same act.
- FIG. 7 is a flowchart of exemplary processing for filtering result links based on POV data according to an implementation consistent with the present invention.
- the search engine 125 may use a document ranking method, such as the PageRankTM method described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999, which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the PageRankTM of a web document is the probability that a web surfer who is surfing at random will be at a document at any time.
- the PageRankTM is the stationary distribution of the random walk process on a graph of the web. Since the web contains many sinks, where the walk cannot follow a forward link, a set of documents is assigned a non-zero “reset” probability and whenever a sink is reached, the walk “jumps” to a randomly selected document in the set, according to the reset probabilities in the set.
- the reset probability of a document is the probability of landing on that document during a random reset.
- the backlinks from different documents are weighted differently and the number of links in each document is normalized.
- the PageRankTM method considers a citation from a highly ranked backlink as more important than a citation from a lowly ranked backlink (provided both citations come from backlink documents that have an equal number of forward links).
- the rank or score of a document may be defined according to:
- r ⁇ ( A ) ⁇ * i ⁇ ( A ) k + ( 1 - ⁇ ) ⁇ ( r ⁇ ( B 1 ) ⁇ B 1 ⁇ + ... + r ⁇ ( B n ) ⁇ B n ⁇ ) , where A is the document being ranked; B 1 , . . . , B n are the backlink documents of document A; r(B 1 ), . . . , r(B n ) are the ranks of documents B 1 , . . . , B n ;
- are the number of forward links for documents B 1 , . . . , B n ; ⁇ is a constant in the interval [0,1]; k is the number of on-topic URLs; and i(A) is set to one if A is in the set of on-topic URLs and reset to zero otherwise.
- the ranks form a probability distribution over web documents, so that the sum of ranks over all web documents is unity.
- the rank of a document can, therefore, be defined as the probability that a surfer will be at the document after following a large number of forward links.
- the constant ⁇ in the above equation may be interpreted as the reset probability that the web surfer will jump randomly to any web page instead of following a forward link.
- the search engine 125 may set the reset probability of the URLs in the set of on-topic URLs to 1/k, where k is the total number of URLs in the set (act 710 ).
- the search engine 125 may set the reset probability of all other URLs to zero (act 720 ).
- a function f may be defined on the set of documents, such that
- f(A) w(A) if A is in the set of on-topic URLs, where w(A) is the weight of the URL.
- the sum of f(A) over all documents may equal one.
- the rank or score of a document may then be defined according to:
- r ⁇ ( A ) ⁇ * f ⁇ ( A ) k + ( 1 - ⁇ ) ⁇ ( r ⁇ ( B 1 ) ⁇ B 1 ⁇ + ... + r ⁇ ( B n ) ⁇ B n ⁇ ) , where A, B 1 , . . . , B n , r(B 1 ), . . . , r(B n ),
- , ⁇ , and k are defined above.
- the search engine 125 may then score the result links using one of the ranking methods described above (act 730 ).
- the rank flows from the documents corresponding to the example URLs to all other documents. Documents that are easily reached from the example documents obtain a high rank. As a result, documents close to the example documents are likely to be returned higher in the rankings for queries to which they match.
- the search engine 125 may then arrange the documents in the result links based on their scores (act 740 ).
- the relative probabilities of traversing links within the web graph may be changed. For example, if a link leads toward documents that are on-topic, then it may be favored over links that lead toward documents that are off-topic.
- Various methods including local optimization methods, may be used to compute appropriate edge probabilities to maximize the POV of the web graph.
- the weights w(A) may be modified based on favored and/or unfavored links to maximize the POV.
- the on-topic URLs may be added to the filtered results.
- the best result might be one that the user saw before and was in the on-topic URLs, but not in the search results.
- the search engine 125 may then present the filtered results to the user (act 550 ).
- the search engine 125 may also rank the results in some manner, such as by assigning scores to the links or by alphabetizing them.
- the search engine 125 may present the filtered result links as a web page in a browser window. Alternatively, the search engine 125 may present the filtered result links as a list of selectable items within a user interface, such as a pull-down or pop-up menu, a side-bar, or a scrollable list.
- the results of a search may include a list of top ranked directory hierarchy nodes.
- the search engine 125 may download the links corresponding to the top ranked directory hierarchy nodes and display them instead of or in addition to the text of the top ranked directory hierarchy nodes.
- Systems and methods consistent with the present invention permit a user to limit search results to a defined POV, such as documents related to an example set of URLs. As a result, systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide meaningful search results to the user.
- search engine 125 performs the acts described above with regard to FIGS. 5 and 7 , this need not be the case.
- one or more other devices such as another server 130 or a client 110 , may perform one or more of the acts.
