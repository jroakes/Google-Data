- FIGS. 1B and 1C show exemplary elements of browser window 150
- browser window 150 may contain fewer elements, different components, additional elements, or differently arranged elements than depicted in FIGS. 1B and 1C . Additionally or alternatively, one or more elements of browser window 150 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other elements of browser window 150 .
- a user accesses a document with no comments, it may be desirable to provide a suggestion to the user to write a comment for the document.
- a user may be more likely to write a comment for a document, if the user is provided with a suggestion to do so.
- a user's browsing experience may not always be associated with viewing or writing comments and a user may not always be cognizant of the comments add-on application or of the opportunity to write comments for a document.
- users may not be viewing comments for a document, and thus may not be aware that a document does not have any comments and/or that users may have requested to see comments for the document.
- Providing a suggestion to a user to write comments about a particular document may thus inform the user that the particular document needs comments and may motivate the user to write comments about the particular document.
- Documents that need comments may be identified based on, for example, requests to see comments for the documents.
- a user may explicitly request comments by, for example, selecting “Request Comments” button 195 .
- comments button 170 for a particular document to view comments for the particular document, it may be considered an implicit request for comments.
- Some documents may be identified as needing comments based on a type of document. Users may want to see comments for particular types of documents. For example, users may want to see comments for recent news articles; documents associated with products, businesses, books, or published papers; highly ranked documents regarding popular topics; and/or documents being discussed on blogs and/or microblogs.
- Some users may not be likely to write comments.
- most users of the comments add-on application may be passive users that read comments but that do not contribute any content themselves. Providing suggestions to users that are not likely to contribute comments may be unproductive and may annoy such users and detract from their browsing experience. Therefore, it may be desirable to identify users that are likely to become authors of comments.
- a user may be identified as a likely author if the user has written comments in the past, if the user has generated content in other online settings (e.g., blogs) associated with the user, or if the user has generated content requiring expertise in a particular area (e.g., the user has sent post requests to a web site associated with a particular topic).
- users may be more likely to write a comment about a document that is in the user's area of expertise or that is related to the user's interests. Therefore, topics associated with a document accessed by a user may be compared to the user's areas of expertise or the user's interests.
- a suggestion may be provided to the user to write a comment about the document.
- Some users may be active authors of comments. For example, a user may dedicate one or two hours each week to writing comments for documents. Such users may want to know where to direct their efforts.
- An implementation described herein may provide a ranked list of documents in need of comments to a user that is an active author of comments.

- FIG. 4 is a diagram of exemplary functional components of comments server 130 .
- Comments server 130 may include a suggestion manager 410 , a user statistics manager 420 , a user profile database 430 , a ranking component 440 , a flagging component 450 , and a flagged documents database 460 .
- Suggestion manager 410 may receive an indication that a user has accessed a document.
- suggestion manager 410 may receive an indication from comments add-on application 510 that a user has accessed a particular document.
- the indication may include, for example, information identifying the accessed document (e.g., a URL of the document) and information identifying the user (e.g., a string which may be used to locate a user profile associated with the user).
- Suggestion manager 410 may determine whether to provide a suggestion to the user to write a comment about the accessed document. Suggestion manager 410 may determine whether to provide the suggestion based on whether the accessed document has been flagged as needing comments, whether the accessed document is related to the user's interests, areas of expertise, or geographic area, and based on the user's author likelihood score. Suggestion manager 410 may compare the user's author likelihood score to a suggestion threshold and may provide an instruction to client device 110 to provide a suggestion to the user to write a comment about the accessed document when the user's author likelihood score is greater than the suggestion threshold.
- Suggestion manager 410 may provide a list of ranked documents to a user.
- a user may be an active author of comments and may want to know which documents are the most in need of comments.
- Suggestion manager 410 may receive a request from a user for a ranked list of documents in need of comments, and may provide a ranked list of documents, in need of comments, to the user.
- suggestion manager 410 may provide a ranked list of documents, in need of comments, to a user at periodic intervals without receiving a request for a ranked list of documents, in need of comments, from the user.
- User statistics manager 420 may maintain statistics associated with a user. For example, user statistics manager 420 may compute, adjust, or receive from the comments add-on application, a user's comment productivity score. A user's comment productivity score may measure how often a user has written comments in the past. User statistics manager 420 may compute, adjust, or receive from the comments add-on application, a user's social graph productivity score. A user's social graph productivity score may measure how often a user authors content on web sites associated with the user's social graph (described below). User statistics manager 420 may compute, adjust, or receive from the comments add-on application, a user's expert postings score. A user's expert postings score may measure how often the user posts to expert web sites.
- User statistics manager 420 may compute, adjust, or receive from the comments add-on application, a user's author likelihood score.
- a user's author likelihood score may measure how likely the user is to write comments, and may be computed based on one or more of the user's comment productivity score, social graph productivity score, or expert postings score.
- User statistics manager 420 may determine information about the user's interests and/or areas of expertise. Information about the user's interests and/or areas of expertise may be determined based on the user's browsing history and/or activity, based on information collected from documents accessed by the user, based on input received from the user, or based on any other techniques to obtain information about a user. Furthermore, user statistics manager 420 may determine a URL hot list for a user. A user's URL hot list may list URLs in which the user has expressed a recent interest. User statistics component 420 may store information about the user in user profile database 430 .

- Ranking component 440 may rank documents based on one or more objective criteria.
- the objective criteria may include a quantity of explicit comment requests associated with the particular document, a quantity of implicit comment requests associated with the particular document, a recency of the particular document (e.g., how long ago the particular document was created), a measure of popularity of the particular document, a measure of popularity of the particular document with regard to a particular popular topic, or a measure of popularity of the particular document with respect to one or more blogging or microblogging web sites.
- a score may be computed for the particular document for each objective criterion and the scores may be combined, based on a weighted sum, into an objective rank score.
- Ranking component 440 may receive one or more subjective criteria associated with a user from user statistics manager 420 (or from comments add-on application 510 ) and may rank documents that have been flagged as needing comments based on the one or more subjective criteria relating to a particular user.
- the subjective criteria may include whether a particular document relates to the identified user's interests or areas of expertise, whether the particular document's address is included in the user's URL hot list, whether the particular document is associated with the user's geographic area, or whether the particular document is associated with the user's language.
- a score may be computed for the particular document for each subjective criterion, relating to the particular user, and the scores may be combined, based on a weighted sum, into a subjective rank score.
- ranking component 440 may combine the objective rank score and subjective rank score for a document into a combined rank score and may provide a list of ranked documents needing comments based on the combined rank score. In another implementation, ranking component 440 may provide a first list of documents flagged as needing comments, ranked based on objective criteria, to a user and may provide a second list of documents flagged as needing comments, ranked based on subjective criteria relating to the user, to the user.
- Flagging component 450 may identify documents that need comments and may flag the documents as needing comments. Flagging component 450 may identify a particular document as needing comments based on receiving explicit or implicit requests for comments for the document from client device 110 (or other client devices).
- Flagging component 450 may identify recent news documents without comments and may flag the identified recent news documents as needing comments. Flagging component 450 may identify recent news documents without comments by, for example, accessing a news document index associated with one or more news servers.
- Flagging component 450 may identify documents, associated with products, businesses, books, or published papers without comments, as needing comments. Flagging component 450 may identify documents associated with products, businesses, books, or published papers without comments by, for example, accessing indices associated with products, businesses, books, or published papers at one or more servers associated with products, businesses, books, or published papers.
- Flagging component 450 may identify documents, with rank scores higher than a particular rank score threshold with respect to popular topics, and without comments, as needing comments. Flagging component 450 may identify documents with rank scores higher than a particular rank score threshold with respect to popular topics by accessing a global document index associated with one or more search engine servers. Furthermore, flagging component 450 may identify documents, without comments, that are being discussed in blogs or microblogs. Flagging component 450 may identify document being discussed in blogs or microblogs by accessing a document index associated with one or more servers that crawl blogging and/or microblogging web sites.
- Flagging component 450 may flag identified documents as needing comments if the documents do not have any associated comments (or if the documents do not have any associated comments with a rating higher than a particular rating threshold) and meet one or more other associated criteria (e.g., a particular popularity score, a particular quantity of explicit request for comments, or a particular quantity of implicit requests for comments). Flagging component 450 may store information about the identified documents in flagged documents database 460 .
- Flagged documents database 460 may store information about documents that have been flagged as needing comments or for which requests for comments have been received.
- a document record for a document stored in flagged documents database 460 may include, for example, a quantity of explicit requests received for the document, a quantity of implicit requests received for the document, topics associated with the document, a popularity score associated with the document, whether the document has been flagged as needing comments, and an objective rank score associated with the document.

- a main browser application such as, for example, GOOGLE CHROME, MOZILLA FIREFOX, MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER, APPLE SAFARI, NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR, or Opera.
- Comments add-on application 520 may request comments from comments server 130 and store any received comments in comments cache 530 .
- comments add-on application 520 may send request for comments 112 automatically in response to a user visiting web page 101 and may receive any comments from comments server 130 based on a determination by comments server 130 as to whether to automatically send comments.
- comments add-on application 520 may make a determination as to whether to automatically request comments based on one or more criteria, such as the particular document a user is visiting, user statistics associated with the user's past history of accessing comments, a type and/or version of the browser application that the user is using, a browser add-on application version that the user is using, or temporal information associated with the document visit.
- Local user statistics database 520 may store statistics associated with the user. For example, local user statistics database 520 may store information that, if provided to comments server 130 , may violate the user's privacy. For example, local user statistics database 520 may store information about posts that the user makes to expert web sites, may store the user's browsing history, may store keywords associated with the user's posts or the user's browsing history, and comments add-on application 510 may compute scores based on the user's activities and/or private information associated with the user. The computed scores may be sent to comments server 130 by comments add-on application 510 with an anonymous identifier string, which may be used to locate a user profile associated with a user, without revealing the user's identity.
- an anonymous identifier string which may be used to locate a user profile associated with a user, without revealing the user's identity.

- URL Uniform Resource Locator
- User ID field 610 may store information that identifies a particular user. In one implementation, user ID field 610 may not include any information that may be used to determine a user's actual identity. For example, user ID field 610 may include a string that may be matched to a string, identifying a user, included in a request for comments received from client device 110 .
- Comment productivity score field 620 may store a score that measures a user's comment productivity.
- the comment productivity score may be based on whether a user has previously written comments about documents. In one implementation, each time a user writes a comment, the user's comment productivity score may be increased. Additionally or alternatively, a user's comment productivity may be based on an average amount of time that elapses between two instances of a user writing a comment or how much time has elapsed since the user has written a comment, and/or how many documents the user has accessed since writing a comment. Thus, for example, if a particular period of time has passed since the user has authored a comment, or if the user has accessed a particular number of documents since the user has authored a comment, the user's comment productivity score may be decreased.
- Social graph productivity score field 630 may store a score that measures a user's productivity associated with the user's social graph.
- a user's social graph may include online content that may be identified as relating to the user.
- a user's social graph may include the user's homepage or any other document primarily about the user; the user's accounts associated with social networking web sites (e.g., FACEBOOK, MYSPACE, LINKEDIN, BEBO, Meetup, Orkut, etc.); the user's accounts associated with blogging web sites (e.g., BLOGGER, LIVEJOURNAL, WORDPRESS, etc.); the user's accounts associated with microblogging or liveblogging web sites (e.g., GOOGLE Buzz, TWITTER, TUMBLR, Plurk, etc.); the user's accounts associated with social news or bookmarking web sites (e.g., Digg, REDDIT, Delicious, SLASHDOT, etc.); the user's accounts associated with content sharing web sites (e.
- accounts associated with a user's social graph may be identified using other techniques. For example, accounts associated with a user may be identified by asking the user to specifically provide information about the user's accounts, or by searching the Internet for accounts that include the user's name or other information that may uniquely identify the user.
- a user's social graph productivity score may be determined based on how much content a user has provided in connection with the user's accounts or how often the user updates the accounts. For example, if the user provides updates to a blogging or microblogging account at a particular frequency, the user's social productivity score may be increased.
- Expert postings score field 640 may store a score that measures whether a user has provided posts to web sites associated with a particular area of expertise. Examples of web sites associated with a particular area of expertise may include public encyclopedia articles (e.g., WIKIPEDIA or a wiki web site associated with a particular topic) or forums or message boards associated with a particular topic. For example, if a user is a WIKIPEDIA author, the user's expert postings score may be increased.
- Author likelihood score field 650 may store a score that indicates a likelihood that a user will become an author of comments.
- the author likelihood score of a user may be based on one or more of a comment productivity score of the user, a social graph productivity score of the user, or an expert postings score of the user.
- Interests and expertise field 660 may store interests and areas of expertise associated with the user. Interests of the user may be determined, for example, based on the user's browsing history. Topics associated with documents accessed by the user may be stored as the user's interests. The user's areas of expertise may be determined, for example, based on posts or articles authored by the user for web sites associated with a particular topic, and may be stored as the user's areas of expertise. Additionally or alternatively, a user may be prompted to enter the user's interests and areas of expertise, and this information may be stored in the interests and expertise field 660 .
- URL hot list field 670 may store URLs in which the user has expressed a recent interest.
- a particular URL may be stored in URL hot list field 670 , for example, if a user accesses a document associated with the particular URL at least a particular number of times within a particular time period.
- a particular URL may be stored in the URL hot list field 670 if the user has mentioned the particular URL, or provided a link to the particular URL, in a document associated with the user's social graph. For example, if the user mentions a particular document in a blog, a URL associated with the document may be stored in URL hot list field 670 .

- FIG. 7 is a diagram of exemplary data fields of a document record 700 that may be stored in the flagged documents database of FIG. 4 .
- Document record 700 associated with a particular document, may be used to rank the particular document, in a list of documents that have been flagged as needing comments.
- Document record 700 may include a document ID field 710 , a number of explicit requests field 720 , a number of implicit requests field 730 , a topics field 740 , a popularity score 750 , a need comments flag 760 , and an objective rank score field 770 .
- Document ID field 710 may store a string that uniquely identifies a particular document.
- document ID field 710 may store a URL associated with a document.
- Number of explicit requests field 720 may store a value reflecting a quantity of explicit requests for comments associated with the document. If a user selects “Request Comments” button 195 while accessing a document, this may be considered an explicit request for comments for the document, and the value in number of explicit requests field 720 may be increased.
- Number of implicit requests field 730 may store a value reflecting a quantity of implicit requests for comments associated with the document. If a user selects comments button 170 while accessing a document, this may be considered an implicit request for comments for the document, and the value stored in number of implicit requests field 730 may be increased.
- Topics field 740 may store information regarding one or more topics associated with the document.
- the topics may be based, for example, on a hierarchical category scheme. Topics for a document may be determined based on manual entry or based on an automated technique, such as, for example, keyword analysis of the text of a document. Topics field 740 may also include geographic topics. Thus, for example, a document about an expensive Italian restaurant in New York may include the topics “Italian restaurants,” “fine dining,” and “New York.”
- Popularity score 750 may include a score that reflects a popularity of the document.
- the popularity of a document may be based on one or more factors that may include, for example, a global rank of the document, a rank of the document in a particular topic, or a number of times that the document has been accessed in a particular period of time.
- Need comments flag 760 may include an indication of whether the document has been flagged as needing comments. For example, need comments flag 760 may be set if a particular quantity of explicit comment requests and/or a particular quantity of implicit comment requests has been received for a document.
- Objective rank score field 770 may store an objective rank score that indicates how the document ranks in a list of documents that have been identified as needing comments.
- the objective rank score for a particular document may be based on one or more objective criteria, including a quantity of explicit comment requests associated with the particular document, a quantity of implicit comment requests associated with the particular document, a recency of the particular document (e.g., how long ago the particular document was created), a measure of popularity of the particular document, a measure of a popularity of the particular document with respect to a particular topic, or a measure of popularity of the particular document with respect to one or more blogging or microblogging web sites.
- a score may be computed for the particular document for each objective criterion and one or more of the computed scores may be combined, based on a weighted sum, into an objective rank score.
- the objective rank score may be used to provide a ranked list of documents to a user when the user requests a list of documents that need comments.
- document record 700 may contain fewer fields, different fields, additional fields, or differently arranged fields than depicted in FIG. 7 . Additionally or alternatively, one or more fields of document record 700 may include information described as being included in one or more other fields of document record 700 .
- FIG. 8A is a flowchart of an exemplary process for determining an author likelihood score for a user.
- the process of FIG. 8A may be performed by comments server 130 .
- some or all of the process of FIG. 8A may be performed by another device or a group of devices separate from or including comments server 130 .
- the process of FIG. 8A may include determining a user's comment productivity score (block 810 ).
- user statistics manager 420 (or comments add-on application 510 ) may generate or adjust a user's comment productivity score based on how many comments the user has written and/or based on a period of time over which the comments were written or based on how many documents the user has accessed over the same time period. For example, each time that a user writes a comment, the user's comment productivity score may be increased. As another example, if a particular period of time passes without the user writing a comment, or if the user accesses a particular number of documents without the user writing a comment, the user's comment productivity score may be decreased.
- a user's comment productivity score may be based on a logistic function
- a user's comment productivity score may rise rapidly as a function of the number of written comments initially, and may rise slower as the number of written comments increases.
- the comment productivity score may distinguish between users that write comments and users that do not write comments. As the percentage of users that actually contribute comments may be small, the fact that a user has written even one comment in the past may be considered significant.
- the difference between a first user that has written two comments and a second user that has written one hundred comments may not be as significant as the different between a first user that has written one comment and a second user that has never written a comment.
- the user's productivity score may be based on another type of function.
- a user's comment productivity score may additionally be based on how much time has elapsed since the last time the user wrote a comment.
- the user's productivity score may be set to decay at an exponential rate, starting from a time when the user last wrote and/or edited a comment.
- a decay constant may be set based on empirical observations.
- the comment productivity score may be recalculated, based on the new number of comments written by the user, and based on either a non-decayed value of the comment productivity score, a decayed value of the comment productivity, or a combination of a decayed and non-decayed value (e.g., an average of a decayed and non-decayed value).
- the decay of the comment productivity score may be reset when the user authors a new comment, and a new recalculated comment productivity score may start to decay.
- the user's comment productivity score may decrease over time, from a time when the user last wrote a comment, in a manner different from an exponential decay function (e.g., linearly).
- the comment productivity score may not decrease over time.
- the user's comment productivity score may be stored in comment productivity score field 620 of the user's user profile 600 .
- a user's social graph productivity score may be determined (block 820 ).
- user statistics manager 420 may generate or adjust a user's social graph productivity score based on how much content a user has provided in connection with the user's accounts or how often the user updates the accounts.
- the user may have a high social graph productivity score.
- the user's social graph productivity score may be stored in social graph productivity score field 630 of the user's user profile 600 .
- a user's expert postings score may be determined (block 830 ). For example, user statistics manager 420 (or comments add-on application 510 ) may generate or adjust a user's expert postings score based on how much or how often the user provides content to a web site associated with a particular area of expertise. For example, if the user writes a WIKIPEDIA article or posts a comment to a forum or message board, comments add-on application 510 may provide an indication to user statistics manager 420 of comments server 130 to increase the user's expert postings score.
- the user's expert postings score may be stored in expert postings field 640 of the user's user profile 600 .
- a user's author likelihood score may be determined (block 840 ). For example, user statistics manager 420 (or comments add-on application 510 ) may generate or adjust a user's author likelihood score based on one or more of the user's comment productivity score, the user's social graph productivity score, or the user's expert postings score.
- the user's author likelihood score may be stored in author likelihood score field 650 of the user's user profile 600 .
- scores associated with a user may be computed locally using comments add-on application 510 , and provided to comments server 130 .
- comments server 130 may not receive any information associated with particular accounts of the user or particular web sites visited by the user. Rather, comments server 130 may only receive scores associated with the user. This may particularly be the case for the expert postings score, as the user may be posting under an anonymous user name (as opposed to the social graph productivity score, which may be based on public links and public content).
- FIG. 8B is a diagram of an exemplary author likelihood function 800 for generating an author likelihood score for a user.
- Author likelihood function 800 may, for a particular user, take, as input values, for one or more of the depicted parameters and generate an author likelihood score 845 .
- author likelihood function 800 may be implemented by comments server 130 . In another implementation, author likelihood function 800 may be implemented by the comments add-on application 520 of client device 110 .
- Author likelihood function 800 may include a comment productivity score input 815 associated with a user.
- Comment productivity score input 815 may include a measure of whether a user has written comments in the past and/or how often the user has written comments.
- a benefit of using a comment productivity score as an input to author likelihood function 800 may include identifying users that have written comments in the past. Users that have written comments in the past may be more likely to author comments in the future.
- Author likelihood function 800 may include a social graph productivity score input 825 associated with a user.
- Social graph productivity score input 825 may include a measure of how much content a user posts in association with the user's social graph and/or how often a user posts content in association with the user's social graph.
- a benefit of using social graph productivity score 825 as an input to author likelihood function 800 may include identifying users that post a lot of online content. Users that post a lot of online content may be more likely to author comments.
- Author likelihood function 800 may include an expert postings score input 835 associated with a user.
- Expert postings score input 835 may include a measure of how much a user posts content to expert web sites and/or how often the user posts content to expert web sites.
- a benefit of using expert postings score 835 as an input to author likelihood function 800 may include identifying users that post a lot of content regarding particular topics. Users that post a lot of expert content, regarding particular topics, may be more likely to author comments regarding these topics, and/or may be more likely to author comments in general.
- One or more of the inputs of author likelihood function 800 may be combined to generate an author likelihood score 845 for a user.
- inputs of author likelihood function 800 may be combined as a weighted sum.
- each of the inputs of author likelihood function 800 may be multiplied by a weight and the results may be added to generate author likelihood score 845 .
- comment productivity score input 815 may be given a greater weight than the other inputs, and thus author likelihood score 845 may depend most significantly on comment productivity score input 815 .
- expert postings score input 835 may be given more weight than social graph productivity score 825 , as users that post expert content may be more likely to provide a useful comment than users that post to social networking web sites.
- comment productivity score input 815 may not influence author likelihood score 845 unless the values are greater than particular thresholds.
- social graph productivity score input 825 may not influence a user's author likelihood score 645 unless the user's social graph is associated with a particular level of prolificacy.
- FIG. 8B shows exemplary inputs of author likelihood function 800
- author likelihood function 800 may contain fewer inputs, different inputs, or additional inputs, than depicted in FIG. 8B .

- FIG. 9 is a flowchart of an exemplary process for flagging documents that are in need of comments according to an implementation described herein.
- the process of FIG. 9 may be performed by comments server 130 .
- some or all of the process of FIG. 9 may be performed by another device or a group of devices separate from or including comments server 130 .
- the process of FIG. 9 may be applied only to documents that do not have any associated comments. In other words, if at least one user has written a comment about a particular document, the particular document may be removed from consideration when determining whether a document is in need of comments.
- the process of FIG. 9 may be applied to documents that do not include comments with a particular rating. For example, users may be able to rate comments.
- a document may be removed from consideration, when determining whether a document is in need of comments, if the document has at least one highly rated comment (e.g., a comment with a combined ratings score, based on ratings of the comment by other users, above a particular rating threshold). However, if a document includes one or more comments, yet none of the comments are highly rated, the document may still be considered as needing comments.
- highly rated comment e.g., a comment with a combined ratings score, based on ratings of the comment by other users, above a particular rating threshold.
- the process of FIG. 9 may include identifying documents associated with explicit comment requests (block 910 ).
- flagging component 450 may receive an indication of an explicit request for comments in response to a user selecting “Request Comments” button 195 when accessing a particular document.
- flagging component 450 may adjust or generate a value for number of explicit requests field 720 of document record 700 associated with the particular document.
- a document may be flagged as needing comments if the quantity of explicit comment requests received is greater than an explicit requests threshold.
- the explicit requests threshold may be set to one. Thus, a single explicit request for comments may be enough to flag the document as needing comments.
- Documents associated with implicit comment requests may be determined (block 920 ). For example, flagging component 450 may receive an indication of an implicit request for comments in response to a user selecting comments button 170 to view comments associated with a particular document. In response to receiving the indication, flagging component 450 may adjust or generate a value for number of implicit requests field 730 of document record 700 associated with the particular document. A document may be flagged as needing comments if the quantity of implicit requests received is greater than an implicit requests threshold. In one implementation, the implicit requests threshold may be set higher than the explicit requests threshold.
- Recent news documents may be identified (block 930 ).
- flagging component 450 may identify documents that include content associated with recent events and that were created within a particular time period as measured from a current time (e.g., within the last 24 hours).
- flagging component 450 may be configured to query a crawling server or a news server at particular intervals for indications of news documents associated with recent events.
- all recent news documents e.g., created within the last 24 hours
- associated with a particular news server may be flagged as needing comments.
- recent news documents associated with a particular popularity score, associated with a particular quantity of explicit comment requests, associated with a particular quantity of implicit comment requests, or a combination thereof may be flagged as needing comments.

- Highly ranked documents in popular topics may be identified (block 950 ).
- flagging component 450 may identify documents associated with a particular topic and associated with a measure of popularity, for the particular topic (or category), greater than a popularity threshold.
- the popularity of topics may be measured, for example, by a quantity of search queries that include a keyword or phrase associated with a particular topic (or category).
- the popularity of a document may be measured based on a rank of the document in a search engine ranking for a query associated with the topic, a number of times the document has been accessed by users, or a combination thereof.
- a particular number of the most highly ranked documents (e.g., documents with a rank score higher than a particular rank threshold) in a popular topic may be automatically flagged as needing comments, if such documents do not include any associated comments. For example, assume that based on a quantity of search queries submitted within a prior 24 hour period, “health care” is determined to be a popular topic. The top ten documents, either tagged with a “health care” topic and/or with the ten highest rank scores with respect to the phrase “health care,” which do not have any associated comments, may be flagged as needing comments.
- highly ranked documents in a particular topic may be flagged as needing comments if the particular documents are associated with a particular time period, associated with a particular quantity of explicit comment requests, associated with a particular quantity of implicit comment requests, or a combination thereof.

- a particular number of the most popular documents being discussed may be identified.
- a particular number of the most popular keywords or phrases being discussed may be retrieved and may be used to identify the most popular document associated with the popular keywords.
- flagging component 450 may access the TWITTER web site and determine that the most popular phrase currently being discussed is “health care.” Flagging component 450 may then identify the most popular documents associated with a “health care” topic and may determine whether any of the identified documents do not have associated comments (or do not have highly rated associated comments).
- a particular number of the most popular documents being discussed may be automatically flagged as needing comments, if such documents do not include any associated comments.
- a particular number of the most popular documents being discussed may be flagged as needing comments if the particular documents are associated with a particular time period, associated with a particular quantity of explicit comment requests, associated with a particular quantity of implicit comment requests, or a combination thereof.
- the identified documents may be flagged as needing comments (block 970 ). Any documents identified in blocks 910 - 960 may be flagged if the documents do not have any associated comments (or if the documents do not have any associated highly rated comments) and meet or exceed one or more other associated criteria (e.g., a particular popularity score, a particular quantity of explicit request for comments, or a particular quantity of implicit requests for comments). For example, flagging component 450 may create document records 700 for the identified documents and may set need comments flag 760 for any documents that are flagged as needing comments.

- user statistics manager 420 or comments add-on application 510 ) may identify URLs of documents in which the user has expressed a recent interest.
- a particular URL may be identified as a hot list URL, for example, if a user accesses a document, associated with the particular URL, at least a particular number of times within a particular time period.
- a particular URL may be identified as a hot list URL, for example, if the user has mentioned the particular URL, or provided a link to the particular URL, in a document associated with the user's social graph.
- a URL associated with the document may be identified as a hot list URL.
- a URL may also be identified as a hot list URL if the user is an author of a document identified by the URL.
- URLs identified as hot list URLs may be stored in URL hot list field 670 of user profile 600 associated with the user.
- a user's interests may be identified based on browsing history (block 1020 ). For example, user statistics manager 420 (or comments add-on application 510 ) may identify keywords associated with documents browsed by the user within a particular time period. For example, keywords may be extracted from documents stored in a browser cache. Documents may be labeled with one or more categorical topics. The user's interests may also be determined based on topics associated with documents browsed by the user within a particular time period. Identified interests of the user may be stored in interests and expertise field 660 of user profile 600 associated with the user.
- a user's expertise may be identified based on content authored by the user (block 1030 ).

- the user's author likelihood score may be adjusted (block 1170 ).
- user statistics manager 420 may adjust the user's author likelihood score based on one or more criteria associated with the accessed document. For example, if the accessed document is related to the user's interests, areas of expertise, or geographic area, the user's author likelihood score may be increased by a particular value. A user may be more likely to write a comment about a document that relates to the user's interests, areas of expertise, or geographic area. As another example, if the accessed document is not associated with a language that the user understands, the user's author likelihood score may be decreased. A user may be less likely to write a comment about a document if the document is in a language that the user does not understand.
- the user's author likelihood score may be increased. A user may be more likely to write a comment about a document that has been associated with the user in some way. As yet a further example, a user's author likelihood score may be adjusted based on a time of day or day of week. A user may be more likely to write a comment for a document in the evening or on the weekend, when the user may have more free time, and less likely to write a comment during business hours.
- the adjusted author likelihood score may be compared to a suggestion threshold (block 1180 ).
- suggestion manager 410 may compare the adjusted author likelihood score to a suggestion threshold. If it is determined that the adjusted author likelihood score is less than or equal to the suggestion threshold (block 1180 —NO), no suggestion may be provided (block 1140 ). For example, suggestion manager 410 may not provide an instruction to comments add-on application 510 to display a suggestion to the user to write a comment for the document.
- a suggestion to write a comment may be provided to the user (block 1190 ).
- suggestion manager 410 may send an instruction to comments add-on application to display a suggestion to the user to write a comment for the document.

- the process of FIG. 15 may be performed by comments server 130 .
- some or all of the process of FIG. 15 may be performed by another device or a group of devices separate from or including comments server 130 .
- the process of the example of FIG. 15 may include receiving an indication that a user has accessed a document (block 1510 ).
- comments add-on application 510 may send an indication to comments server 130 that the user has accessed the document.
- the indication may include a URL identifying the document and a user identification string that may be used to identify a user profile associated with a user.
- the accessed document may be identified as flagged as needing comments (block 1520 ).
- flagging component 450 may determine that a document record 700 exists that is associated with the received URL and that need comments flag 760 of document record 700 has been set.
- the user's likelihood score may be retrieved from author likelihood score field 650 of user profile 600 associated with the received user identification string (block 1530 ). Assume that the user has written 2 comments within the last couple of weeks and based on this fact, the comment productivity score of the user has been set to 0.2. Further assume that the user does not post frequently to web sites associated with the user's social graph and that the user's social graph productivity score has been set to 0. Further assume that the user has written one WIKIPEDIA article in the last month and based on this fact, the user's expert postings score has been set to 0.1.
- the user's author likelihood score is based on a sum of the user's comment productivity score, the user's social graph productivity score, and the user's expert postings score.
- the user's author likelihood score may in this case be 0.3.
- User statistics manager 420 may compare topics field 740 of document record 700 of the accessed document with interests and expertise field 660 of user profile 600 associated with the user and determine that the document is related to an interest of the user. For example, assume that the user frequently browses documents tagged with a “gardening” topic, and that the accessed document is also tagged with a “gardening” topic. Thus, the user's author likelihood score may be increased based on a topic associated with the document relating to an interest of the user (block 1540 ). In this case, assume user statistics manager 420 increases the user's author likelihood score by 0.1 to 0.4.
- a suggestion may be provided to the user to write a comment about the document (block 1560 ).
- suggestion manager 410 may send an instruction to comment add-on application 510 to provide a suggestion, and comment add-on application 510 may display suggestion 1210 in browser window 150 .
- logic or a “component” that performs one or more functions.
- the terms “logic” or “component” may include hardware, such as a processor, an ASIC, or a FPGA, or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., software running on a processor).
Abstract
Description
type function, where T represents a quantity of comments written by the user). Thus, a user's comment productivity score may rise rapidly as a function of the number of written comments initially, and may rise slower as the number of written comments increases. Thus, the comment productivity score may distinguish between users that write comments and users that do not write comments. As the percentage of users that actually contribute comments may be small, the fact that a user has written even one comment in the past may be considered significant. The difference between a first user that has written two comments and a second user that has written one hundred comments may not be as significant as the different between a first user that has written one comment and a second user that has never written a comment. In another implementation, the user's productivity score may be based on another type of function.
