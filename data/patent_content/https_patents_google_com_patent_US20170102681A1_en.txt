- VSCU units versatile sensing and control units
- each VSCU unit being configured and adapted to provide sophisticated, customized, energy-saving HVAC control functionality while at the same time being visually appealing, non-intimidating, elegant to behold, and belovedly easy to use.
- thermostat is used hereinbelow to represent a particular type of VSCU unit (Versatile Sensing and Control) that is particularly applicable for HVAC control in an enclosure.
- thermostat and “VSCU unit” may be seen as generally interchangeable for the contexts of HVAC control of an enclosure, it is within the scope of the present teachings for each of the embodiments hereinabove and hereinbelow to be applied to VSCU units having control functionality over measurable characteristics other than temperature (e.g., pressure, flow rate, height, position, velocity, acceleration, capacity, power, loudness, brightness) for any of a variety of different control systems involving the governance of one or more measurable characteristics of one or more physical systems, and/or the governance of other energy or resource consuming systems such as water usage systems, air usage systems, systems involving the usage of other natural resources, and systems involving the usage of various other forms of energy.
- measurable characteristics other than temperature e.g., pressure, flow rate, height, position, velocity, acceleration, capacity, power, loudness, brightness
- thermodynamic behavioral modeling of structures In many modern systems, including systems such include HVAC systems which manage the environmental characteristics in a structure, it is desirable to predict the thermodynamic behavior of a structure. Such predictions may have a variety of tangible, beneficial uses. In modern building control systems, such predictions may be used on a daily basis to accurately actuate the system in reaching or maintaining desired setpoint temperatures or to manage energy consumption. In addition, such predictions may be made available to third party vendors so that the third party vendor can coordinate the operation of their respective third party devices in connection with the building system and/or other third party devices operating within the structure in order to manage energy consumption within the structure.
- third party devices can be refrigerators, freezers, lighting systems, energy storage systems, or other energy related devices contained within the structure.
- a third party application can be provided with a thermal model prediction, and based on that prediction, can schedule run times of its respective device so that it is staggered with the run time of the building system. This way, the operation of the building control system and the third party device can be staggered so as to reduce potential for peak power consumption events.
- the third party devices and the building control system are disparately controlled. That is, each device is independently controlled by its own control system/software; they are not all controlled by a single god-like device that has infinite knowledge of all devices operating within the enclosure. Although, a single god-like device is in theory possible, implementation of such a device is not practical and do not work.
- Embodiments discussed herein provide a smart control system associated with a HVAC system can generate near-term predictive models to simulate operation of the HVAC system and the thermal response of the enclosure to predict a control trajectory of the HVAC system over the future near-term interval. The predictions can be generated using, for example, a state space model that accurately predicts when the HVAC system will be ON and OFF during the future near-term interval.
- This information can be stored in a database that is accessible by the third party vendor of a third party device.
- the third party vendor can use the predicted run time operation of the HVAC system to make sure that run times of the third party device are staggered with the predicted run time operation of the HVAC system, while also optimizing the operation of the third party device in view of the constraints.
- the third party vendor can publish its third party run time schedule to the database so that other vendors can access it and take it and the model prediction into account when formulating their respective run time schedules. If conflicts exist between among two or more third party vendors (i.e., both vendors have overlapping active operation periods that would result in excessive power consumption), a server (e.g., the server that maintains the database) may arbitrate which vendor has priority. The priority may be based on any number of different suitable criteria, including for example, first vendor in line, preferred vendors, and designated priority of vendors.
- thermodynamic model itself may be defined by a state space model that characterizes the thermodynamic response of an enclosure, such as indoor temperature, in response to application of a stimulus, such as a change in HVAC actuation state and outdoor temperature.
- the state-space model is adaptable to incorporate actual measured data to update the model and is adaptable to incorporate new inputs and measured data points.
- thermodynamic may include all state variables that can be used to characterize a physical system. Examples of thermodynamic variables include, but are not limited to: pressure, temperature, airflow, humidity, and particulate matter.
- model refers generally to a description or representation of a system. The description or representation can use mathematical language, such as in the case of mathematical models. Examples of such models used herein include state-space model or multi-input, multi-output systems.
- the thermal model described herein can enable a control system, a thermostat and/or servers to compute accurate predictions related to temperature, humidity, HVAC runtime, and other factors pertaining to a particular enclosure.
- the thermal model can be used to predict energy consumption of the HVAC system to achieve desired thermal characteristics within the enclosure within a future time frame.
- the results of the thermal model can be used by a thermostat contained within the enclosure to control the operation of the HVAC system.
- the results of the thermal model can be also used as data inputs to the company that sells the thermostat so that information can be further analyzed, for example, by more powerful computers.
- the analyzed results of the thermal model may be provided to third party vendors (e.g., a smart home refrigerator vendor or energy partner so that it can make better assessments of energy production).
- third party providers may be granted access to the thermal model and/or its results via an API.

For example, intelligence components 116 can detect that a particular device is turned on every week day at 6:30 am, or that a device setting is gradually adjusted from a high setting to lower settings over the last three hours. Intelligence components 116 can then predict that the device is to be turned on every week day at 6:30 am or that the setting should continue to gradually lower its setting over a longer time period.
- devices can interact with each other such that events detected by a first device influence actions of a second device.
- a first device can detect that a user has pulled into a garage (e.g., by detecting motion in the garage, detecting a change in light in the garage or detecting opening of the garage door).
- the first device can transmit this information to a second device, such that the second device can, e.g., adjust a home temperature setting, a light setting, a music setting, and/or a security-alarm setting.
- a first device can detect a user approaching a front door (e.g., by detecting motion or sudden light-pattern changes).
- the first device can, e.g., cause a general audio or visual signal to be presented (e.g., such as sounding of a doorbell) or cause a location-specific audio or visual signal to be presented (e.g., to announce the visitor's presence within a room that a user is occupying).
- a general audio or visual signal e.g., such as sounding of a doorbell
- a location-specific audio or visual signal e.g., to announce the visitor's presence within a room that a user is occupying.

- FIG. 6 illustrates an example of system 600 in which third party devices can access a database containing predictive models of enclosure 610 according to various embodiments.
- FIG. 6 can include enclosure 610 , remote server 620 , and third party vendors 630 , each of which may communicate with each other.
- Enclosure 610 can be a simplified version of smart home environment 200 (of FIG. 2 ).
- Enclosure 610 may include thermal model 611 , which may be executed within a thermostat (not shown), third party devices 615 a - c , and building control system 617 .
- Thermal model 611 can generate any suitable number of different model predictions 612 , including, for example, system usage predictions 613 and temperature predictions 614 .
- System usage predictions 613 may predict the run time operation of building control system 617 (e.g., an HVAC system) for a future timeframe.
- Model predictions 612 can be provided to remote server 620 on a periodic basis (e.g., once a day) or on demand.
- Remote server 620 can include thermal model 622 and database 624 .
- Remote server 620 can be any suitable server that can communicate with enclosure 610 and third party vendors 630 .
- Thermal model 622 may be used in lieu of, or in addition to, thermal model 611 .
- thermal model 622 may be used if additional processing power is needed to generate the model predictions.
- Database 624 may store model predictions provided by thermal model 611 and/or thermal model 622 .
- Database 624 may also store run time schedules provided by any one or more of third party vendors 630 .
- Third party vendors 630 can be remote servers or applications affiliated with a third party device (e.g., one of devices 615 ) contained in enclosure 610 .
- third party vendor 635 a may be affiliated with third party device 615 a

- Third party vendors 630 can communicate with their respective devices (directly or indirectly via remote server 620 ) and can control the operation of their devices.
- third party vendors can generate run time schedules that govern the operation of the devices.
- third party vendors 630 can access model predictions and/or other third party stored run time schedules stored in database 624 and can generate a run time schedule for its respective third party device. This way, when the third party device operates according to its run time schedule, the third party device's operation is coordinated with the predicted operation of the building control system.
- the runtime schedule can vary depending on the type of third party device to which it is associated. For example, if the third party device is an energy consumption device, such as a refrigerator, then the run time schedule can include an ON/OFF run time schedule. If the third party device is an energy storage unit, such as a battery or car, the run time schedule can define a charge/discharge schedule.
- Thermal model 611 or 622 may include computational logic that is operable to predict the thermodynamic behavior of a structure based historical observations of the enclosure, and inputs affecting the thermodynamics of the enclosure.
- Thermal models 611 and 622 may include a variety of computational logic for modeling such predictions, such as a thermodynamic state-space model engine and its own database.
- the thermodynamic state-space model engine can be a recursively learning model that characterizes the thermodynamic properties of an enclosure (e.g., structure such as a house) by taking any into any number of different inputs that affect the thermodynamic characteristics of the enclosure and learning from any errors in its predictions of any number of outputs generated to quantify environmental parameters of the enclosure based on actual internal enclosure parameter measurements fed back into the model.
- the thermal model database can maintain historical information characterizing the enclosure and sensor data.
- the historical information can include all data collected over the lifetime of the enclosure thereby providing a comprehensive historical database for model engine to leverage when modeling thermodynamic characteristics of the enclosure.
- the historical information stored in the database may be selectively updated with new data and with a bias to “forget” old data. This way, whenever relatively abrupt changes are introduced into the enclosure (e.g., a new sensor that provides additional measurement data or a new input), such changes are rapidly assimilated into to the database so that the model engine is provided with up-to-date data to provide more accurate predictions. This is in contrast with conventional database paradigms that have to rebuild a model from scratch whenever such an abrupt change is introduced.
- the model engine is not constrained as such because its state-space representation of the enclosure immediately evolves in response to any new data stored in the model database.
- the thermal model according to embodiments discussed herein can be represented by a linear multi input multi output (MIMO) system, and in particular can be represented by a linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space system.
- MIMO linear multi input multi output
- LTI linear time-invariant
- the inputs for the thermal model can be actual physical factors that affect the thermal dynamics of the enclosure. This is in contrast to conventional models that empirically determine nonlinear inputs.
- the thermal model can be general model that is learned and mapped for example to different zones.
- HVAC operational stages can include no HVAC operations, first stage heat, first and second stage heat, and first, second, and auxiliary heat.
- the thermal state-space model can employ a recursive subspace identification algorithm that rapidly accommodates new additions of training data.
- the algorithm is recursive in the sense that the model has an intermediate state, which can be used as a history object, which can be stored in the model database. Whenever new training data becomes available, the history object is updated using only the new data.
- the algorithm can employ a “forgetting” factor that enables the thermal model to be adaptive over time.
- the thermal model may be initially programmed with an “out-of-the-box” history object.
- the out-of-the-box history object may be based on the thermostat's geographic location, the HVAC system the thermostat is controlling, enclosure type (e.g., house or office building), and any other suitable criteria. This enables the thermostat to begin immediate thermal modeling predictions, without having to wait for training data to be provided by various devices within the enclosure.
- the “forgetting” factor can enable the thermal model to evolve from the initial model and adapt to the actual thermodynamics of the enclosure.
- the thermal model can be tunable to find a stable higher-order model.
- the ability to tune the order of the model enables the thermal model to account for higher order thermodynamics of the enclosure and thereby compute more accurate predictions (e.g., especially for short-cycle HVAC run times).
- the recursive subspace identification algorithm can tune itself to the highest order model it can sustain. If a particular order model cannot be sustained, the algorithm may attempt to stabilize at a lower order model. And if no order model can be sustained, the set of new training data may be discarded and the model may revert back to the highest sustainable order.

- the B mapping function can represent a mapping that the inputs have on affecting the state of the enclosure.

- FIG. 7C shows yet another illustrative schematic showing another portion of the state-space model that builds on the schematic of FIG. 7B , according to an embodiment.

- y(k) is the predicted internal temperature of enclosure 710 .
- FIG. 7E shows that y(k) can represent outputs for different devices 721 - 724 located in the actual enclosure 720 being modeled by state space model of enclosure 710 .
- FIG. 7D shows yet another illustrative schematic showing another portion of the state-space model that builds on the schematic of FIG. 7C , according to an embodiment.
- FIG. 7D introduces y meas (k), e(k) and mapping function K.
- Y meas (k) can represent actual measured values obtained from one or more sensors located within enclosure 710 .
- y meas (k) can represent temperature and humidity sensor readings from one or more of thermostats and/or smoke detectors located in the enclosure.
- FIG. 7E shows, for example, that devices 721 - 724 are providing measurement data.
- Correction factor e(k) represent the difference between y(k) and y meas (k).
- K represents a mapping that the correction factor e(k) has on updating the next internal state (x(k+1)) of enclosure 710 .
- the mapping functions A, B, C, and K can represent state-space matrices that may be calculated by the thermodynamic state-space engine according to various embodiments on a periodic basis (e.g., once a day).
- the state-space engine may make assumptions that correlations exist between inputs and outputs (e.g., an HVAC input will affect temperature and humidity within the enclosure) so that the state-space matrices (e.g., A, B, C, and K mapping functions) can be calculated.
- the state-space engine can determine that predicted outputs, y(k) and the next state space x(k ⁇ 1) can be calculated.
- thermal model defined by the state-space described in connection with FIGS. 7A-7D is that no model changes are required for enclosures having multiple zones. For example, if additional zones are added to the enclosure, the B and C mappings may be updated to incorporate the additional inputs and the thermal model will automatically incorporate the new factors. There is no need to create additional new models for the new factors. Another advantage is that regardless of how many new inputs and sensors are added to the enclosure, the thermal model can rapidly assimilate the changes and accurately predict the temperature. For example, FIG.
- the state-space model can create new entries for the devices in the y(k) and Y meas (k) vectors, while maintaining the same state-space vector, x.
- the state-space vector will, however, take the new y(k) and Y meas (k) vector entries into account (by way of the e vector) as it updates over time.
- FIG. 8 shows an illustrative schematic representation of state-space model 800 according to an embodiment.
- State-space model 800 can include inputs 810 , current state space 820 , predicted outputs 830 , measured outputs 840 , correction factor 850 , and next state space 860 .
- State-space model 800 also includes A mapping function 870 , which exists between current state space 820 and next state space 860 , B mapping function 871 , which exists between inputs 810 and next state space 860 , C mapping function 872 , which exists between current state space 820 and predicted outputs 830 , and K mapping function 873 , which exists between correction factor 850 and next state space 860 .
- Inputs 810 can represent various factors that can affect the thermodynamic characteristics of an enclosure.
- the inputs can include, for example, HVAC states 811 , outdoor temperature 812 , ambient light 813 , window states 814 , door states 815 , occupancy 816 , clock 817 , and weather 818 .
- HVAC states 811 can represent all the different possible HVAC operational states that can be imposed on the enclosure (e.g., single stage, dual stage, dual stage and auxiliary pump, etc.).
- Outdoor temperature 812 can represent the temperature outside of the enclosure.
- Ambient light 813 can represent how much ambient light is striking the enclosure.

- Weather 818 can indicate current conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) and predicted conditions.
- Predicted outputs 830 can represent various predicted outputs generated by state-space model 800 . Any suitable number of outputs may be generated. If desired, multiple outputs can be generated for each sensor/device. For example, as shown, outputs 831 and 833 may represent predicted indoor temperature for sensors 1 and 2 , respectively, and outputs 832 and 834 may represent predicted indoor humidity for sensors 1 and 2 , respectively. Output 835 may represent a predicted parameter for sensor N.
- sensor 1 can be a thermostat
- sensor 2 can be smoke detector
- sensor N can be a central alarm system.
- Each of the sensors can be located in different regions or zones of the enclosure, thereby providing a basis for thermal model 800 to map and predict parameters at those different zones.
- Measured outputs 840 can represent actual measured data acquired from one or more sensors located within the enclosure.
- the measured outputs can match predicted outputs, or the measured outputs can be less than or greater than the number of predicted outputs. As illustrated in this FIG., the measured outputs match those of the predicted outputs.
- outputs 841 and 843 may represent measured indoor temperature acquired at sensors 1 and 2 , respectively
- outputs 842 and 844 may represent indoor humidity acquired at sensors 1 and 2 , respectively.
- Measured output 845 may represent a parameter acquired by sensor N.
- Mapping functions 870 - 873 can represent the variables used by thermal model 800 to ascertain the predicted outputs and the next state space. Over time, one or more of mapping functions 870 - 873 may change as new training data (e.g., measured outputs) is acquired. Mapping functions 870 - 873 may be updated on a periodic basis (e.g., once a day, every four hours, once a week, etc.). The manner by which mapping functions 870 - 873 are updated is discussed below in more detail. It should be appreciated that the mapping functions are used to solve x(k+1) and y(k) of the state space model.
- the state space model can be represented by different mathematical representations that may enable state space model engine 800 to estimate values of the next state space and the outputs. These alternative representations of the state space are now discussed.
- the state space system can be represented in a predictor form:
- an extended state-space model can be formulated as:
- Y s,s,N ⁇ s X s,N +H s U s,s,N +G s E s,s,N ,
- s can be chosen to represent a level of complexity or length of dynamics to be captured by the state space.
- s can be defined as a function (e.g., a multiple of a fixed number) of the order of the state space model.
- s can be defined as two times the order model. Thus, if the order of the model is 5, s is 10.
- Y s , U s , and E s are known, but X s , ⁇ s , H s , and G s are not known.
- the Kalman state X s,N is unknown, but the Kalman state can be estimated from past input and output data, and can be represented as:
- X s . N A K s ⁇ X 0 , s + L s ⁇ [ Y 0 , s , N U 0 , s , N ] ⁇ L s ⁇ [ Y 0 , s , N U 0 , s , N ] ,

- Determination engine 900 can be run on a periodic basis in order to ascertain updated mapping functions 870 - 873 .
- the periodic basis can be any suitable time frame such as once a day, twice a day, six times a day, or once a week.
- the frequency at which determination engine 900 may determine how fast newly acquired sensor data and inputs are used for ascertaining the mapping functions.
- determination engine 900 can throttle the periodic basis as needed. For example, when evidence of a new input or a new sensor is provided, determination engine 900 may temporarily increase the frequency during which it ascertains updated mapping functions. This may permit the new data to be more quickly assimilated into the state-space model. After a relative steady state has been achieved, the frequency of updates may return back to its “normal” period.
- Device inputs and measurements 908 may represent data points that are collected and stored in sensor database 910 on a period basis.
- the period basis for data collection can be, for example, one a minute, every five minutes, or any other suitable timeframe.
- some the data collection rate may vary depending on the type of device.
- thermostat devices may have a different data collection rate than a smoke detector device or security monitoring device.
- Device inputs can represent inputs provided by the device.
- the input can be HVAC control instructions (e.g., run time, setpoints, etc.).
- the device inputs can include one or more of the inputs provided to the state-space model (e.g., one or more of inputs 811 - 818 ).
- the measurements can be data measured by a device located within the enclosure.
- a thermostat may measure the temperature at its location.
- the measurements can include one or more of the same measurements that are used in the state-space model (e.g., outputs 841 - 845 ).
- Sensor database 910 can function as a cache for temporarily storing device inputs and measurements. Sensor database 910 can accumulate data during the periodic basis set by the determination engine 900 . Thus, if the periodic basis is one day, sensor database 910 accumulates data for a day, and after the day is over, the accumulated data is provided to subspace identification module 920 , and the data stored in database 910 is flushed. New data can be collected and stored during the next periodic cycle.
- Intermediate history database 914 can store a state-space model representation of an intermediate history object 912 that includes all previously acquired sensor data with a bias that puts less emphasis on older data.

- the new sensor data is incorporated into the intermediate history object provided by intermediate history database 914 . More particularly, the intermediate history object is updated in a recursive manner that only uses the new data to update the object.
- the recursive updating nature of the intermediate history block provides an advantage for enabling the state-space model to rapidly adapt to monitored changes in the enclosure.
- each recursive update of the intermediate history object is stored in intermediate history database 914 .
- the intermediate history object is maintained the same format (e.g., LQ factorization) used by one of the subspace identification processes implemented by subspace identification module 920 .
- This format can be the result of a least squares regression, for example.
- Subspace identification module 920 can receive intermediate history database 912 , which incorporates new sensor data provided by sensor databased 910 and the history object stored in history database 914 . Using the updated intermediate history object 912 , subspace identification module 920 can calculate updated mapping functions by processing the data in regression engine 922 , model reduction engine 924 , and parameter estimation engine 926 . The updated mapping functions obtained from module 920 are represented by box 930 . Updated mapping functions 930 are provided to engine 800 to evaluate state space and output determinations using the updated mapping functions.
- Subspace identification module 920 may calculate the updated mapping functions by performing the following steps in order: regression, model reduction, and parameter estimation.
- Regression engine 922 may perform a least squares regression to estimate one or several high-order models.
- Regression engine 922 can computer the least squares estimates in the following equation:
- Regression engine 922 may create an intermediate block, L w , represented by the following equation:
- model reduction engine 924 reduces it to an appropriate low dimensional subspace that is observable. In other words, model reduction engine 924 reduces the intermediate block to a lower order intermediate block.
- the intermediate block, L w can be factorized using a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- SVD Singular Value Decomposition
- Parameter estimation engine 926 can estimate the mapping functions from the lower order intermediate block. Parameter estimation engine 926 may first solve mapping functions A and C. Once mapping functions A and C are found, engine 926 may solve for mapping function B, and then mapping functions K and R can be found. Mapping function R may represent noise in the data.
- Parameter estimation engine 926 can estimate mapping functions A and C by defining the following two matrices:

- parameter estimation engine 926 can solve the least squares equation to find the B mapping function:
- Parameter estimation engine 926 may estimate mapping functions K and R by the following covariance matrices:
- state space model with updated mapping functions 930 may update the intermediate history object and provide it to intermediate history database 940 . This can be done by assuming that a solution exists to the LQ factorization, represented as:

- It is often desired to reduce peak energy consumption within a home as measured over certain time frames, which can happen with there are two or more energy-intensive devices running at the same time. Accordingly, it would be useful to have a home control system that can control the operation of the devices to control the combined energy load within the home.
- This patent specification relates to coordinating energy use of disparately-controlled devices based on predictive modeling characteristics of an enclosure. More particularly, this patent specification relates to enabling third party vendors to coordinate operation of third party devices existing within the enclosure with the enclosure's building control system to manage energy consumption. Embodiments discussed herein provide a smart control system associated with a building control system can generate near-term predictive models to simulate operation of the building control system and the thermal response of the enclosure to predict a run time operation of the system over the future near-term interval. The predictions can be generated using, for example, a state space model that accurately predicts when the system will be operating during the future near-term interval. This information can be stored in a database that is accessible by the third party vendor of a third party device.

- In one embodiment, a method for coordinating energy use of disparately-controlled devices located in a smart home is provided. The method can include accessing a thermal model prediction associated with a building control system of the smart home. The thermal model prediction can specify a future run time operation of the building control system. The method can include determining a third party device run time schedule based on the thermal model prediction. The third party device run time schedule can compliment the future run time operation in a manner that minimizes simultaneous aggregate power consumption by the building control system and a third party device operating according to the third party device run time schedule.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that these various embodiments are illustrative only and are not intended to be limiting in any way. Other embodiments will readily suggest themselves to such skilled persons having the benefit of this disclosure.
- In addition, for clarity purposes, not all of the routine features of the embodiments described herein are shown or described. One of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous embodiment-specific decisions may be required to achieve specific design objectives. These design objectives will vary from one embodiment to another and from one developer to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming but would nevertheless be a routine engineering undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.
- It is to be appreciated that while one or more embodiments are described further herein in the context of typical building control systems used in a residential home, such as single-family residential home, the scope of the present teachings is not so limited. More generally, thermostats according to one or more of the preferred embodiments are applicable for a wide variety of enclosures having one or more building control systems including, without limitation, duplexes, townhomes, multi-unit apartment buildings, hotels, retail stores, office buildings and industrial buildings. Further, it is to be appreciated that while the terms user, customer, installer, homeowner, occupant, guest, tenant, landlord, repair person, and the like may be used to refer to the person or persons who are interacting with the thermostat or other device or user interface in the context of one or more scenarios described herein, these references are by no means to be considered as limiting the scope of the present teachings with respect to the person or persons who are performing such actions.
- Provided according to one or more embodiments are systems, methods, computer program products, and related business methods for controlling one or more building control systems or HVAC systems based on one or more versatile sensing and control units (VSCU units), each VSCU unit being configured and adapted to provide sophisticated, customized, energy-saving HVAC control functionality while at the same time being visually appealing, non-intimidating, elegant to behold, and delightfully easy to use. The term “thermostat” is used hereinbelow to represent a particular type of VSCU unit (Versatile Sensing and Control) that is particularly applicable for HVAC control in an enclosure. Although “thermostat” and “VSCU unit” may be seen as generally interchangeable for the contexts of HVAC control of an enclosure, it is within the scope of the present teachings for each of the embodiments hereinabove and hereinbelow to be applied to VSCU units having control functionality over measurable characteristics other than temperature (e.g., pressure, flow rate, height, position, velocity, acceleration, capacity, power, loudness, brightness) for any of a variety of different control systems involving the governance of one or more measurable characteristics of one or more physical systems, and/or the governance of other energy or resource consuming systems such as water usage systems, air usage systems, systems involving the usage of other natural resources, and systems involving the usage of various other forms of energy.
- Various methods, apparatus, systems, and computer-readable mediums are described herein that concern the field of thermodynamic behavioral modeling of structures. In many modern systems, including systems such include HVAC systems which manage the environmental characteristics in a structure, it is desirable to predict the thermodynamic behavior of a structure. Such predictions may have a variety of tangible, beneficial uses. In modern building control systems, such predictions may be used on a daily basis to accurately actuate the system in reaching or maintaining desired setpoint temperatures or to manage energy consumption. In addition, such predictions may be made available to third party vendors so that the third party vendor can coordinate the operation of their respective third party devices in connection with the building system and/or other third party devices operating within the structure in order to manage energy consumption within the structure. For example, third party devices can be refrigerators, freezers, lighting systems, energy storage systems, or other energy related devices contained within the structure. A third party application can be provided with a thermal model prediction, and based on that prediction, can schedule run times of its respective device so that it is staggered with the run time of the building system. This way, the operation of the building control system and the third party device can be staggered so as to reduce potential for peak power consumption events.
- The third party devices and the building control system are disparately controlled. That is, each device is independently controlled by its own control system/software; they are not all controlled by a single god-like device that has infinite knowledge of all devices operating within the enclosure. Although, a single god-like device is in theory possible, implementation of such a device is not practical and do not work. Embodiments discussed herein provide a smart control system associated with a HVAC system can generate near-term predictive models to simulate operation of the HVAC system and the thermal response of the enclosure to predict a control trajectory of the HVAC system over the future near-term interval. The predictions can be generated using, for example, a state space model that accurately predicts when the HVAC system will be ON and OFF during the future near-term interval. This information can be stored in a database that is accessible by the third party vendor of a third party device. The third party vendor can use the predicted run time operation of the HVAC system to make sure that run times of the third party device are staggered with the predicted run time operation of the HVAC system, while also optimizing the operation of the third party device in view of the constraints.
- In some embodiments, the third party vendor can publish its third party run time schedule to the database so that other vendors can access it and take it and the model prediction into account when formulating their respective run time schedules. If conflicts exist between among two or more third party vendors (i.e., both vendors have overlapping active operation periods that would result in excessive power consumption), a server (e.g., the server that maintains the database) may arbitrate which vendor has priority. The priority may be based on any number of different suitable criteria, including for example, first vendor in line, preferred vendors, and designated priority of vendors.
- The predictive run time operation of the building control system can be obtained through the use of a thermodynamic model of the structure. The thermodynamic model itself may be defined by a state space model that characterizes the thermodynamic response of an enclosure, such as indoor temperature, in response to application of a stimulus, such as a change in HVAC actuation state and outdoor temperature. The state-space model is adaptable to incorporate actual measured data to update the model and is adaptable to incorporate new inputs and measured data points.
- It should be recognized that the term “thermodynamic” may include all state variables that can be used to characterize a physical system. Examples of thermodynamic variables include, but are not limited to: pressure, temperature, airflow, humidity, and particulate matter. Further, the term “model” refers generally to a description or representation of a system. The description or representation can use mathematical language, such as in the case of mathematical models. Examples of such models used herein include state-space model or multi-input, multi-output systems.
- The thermal model described herein can enable a control system, a thermostat and/or servers to compute accurate predictions related to temperature, humidity, HVAC runtime, and other factors pertaining to a particular enclosure. The thermal model can be used to predict energy consumption of the HVAC system to achieve desired thermal characteristics within the enclosure within a future time frame. The results of the thermal model can be used by a thermostat contained within the enclosure to control the operation of the HVAC system. In addition, the results of the thermal model can be also used as data inputs to the company that sells the thermostat so that information can be further analyzed, for example, by more powerful computers. Further still, the analyzed results of the thermal model may be provided to third party vendors (e.g., a smart home refrigerator vendor or energy partner so that it can make better assessments of energy production). In yet another approach, third party providers may be granted access to the thermal model and/or its results via an API.
- Turning now to the figures,
FIG. 1A illustrates an example of general device components which can be included in an intelligent, network-connected device 100 (i.e., “device”) that may be used to implement one or more of the thermodynamic behavior prediction processes described herein according to an embodiment. Each of one, more or alldevices 100 within a system of devices can include one ormore sensors 102, a user-interface component 104, a power supply (e.g., including apower connection 106 and/or battery 108), acommunications component 110, a modularity unit (e.g., including adocking station 112 and replaceable module 114) andintelligence components 116.Particular sensors 102, user-interface components 104, power-supply configurations,communications components 110, modularity units and/orintelligence components 116 can be the same or similar acrossdevices 100 or can vary depending on device type or model. -
Sensors 102 as described herein generally includes devices or systems that measure and/or register a substance, physical phenomenon and/or physical quantity. The sensor may convert a measurement into a signal, which can be interpreted by an observer, instrument and/or system. A sensor can be implemented as a special purpose device and/or can be implemented as software running on a general-purpose computer system. By way of example and not by way of limitation, one ormore sensors 102 in adevice 100 may be able to, e.g., detect acceleration, temperature, humidity, water, supplied power, proximity, external motion, device motion, sound signals, ultrasound signals, light signals, fire, smoke, carbon monoxide, global-positioning-satellite (GPS) signals, or radio-frequency (RF) or other electromagnetic signals or fields. Thus, for example,sensors 102 can include temperature sensor(s), humidity sensor(s), hazard-related sensor(s) or other environmental sensor(s), accelerometer(s), microphone(s), optical sensor(s) up to and including camera(s) (e.g., charged-coupled-device or video cameras), active or passive radiation sensor(s), GPS receiver(s) or radio-frequency identification detector(s). WhileFIG. 1A illustrates an embodiment with a single sensor, many embodiments will include multiple sensors. In some instances,device 100 includes one or more primary sensors and one or more secondary sensors. The primary sensor(s) can sense data central to the core operation of the device (e.g., sensing a temperature in a thermostat or sensing smoke in a smoke detector). The secondary sensor(s) can sense other types of data (e.g., motion, light or sound), which can be used for energy-efficiency objectives or smart-operation objectives. In some instances, an average user may even be unaware of an existence of a secondary sensor. - One or more user-
interface components 104 indevice 100 may be configured to present information to a user via a visual display (e.g., a thin-film-transistor display or organic light-emitting-diode display) and/or an audio speaker and/or some other communication medium. User-interface component 104 can also include one or more user-input components to receive information from a user, such as a touchscreen, buttons, scroll component (e.g., a movable or virtual ring component), microphone or camera (e.g., to detect gestures). In one embodiment, user-input component 104 includes a click-and-rotate annular ring component, wherein a user can interact with the component by rotating the ring (e.g., to adjust a setting) and/or by clicking the ring inwards (e.g., to select an adjusted setting or to select an option). In another embodiment, user-input component 104 includes a camera, such that gestures can be detected (e.g., to indicate that a power or alarm state of a device is to be changed). - A power-supply component in
device 100 may include apower connection 106 and/orlocal battery 108. For example,power connection 106 can connectdevice 100 to a power source such as a line voltage source. In some instances,connection 106 to an AC power source can be used to repeatedly charge a (e.g., rechargeable)local battery 108, such thatbattery 108 can later be used to supply power if needed in the event of an AC power disconnection or other power deficiency scenario. - A
communications component 110 indevice 100 can include a component that enablesdevice 100 to communicate with a central server or a remote device, such as another device described herein or a portable user device.Communications component 110 can allowdevice 100 to communicate via, e.g., Wi-Fi, ZigBee, 3G/4G wireless, CAT6 wired Ethernet, HomePlug or other powerline communications method, telephone, or optical fiber, by way of non-limiting examples.Communications component 110 can include a wireless card, an Ethernet plug, or another transceiver connection. In some embodiments, thecommunications component 110 facilitates communication with a central server to synchronize information betweendevice 100, the central server, and in some cases additional devices. Techniques for synchronizating data between such devices are further described in the commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 8,635,373. - A modularity unit in
device 100 can include a static physical connection, and areplaceable module 114. Thus, the modularity unit can provide the capability to upgradereplaceable module 114 without completely reinstalling device 100 (e.g., to preserve wiring). The static physical connection can include a docking station 112 (which may also be termed an interface box) that can attach to a building structure. For example,docking station 112 could be mounted to a wall via screws or stuck onto a ceiling via adhesive.Docking station 112 can, in some instances, extend through part of the building structure. For example,docking station 112 can connect to wiring (e.g., to 120V line voltage wires) behind the wall via a hole made through a wall's sheetrock.Docking station 112 can include circuitry such as power-connection circuitry 106 and/or AC-to-DC powering circuitry and can prevent the user from being exposed to high-voltage wires.Docking station 112 may also or alternatively include control circuitry for actuating (i.e., turning on and off) elements of an HVAC system, such as a heating unit (for heating the building structure), an air-condition unit (for cooling the building structure), and/or a ventilation unit (for circulating air throughout the building structure). In some instances,docking stations 112 are specific to a type or model of device, such that, e.g., a thermostat device includes a different docking station than a smoke detector device. In some instances,docking stations 112 can be shared across multiple types and/or models ofdevices 100. -
Replaceable module 114 of the modularity unit can include some or allsensors 102, processors, user-interface components 104,batteries 108,communications components 110,intelligence components 116 and so forth of the device.Replaceable module 114 can be configured to attach to (e.g., plug into or connect to)docking station 112. In some instances, a set ofreplaceable modules 114 are produced with the capabilities, hardware and/or software, varying across thereplaceable modules 114. Users can therefore easily upgrade or replace theirreplaceable module 114 without having to replace all device components or to completely reinstalldevice 100. For example, a user can begin with an inexpensive device including a first replaceable module with limited intelligence and software capabilities. The user can then easily upgrade the device to include a more capable replaceable module. As another example, if a user has aModel # 1 device in their basement, aModel # 2 device in their living room, and upgrades their living-room device to include aModel # 3 replaceable module, the user can move theModel # 2 replaceable module into the basement to connect to the existing docking station. TheModel # 2 replaceable module may then, e.g., begin an initiation process in order to identify its new location (e.g., by requesting information from a user via a user interface). -
Intelligence components 116 of the device can support one or more of a variety of different device functionalities.Intelligence components 116 generally include one or more processors configured and programmed to carry out and/or cause to be carried out one or more of the advantageous functionalities described herein. Theintelligence components 116 can be implemented in the form of general-purpose processors carrying out computer code stored in local memory (e.g., flash memory, hard drive, random access memory), special-purpose processors or application-specific integrated circuits, combinations thereof, and/or using other types of hardware/firmware/software processing platforms. Theintelligence components 116 can furthermore be implemented as localized versions or counterparts of algorithms carried out or governed remotely by central servers or cloud-based systems, such as by virtue of running a Java virtual machine (JVM) that executes instructions provided from a cloud server using Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) or similar protocols. By way of example,intelligence components 116 can be configured to detect when a location (e.g., a house or room) is occupied, up to and including whether it is occupied by a specific person or is occupied by a specific number and/or set of people (e.g., relative to one or more thresholds). Such detection can occur, e.g., by analyzing microphone signals, detecting user movements (e.g., in front of a device), detecting openings and closings of doors or garage doors, detecting wireless signals, detecting an IP address of a received signal, or detecting operation of one or more devices within a time window.Intelligence components 116 may include image-recognition technology to identify particular occupants or objects. - In some instances,
intelligence components 116 can be configured to predict desirable settings and/or to implement those settings. For example, based on the presence detection,intelligence components 116 can adjust device settings to, e.g., conserve power when nobody is home or in a particular room or to accord with user preferences (e.g., general at-home preferences or user-specific preferences). As another example, based on the detection of a particular person, animal or object (e.g., a child, pet or lost object),intelligence components 116 can initiate an audio or visual indicator of where the person, animal or object is or can initiate an alarm or security feature if an unrecognized person is detected under certain conditions (e.g., at night or when lights are out). As yet another example,intelligence components 116 can detect hourly, weekly or even seasonal trends in user settings and adjust settings accordingly. For example,intelligence components 116 can detect that a particular device is turned on every week day at 6:30 am, or that a device setting is gradually adjusted from a high setting to lower settings over the last three hours.Intelligence components 116 can then predict that the device is to be turned on every week day at 6:30 am or that the setting should continue to gradually lower its setting over a longer time period. - In some instances, devices can interact with each other such that events detected by a first device influence actions of a second device. For example, a first device can detect that a user has pulled into a garage (e.g., by detecting motion in the garage, detecting a change in light in the garage or detecting opening of the garage door). The first device can transmit this information to a second device, such that the second device can, e.g., adjust a home temperature setting, a light setting, a music setting, and/or a security-alarm setting. As another example, a first device can detect a user approaching a front door (e.g., by detecting motion or sudden light-pattern changes). The first device can, e.g., cause a general audio or visual signal to be presented (e.g., such as sounding of a doorbell) or cause a location-specific audio or visual signal to be presented (e.g., to announce the visitor's presence within a room that a user is occupying).

FIG. 1B illustrates an intelligent, network-connecteddevice 100 having a replaceable module 114 (e.g., a head unit) and a docking station 112 (e.g., a back plate) for ease of installation, configuration, and upgrading according to an embodiment. As is described hereinabove,device 100 may be wall mounted, have a circular shape, and have an outer rotatable ring 120 (that may be, e.g., part of user interface 104) for receiving user input. Outerrotatable ring 120 allows the user to make adjustments, such as selecting a new target temperature. For example, by rotatingouter ring 120 clockwise, a target setpoint temperature can be increased, and by rotating theouter ring 120 counter-clockwise, the target setpoint temperature can be decreased. Changes to an existing setpoint temperature that reflect a desire for the temperature in the structure to be immediately changed to that setpoint temperature may herein be referred to as changes to an “immediate setpoint temperature” or a “current setpoint temperature”. This is in contrast to setpoint temperatures that may be provided in a hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other schedule in which setpoint temperatures may reflect a desire for future temperatures in the structure. Such setpoint temperatures may herein be referred as “scheduled setpoint temperature” or as a “schedule of setpoint temperatures”. -
Device 100 has acover 122 that includes a display 124 (that may be, e.g., part of user interface 104).Head unit 114 slides ontoback plate 112.Display 124 may display a variety of information depending on, e.g., a current operational state of thedevice 100, direct user interaction with the device viaring 120, sensed presence of the user via, e.g., a proximity sensor 102 (such as a passive infrared motion sensor), remote user interaction with the device via a remote access device, etc. For example,display 124 may display central numerals that are representative of a current setpoint temperature. - According to some embodiments the connection of the
head unit 114 to backplate 112 can be accomplished using magnets, bayonet, latches and catches, tabs or ribs with matching indentations, or simply friction on mating portions of thehead unit 114 andback plate 112. According to some embodiments, thehead unit 114 includesbattery 108,communications component 110,intelligence components 116, and a display driver 126 (that may be, e.g., part of user interface 104).Battery 108 may be recharged using recharging circuitry (that may be, e.g., part ofintelligence components 116 and/or may be included in the back plate 112) that uses power from theback plate 112 that is either obtained via power harvesting (also referred to as power stealing and/or power sharing) from the HVAC system control circuit(s) or from a common wire, if available. According to some embodiments,battery 108 is a rechargeable single cell lithium-ion, or a lithium-polymer battery. -
Back plate 112 includeselectronics 130 and a temperature sensor 132 (that may be, e.g., one of sensors 102) inhousing 134, which are ventilated viavents 136.Temperature sensor 132 allows theback plate 112 to operate as a fully functional thermostat even when not connected to thehead unit 114.Wire connectors 138 are provided to allow for connection to HVAC system wires, such as connection to wires for actuating components of the HVAC system, wires for receiving power from the HVAC system, etc.Connection terminal 140 is a male or female plug connector that provides electrical connections between thehead unit 114 andback plate 112. - In some embodiments, the
back plate electronics 130 includes an MCU processor, and driver circuitry for opening and closing the HVAC control circuits, thereby turning on and turning off the one or more HVAC functions such as heating and cooling. Theelectronics 130 also includes flash memory which is used to store a series of programmed settings that take effect at different times of the day, such that programmed setpoint (i.e., desired temperature) changes can be carried out even when thehead unit 114 is not attached to theback plate 112. According to some embodiments, theelectronics 130 also includes power harvesting circuitry (that may be in addition or alternatively to that provided in head unit 114) to obtain power from the HVAC control circuit(s) even when an HVAC common power wire is not available. -
Device 100 in certain embodiments is an intelligent, network-connected learning thermostat that includes various components such as a head unit, a back plate, a user interface, communications components, intelligent components, etc. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that devices that perform the various operations described herein could operate equally well with fewer or a greater number of components than are illustrated inFIGS. 1A and 1B . Thus, the depiction ofdevice 100 inFIGS. 1A and 1B should be taken as being illustrative in nature, and not limiting to the scope of the present teachings. -
FIG. 2 illustrates an example of asmart home environment 200 within which one or more of the devices, methods, systems, services, and/or computer program products described further herein can be applicable according to an embodiment. The depicted smart home environment includes astructure 250, which can include, e.g., a house, office building, garage, mobile home, or other type of enclosure for which thermodynamic behavior may be predicted. It will be appreciated that devices can also be integrated into a smart home environment that does not include anentire structure 250, such as an apartment, condominium, or office space. Further, the smart home environment can control and/or be coupled to devices outside of theactual structure 250. Indeed, several devices in the smart home environment need not physically be within thestructure 250 at all. For example, a device controlling a pool heater or irrigation system can be located outside of thestructure 250. - The
smart home environment 200 includes a plurality ofrooms 252, separated at least partly from each other viawalls 254. Thewalls 254 can include interior walls or exterior walls. Each room can further include afloor 256 and aceiling 258. Devices can be mounted on, integrated with and/or supported by awall 254,floor 256 orceiling 258. The various devices that may be incorporated within thesmart home environment 200 include intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected devices that can integrate seamlessly with each other and/or with cloud-based server systems to provide any of a variety of useful smart home objectives. An intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connectedthermostat 202 can detect ambient climate characteristics (e.g., temperature and/or humidity) and control abuilding control system 203 such as a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. It should be recognized that while control of an HVAC system is described herein, similar principles can equally be applied to controlling other temperature/humidity control systems, such as a heating system, an air conditioning system, a humidity control system, or any combination thereof. One or more intelligent, network-connected, multi-sensinghazard detection units 204 can detect the presence of a hazardous substance and/or a hazardous condition in the home environment (e.g., smoke, fire, or carbon monoxide). One or more intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connectedentryway interface devices 206, which can be termed a “smart doorbell”, can detect a person's approach to or departure from a location, control audible functionality, announce a person's approach or departure via audio or visual means, or control settings on a security system (e.g., to activate or deactivate the security system). - In some embodiments, the smart home may include at least one
energy consumption meter 218 such as a smart meter. Theenergy consumption meter 218 monitors some or all energy (electricity, gas, etc.) consumed by the devices in and around thestructure 250. Theenergy consumption meter 218 may display the amount of energy consumed over a given period of time on a surface of themeter 218. The given period may be, e.g., a second, a minute, an hour, a day, a month, a time span less than one second, a time span greater than a month, or a time span between one second and one month. In some embodiments, theenergy consumption meter 218 may include communication capabilities (wired or wireless) that enable themeter 218 to communicate various information, e.g., the amount of energy consumed over one or more given periods, the price of energy at any particular time or during any particular period of time, etc. The communication capabilities may also enable the meter to receive various information. For example, the meter may receive instructions for controlling one or more devices in the smart home such as theHVAC system 203, the price of energy at any particular time or during any particular period of time, etc. To facilitate control of devices in and around thestructure 250, themeter 218 may be wired or wirelessly connected to such devices. - Each of a plurality of intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected
wall light switches 208 can detect ambient lighting conditions, detect room-occupancy states and control a power and/or dim state of one or more lights. In some instances,light switches 208 can further or alternatively control a power state or speed of a fan, such as a ceiling fan. Each of a plurality of intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected wall plug interfaces 210 can detect occupancy of a room or enclosure and control supply of power to one or more wall plugs (e.g., such that power is not supplied to the plug if nobody is at home). The smart home may further include a plurality of intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connectedappliances 212, such as refrigerators, stoves and/or ovens, televisions, washers, dryers, lights (inside and/or outside the structure 250), stereos, intercom systems, garage-door openers, floor fans, ceiling fans, whole-house fans, wall air conditioners,pool heaters 214,irrigation systems 216, security systems, and so forth. While descriptions ofFIG. 2 can identify specific sensors and functionalities associated with specific devices, it will be appreciated that any of a variety of sensors and functionalities (such as those described throughout the specification) can be integrated into the device. - In addition to containing processing and sensing capabilities, each of the devices within the
smart home environment 200 can be capable of data communications and information sharing with any other devices within thesmart home environment 200, as well as to any devices outside thesmart home environment 240 such as theaccess device 266 and/orremote server 264. The devices can send and receive communications via any of a variety of custom or standard wireless protocols (Wi-Fi, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN, IR, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15.4, etc.) and/or any of a variety of custom or standard wired protocols (CAT6 Ethernet, HomePlug, etc.). The wall plug interfaces 210 can serve as wireless or wired repeaters, and/or can function as bridges between (i) devices plugged into AC outlets and communicating using Homeplug or other power line protocol, and (ii) devices that are not plugged into AC outlets. - For example, a first device can communicate with a second device via a
wireless router 260. A device can further communicate with remote devices via a connection to a network, such as thenetwork 262. Through thenetwork 262, the device can communicate with a central (i.e., remote) server or a cloud-computing system 264. The remote server or cloud-computing system 264 can be associated with a manufacturer, support entity or service provider associated with the device. In one embodiment, a user may be able to contact customer support using a device itself rather than needing to use other communication means such as a telephone or Internet-connected computer. - Devices' network connections can further allow a user to interact with the device even if the user is not proximate to the device. For example, a user can communicate with a device (e.g., thermostat 202) using a computer (e.g., a desktop computer, laptop computer, or tablet) or other portable electronic device (e.g., a smartphone) 266. A webpage or app can be configured to receive communications from the user and control the device based on the communications and/or to present information about the device's operation to the user. For example, when the portable
electronic device 266 is being used to interact with thethermostat 202, the user can view a current setpoint temperature for a thermostat and adjust it using the portableelectronic device 266. The user can be in the structure during this remote communication or outside the structure. The communications between the portableelectronic device 266 and thethermostat 202 may be routed via the remote server 264 (e.g., when the portableelectronic device 266 is remote from structure 250) or, in some embodiments, may be routed exclusive of theremote server 264. - The
smart home environment 200 also can include a variety ofnon-communicating legacy appliances 240, such as old conventional washer/dryers, refrigerators, and the like which can be controlled, albeit coarsely (ON/OFF), by virtue of the wall plug interfaces 210. The smart home can further include a variety of partially communicatinglegacy appliances 242, such as IR-controlled wall air conditioners or other IR-controlled devices, which can be controlled by IR signals provided by thehazard detection units 204 or thelight switches 208 or, in some embodiments, by using socket-based communication protocol such as powerline to communicate via awall plug interface 210. -
Smart home 200 in certain embodiments is an environment including a number of client devices and access devices all operable to communicate with one another as well as with devices or systems external to thesmart home 200 such asremote server 264. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that such an environment could operate equally well having fewer or a greater number of components than are illustrated inFIG. 2 . Thus, the depiction of thesmart home environment 200 inFIG. 2 should be taken as being illustrative in nature, and not limiting to the scope of the present teachings. -
FIG. 3 illustrates a network-level view of an extensible devices and services platform with which the smart home ofFIGS. 1 and/or 2 can be integrated according to an embodiment. Each of the intelligent, network-connected devices discussed with reference toFIG. 2 can communicate with one or more remote servers orcloud computing systems 264. The communication can be enabled by establishing connection to theInternet 262 either directly (for example, using 3G/4G connectivity to a wireless carrier), though a hubbed network (which can be a scheme ranging from a simple wireless router, for example, up to and including an intelligent, dedicated whole-home control node), or through any combination thereof. - The remote server or cloud-
computing system 264 can collectoperation data 302 from the smart home devices. For example, the devices can routinely transmit operation data or can transmit operation data in specific instances (e.g., when requesting customer support). The remote server or cloud-computing architecture 264 can further provide one ormore services 304. Theservices 304 can include, e.g., software update, customer support, sensor data collection/logging, remote access, remote or distributed control, or use suggestions (e.g., based on collectedoperation data 304 to improve performance, reduce utility cost, etc.). Data associated with theservices 304 can be stored at the remote server or cloud-computing system 264 and the remote server or cloud-computing system 264 can retrieve and transmit the data at an appropriate time (e.g., at regular intervals, upon receiving request from a user, etc.). - One salient feature of the described extensible devices and services platform, as illustrated in
FIG. 3 , is aprocessing engine 306, which can be concentrated at a single data processing server 307 (which may be included in or separate from remote server 264) or distributed among several different computing entities without limitation.Processing engine 306 can include engines configured to receive data from a set of devices (e.g., via the Internet or a hubbed network), to index the data, to analyze the data and/or to generate statistics based on the analysis or as part of the analysis. The analyzed data can be stored as deriveddata 308. Results of the analysis or statistics can thereafter be transmitted back to a device providing ops data used to derive the results, to other devices, to a server providing a webpage to a user of the device, or to other non-device entities. For example, use statistics, use statistics relative to use of other devices, use patterns, and/or statistics summarizing sensor readings can be transmitted. The results or statistics can be provided via theInternet 262. In this manner,processing engine 306 can be configured and programmed to derive a variety of useful information from the operational data obtained from the smart home. A single server can include one or more engines. - The derived data can be highly beneficial at a variety of different granularities for a variety of useful purposes, ranging from explicit programmed control of the devices on a per-home, per-neighborhood, or per-region basis (for example, demand-response programs for electrical utilities), to the generation of inferential abstractions that can assist on a per-home basis (for example, an inference can be drawn that the homeowner has left for vacation and so security detection equipment can be put on heightened sensitivity), to the generation of statistics and associated inferential abstractions that can be used for government or charitable purposes. For example, the
processing engine 306 can generate statistics about device usage across a population of devices and send the statistics to device users, service providers or other entities (e.g., that have requested or may have provided monetary compensation for the statistics). As specific illustrations, statistics can be transmitted tocharities 322, governmental entities 324 (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency), academic institutions 326 (e.g., university researchers), businesses 328 (e.g., providing device warranties or service to related equipment), orutility companies 330. These entities can use the data to form programs to reduce energy usage, to preemptively service faulty equipment, to prepare for high service demands, to store past service performance, etc., or to perform any of a variety of beneficial functions or tasks now known or hereinafter developed. -
FIG. 4 illustrates an abstracted functional view of the extensible devices and services platform ofFIG. 3 , with particular reference to theprocessing engine 306 as well as the devices of the smart home environment, according to an embodiment. Even though the devices situated in the smart home have an endless variety of different individual capabilities and limitations, they can all be thought of as sharing common characteristics in that each of them is a data consumer 402 (DC), a data source 404 (DS), a services consumer 406 (SC), and/or a services source 408 (SS). Advantageously, in addition to providing the essential control information needed for the devices to achieve their local and immediate objectives, the extensible devices and services platform can also be configured to harness the large amount of data that is flowing out of these devices. In addition to enhancing or optimizing the actual operation of the devices themselves with respect to their immediate functions, the extensible devices and services platform can also be directed to “repurposing” that data in a variety of automated, extensible, flexible, and/or scalable ways to achieve a variety of useful objectives. These objectives may be predefined or adaptively identified based on, e.g., usage patterns, device efficiency, and/or user input (e.g., requesting specific functionality). - For example,
FIG. 4 showsprocessing engine 306 as including a number of paradigms 410.Processing engine 306 can include a managedservices paradigm 410 a that monitors and manages primary or secondary device functions. The device functions can include ensuring proper operation of a device given user inputs, estimating that (e.g., and responding to) an intruder is or is attempting to be in a dwelling, detecting a failure of equipment coupled to the device (e.g., a light bulb having burned out), implementing or otherwise responding to energy demand response events, or alerting a user of a current or predicted future event or characteristic.Processing engine 306 can further include an advertising/communication paradigm 410 b that estimates characteristics (e.g., demographic information), desires and/or products of interest of a user based on device usage. Services, promotions, products or upgrades can then be offered or automatically provided to the user.Processing engine 306 can further include asocial paradigm 410 c that uses information from a social network, provides information to a social network (for example, based on device usage), and/or processes data associated with user and/or device interactions with the social network platform. For example, a user's status as reported to their trusted contacts on the social network could be updated to indicate when they are home based on light detection, security system inactivation or device usage detectors. As another example, a user may be able to share device-usage statistics with other users.Processing engine 306 can include a challenges/rules/compliance/rewards paradigm 410 d that informs a user of challenges, rules, compliance regulations and/or rewards and/or that uses operation data to determine whether a challenge has been met, a rule or regulation has been complied with and/or a reward has been earned. The challenges, rules or regulations can relate to efforts to conserve energy, to live safely (e.g., reducing exposure to toxins or carcinogens), to conserve money and/or equipment life, to improve health, etc. -
Processing engine 306 can integrate or otherwise utilizeextrinsic information 416 from extrinsic sources to improve the functioning of one or more processing paradigms.Extrinsic information 416 can be used to interpret operational data received from a device, to determine a characteristic of the environment near the device (e.g., outside a structure that the device is enclosed in), to determine services or products available to the user, to identify a social network or social-network information, to determine contact information of entities (e.g., public-service entities such as an emergency-response team, the police or a hospital) near the device, etc., to identify statistical or environmental conditions, trends or other information associated with a home or neighborhood, and so forth. - An extraordinary range and variety of benefits can be brought about by, and fit within the scope of, the described extensible devices and services platform, ranging from the ordinary to the profound. Thus, in one “ordinary” example, each bedroom of the smart home can be provided with a smoke/fire/CO alarm that includes an occupancy sensor, wherein the occupancy sensor is also capable of inferring (e.g., by virtue of motion detection, facial recognition, audible sound patterns, etc.) whether the occupant is asleep or awake. If a serious fire event is sensed, the remote security/monitoring service or fire department is advised of how many occupants there are in each bedroom, and whether those occupants are still asleep (or immobile) or whether they have properly evacuated the bedroom. While this is, of course, a very advantageous capability accommodated by the described extensible devices and services platform, there can be substantially more “profound” examples that can truly illustrate the potential of a larger “intelligence” that can be made available. By way of perhaps a more “profound” example, the same data bedroom occupancy data that is being used for fire safety can also be “repurposed” by the
processing engine 306 in the context of a social paradigm of neighborhood child development and education. Thus, for example, the same bedroom occupancy and motion data discussed in the “ordinary” example can be collected and made available for processing (properly anonymized) in which the sleep patterns of schoolchildren in a particular ZIP code can be identified and stored. Localized variations in the sleeping patterns of the schoolchildren may be identified and correlated, for example, to different nutrition programs in local schools. -

FIG. 6 illustrates an example of system 600 in which third party devices can access a database containing predictive models ofenclosure 610 according to various embodiments. As shown,FIG. 6 can includeenclosure 610,remote server 620, andthird party vendors 630, each of which may communicate with each other.Enclosure 610 can be a simplified version of smart home environment 200 (ofFIG. 2 ).Enclosure 610 may includethermal model 611, which may be executed within a thermostat (not shown), third party devices 615 a-c, andbuilding control system 617.Thermal model 611 can generate any suitable number ofdifferent model predictions 612, including, for example,system usage predictions 613 andtemperature predictions 614.System usage predictions 613 may predict the run time operation of building control system 617 (e.g., an HVAC system) for a future timeframe.Model predictions 612 can be provided toremote server 620 on a periodic basis (e.g., once a day) or on demand. -
Remote server 620 can includethermal model 622 anddatabase 624.Remote server 620 can be any suitable server that can communicate withenclosure 610 and third party vendors 630.Thermal model 622 may be used in lieu of, or in addition to,thermal model 611. For example,thermal model 622 may be used if additional processing power is needed to generate the model predictions.Database 624 may store model predictions provided bythermal model 611 and/orthermal model 622.Database 624 may also store run time schedules provided by any one or more of third party vendors 630. -
Third party vendors 630 can be remote servers or applications affiliated with a third party device (e.g., one of devices 615) contained inenclosure 610. For example,third party vendor 635 a may be affiliated withthird party device 615 a,third party device 635 b may be affiliated withthird party device 615 b, and so on.Third party vendors 630 can communicate with their respective devices (directly or indirectly via remote server 620) and can control the operation of their devices. For example, third party vendors can generate run time schedules that govern the operation of the devices. In accordance with various embodiments discussed herein,third party vendors 630 can access model predictions and/or other third party stored run time schedules stored indatabase 624 and can generate a run time schedule for its respective third party device. This way, when the third party device operates according to its run time schedule, the third party device's operation is coordinated with the predicted operation of the building control system. - The runtime schedule can vary depending on the type of third party device to which it is associated. For example, if the third party device is an energy consumption device, such as a refrigerator, then the run time schedule can include an ON/OFF run time schedule. If the third party device is an energy storage unit, such as a battery or car, the run time schedule can define a charge/discharge schedule.

Thermal model Thermal models - The thermal model according to embodiments discussed herein can be represented by a linear multi input multi output (MIMO) system, and in particular can be represented by a linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space system. This advantageously makes the thermal model compatible with existing analyses tools and control strategies. In addition, the inputs for the thermal model can be actual physical factors that affect the thermal dynamics of the enclosure. This is in contrast to conventional models that empirically determine nonlinear inputs. In addition, the thermal model can be general model that is learned and mapped for example to different zones.
- Further still, only one thermal model needs to be learned to predict all the different HVAC operational stages or states. This way, the relative strengths of each HVAC operational stage can be appropriately modeled. This is in contrast with conventional modeling techniques that have to create a separate model for each HVAC operational stage. For example, different HVAC operational stages can include no HVAC operations, first stage heat, first and second stage heat, and first, second, and auxiliary heat.
- The thermal state-space model can employ a recursive subspace identification algorithm that rapidly accommodates new additions of training data. The algorithm is recursive in the sense that the model has an intermediate state, which can be used as a history object, which can be stored in the model database. Whenever new training data becomes available, the history object is updated using only the new data. In addition, the algorithm can employ a “forgetting” factor that enables the thermal model to be adaptive over time. The thermal model may be initially programmed with an “out-of-the-box” history object. The out-of-the-box history object may be based on the thermostat's geographic location, the HVAC system the thermostat is controlling, enclosure type (e.g., house or office building), and any other suitable criteria. This enables the thermostat to begin immediate thermal modeling predictions, without having to wait for training data to be provided by various devices within the enclosure. The “forgetting” factor can enable the thermal model to evolve from the initial model and adapt to the actual thermodynamics of the enclosure.
- The thermal model can be tunable to find a stable higher-order model. The ability to tune the order of the model enables the thermal model to account for higher order thermodynamics of the enclosure and thereby compute more accurate predictions (e.g., especially for short-cycle HVAC run times). With each new set of training data, the recursive subspace identification algorithm can tune itself to the highest order model it can sustain. If a particular order model cannot be sustained, the algorithm may attempt to stabilize at a lower order model. And if no order model can be sustained, the set of new training data may be discarded and the model may revert back to the highest sustainable order.
- The thermal model according to embodiments discussed herein can be represented by the following state-space model:
-
- where x(k)εRn, u(k)εy(k)εR1. The vectors, x, u, e, and y, and mapping functions A, B, C, and K are explained below in connection with
FIGS. 7A-7E . -
FIG. 7A shows an illustrative schematic showing a portion of the state-space model defining the thermal model, according to an embodiment. The x represents an n-dimensional state vector that represents the internal state ofenclosure 710. The k value represents the current time step, and the k+1 value represents the next time step. The A represents a mapping function from the current state to the next state. Thus, even without inputs, outputs, or correction factors, the predicted internal state ofenclosure 710 can evolve. In some embodiments, the A mapping function may represent the order of the thermodynamic model, and thus may remain fixed unless the order of the model is changed. -
FIG. 7B shows another illustrative schematic showing another portion of the state-space model that builds on the schematic ofFIG. 7A , according to an embodiment.FIG. 7B introduces u and B, where u represents an m-dimensional input vector that has an impact on the state ofenclosure 710. The variables of the input vector, u, can include, for example, the outdoor temperature, the various HVAC operation stages, humidity, occupancy, ambient light, window states, door states, and any other factors that can affect the internal state ofenclosure 710. For example, in one embodiment, the input vector, u(k) can be defined as follows: u(k)=[Toutdoor(k) HVACstage1heat(k) HVACauxheat(k)]T. The B mapping function can represent a mapping that the inputs have on affecting the state of the enclosure. Thus, the state x(k+1) can include the state of the previous step, x(k), the input, u(k), and mapping function B. -
FIG. 7C shows yet another illustrative schematic showing another portion of the state-space model that builds on the schematic ofFIG. 7B , according to an embodiment.FIG. 7C introduces y and C. The y can represent an 1-dimensional output vector that can be determined by applying the C mapping function to the state vector (e.g., x(k)). The C mapping function can represent a mapping that the current state has on the output vector. For example, in one embodiment, the output vector, y(k) can be defined as follows: y(k)=Tindoor(k). In other words, in this embodiment, y(k) is the predicted internal temperature ofenclosure 710. In another example,FIG. 7E shows that y(k) can represent outputs for different devices 721-724 located in the actual enclosure 720 being modeled by state space model ofenclosure 710. -
FIG. 7D shows yet another illustrative schematic showing another portion of the state-space model that builds on the schematic ofFIG. 7C , according to an embodiment.FIG. 7D introduces ymeas(k), e(k) and mapping function K. Ymeas(k) can represent actual measured values obtained from one or more sensors located withinenclosure 710. For example, ymeas(k) can represent temperature and humidity sensor readings from one or more of thermostats and/or smoke detectors located in the enclosure.FIG. 7E shows, for example, that devices 721-724 are providing measurement data. Correction factor e(k) represent the difference between y(k) and ymeas(k). K represents a mapping that the correction factor e(k) has on updating the next internal state (x(k+1)) ofenclosure 710. - The mapping functions A, B, C, and K can represent state-space matrices that may be calculated by the thermodynamic state-space engine according to various embodiments on a periodic basis (e.g., once a day). The state-space engine may make assumptions that correlations exist between inputs and outputs (e.g., an HVAC input will affect temperature and humidity within the enclosure) so that the state-space matrices (e.g., A, B, C, and K mapping functions) can be calculated. When the state-space matrices are found, the state-space engine can determine that predicted outputs, y(k) and the next state space x(k±1) can be calculated.
- One of the advantages of the thermal model defined by the state-space described in connection with
FIGS. 7A-7D is that no model changes are required for enclosures having multiple zones. For example, if additional zones are added to the enclosure, the B and C mappings may be updated to incorporate the additional inputs and the thermal model will automatically incorporate the new factors. There is no need to create additional new models for the new factors. Another advantage is that regardless of how many new inputs and sensors are added to the enclosure, the thermal model can rapidly assimilate the changes and accurately predict the temperature. For example,FIG. 7F , shows that even when new devices 731 and 732 are added to enclosure 720, the state-space model can create new entries for the devices in the y(k) and Ymeas(k) vectors, while maintaining the same state-space vector, x. The state-space vector will, however, take the new y(k) and Ymeas(k) vector entries into account (by way of the e vector) as it updates over time. -
FIG. 8 shows an illustrative schematic representation of state-space model 800 according to an embodiment. State-space model 800 can includeinputs 810,current state space 820, predictedoutputs 830, measured outputs 840,correction factor 850, andnext state space 860. State-space model 800 also includes Amapping function 870, which exists betweencurrent state space 820 andnext state space 860,B mapping function 871, which exists betweeninputs 810 andnext state space 860,C mapping function 872, which exists betweencurrent state space 820 and predictedoutputs 830, andK mapping function 873, which exists betweencorrection factor 850 andnext state space 860. -
Inputs 810 can represent various factors that can affect the thermodynamic characteristics of an enclosure. The inputs can include, for example, HVAC states 811,outdoor temperature 812,ambient light 813, window states 814, door states 815,occupancy 816,clock 817, andweather 818. It should be understood that any additional inputs can be added and any inputs listed herein can be omitted. HVAC states 811 can represent all the different possible HVAC operational states that can be imposed on the enclosure (e.g., single stage, dual stage, dual stage and auxiliary pump, etc.).Outdoor temperature 812 can represent the temperature outside of the enclosure.Ambient light 813 can represent how much ambient light is striking the enclosure. Window and door states 814 and 815 may represent whether windows and doors are open or closed.Occupancy 816 can indicate whether any persons are present or expected to be present.Clock 817 can include calendar and time of day information.Weather 818 can indicate current conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) and predicted conditions. - Current state-
space 820,correction factor 850, and next state-space 860 have been discussed above and require no further explanation. -
Predicted outputs 830 can represent various predicted outputs generated by state-space model 800. Any suitable number of outputs may be generated. If desired, multiple outputs can be generated for each sensor/device. For example, as shown,outputs sensors sensors Output 835 may represent a predicted parameter for sensor N. For example,sensor 1 can be a thermostat,sensor 2 can be smoke detector, and sensor N can be a central alarm system. Each of the sensors can be located in different regions or zones of the enclosure, thereby providing a basis forthermal model 800 to map and predict parameters at those different zones. - Measured outputs 840 can represent actual measured data acquired from one or more sensors located within the enclosure. The measured outputs can match predicted outputs, or the measured outputs can be less than or greater than the number of predicted outputs. As illustrated in this FIG., the measured outputs match those of the predicted outputs. As such,
outputs sensors sensors Measured output 845 may represent a parameter acquired by sensor N. - Mapping functions 870-873 can represent the variables used by
thermal model 800 to ascertain the predicted outputs and the next state space. Over time, one or more of mapping functions 870-873 may change as new training data (e.g., measured outputs) is acquired. Mapping functions 870-873 may be updated on a periodic basis (e.g., once a day, every four hours, once a week, etc.). The manner by which mapping functions 870-873 are updated is discussed below in more detail. It should be appreciated that the mapping functions are used to solve x(k+1) and y(k) of the state space model. - The state space model can be represented by different mathematical representations that may enable state
space model engine 800 to estimate values of the next state space and the outputs. These alternative representations of the state space are now discussed. The state space system can be represented in a predictor form: -
x(k+1)=A K x(k)+B K z(k), -
y(k)=Cx(k)+e(k), - where:
z(k)=[u(k)T y(k)T]T, - Based on this representation, an extended state-space model can be formulated as:
-
Y s,s,N=Γs X s,N +H s U s,s,N +G s E s,s,N, - where:
-
- The value of s can be chosen to represent a level of complexity or length of dynamics to be captured by the state space. In some embodiments, s can be defined as a function (e.g., a multiple of a fixed number) of the order of the state space model. As a specific illustrative example, s can be defined as two times the order model. Thus, if the order of the model is 5, s is 10.
- Ys, Us, and Es are known, but Xs, Γs, Hs, and Gs are not known. Specifically, the Kalman state Xs,N is unknown, but the Kalman state can be estimated from past input and output data, and can be represented as:
-
- where:
-
- An assumption can be made that AK
s =0 when AK is stable and s is sufficiently large. Based on this assumption, the extended state space model can be formulated as: -
- where:
-
- This can result in the following formulation of the extended state space model:
-
Y f =L w W p +H s U f +G s E f. -
FIG. 9 shows an illustrative schematic diagram illustrating mapping function determination engine 900 of how mapping functions are updated according to an embodiment. Mapping function determination engine 900 can include device inputs andmeasurements 908,sensor database 910,intermediate history object 912, intermediahistory database 914,subspace identification module 920, updated mapping functions 930, andstate space engine 800. Determination engine 900 can be run on a periodic basis in order to ascertain updated mapping functions 870-873. For example, the periodic basis can be any suitable time frame such as once a day, twice a day, six times a day, or once a week. The frequency at which determination engine 900 may determine how fast newly acquired sensor data and inputs are used for ascertaining the mapping functions. In some embodiments, determination engine 900 can throttle the periodic basis as needed. For example, when evidence of a new input or a new sensor is provided, determination engine 900 may temporarily increase the frequency during which it ascertains updated mapping functions. This may permit the new data to be more quickly assimilated into the state-space model. After a relative steady state has been achieved, the frequency of updates may return back to its “normal” period. - Device inputs and
measurements 908 may represent data points that are collected and stored insensor database 910 on a period basis. The period basis for data collection can be, for example, one a minute, every five minutes, or any other suitable timeframe. In some embodiments, some the data collection rate may vary depending on the type of device. For example, thermostat devices may have a different data collection rate than a smoke detector device or security monitoring device. Device inputs can represent inputs provided by the device. For example, for thermostat devices, the input can be HVAC control instructions (e.g., run time, setpoints, etc.). In other embodiments, the device inputs can include one or more of the inputs provided to the state-space model (e.g., one or more of inputs 811-818). The measurements can be data measured by a device located within the enclosure. For example, a thermostat may measure the temperature at its location. In some embodiments, the measurements can include one or more of the same measurements that are used in the state-space model (e.g., outputs 841-845). -
Sensor database 910 can function as a cache for temporarily storing device inputs and measurements.Sensor database 910 can accumulate data during the periodic basis set by the determination engine 900. Thus, if the periodic basis is one day,sensor database 910 accumulates data for a day, and after the day is over, the accumulated data is provided tosubspace identification module 920, and the data stored indatabase 910 is flushed. New data can be collected and stored during the next periodic cycle. -
Intermediate history database 914 can store a state-space model representation of anintermediate history object 912 that includes all previously acquired sensor data with a bias that puts less emphasis on older data. The intermediate history object maintains a fixed size regardless of how much data acquired and is updated each time accumulated data is provided bysensor database 910. Theintermediate history object 912 provided tosubspace identification 920 can incorporate the new sensor data (as being provided by sensor data base 910). The new sensor data is incorporated into the intermediate history object provided byintermediate history database 914. More particularly, the intermediate history object is updated in a recursive manner that only uses the new data to update the object. The recursive updating nature of the intermediate history block provides an advantage for enabling the state-space model to rapidly adapt to monitored changes in the enclosure. In addition, each recursive update of the intermediate history object is stored inintermediate history database 914. Moreover, as will be explained in more detail below, the intermediate history object is maintained the same format (e.g., LQ factorization) used by one of the subspace identification processes implemented bysubspace identification module 920. This format can be the result of a least squares regression, for example. -
Subspace identification module 920 can receiveintermediate history database 912, which incorporates new sensor data provided by sensor databased 910 and the history object stored inhistory database 914. Using the updatedintermediate history object 912,subspace identification module 920 can calculate updated mapping functions by processing the data inregression engine 922,model reduction engine 924, andparameter estimation engine 926. The updated mapping functions obtained frommodule 920 are represented bybox 930. Updated mapping functions 930 are provided toengine 800 to evaluate state space and output determinations using the updated mapping functions. -
Subspace identification module 920 may calculate the updated mapping functions by performing the following steps in order: regression, model reduction, and parameter estimation.Regression engine 922 may perform a least squares regression to estimate one or several high-order models.Regression engine 922 can computer the least squares estimates in the following equation: -

FIG. 10 shows an illustrative flowchart of steps that may be taken to coordinate the operation of a third party device with the predicted operation of the HVAC system, according to an embodiment.FIG. 10 is arranged in three columns, each representing actions taken by a different device. The left most column corresponds to the third party vendor/application (e.g.,vendor 630 ofFIG. 6 ). The middle column corresponds to a remote server that maintains a database that stores model predictions (e.g.,database 624 that stores model predictions generated bythermal model 611 or thermal model 622). The right most column corresponds to a third party device that is associated with the third party vendor/application in the left most column. For example, the third party device can bethird party device 615 a ofFIG. 6 . - Starting at
step 1002, the third party application can request a model prediction from the remote server. The request may pertain to a specific house or enclosure. Atstep 1004, the remote server can receive the request for the model prediction. The remote server may access a database (e.g., database 624) to pull the appropriate model prediction associated with the house or enclosure of interest and provide that model prediction to the third party application, atstep 1006. The model prediction may include a run time schedule of the building control system (e.g., HVAC system) in the house of interest. The run time schedule may span a fixed future time. For example, referring briefly toFIG. 11 ,waveform 1110 shows an illustrative ON and OFF cycles over the future time period defined by times, t0 and tn.Waveform 1110 has ON periods existing between times, t1 and t2, t4 and t5, and t7 and t8, and has OFF periods existing between times t0 and t1, t2 and t3, t5 and t7, and t8 and tn. - In some embodiments, the remote server may also provide a power threshold to the third party application. This can enable the third party application to schedule a run time of its third party device to coincide with the run time of the building control system so long as the combined power load does not exceed the power threshold. It should be appreciated that embodiments that use the power threshold may use a model prediction that includes a projected energy consumption profile over the future time period. For example, the model prediction may specify the anticipated power load of the building system, or a combination of the building system and other devices, over that fixed future time.
- Referring back to
FIG. 10 , atstep 1008, the third party application can receive the model prediction. Atstep 1010, the third party application can determine a third party run time schedule based on the received model prediction. For example, referring again toFIG. 11 , an illustrative third party device run time schedule is shown aswaveform 1120. The third party application can schedule the ON/OFF cycles of the third party device so that they are staggered with respect to the ON/OFF cycles ofwaveform 1110. That is, the third party application can schedule third party device ON times during HVAC OFF times. As shown inwaveform 1120, the ON times coincide with the OFF times ofwaveform 1110. This can result in a staggered operation of the HVAC system and the third party device, provided that the HVAC operation adheres to its predicted run time operation. - Referring back to
FIG. 10 , the third party application can provide the third party device run time schedule to the third party device, as shown instep 1012. The run time schedule can be provided directly the third party device (as shown inFIG. 10 ) or indirectly by way of the remote server (not shown inFIG. 10 ). Atstep 1014, the third party device can receive the third party device run time schedule, and can operate according to the received run time schedule (at step 1016). - It should be understood that the steps shown in
FIG. 10 are merely illustrative and that additional steps may be added, re-arranged, or omitted. For example, authentication steps could be added to show that the remote server authenticates the third party application before providing it with requested model predictions. As another example, steps could be added showing that the third party device run time schedule is provided to the remote server, which may analyze it before transmitting it to the third party device. If the remote server determines that the third party run-schedule is unfit, it may be refuse to transmit it to the third party device and notify the third party application of its determination. -
FIGS. 12A and 12B show anillustrative process 1200 of how a remote server handles receipt of run time schedules for multiple third party devices, according to an embodiment. Starting atstep 1202, a request for model prediction can be received from a first third party application. Atstep 1204, a determination is made as to whether any third party device run time schedules are currently coordinated with a pending model prediction. A pending model prediction can be an up-to-date model prediction for a future time frame that has not yet commenced. Run time schedules that are currently coordinated with the pending model prediction refer to run time schedules that have been generated to operate in connection with the pending model prediction. If the determination atstep 1204 is NO, the model prediction can be provided to the third party application, as indicated bystep 1206. Not shown, but followingstep 1206, the third party application can generate a run time schedule based solely on the model prediction. If the determination atstep 1204 is YES, the model prediction and each third party run time schedule currently coordinated with the pending model prediction are provided to the first third party application, as indicated bystep 1208. Not shown, but followingstep 1208, the third party application can generate a run time schedule based on the model prediction and each third party run time schedule currently coordinated with the pending model prediction. - At
step 1210, a run time schedule from the first third party application can be received. Atstep 1212, a determination can be made as to whether the run time schedule from the first third party application satisfies criteria. Any suitable criteria can be used in making this determination. For example, the criteria can include authentication verification. The criteria can include verification that the run time schedule does not conflict with the prediction model or existing coordinated run time schedules. If the determination at step 1211 is NO, the first device's run time schedule can be rejected and the first third party application can be informed of the rejection, as indicated bystep 1214. If the determination atstep 1212 is YES, the first device's run time schedule can be stored in a database and can be marked as coordinated with the pending model prediction, as indicated atstep 1216. Atstep 1218, the first device's run time schedule can be provided to a third party device associated with the first third party application. - It should be understood that the steps shown in
FIG. 12 are merely illustrative and that additional steps may be added, re-arranged, or omitted. -
FIG. 13 shows anillustrative process 1300 for arbitrating receipt of two or more run time schedules according to an embodiment. Atstep 1310, a model prediction is provided to a plurality of third party applications. Atstep 1320, at least two third party run time schedules can be received from the plurality of third party applications. The third party applications may not be aware of each other and thus have the potential to create run time schedules that conflict with each other. Thus, atstep 1330, any conflicts that exist among the received third party run time schedules may be arbitrated, and modifications can be made to at least one of the run time schedules based on the arbitration, as shown instep 1340. For example, the arbitration can be carried out by assigning priority to each of the third party applications that provided a run time schedule. In this example, the top priority application may be allowed to keep its run time schedule, but the remaining applications may be required to re-generate their run time schedule by taking the model prediction and higher priority applications into account. - It should be understood that the steps shown in
FIG. 13 are merely illustrative and that additional steps may be added, re-arranged, or omitted. - In other embodiments, the model predictions can be provided directly to disparately-controlled devices located in a smart home. For example, third party devices may access a thermal model prediction associated with a smart home to obtain a future parameter associated with the smart home. The future parameter can include, for example, building control nm time predictions or temperature predictions. Upon receiving the future parameter, the third party device can optimize a run time schedule based on the future parameter. This way, the third party device can self-adjust its operations based on the model predictions provided by the thermal model.
- Whereas many alterations and modifications of the present disclosure will no doubt become apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art after having read the foregoing description, it is to be understood that the particular embodiments shown and described by way of illustration are in no way intended to be considered limiting.
