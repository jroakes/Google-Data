Definitions
- This application pertains to computer-based information retrieval systems generally and, in particular, to systems which retrieve information from full text data bases. Specifically it pertains to a new, adaptive, record ranking scheme for full-text information retrieval in which records are ranked according to their relevance to query terms.
- the system of this invention is based on a multilevel (ML) record relevance weighting model.
- the multilevel (ML) record relevance weighting model proposed in "And-less Retrieval: Toward Perfect Ranking," by S.-C. Chang and W. C. Chen, Proc. ASIS Annual Meeting 1987, October 1987, pp. 30-35, is the only prior model aimed at providing a natural foundation for dynamically specifying and controlling the weighting and ranking process.
- the ML model enabled these advantages by modeling record-term-weighting criteria with multiple levels. Therefore, complex, and even conflicting, weighting criteria may be sorted out on different levels. Since each level contains only simple criteria, it is easy to describe, and to make users understand, the weighting rules under the ML model. It is therefore, possible to allow users to have direct guidance over the alteration of these criteria.
- Boolean operators have been known to be not flexible enough for information retrieval. Efforts have been made to "soften” the Boolean operators in "Extended Boolean Retrieval," by G. Salton, E. A. Fox, and H. Wu, CACM, 26 (912), December 1983, pp. 1022-1036, and "Fuzzy Requests: An Approach to Weighted Boolean Retrieval," by A. Bookstein, Journal ASIS, July 1980, pp. 240-247. But, they still preserve the operators, while the model cited above was designed to replace these Boolean operators. It is a known fact that, with any two query terms, the following relations hold between the Boolean and adjacency operators:
- adjacency implies the existence of both terms; while the existence of both terms implies at least one of them is present. It was shown that the ML model was capable of capturing this natural relation between the Boolean and adjacency operators (thereby obviating their use). In order to do this, a uniform way of quantifying phrase and word occurrences to model adjacency was established.
- This invention pertains to a method for adaptive multilevel record ranking for full text information retrieval systems, whereby retrieved records are quantitatively ranked with respect to their relevance to the terms of a query and wherein a user specifies relevance factors for a relative weighting of said relevance factors on each level.
- a first step the user chooses a set of query terms for searching a full text data base, wherein a term might include more that one word.
- the user selects and orders a plurality of relevance factors onto a number of levels, and for each relevance factor the user assigns values for attributes of the properties of said query terms which affect the relevance value of any record to his query terms for a given level of search. The user then requests a search of the full text data base for records containing the query terms.
- the system calculates, for each term of the query, a first relevance weight for each retrieved record containing said term as a function of the number of occurrences of the term in the record and, for a term containing more than one word, as a function of the distance between occurrences of words of the term.
- the system calculates, for each query term and for each of said attributes of each relevance factor, a second relevance weight value for each retrieved record as a function of said first weight value and said relevance factor.
- the system calculates, for each retrieved record a third relevance weight as a function of all of said second weight values for all of said query terms appearing in said record.
- the system ranks all retrieved records according to the quantitative values of third relevance weights of each level.
- the rank order determined by the weights on a prior level has precedence over the order determined by the weights on a succeeding level. That is, records are ranked first by the weights on level one. If two records are found to have equal weights on level one, level two weights are used to distinguish them, and so on.
- the user may assign different values to the attributes of the relevance factors to obtain a ranking at a different level.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing the hardware and operating software systems on which embodiments of the present invention have been implemented;
- FIG. 2 is an information processing flow chart for indexing the full text data base input used in the embodiments of the present invention
- FIG. 3 is an information processing flow chart of the query process for information retrieval from the full text data bases of FIG. 2;
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of one embodiment of the adaptive ranking system of the present invention showing the record weight determination at a given level.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of the hardware and operating systems environment for an experimental information retrieval system designated by the acronym FAIRS and partially disclosed in the cited reference.
- FAIRS operates on a variety of computer systems each using its own operating system. The principal feature of all the systems is the massive data storage devices indicated by reference number 12.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart showing the information processing flow for inputting a full text data base and indexing the data base in a large system using FAIRS.
- Original text files 21, are read into storage 12 as is, with the user optionally specifying record markers, each file being named and having .TXT as an extension to its file name.
- the user also describes his files to the system 22, providing a list of his files with .SRC as the extension, the configuration of his files with .CFG as extension, and additional new files with .NEW as extension.
- the user also provides a negative dictionary 23 (.NEG) of words not to be indexed.
- the inputs 21, 22, 23 are processed by an adaptive information reader/parser 24 under the FAIRS program.
- an INDEX builder 25 produces the index files 26 necessary for retrieval.
- a major component of index files is an inverted file .INV 27, which is an index to the locations of all occurrences of word in the text files 21.
- the remaining index files (28a, 28b, 28c, 28d) contain the location of the records having each word (.REC), the location of occurrences of the word (.LOC), the address of each record (.ADR) and a utility file (.CNT).
- FIG. 3 is an information processing flow chart for retrieving information from the files inputted into the system through queries.
- a user query 31 is enhanced 32 by checking it for spelling variation 33 and synonym definitions 34.
- the index files 26 are used to search 35 for records containing the query terms.
- the records found in the search are ranked 36 according to ranking rules 37.
- the original files 21 are the displayed 38 for user feedback. At this point the user can feedback relevance information 39a to refine the search or accept the retrieved text records 39b and transfer them to other media for further use.
- the present invention pertains directly to the ranking of the files in this information flow and to the user relevance feedback.
- Vector-based similarity measures have often been used to model record relevance in the hope that vector similarity measurements would somehow quantify the relevance relation of the queries or records represented by the corresponding vectors.
- the first type is to use some vector similarity formula, such as the inner product or cosine measures.
- the second type is to use various weighting functions representing certain properties of terms' occurrences, such as word frequency counts.
- the ML model may be viewed as one of the second type of effort in one sense.
- the ML model is different from traditional weighting and relevance models because it is especially designed to model the relevance between a query and a record. It is not meant for measuring relevance between two records. That is why the ML model purposely allows identical vectors to be measured less relevant, which seems against the traditional spirit of vector-based similarity measures.
- the ML relevance weighting model to estimate the relevance between query Q and record R with a vocabulary may be expressed as
- Q' is a superset of Q.
- Q' may contain m extra "dummy words" (to be defined later) created from Q by the model.
- the two weighting functions, W Q , W R are very different.
- the query-term-weighting function W Q is always binary, even though the user may specify an explicit weight for a query term.
- the record-term-weighting function W R maps record terms to vectors. The main emphasis of the ML model is put on W R , which has multiple levels and can, therefore, address complex and even conflicting (on different levels) user interpretations of relevance.
- Eq. (1) looks exactly like an inner product with the exception of the operator "*" being a multiplication between a scalar and a vector. In fact, that is exactly what is done in our spreadsheet-like scheme.
- TERM i may be a single word (simple term or a phrase (complex term). Adjacency is modeled first in preparation for the ML model.
- Wd ij represents the adjacency between words Wd i and Wd j .
- These dummy words are created to account for the effect of distances between occurrences in a record of the word pairs.
- Each occurrence of a dummy word is defined as follows: Let us assume Wd i and Wd j are a pair of adjacent words in a complex term Wd 1 , Wd 2 , . . . , Wd s of a query. We further assume that the word pair (Wd i and Wd j ) is to occur in a record with a minimal distance d, which is calculated by viewing record as a linear string of words and the distance d being 1+(the number of words in between), Each such occurrence of Wd i Wd j would then contribute: ##EQU1## to the total occurrence of the term Wd 1 , Wd 2 , . . .
- Wd i , Wd j where k is currently set to 1 in our implementation.
- the number 2s-1 is the sum of the number of actual words, s, and the number of dummy words, s-1.
- the dummy word Wd AB is represented by the two occurrences of AB and A-B with distances 1 and 3, respectively.
- the total number of occurrences of Wd AB in this record would thus be computed as ##EQU2##
- the total occurrences of term AB is computed as ##EQU3##
- the relevance weight W tr of a given term t in a record r is represented by an ordered n-tuple (vector)
- F i .sbsb.tr 's are real valued functions.
- the relevance factors F i .sbsb.tr 's are ordered by their relative importance as determined by the user. That is, F 1 .sbsb.tr is more important than F 2 .sbsb.tr, F 2 .sbsb.tr is more important than F 3 .sbsb.tr, and so forth in terms of determining the relevance.
- the ranks for the retrieved records are then decided by ordering the relevance vectors according to the values in the n coordinates.
- F i .sbsb.tr For each factor F i .sbsb.tr, there are some, say k, attributes A for term t in record r, that may affect its value. These attribute functions map each query term into a real number to indicate some properties of the term occurred in a record. F i .sbsb.tr can then be expressed as
- a j .sbsb.tr is the j-th attribute of term t in record r.
- the record-term-weighting function W i .sbsb.r on level i to estimate the relevance of record r to a query Q is
- the relevance of a retrieved record is judged by a user according to several factors, each on a different priority level.
- the factor is weighted using a set of attributes.
- the AND over OR preference may be expressed as a level where only the criterion of whether all search words are present is considered. This will become clearer in the following sections.
- the ML model essentially says that each occurrence of a search word in a record in the textbase is significant in some way to relevance (to the query) estimation of the record.
- the magnitude of significance of the relevance is to be defined according to the ML weighting model.
- the contribution of each word occurrence towards the significance of the record in the relevance estimation is quantified by some attributes of such occurrence at various levels. Based on these guidelines, we start constructing our weighting formula.
- Importance Relative weight of the term assignee by the user.
- Frequency The number of occurrences of the term in the record(s).
- Word Location The average position of the word occurrence within a record.
- the attributes Record ID and Word Location were rarely used as term-weighting factors, while they do sometimes affect relevance judgements.
- the Record ID numbers usually indicate the chronological order in which the records are put into the textbase, which may affect a user's preference.
- the location of a word may also mean something to a user. For example, when searching a collection of papers, the words which appear in the beginning are likely to be the words used in the title or the abstract, while words at the end are more likely to appear in the references. A user may find one of these situations more important to him.
- the five attributes are very different, yet they all fit well in the ML model.
- one of three potential impacts may be specified: positive, negative, or neutral.
- “Positive” means the value of this attribute should have positive impact on the relevance of the record. This attribute should therefore be multiplied on the relevance estimation for this record.
- “Negative” means this attribute has a negative impact on the relevance of the record. In this case, the reciprocal of the attribute value is multiplied for the relevance estimation of the record.
- “Neutral” means there is no effect of this attribute towards the relevance estimation of this record. As the result of selecting this option, the relevance estimation of the record is always multiplied by a constant 1.
- a coefficient may be specified to further qualify the attribute. For example, a positive impact with coefficient 3 means the attribute value is tripled before becoming a multiplier in the relevance estimation. This may be used to stress a certain attribute over others.
- the coefficient concept may be extended to cover other types of computation such as exponentiation and addition. However, we felt multiplication might be sufficient for this purpose.
- FAIRS also provides extensive relevance feedback (preview) mechanisms (see "Towards a Friendly Adaptable Information Retrieval System," by S. C. and A. Chow, PROC. RIAO 88, March 1988, pp. 172-188.) for the user to judge if the current rules are adequate.
- the formula generation process is straightforward except for the "dummy words" created by the ML model for adjacency handling. Essentially, it is a way to count the Frequency of the occurrences of a phrase in a record. Each "occurrence" of such dummy words may carry a value between 0 and 1, which represents part of that phrase frequency.
- the formula generator selects the maximum value among all occurrences of a dummy word in a record when the attribute Frequency is set to neutral (which means, no matter how many occurrences there are for the dummy word, only one will be counted, and we pick the most significant one). Otherwise, the average value of all occurrences of a dummy word is used.
- the records are ranked by the "Coverage" of the search words (Level 1), i.e., how many distinct search words a record has. This takes care of the AND case. That is, records with all the search words will be ranked highest. If no such record exists, records with the highest coverage will be selected naturally. Given k search terms, the records retrieved will be ranked automatically in the following manner:
- the default settings state that the importance of a search word and its frequency of occurrence in the record should have positive impact on the relevance estimation while the popularity of the word has negative impact. Their corresponding impacts are considered in the listed order.
- the fifth level default setting states that, all else being equal, rank the records in the reverse order according to their identification number.
- the third-level rule is equivalent to ranking the latest record highest.
- the sixth level in our default setting indicates that, all else being equal, give a record higher weight if it has the search words up front, that is, at the beginning of the document or record.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of the record weight determination at any level, which is under the control of the user.
- each ranking attribute by adjusting its coefficient 42.
