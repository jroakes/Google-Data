Physical memory on wireless communicator 100 is generally divided into 512 character group sectors, therefore troop to form 2KB in four sectors of combination, but those of ordinary skill in the art should understand, and other is cut apart and does not also depart from category of the present invention.In Figure 11, this physical memory comprises troops 1 to 30.To be maintained in file configuration table (FAT) about available information of trooping on wireless communicator 100.Troop for each, in this FAT, store two bytes, as follows.
Figure 13 troops 1 to 6 corresponding to the mp3 file storing as cluster chain.In this chain first to troop be to troop 1, then this chain is continuously by trooping 2,3,4,5 and 6, trooping 6 is finally trooping in file, is appointed as EOF (EOF) and troops.Represent the index of advancing by this cluster chain at those interior drawn arrows of trooping.Figure 13 troops 7 to 9 corresponding to the mp3 file of downloading at present.So, troop 9 not necessarily EOF troop, due to additional downloads data may need additionally to troop for store.Similarly, troop 26 to 28 corresponding to the 2nd MP3 downloading at present.Troop 23 and 24 corresponding to the MP4 downloading at present.Troop 10 to 22 and 25,29 and 30 is idle trooping.Cross spider correspondence in the trooping of Figure 13 is in the type of trooping, as shown in FAT legend.
Be to be stored in catalogue about the information of file, it is appointed as " root " in Figure 13, has 32 byte directory entries, generally comprises following message.
The file name of 8+3 character
Type-regular file, catalogue
File size
Date and time
The first file clusters
The file name of being longer than 8+3 character is by comprising that for the same file with specific properties extraneous term obtains.This catalogue self is to be stored in file system as regular file.
In the specific embodiments of the invention shown in Figure 13, this SD file system can be extended by entity flash memory size by declaring that amount of capacity is greater than.Strengthen functional device 300 and can not know this difference, because it never needs to write excessive capacity.
This extension capacity comprises that entity is trooped and virtual cluster, and it is extremely actual flash locations of reflection that entity is trooped, and virtual cluster has the address that exceedes available flash memory.Trooping in Figure 13 1 to 30 is that entity is trooped, and 31 to 60 is virtual clusters and troop.After initialized, the damage that these virtual clusters can be marked as in this FAT is trooped, and can not attempt writing these and troops thereby guarantee to strengthen functional device 100.More generally, when starting when host apparatus, this flash memory is by erasing All Files item in root empty this FAT and reseted.It is to be marked as idle trooping that entity is trooped, and virtual cluster can be marked as to damage and troops.
Virtual cluster converts counterfoil (stub) position in the time reading.Counterfoil position comprises directoryof counterfoil and media counterfoil, for example MP3 counterfoil.Directoryof counterfoil comprise and there is the symbol of taking information (for example " file is currently being downloaded, the file of download will be complete within xx seconds "), as described above.Virtual cluster is the suitable counterfoil position of videoing in this way in flash memory, and different virtual is trooped corresponding to different counterfoil files.
Trooping in Figure 13 31 and 37 is directoryof counterfoils.Troop 44 to 46, troop 50 to 52 and to troop 59 to 60 are media counterfoils.Media counterfoil is to troop and locate the cluster chain of end at EOF.Troop 44 to 46 with troop 50 to 52 corresponding to MP3 counterfoil, and troop 59 to 60 corresponding to MP4 counterfoil.Troop 32 to 36,38 to 43,47 to 49 and 53 to 58 be marked as damage troop.It should be noted that MP3 counterfoil is generally identical, because it generally comprises identical placeholder information.More generally, for example, be identical for the media counterfoil (MP3 counterfoil, JPG counterfoil or MP4 counterfoil) of particular media type.
Defined virtual cluster number equals N*M, and wherein N is the maximum number of required concurrent counterfoil, and M is the maximum number of clusters for counterfoil data.Generally speaking, troop for a directoryof counterfoil for one, and troop for a media counterfoil corresponding to 50 of 100KB.For the object of simplifying, Figure 13 draws with N=5 and M=6.In practice, be respectively 256 and 64 for the reasonable value of N and M, therefore the number of virtual cluster is 2^14.So, these virtual clusters require 32KB for its FAT item.
A part (being appointed as " counterfoil storage area " in Figure 13) that comprises the flash memory that M troops is in order to counterfoil file data and do not video to this file system.This storage area that only SD controller 112 can access flash memory.It is to hide to troop that these M in this counterfoil storage area troop; Clear and definite, it is that entity in flash memory is trooped, but is not directly mapped across on this FAT.In the time reading virtual cluster, these virtual cluster positions are converted to hiding cluster location.
Counterfoil file has effective directory entry, and it points to the virtual cluster as this first file clusters.All subsequent clusters in these counterfoil files are also virtual clusters.With reference to Figure 13, troop 44 to 46, troop 50 to 52 and to troop 59 to 60 are cluster chains for counterfoil file.Each counterfoil file points to different virtual and troops, but it can comprise identical counterfoil data.Therefore the file that will download is understood in the virtual sectors number that, SD controller 112 is asked based on enhancing functional device 300.Clear and definite, the hiding sector number that read from this counterfoil storage area is V (mod4M), and wherein V is the virtual sectors skew in this region, virtual sectors.Term 4M comes from 4 sectors of often trooping.Clearer and more definite, there is K sector if often troop, the hiding sector number that will read is V (mod K*M).
In the time downloading telefile or stream, in FAT cluster chain, be stored on wireless communicator 100, as stored local file.But, can not point to first trooping in chain for the directory entry of this file.From virtual cluster number to file name, file type, the download of truly trooping to the index, first of file remote server video in order to maintain all current counterfoil lists of documents, is included in file under counterfoil pattern and file under downloading mode.The link that can click in the above for user has at item and the counterfoil file directory item downloaded in reflection, and this counterfoil file directory item has file type or this type of other medium type of form DIRECTORY, MP3, MP3_STREAM.In the time completing download file, can from this download reflection, be removed.
In Figure 13, show and download reflection, it has the item for two catalogues and two mp3 files, and these are corresponding to these counterfoils in root.These MP3 that downloading be stored at present troop 7 to 9 with troop in 23 and 24.
With reference now to Figure 14,, it is a kind of simplified flow chart for the method from remote server download file to wireless communicator 100 according to specific embodiments of the invention.In order to supplement Figure 14, also with reference to figure 15A to 15D, its be according to specific embodiments of the invention operating period of Figure 14 method during various file download phase for the user interface of simple example service condition and the snapshot of file system.Each figure of Figure 15 A to 15D is divided into three parts.Far Left part explanation user interface, mid portion explanation directory entry and download reflection, and rightmost part explanation FAT.Thereby, although these steps are being carried out in Figure 14 explanation, the state of accompanying drawing 15A to 15D explanation user interface and file system during each step of these steps.In Figure 15 A to 15D, be identical with the legend that is provided in Figure 13 for the legend of cross spider on these FAT.Those of ordinary skill in the art should understand, and the file system shown in Figure 15 A to 15D is simplified, to emphasize the work of specific embodiments of the invention.
With reference to Figure 14, generally in step 1205, SD application program 208 is analyzed download directory file to set up new counterfoil file.SD application program 208 is search directory content recursively.For found each file, corresponding to file type, set up directoryof counterfoil or media counterfoil.
Figure 15 A is corresponding to the starting stage, and wherein user is just at browsing and download remote directory inventory, as shown in the Far Left part of Figure 15 A.In this stage, root has the item for two counterfoil catalogues, " jazz " counterfoil catalogue at virtual cluster 31 places with in " rock and roll " counterfoil catalogue at virtual cluster 37 places.This root also has the item for local file, is stored in the film and the popular song that is stored in 7 to 9 places of trooping at 1 to 6 place of trooping.Download reflection and there is the URL item for two remote directorys, there is URL http://music.com/jazz in " jazz " catalogue at virtual cluster 31 places, and there is URL http://music.com/rock in " rock and roll " catalogue at virtual cluster 37 places.
With reference now to Figure 16,, it is a kind of for produce the simplified flow chart of the method for counterfoil file in Figure 14 step 1205 according to the present invention.In step 1310, SD application program 208 is searched for the virtual cluster in FAT, for example, in Figure 15 A, troop 31 to 60, damages the first row of trooping of trooping to obtain the first idle row, to have to be labeled as.In step 1320, in finding row, step 1,310 first can apply that to troop be to be set as first of this counterfoil file according to counterfoil file type to troop.Clear and definite, for the exemplary FAT shown in Figure 13, trooping for applying of directoryof counterfoil is that first in these row are trooped, and for MP3, counterfoil is that second in these row are trooped, and for MP4, counterfoil is that the 5th in these row are trooped.This type of configuration guarantee dissimilar counterfoil corresponding to the difference in counterfoil storage area hide troop.
In step 1330, SD application program 208 configures extra virtual cluster as required for storing counterfoil file, and these extra virtual clusters are linked to the first virtual cluster.This type of virtual cluster in Figure 13 B, be shown as troop 44 to 46 with troop 50 to 52.Finally, in step 1340, SD application program 208 amendment is for the directory entry of counterfoil file, first of this counterfoil file trooped point to troop from first of step 1320, and makes the size of this counterfoil file mate the physical length of this counterfoil file.
In step 1210, enhancing functional device 200 refreshes and identifies the directoryof of up-to-date download.In step 1215, determine whether to want download file.If so, process and proceed to step 1225.Otherwise processing finishes.
As shown in Figure 15 A, user clicks in " jazz " catalogue.At once, placeholder information " downloading file list please wait " comes across on user interface.This placeholder information storage is in the counterfoil storage area corresponding in 31 hiding the trooping of trooping, as shown in figure 13.Meanwhile, strengthen functional device 200 and download telefile inventory for " jazz " catalogue, and at this inventory shown in the demonstration of the Far Left part top of Figure 15 B.This inventory comprises two files, i.e. " benny goodman " mp3 file and " louis armstrong " mp3 file.
In this stage, root comprises local directory " jazz " catalogue for data clustering 13 places.Produce " jazz " catalogue, and comprise the item for two counterfoil mp3 files, the counterfoil mp3 file at virtual cluster 44 places with at the counterfoil mp3 file at virtual cluster 50 places.Download reflection and comprise the URL with " louis armstrong " file for long-range " benny goodman ".User clicks and starts to download this file on " benny goodman ".
Refer again to Figure 14, generally in step 1220, strengthen functional device 200 to this SD file system file publishing read requests.This request is to be sent to SD driver 207.What SD driver 207 will read from FAT decision suitably troops, and finds the value of trooping corresponding to virtual cluster.Strengthen functional device 200 and do not know that this value of trooping troops corresponding to non-entity, and translate this value as the legal value of trooping.
In step 1225, SD driver 207 sends read requests to SD from controller 112.The conversion of SD driver 212 type of service K*V+ constants converts this virtual cluster value to virtual sectors value, and issues read requests to this virtual sectors.As above-mentioned, parameter K is the sector number of often trooping.
In step 1230, SD receives this read requests from controller 112.As response, SD communicates commands to SD application program 208 from controller 112, it comprises virtual cluster value, and uses formula h idden_sector=virtual_sector (mod (K*M)) to return to the hiding sector value of this correspondence to strengthening functional device 200.
In step 1235, SD application program 208 receives these events from SD from controller 112, then use download mapping by sector value convert to URL or in addition this type of to the index of file on remote server.SD application program 208 is then issued HTTP GET order or this type of other download command to obtain telefile.In the time reading the first sector of this file, this operation is only carried out once.
In step 1240, SD driver 207 these counterfoil data of acquisition.Strengthen functional device 200 and do not know that these data belong to counterfoil file.Length can be mated the file size in directoryof, to guarantee consistency.Show this data to user, and it comprises information, for example " file is currently being downloaded, download will be complete within xx seconds ".Generally refresh this information by strengthening functional device 200.Strengthening under the situation that do not refresh of functional device 200, SD cartoon is crossed refresh operation or is forced within every 2 to 3 seconds, once refresh with the disconnect/attended operation of SD agreement.
With reference to figure 15B, in this specific embodiment, play the placeholder information " Please wait, file is downloading " from counterfoil file to user.Those of ordinary skill in the art should understand, and can be used as still image or video clipping and show these placeholder information to user, or play as audio file, or the two.In a specific embodiment, this placeholder information and its respective file are same media type, i.e. audio plays in the time of download audio files just, and displaying video information in the time of downloading video files just.
With reference to figure 15C, the file of downloading is stored in entity and troops in 15,16,17 etc.This is reflected in downloads in the interior item for " benny goodman " file of reflection, wherein specifies and troops 15.
Refer again to Figure 14, generally in step 1245, SD application program 208 receives authentic document content and is stored in flash memory.This file is downloaded via baseband modem 120.Along with it arrives, SD application program 208 use receive the quantity of data and upgrade the download reflection for this file, and upgrade first in cluster chain and troop for the file in flash memory.Respectively trooping of this download file is in idle the trooping being stored in flash memory, is then labeled as full.Thereby those of ordinary skill in the art should understand, in the time downloading this file, can in FAT, produce regular file, but not for the directory entry of this file.But the first sector of this file is stored in this download reflection.
In step 1250, strengthen functional device 300 and refresh this lists of documents.In step 1255, determine whether to complete this file and download.If not, process and be back to step 1245, wherein SD application program 208 continues to download this file.Otherwise if downloaded, in step 1260, SD application program 208 is used finally trooping of this download file of EOF mark.
In step 1265, SD application program 208 is trooped and is pointed to the data clustering chain of downloading first of this file.SD application program 208 is restored the Directory Value for this file concerning the extremely first instance of up-to-date download file from this virtual cluster value and is trooped.So, this file directory is pointed to legitimate files now.Also change file size, so that corresponding to receiving file size.Then from download reflection, remove this file.
With reference to figure 15D, in the time that enhancing functional device 200 refreshes, this user interface can show new file, then the real Benny Goodman of user's uppick song.This download file is stored in now troops in 15 to 21, and the 21 use EOF that troop carry out mark.This download file is revealed as the local file in " jazz " catalogue now, and removes its catalogue from download reflection.
With reference now to Figure 17,, it is the simplification calcspar of a kind of broadcasting according to specific embodiments of the invention from the method for the mobile file of wireless communicator 100.In step 1410, strengthen functional device 200 access media counterfoils.In step 1410, start download and be associated in the flow data of this media counterfoil, and in the time that it arrives, be stored in entity file for example file clusters 7 to 9 in Figure 13.SD application program 208 is waited for, until enough data arrive to play long media of several seconds.Then,, in step 1430, SD application program 208 links download file to FAT.File size is reported as extremely long.In step 1440, in the time of this stream of above download of lasting several seconds, SD application program 208 can continue to write new data and troop.In step 1450, this FAT link of trooping can become circle, and SD application program 208 dates back for first of this file and stores and troop.
In this regard, with reference now to Figure 18, it is the schematic diagram that uses the circular file that circulates of trooping according to specific embodiments of the invention in FAT.Cross spider in Figure 18 is trooped corresponding to the FAT legend providing in Figure 10.
Refer again to Figure 17, in step 1460, determine whether user has stopped listening to this stream.This type of decision can strengthen functional device 200 by identification does not have these file clusters causes of access SD application program 208 to make.If user had not stopped listening to this stream,, along with mobile more data, processing can be back to step 1440.Otherwise, if user has stopped listening to this stream, in step 1470, strengthen application program 208 and upgrade these FAT to point to the counterfoil in virtual memory, and release to specify for all of this mobile file and troop.
Except downloading telefile to wireless communicator 100, application program 208 also can, from wireless communicator 100 upload files to remote server, be then stored in assigned catalogue.In the time of the file system of intiating radio communicator 100, SD application program 208 can be set up the catalogue of " uploading " by name under root.Should " uploading " catalogue be to produce as the directoryof counterfoil in territory, virtual storage area, and comprise single data clustering.Should " uploading " catalogue be set as at first empty list.
With reference now to Figure 19,, its be a kind of according to specific embodiments of the invention for the simplified flow chart from wireless communicator 100 upload files to the method for remote server.In order to supplement Figure 19, also with reference to figure 20A and 20B, its be according to specific embodiments of the invention operating period of Figure 19 method during various files are uploaded the stage for the user interface of simple example service condition and the snapshot of file system.Figure 20 A is divided into three parts.Far Left part represents user interface, and mid portion represents directory entry and uploads reflection, and rightmost part represents FAT.Figure 20 B is divided into two parts.Left-hand component represents directory entry and uploads reflection, and right-hand component represents FAT.Thereby, although Figure 19 illustrates the step of carrying out, with reference to the stage of Figure 20 A and 20B explanation this user interface and this file system during each step of these steps.Legend for these cross spiders on Figure 20 A to 20B is identical with the legend that is provided in Figure 13.Those of ordinary skill in the art should understand, and the file system shown in Figure 20 A to 20B is simplified, to emphasize the work of specific embodiments of the invention.
With reference to Figure 19, generally in step 1510, in the time that instruction strengthens functional device 200 upload files to remote server, it sets up new file in the virtual directory of " uploading " by name.In step 1520, SD " uploads " catalog recognition write request from controller 112 to this.SD can identify this type of request from controller 112, issues this write request to virtual cluster number owing to strengthening functional device 200.SD controller is followed transmission event to SD application program 208.

Those of ordinary skill in the art should understand, and the bidirectional battery charging chart in Figure 29 is applicable to general setting, thereby mobile device dockable (dock) is to accessories apparatus.The present invention can be advantageously used in the bidirectional battery charging of general electronic installation, and these electronic installations comprise controller, rechargeable battery, booster and battery charger, as shown in figure 29.
With reference now to Figure 30,, it represents the bidirectional battery recharge logic for Figure 29 hardware according to a specific embodiment of the present invention.In the expression of Figure 30, wireless communicator 100 is called (SA) device separately, is called jacket body (JKT) and strengthen functional device 200, in it, can pack wireless communicator 100.
Figure 30 is divided into six row.The first row refers to the state of this SA battery, and the second row refers to the state of this jacket body battery.With reference to Figure 30, below represent for this two row.
Cc is the charging current for this SA battery.CC should meet the maximum charging current mandate being set by this JKT, and is generally between 200mA to 500mA.For example, if this SA battery has 500mAh electric charge, use the electric current that is greater than 500mA to charge and may be harmful to battery.
JKT is the voltage of this JKT battery.
SA is the voltage of this SA battery.
STBC is the electric current of on average awaiting orders of this SA device.STBC is generally between 5mA to 50mA.
Vc is the voltage drop on this SA booster, this SA battery charger and this SA battery in the time using electric charge CC charging.Vc general about be 0.3V and corresponding to this SA battery capacity 50% to 100%.

Vm is the minimum voltage for this JKT battery, forces to charge from this SA device lower than this voltage.Vm is generally between 3.4V to 3.5V, corresponding to 10% capacity of about this JKT battery.
The third line in Figure 30 refers to the pattern that this SA device is operating.Exist three kinds of operator schemes for this SA device, as follows:
I. high current drain.This pattern is movable and generation while sending between this SA device and base transceiver stations (BTS) at this SA device.Under this pattern, this SA has the general current drain that is greater than 100mA, and peak current may be greater than 1A, requires factor to determine, for example distance of this SA device and this BTS according to electric power.Use this SA device of this JKT battery supplied because these higher peak current are undesirable under this pattern.See through bag connector and transmit this type of high electric current and have difficulties in the quality of this JKT battery and current drives, booster electric current and charger current, cause hardware cost and size to increase.Under this pattern, charging is limited to fixed current, and because fixed voltage charging is drawn peak current from this JKT, this is undesirable.
II. the current drain of awaiting orders.This pattern occurs in the time that this SA device is not communicated by letter with this BTS.Under this pattern, this SA device has and is less than the general current drain of 100mA and exceedes 100mA without any peak current.This type of electric current position standard is suitable for from this JKT battery supplied, and not charging on dielectric imposed limits.

The design of 8.SD bridger
Specific embodiments of the invention are the BDB Bi-directional Data Bus about splicing ear A and terminal B.This data/address bus may be SD or MMC bridger, and wherein terminal A is connected to strengthen functional device 200 and terminal B is connected to wireless communicator 100.Bridger of the present invention can determine input and the definite information content that do not need outside direction signal and do not need decoding to send on this bridger.
In a specific embodiment, the present invention uses two data buffers, drives the first buffer of signal and the second buffer that drives in the opposite direction signal on the direction from terminal A to terminal B in data/address bus.These buffers may be under an activation or dead status.In the time of activation buffer, it drives sense.
Introduce specific logical with based on deciding activation and the time of each buffer of stopping using in terminal A and B logical process sampling position.
With reference now to Figure 34,, it is that this circuit determines bus direction on two-way SD and NMC holding wire according to the reduced graph of the circuit 600 of a specific embodiment of the present invention.Circuit 600 connects two terminal A and B, and on both direction,, from A to B and from B to A, sends signal.
Generally speaking, terminal A is connected to and strengthens functional device 200 (it is SD main frame), and terminal B is connected to wireless communicator 100 (it is SD slave unit).In the case, there is multiple bidirectional data line D0 to D3 and CMD.These data wires D0 to D3 synchronously makes it change its sense simultaneously.
May be identical or may be not identical at the voltage of terminal A and B.In order to hold the different voltages at these terminal places, circuit 600 comprises two accurate deviator buffers 610 and 615 in position, and it drives signal from A to B and from B to A respectively.The accurate skew meeting in position produces voltage drop to drive sense on these buffers.Each buffer has two states, i.e. activation is with inactive.In the time of activation buffer 610, from A to B transmitted signal data, and in the time of activation buffer 615, from B to A transmitted signal data.
Circuit 600 also comprises four data inverters (DFF) module, i.e. module 620 (specifying DFF_A), module 625 (specifying DFF_B), module 630 (specifying DFF_EnAB) and module 635 (specifying DFF_EnBA).Each DFF module has input value, output valve and frequency values.The output of DFF module is input delay one frequency counting, and in the time that frequency rises, DFF module is at a rising frequency edges moment capturing input signal, and input subsequently can change not affect output, until next rising frequency edges.
Module 630 and 635 is in order to difference activation buffer 610 and 615.Clear and definite, in the time of DFF EnAB.out=0, meeting activation buffer 610, and in the time of DFF EnAB.out=1, the buffer 610 of can stopping using.Similarly, in the time of DFF EnAB.out=0, meeting activation buffer 615, and in the time of DFF EnAB.out=1, the buffer 115 of can stopping using.
Circuit 600 also comprises respectively bypass line 640 and 645, makes previous signal value A and B (representing respectively A_Delayed and B_Delayed) and current signal value A and B can supply access.
Circuit 600 comprises four Logical processing units 650,655,660 and 665.Processing unit 650 has input A and A_Delayed; Processing unit 655 has input B and B_Delayed; Except entering from processing unit 650 data of processing unit 660, processing unit 660 has input DFF_EnBA.out; And except entering from processing unit 655 data of processing unit 665, processing unit 665 has input DFF_EnAB.out.The operation of processing unit 650,655,660 and 665 is below described in the discussion of Figure 35.
Circuit 600 comprises two pullup resistors 670 and 675, draws this circuit to logical one on when it does not drive signal in SD or MMC link both sides.
With reference now to Figure 35,, it is a kind of for determine online the simplified flow chart of bus direction at two-way SD and MMC signal according to a specific embodiment of the present invention.Clear and definite, Figure 35 general introduction is for a part for the logic of activation and inactive Figure 30 buffer 610 and 615.
Reason for logic shown in Figure 35 is three characteristics based on SD and MMC bus; That is:
1. this SD and MMC bus D0 to D3 and CMD line have the pullup resistor 670 and 675 that is connected to it, draw this bus to logical one on when its both sides at this SD or MMC link do not drive signal.
2. start from the start bit of logical zero and end at the position of rest of logical one in D0 to D3 and the online each SD of CMD and MMC transaction.
3. because comprising direction, these SD and MMC bus change, therefore drive a side of signal to stop driving bus before opposition side starts to drive two frequencies circulations of bus.
The logic of Figure 35 starts from step 1705, and wherein two buffers are to be set to its dead status.In step 1710, these A of initialization and B signal value are to logical zero.Step 1715 and 1720 is crossover steps, and it preserves previous A and B signal value and new samples value.
As in step 1725 to 1750 findings, there is logical zero input during when the side (A or B) of sample circuit 600, circuit 600 activation buffer on the direction from this side to opposition side, and lock this buffer under enabled status.
As in step 1755 to 1775 findings, circuit 600 this activation buffer of stopping using in the time 1 of two continuous logic being detected.The event that detects 1 of two continuous logic may represent closing the transaction, may be maybe a part for transaction.Under former instance, two buffers of stopping using, then circuit 600 prepares to detect next transaction, and switching direction when needed.Under latter instance, this SD or MMC bus due to these pullup resistors still in its correct logic level.Because first anteposition is logical one, due to device and bus capacitance and do not cause the delay of any bus signals stabilisation.
