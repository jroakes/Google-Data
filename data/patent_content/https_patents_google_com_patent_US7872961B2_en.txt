Definitions
- This invention relates generally to orthogonal frequency division multiple access communications.
- each such end user platform typically receives base station instructions (via, for example, a ranging exercise) regarding adjustments to be made to the end user platform's transmissions. These adjustments are intended to cause all end user platform transmissions to arrive in synchronicity at the base station. Unfortunately, such synchronicity typically does not literally occur notwithstanding such adjustments. Ranging errors and channel delay spread as corresponds to each end user platform, for example, tends to cause at least a certain degree of non-synchronicity.
- a base station in such a system typically cannot separate end user platform transmissions prior to employing fast Fourier transform processing and therefore must essentially tolerate such timing errors.
- the timing error becomes relatively large, however, this typically leads inevitably to performance degradation. Such degradation can often be observed even when, for example, the timing error is small enough to be within a cyclic prefix interval as corresponds to common orthogonal frequency division multiple access protocols.
- FIG. 1 comprises a schematic signal depiction as configured in accordance with the prior art
- FIG. 2 comprises a flow diagram as configured in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 3 comprises a schematic signal depiction as configured in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 4 comprises a flow diagram as configured in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.
- FIG. 5 comprises a block diagram as configured in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.
- a base station receives orthogonal frequency division multiple access signals from a plurality of end user platforms that share all used tones within at least one orthogonal frequency division multiple access symbol.
- this base station uses a fixed starting time to select contiguous samples from received aggregate signals to provide selected contiguous samples wherein the fixed starting time is offset from a reference time that comprises a time at which the base station expects to be receiving the messages from all end users.
- the base station selects contiguous samples from the received aggregate signals to thereby provide corresponding selected contiguous samples, processes these selected contiguous samples using fast Fourier transform, and provides phase rotation with respect to those processed samples.
- phase rotation can be applied to the multi-user composite signal (to compensate for using the fixed start time noted above) and, in addition, individual phase rotation can be applied as determined on a user-by-user basis.
- OFDMA signals 100 from different end user platforms often (in fact, typically) arrive in a non-synchronous manner with respect to one another.
- a process 200 in accordance with these teachings provides for reception 201 at an OFDMA base station as is known in the art of signals from a plurality of end user platforms that share all used tones within at least one OFDMA symbol.
- this process 200 then provides for using 202 a fixed starting time to select contiguous samples from received aggregate signals to provide selected contiguous samples.
- this fixed starting time 303 is offset from a reference time 301 by an offset value A 302 that comprises a time at which the base station expects to be receiving the signals 300 from all end users.
- this offset value can comprise a relatively static value as may be set by a system administrator or calculated by the base station or other system resource.
- this offset value can be selected from amongst a plurality of candidate offset values 203 .
- the transmitted messages will each comprise, in part, a cyclic prefix. Accordingly, if desired, this offset value can be selected as a function, at least in part, of one or more of the cyclic prefix length, a known, calculated, measured, or estimated system ranging error, and/or a maximum channel delay.
- this process 200 can optionally further provide for processing 204 the selected contiguous samples using fast Fourier transform to provide processed samples and then providing 205 phase rotation with respect to such processed samples.
- this provision of phase rotation can comprise first applying 401 a phase rotation that corresponds to the offset value to all of the end user platforms to compensate for having used the aforementioned fixed starting time.
- the base station can then apply 402 individual phase rotation as corresponds to time delays that are determined on a user-by-user basis.
- This can comprise, for example, determining the individual phase rotations as a function, at least in part, of a timing error estimate as individually corresponds to each end user platform.
- Such can be accomplished, for example, by using linear regression to determine the time error estimate(s) as individually correspond to each end user platform.
- an OFDMA base station 500 comprises, in relevant part, a processor 501 that operably couples to a receiver 502 and a first and second memory 503 and 504 .
- the receiver 502 serves to receive the aforementioned OFDMA signals in aggregate form.
- the first memory 503 serves to store such signals.
- the second memory 504 serves to store the aforementioned shared fixed starting time.
- the processor 501 may be configured and arranged (via, for example, appropriate programming) to use the shared fixed starting time to select contiguous samples from received aggregate messages to provide resultant selected contiguous samples.
- This processor 501 may be further configured and arranged to process such selected contiguous samples using fast Fourier transform to provide resultant processed samples and to then provide phase rotation with respect to such processed samples (again as described above if so desired).
- Such an OFDMA base station 500 may be comprised of a plurality of physically distinct elements as is suggested by the illustration shown in FIG. 5 . It is also possible, however, to view this illustration as comprising a logical view, in which case one or more of these elements (such as, for example, the first and second memory 503 and 504 ) can be enabled and realized via a shared platform. It will also be understood that such a shared platform may comprise a wholly or at least partially programmable platform as are known in the art.
- the received baseband signal can be expressed as:
- x (1) (t) and x (2) (t) are time domain mobile signals
- ⁇ 1 and ⁇ 2 denote the timing offset of end user platforms 1 and 2 ;
- the soft quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbol for the nth tone may be expressed as:
- the samples input for fast Fourier transform processing for current OFDMA symbol will typically contain a portion of samples from one or more adjacent OFDMA symbols.
- ISI inter-symbol interference
- ICI inter-carrier interference
- nth tone of mth OFDM symbol can be expressed as:
- the first term is the desired part that has been scaled and rotated by a phase proportional to the tone index n for a given offset ⁇
- the second and third term are interference results from a self OFDM symbol, which comprises the aforementioned inter-carrier interference, and the adjacent OFDM symbol, which comprises the aforementioned inter-symbol interference.
- Parameter ⁇ is preferably selected to be the maximum tolerable system timing error. If the channel delay spread is very small and negligible, ⁇ can be cyclic prefix/2 to maximize ranging error tolerance. On the other hand, if ⁇ can be reduced in view of better ranging performance, the cyclic prefix can be shortened to reduce the corresponding cyclic prefix penalty that inherently exists in any OFDM system. In practical implementation, the fixed offset ⁇ may be programmable at the base station to accommodate different application scenarios.
- phase rotation for each tone after the fast Fourier transform processing step.
- there may be two phase rotations (though these teachings will readily permit combining these two rotations into a single step if desired) with a first phase rotation (that corresponds to the fixed offset ⁇ ) being applied to all tones and the other phase rotation being end user platform based and being associated with individual end user platform timing error.
- CP corresponds to the cyclic prefix
- ⁇ m is the timing error associated with end user platform m.
- the phase rotation per end user platform is either counterclockwise or clockwise.
- the next step is to estimate the individual mobile timing error ⁇ m .
- AAS Adaptive Antenna System
- AMC Adaptive Modulation and Coding
- pilot symbols for example, PUSC (Partial Usage of SubChannels) mode in 802.16e) or the like.
- phase rotation is a linear function of tone index.
- ⁇ b L xy L xx a - y _ - b ⁇ x _ ⁇ ⁇
- each PUSC tile contains 12 positions in a tone-time grid and this corresponds to 12 QAM symbols.
- Four of these symbols are used for pilots that are modulated in binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), and the remaining eight positions are for data that could be quadrature phase shift keyed (QPSK), 16QAM, 64QAM symbols, or the like.
- BPSK binary phase-shift keying
- QPSK quadrature phase shift keyed
- one slot is defined as six “tiles,” where each tile consists of four adjacent subcarriers in the frequency domain across three adjacent OFDMA symbol durations in the time domain.
- the six physical positions of the six tiles in one subchannel will typically randomly change every slot.
- This effective tone hopping facilitates inter-cell interference mitigation. Due to this tone hopping, the timing error estimate for individual end user platforms may be based on each tile using the corresponding pilot symbols.
- the timing error estimate for a particular end user platform can be expressed as:
Abstract
Description
where x(1)(t) and x(2)(t) are time domain mobile signals; τ1 and τ2 denote the timing offset of end user platforms 1 and 2; and φ1 and φ2 are related phase offsets due to the timing errors. In the discrete time domain, the received signal may be expressed as:
y k =x k+τ
where δn 1 and δn 2 equal 1 or 0 indicating if the nth tone is assigned to the first or second end user platform, respectively; and sn (1) and sn (2) are QAM symbols on the nth tone if the tone is used by either end user platform (though not where both are used for non-space division multiple access systems). This indicates that when the timing error is within the ambit of the cyclic prefix, fast Fourier transform orthogonality is preserved and only phase rotation on the desired tone exists, which is a linear function of the tone index n and the rotation direction is determined by the sign of τ1 and τ2.
r=[y τ(m), y τ+1(m), . . . , y N−1(m), y 0(m+1), y 1(m+1), . . . , y τ−1(m+1)]
where the first N−τ samples are from the current OFDM symbol and the remaining τ samples are from the (m+1)th OFDM symbol. Then, the nth tone of mth OFDM symbol can be expressed as:
Φk=exp(j2π(CP−Δ)k/N) for tone k across all data tones.
The second phase rotation per end user platform can be expressed as:
Ψk=exp(j2πτm k/N) for tone k if the tone is used by end user platform m
Where CP corresponds to the cyclic prefix and τm is the timing error associated with end user platform m. Depending on the sign of τm, the phase rotation per end user platform is either counterclockwise or clockwise. The next step is to estimate the individual mobile timing error τm. This can be achieved, for example, by either using a message/packet/symbol preamble (such as in AAS (Adaptive Antenna System) AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding) mode), pilot symbols (for example, PUSC (Partial Usage of SubChannels) mode in 802.16e) or the like.
where Q is the number of points in the scattering, or the number of preamble or pilot symbols used in the timing error estimate. The solution can be easily obtained by solving:
The estimated timing error is therefore τm=Nb/2π.
φt,k =<P t,k ×{tilde over (P)} t,k*, where t is tile index and k=1,2,3, and 4 for pilot positions in a tile
where {tilde over (P)}t,k* represents conjugate received pilot symbol in tile t at position k. Then the timing error estimate for a particular end user platform can be expressed as:
where T is the number of total tiles as correspond to end user platform m.
