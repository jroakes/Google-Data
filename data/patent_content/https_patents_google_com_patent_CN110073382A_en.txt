Index, which holds up computing system 140, can weigh the input from user 101 less than from the user's with higher reliability score
Input.
In another example, 140 determination of search engine computing system will be considered as the configuration in the inventory of " abundance "
Unit numbers, wherein term " abundance " here indicates that the number of obtainable article is greater than expected requirement and therefore produces
Product will likely can get for buying.For example, the utilization rate of size, product based on shop, the time in one day, Inventory Transshipment
Frequency and other factors, determination will ensure that user 101 will likely can get the unit numbers in the inventory of unit.For example,
In the small shop of inventory usually sold five units weekly and supplement shop every three days, the inventory of six units will be regarded
For sufficient inventory.In this example, search engine computing system 140 can be shown on graphic user interface 114 " in the quotient
It can get sufficient unit at family ".It is that any other obtainable term can be used for conveying superfluous unit.If
Small shop, which only has a unit, can get and sell five units weekly, then inventory will be confirmed as " inadequate ".
