Technical field
The present invention relates to a kind of being used for to document produce index, search and the information retrieval system of classifying such as the extensive corpus of internet (Internet).
Background technology
The so-called search engine of information retrieval system, nowadays they are a kind of being used at the basic tool of seeking information such as extensive, the also ever-increasing corpus of variation of internet.In general, search engine is created index so that the individual malapropism that exists in document (or " page or leaf ") and each document is relevant.Response one inquiry that contains a plurality of query terms comes searching document, and this normally realizes based on the query term that has some in the literature.Come the document that retrieves is classified according to other statistical measures such as the frequency that occurs such as query term, main territory, link analysis.Then, by the order after the graduation document that retrieves is presented to the user usually, and do not carry out any other grouping or force classification.In some cases, only present the selected part of document text so that make the user can understand the content of described document roughly.
Direct " boolean (Boolean) " of query term coupling has a plurality of restrictions of knowing, and especially can't discern those and do not have query term but document with related words.For instance, in typical Boolean system, to can not return document during search " Australian Shepherds (Australian shepherd dog) " about other herding dogs (shepherd dog) (for example, BorderCollies (winning shepherd dog)) with definite query term.On the contrary, described system may retrieve usually simultaneously about the document of Australia (Australia) (and with dogs (dog) irrelevant) and document about " shepherds (shepherd dog) ", and these documents are come higher level.
The problem here is that traditional system works out literature index according to individual term rather than notion.Notion is represented with phrase usually, as " Australian Shepherd (Australian shepherd dog) ", " President of the United States (US President) " or " Sundance Film Festival (Sundance Film Festival) " etc.Some existing system is at most just predetermined and the incompatible establishment literature index of very limited " known " phrase book, and these " known " phrases are generally selected by human operator may.Because perceive identification by (such as) all possible phrase formed of three, four or five or more a plurality of word need calculate and storer, so generally can avoid to the phrase produce index.For instance, if suppose that any five words can constitute a phrase and a big corpus will have at least 200,000 uniquity, will there be about 3.2*10 so
26Individual may phrase, this obviously exceeds any existing system can be stored in amount or its amount that can programme in addition and handle in the storer.Another problem is the continuous input of phrase and can exceeds its usage in dictionary that this individual malapropism newer than invention is much frequent.New phrase always produces from originate such as technology, art, world's incident and law etc.Other phrase will reduce use in time.
Some existing information searching system attempts to provide conceptual retrieval by the pattern of using a malapropism to occur simultaneously.In these systems, search for a word, for example " President (president) " will retrieve the document that has continually other word (reaching " House (house) " as " White (white) ") that occurs with " President (president) " simultaneously.Although this method may produce the Search Results with the document of conceptually being correlated with on individual malapropism level, it generally can't be trapped in the thematic relation that exists between the phrase that occurs simultaneously.
Therefore, need a kind of information retrieval system and method, it can discern phrase in the extensive corpus all sidedly, according to phrase establishment literature index, according to its phrase search document and with the document graduation and other trooping and descriptive information about described document is provided.
Summary of the invention
The present invention relates to a kind of information retrieval system and method, it uses phrase to come the document produce index in the document databse, search for, classify and illustrate.Described system is suitable for discerning those phrases that have enough frequent and/or unique usage in document databse to indicate that it is " effectively " or " good " phrase.In this way, can discern the multiword phrase, for example by four, five or the more multinomial phrase of forming.This with regard to avoided necessary identification by the word of giving determined number each possible phrase of might sequence being produced and to the problem of its produce index.
This system also is suitable for according to existing the ability of other phrase to discern the phrase that is relative to each other in the phrase prediction document.More particularly, utilization makes the relevant prediction measures of expection while occurrence rate of actual while occurrence rate with these two phrases of two phrases.A kind of this type of prediction measures is an information gain, and promptly actual occurrence rate simultaneously and expection be the ratio of occurrence rate simultaneously.When prediction measures surpassed a predetermined threshold, two phrases were relevant.Under the sort of situation, second phrase has significant information gain with respect to first phrase.Semantically, relevant phrases will be those phrases that are used for discussing or describing a given theme or notion jointly, as " President of the United States (US President) " and " White House (White House) ".For a given phrase, relevant phrases can be come sequencing based on its prediction measures separately according to its correlativity or validity.
Information retrieval system is come the document produce index in the document databse by effective or good phrase.For each phrase, charge to tabulation identification those contain the document of described phrase for one.In addition, for a given phrase, use second tabulation, vector or other structure to store also there is which relevant phrases of given phrase in indication in containing each document of described given phrase data.In this way, described system not only can respond search inquiry and identify which document easily and contain which phrase, and can identify which document also contain relevant with query phrase and therefore more may be specifically about the represented theme of query phrase or the phrase of notion.
Use phrase and relevant phrases also to create and used trooping of relevant phrases, it is semantically representing the significant grouping of phrase.The relevant phrases that has very high prediction measures between the genitive phrase during trooping is discerned and is trooped.Trooping can be used to organize Search Results, comprises selecting to comprise which document and order thereof in the Search Results, and removes document from Search Results.
Information retrieval system also is suitable in response inquiry and uses phrase during the search document.Handle inquiry so that be identified in any phrase that exists in the inquiry, thereby charging to together of retrieval and inquisition phrase tabulated and relevant phrases information.In addition, in some cases, the user can import incomplete phrase in search inquiry, as " President of the (... president) ".Can discern imperfect phrase like this and replace, as " President of the United States (US President) " with the expansion phrase.This helps to guarantee the most possible search of actual execution user.
System also can use relevant phrases information to discern or select to comprise in the Search Results which document.For a given phrase and a given document, relevant phrases information points out to exist which relevant phrases of described given phrase in described given document.Therefore, for an inquiry that contains two query phrases, the tabulation of charging to of handling first query phrase earlier contains the document of first query phrase with identification, and which document also contains second query phrase in these documents to discern then to handle relevant phrases information.Then, these documents of back are included in the Search Results.This does not just need system to follow the tabulation of charging to of individual processing second query phrase, and be provided search time faster thus.Certainly, the method also can expand to the phrase that any amount is arranged in the inquiry, calculates and the time thereby can significantly save.
System also can be suitable for using phrase and relevant phrases information to come the document among the last set result is classified.The relevant phrases information of one given phrase is preferable with the form storage such as bit vector, and it represents the validity of each relevant phrases with respect to described given phrase.For instance, relevant phrases bit vector all has a position for each relevant phrases of given phrase, and these prediction measures according to relevant phrases (for example, information gain) are come sequencing.The most effective position of relevant phrases bit vector is relevant with the relevant phrases with the maximum prefetch amount of estimating, and least significant bit (LSB) is relevant with the relevant phrases with minimum prediction measures.In this way, for a given document and a given phrase, relevant phrases information can be used to document is scored.The value of bit vector (as a value) itself can be used as the document mark, and in this way, the document that contains the senior relevant phrases of query phrase more may be relevant with inquiry on theme than the document with rudimentary relevant phrases.The bit vector value also can be used as the one-component in the more complicated score function, and can weighting.Then, can come document is classified according to the document mark.
Phrase information also can be used in the information retrieval system so that user's search personalization.The user is modeled as the phrase that document an obtained set of crossing (for example, see, print, store or the like) from (for example) described user's ever accessed on screen.Say that more specifically the document of given user capture then will be included in the relevant phrases that exists in this document in user model or overview.At searching period subsequently, use phrase in the user model to come the phrase of filtered search inquiry and to the document mark weighting of the document that retrieves.
Phrase information also can be used in the information retrieval system to create the document description that (for example) is included in the document among the last set result.A given search inquiry, described system identification go out the phrase that exists in the inquiry with and relevant phrases and its expansion phrase.For a given document, each sentence of described document all has a counting that has what query phrases, relevant phrases and expansion phrase in sentence.Can come the graduation of document sentence by these countings (indivedual or combination), and select the sentence (for example, five sentences) of the highest ranking of some to form document description.When comprising described document in the Search Results, can then present document description to the user, make and can understand described document better with respect to inquiring user.
System further improves the method for this generation document description, so that can provide the personalization explanation at reflection user interest place.As mentioned above, user model has been stored the information of identification user's interest relevant phrases.The phrase that this user model is relevant with query phrase with row intersects, to discern these two groups total phrases.Then, come described total set sequencing according to relevant phrases information.Then, use the set of gained relevant phrases to come to come the sentence of document is classified according to the instance number of these relevant phrases that exist in each document.Selection has a plurality of sentences of total relevant phrases of maximum quantity as personalized document description.
When to document databse produce index (creeping) or when disposal search queries, information retrieval system also can use phrase information to discern and remove the repetition document.For a given document, each sentence of described document all has a counting that has what relevant phrases in sentence.Can count to the graduation of document sentence by this, and select the sentence (for example, five sentences) of a plurality of highest rankings to form document description.Then, this explanation storage (for example) that will be relevant with document is the character string or the hash of described sentence.During produce index, handle the document newly creep in the same manner to produce document description.New document description can mate (for example, hash) with previous document description, and if find coupling, this new document is exactly a repetition document so.Similarly, between the fruiting period of preparing search inquiry, the document that can handle in the search result set repeats document to remove.
The user interface that system of the present invention and software architecture, computer program and computer-implemented method and computing machine produce has other embodiment with presenting.
Above only be based on the information retrieval system of phrase and some features of method.The technician of information retrieval field will understand, and the dirigibility of phrase information ubiquity can be extensive use of it and uses in produce index, document note, search, graduation and other field of document analysis and processing.

Embodiment
I. system survey
Referring now to Fig. 1,, it has showed the software architecture of an embodiment of search system 100 according to an embodiment of the invention.In this embodiment, system comprises a directory system 100, a search system 120, a display system 130 and a front-end server 140.
With regard to the application's case, " document " is interpreted as and can comprises file of webpage document, image, multimedia file, text document, PDF or other picture format or the like by the medium of search engine produce index and any kind of retrieving.A document can have the ingredient of one or more page, subregion, section or other suitable its contents and type.Comparably, document can be called " page or leaf ", and it is commonly used to refer to the document on the internet.Use generic term " document " not mean category of the present invention is carried out any restriction.Search system 100 can be operated big document corpus, and as internet and WWW, but it can be used in the more limited set equally, as is used for the document databse of the library or the private enterprise.Should be appreciated that under arbitrary situation document generally is distributed in the many different computer systems and website.So, do not lose generality, no matter form or position (for example, which website or database) are referred to as corpus or document databse with document.Each document all has the identifier together of a described document of unique identification; Described identifier is preferably URL, but also can use the identifier (for example, document number) of other type.In this announcement, suppose and use URL to discern document.
II. directory system
In one embodiment, directory system 110 provides the operation of three main functions: 1) identification phrase and relevant phrases, 2) about phrase to the document produce index, and 3) produce and keep classification based on phrase.The person of ordinary skill in the field will understand, and under the support of traditional index function, directory system 110 also will be carried out other function, so this paper is not described further these other operations.The index 150 and the data storage bank 160 of 110 pairs of phrase data of directory system are operated.Hereinafter further specify these data storage banks.
1. phrase identification
" good " and " bad " phrase in the phrase identifying operation identification document databse of directory system 110, these phrases help document produce index and search.On the one hand, good phrase is that those often appear in the document databse phrase that surpasses in the document of a certain number percent, and/or be expressed as have different outward appearances in described document, as delimiting by putting mark label or other form, form or grammatical markers.Good phrase be that it can predict other good phrase on the other hand, and be not only the word sequence that appears in the dictionary.For instance, phrase " President of the United States (US President) " is a prediction waits other phrase such as " George Bush (George Bush) " and " Bill Clinton (bielke Islington a) " phrase.Yet, do not have a predictability such as other phrase of " fell down the stairs " or " top of the morning ", " out of the blue ", this is often to occur with many other different and irrelevant phrases with idiom because resemble these Chinese idiom.Therefore, the phrase cognitive phase determines which phrase has been that phrase and which are bad phrase (that is, lacking predictive ability).
Referring now to Fig. 2,, the phrase identifying has the following functional stage:
200: collect possibility and good phrase, and the frequency of described phrase and the statistical value that occurs simultaneously;
202: may be divided into phrase or bad phrase by phrase based on the frequency statistics value;
204: measure based on the predictability that obtains from the statistical value that occurs simultaneously and to have simplified list of phrases.
Each stage in these stages will be described now in further detail.
Phase one 200 is such processes, and by this process, the directory system 110 one group of document in (crawl) document databse of creeping forms a plurality of repetition subregions of described document databse in time.Subregion of every around reason.The document number of creeping for every time may change, and is preferably about 1,000,000 document of each subregion.The preferable document of before not creeping of only handling in each subregion up to handling all documents, or satisfies a certain other stop criterion.In fact, because new document constantly adds in the document databse, constantly continue so creep.Each document after 110 pairs of directory systems are creeped is taked the following step.
Travel through each word of described document with the phrase length of window of n, wherein n is the maximum phrase length of expectation.The length of window is generally at least 2, is preferably 4 or 5 (words).Preferable all words that comprise in the phrase window of phrase comprise those otherwise can be characterized as being the word that finishes word, as " a ", " the " or the like.The phrase window can return, put the sign of marking label or other guide or format change by end of line, paragraph and stop.
Fig. 3 illustrates the part of document 300 during the traversal, and it shows that phrase window 302 is from word " stock " beginning and expand 5 words to the right.First word in the window 302 is candidate's phrase i, and each phrase among sequence i+1, i+2, i+3, i+4 and the i+5 is similarly candidate's phrase.Therefore, in this example, candidate's phrase is: " stock ", " stock dogs ", " stock dogs for ", " stock dogs for the ", " stock dogs for the Basque " and " stock dogs for the Basque shepherds ".
In each phrase window 302, check successively each candidate's phrase with determine its whether Already in good list of phrases 208 or may list of phrases 206 in.If candidate's phrase has not appeared in list of phrases 208 or the possibility list of phrases 206, that just definite described candidate's phrase is skipped for " bad " phrase and with it.
If candidate's phrase has appeared in the list of phrases 208, as an article or item in a contract gj, that just more index 150 an article or item in a contracts of new phrase gj appear in the current document to indicate this candidate's phrase gj to comprise described document (for example, its URL or other document identification symbol).An article or item in a contract in the index 150 of phrase gj (or item) is called the tabulation of charging to of phrase gj.Charge to tabulation and comprise a row document d (by its document identification symbol, for example document number or URL) who phrase wherein occurs.
In addition, as hereinafter further explaining, matrix 212 appears in renewal simultaneously.In initial first pass, all will be sky well with bad tabulation, therefore tend to most of phrases add to may list of phrases 206 in.
If candidate's phrase has not appeared in the list of phrases 208, that just adds it in the possibility list of phrases 206, unless wherein there has been described time phrase.Each an article or item in a contract p on the possible list of phrases 206 has three countings together:
P (p): the document number that has the possibility phrase;
S (p): all instance number of possible phrase; And
M (p): the instance number that arouses attention of possible phrase.May phrase and document in the difference of adjacent content be grammer or form mark, for example black matrix or underscore or when being anchor text in hyperlink or the quotation marks, the example of possible phrase " arouses attention ".These (with other) difference outward appearance is indicated by various HTML markup language labels and grammatical markers.When a phrase had been placed in the list of phrases 208, these statistical values of described phrase still were retained.
Except each tabulation, matrix 212 (G) appears when also retaining phrase.Matrix G has the mxm dimension, and wherein m has been the quantity of phrase.Each an article or item in a contract G in the matrix (j, k) representative a pair of good phrase (gj, gk).Occur simultaneously matrix 212 logically (but physically not necessarily) keep every pair of good phrase (gj, gk) about three separate counts of secondary window 304, described window 304 be centered close to current word i, and expansion+/-a h word.In one embodiment, for example as described in Figure 3, secondary window 304 has 30 words.Therefore, occurring matrix 212 simultaneously keeps:
R (j, k): occurrence count in the time of original, promptly phrase gj appears at number of times in the secondary window 304 with phrase gk;
D (j, k): the counting that arouses attention of separation, promptly phrase gj or phrase gk appear at number of times in the secondary window as special text; And
(j, k): the counting that arouses attention of connection, promptly phrase gj and phrase gk simultaneously appear at number of times in the secondary window as special text to C.The counting that arouses attention that use to connect is particularly advantageous in avoids phrase (for example, copyright notice) frequently to appear in sidebar, footer or the header and the therefore situation of in fact unpredictable other text.
Referring to the example of Fig. 3, suppose that " stock dogs " and phrase " Australian Shepherd " and " Australian Shepard Club of America " have been positioned on the list of phrases 208.Latter two phrase appears in the secondary window 304 works as before phrase " stock dogs " on every side.Yet phrase " Australian Shepherd Club of America " occurs as the anchor text of the hyperlink (by the underscore indication) of website.Therefore, described to { " stock dogs ", " Australian Shepherd " } original while occurrence count increase progressively, and { " stock dogs ", " Australian Shepherd Club of America " } original while occurrence count all increase progressively with the counting that arouses attention that separates, this is to occur as special text because of the latter.
Each document in the subregion is repeated with the process of window sequence 302 with secondary window 304 each document of traversal.
Behind the document in having traveled through subregion, the next stage of produce index operation is exactly from may list of phrases 206 upgrading 202 good list of phrases 208.If possible the frequency of occurrences of the possibility of on the list of phrases 206 phrase p indicates it enough to be used as significant phrase semantically with the document number that described phrase occurs, and that has just moved on to described phrase in the list of phrases 208.
In one embodiment, its test is as follows.May phrase p and placed it in the list of phrases 208 from may list of phrases 206 getting one, precondition is:
A) P (p)＞10 and S (p)＞20 (the document number that contains p is greater than 10, and the occurrence number of phrase p is greater than 20); Perhaps
B) M (p)＞5 (instance number that arouses attention of phrase p is greater than 5).
Document number in these threshold values and the subregion is proportional; For example, if creep 2,000,000 document in subregion, that threshold value approximately doubles.Certainly, the person of ordinary skill in the field will understand, and the occurrence of these threshold values or the logic of testing it can change with the need.
If phrase p does not have qualification to enter list of phrases 208, check that then it becomes the qualification of bad phrase.Phrase p is that the condition of a bad phrase is:
A) document that contains phrase is counted P (p)＜2; And
B) the instance number M that arouses attention (p)=0 of phrase.
These conditions indicate described phrase neither frequent, can not be used to refer to effective content, and similarly, these threshold values can be proportional with the document number in the subregion.
It should be noted that as mentioned above except the multiword phrase, good list of phrases 208 natures will comprise that a malapropism is as phrase.This is because each the first word candidate's phrase always in the phrase window 302, and suitable example counting will be accumulated.Therefore, directory system 110 can be automatically to individual malapropism (that is the phrase that, has single word) and multiword phrase produce index.Good list of phrases 208 also will than based on m phrase the theoretical maximum that might make up short a lot.In exemplary embodiments, good list of phrases 208 will comprise about 6.5x105 phrase.Because the phrase of may phrase becoming reconciled only need be understood by system, so do not need to store bad list of phrases.
By last time inspection document databse, because the expection distribution that phrase uses in the big corpus, so the tabulation of possibility phrase will be shorter relatively.Therefore, if the 10th time (for example, 10,000,000 document), a phrase occurs for the first time, and it is extremely can not become a good phrase in that time so.It may be the new phrase of just having brought into use, and therefore becomes more and more common in creeping subsequently.Under the sort of situation, its corresponding counts will increase, and may finally satisfy the threshold value that becomes a good phrase.
The phase III of produce index operation is to use from occurring predictability that matrix 212 obtains simultaneously and measures and simplify 204 good list of phrases 208.Without reducing the number of, itself can't fully predict the existence of other phrase in the dictionary or itself be the phrase of the subsequence of length language more although good list of phrases 208 comprises many reasonably appearing at probably.More may effectively obtain phrase after removing these more weak good phrases.In order to have discerned phrase, use predictability tolerance, it represents the existence of a given phrase, the possibility that occurs another phrase in the literature increases.In one embodiment, this finishes as follows.
As mentioned above, occurring matrix 212 simultaneously is m x m matrixes of storing the data that are associated with good phrase.Every capable j in the matrix has represented phrase gi, and every row k has represented phrase gk.For each good phrase gj, calculation expectation value E (gj).Expectation value E is the number percent that expection contains the document of gj in the storehouse.For example, it is calculated as the ratio of the document sum T that has creeped in the document number that contains gj and the storehouse: P (j)/T.
As mentioned above, when gj occurs in the literature at every turn, promptly upgrade the document number that contains gj.When the counting of each gj increases or during this phase III, the value of renewable E (gj).
Then, other good phrase gk for each (for example, each row of matrix) determines whether gj has predicted gk.It is definite as follows that the predictability of gj is measured:
I) calculation expectation value E (gk).If gj and gk are irrelevant phrases, then (j k) is E (gj) * E (gk) to its expection while occurrence rate E;
Ii) calculate gj and gk actual while occurrence rate A (j, k).(j is k) divided by document sum T to be about to original while occurrence count R;
Iii) it is said when actual occurrence rate A simultaneously (j, k) surpass expection simultaneously occurrence rate E (j, k) during a critical quantity, gj predicts gk.
In one embodiment, predictability tolerance is information gain.Therefore, when the information gain I of another phrase gk in face of phrase g j surpasses a threshold value, phrase gj prediction phrase gk.In one embodiment, this is calculated as follows:
I(j，k)＝A(j，k)/E(j，k)。
And when satisfying following condition, good phrase gj has predicted phrase gk:
I (j, k)＞information gain threshold.
In one embodiment, information gain threshold is 1.5, but preferable between 1.1 and 1.7.Being elevated to threshold value above 1.0 is in order to reduce the possibility that stochastic prediction appears surpassing in two scripts irrelevant phrase simultaneously.
As mentioned above, with respect to given capable j, to every row k duplicate message Calculation of Gain of matrix G.After delegation finished, if the information gain of none phrase surpasses information gain threshold among the good phrase gk, this just meaned unpredictable any other the good phrase of phrase gj.Under the sort of situation, remove gj from good list of phrases 208, it just becomes bad phrase basically.Note, do not remove the row j of phrase gj, because this phrase itself can be predicted by other good phrase.
After having assessed all row that occur simultaneously in the matrix 212, finish this step.
Last step in this stage is to have simplified list of phrases 208 to remove imperfect phrase.Imperfect phrase is one and only predicts its expansion phrase and the phrase of (that is, phrase begin place) beginning from the leftmost side of described phrase." the expansion phrase " of phrase p is a supersequence that begins with phrase p.For instance, phrase " President of " prediction " President of the United States ", " President of Mexico ", " President of AT﹠amp; T " or the like.Because these phrases of all back all are to begin and be its supersequence with " President of ", so they are the expansion phrases of " President of ".
Therefore, each the phrase gj that has been retained on the list of phrases 208 will predict a certain amount of other phrase based on the aforementioned information gain threshold.Now, for each phrase gj, the string matching of each phrase gk that directory system 110 execution itself and its are predicted.String matching tests whether each prediction phrase gk is the expansion phrase of phrase gj.If all prediction phrase gk are the expansion phrases of phrase gj, gj is just imperfect so, it is removed from good list of phrases 208 and adds in the imperfect list of phrases 216.Therefore, not the phrase gk of the expansion phrase of gj if there is at least one, that gj is exactly complete, and can be retained in the list of phrases 208.So for instance, unique other phrase of being predicted as " President of the United " is " President of the United States " and this prediction phrase when being the expansion phrase of described phrase, and " President of the United " is exactly an imperfect phrase.
216 of imperfect list of phrases are very useful in the actual search process.When receiving search inquiry, itself and imperfect tabulation 216 can be compared.If described inquiry (or its part) is mated with an an article or item in a contract in the described tabulation, that search system 120 just can be searched most probable expansion phrase (the given imperfect phrase of this imperfect phrase, have the expansion phrase of high information gain), and advise this phrase or the expansion phrase is searched for automatically to the user.For example, if search inquiry is " President of the United ", that search system 120 can be from trend user suggestion " President of the United States " as search inquiry.
Behind the last stage of finishing the produce index process, good list of phrases 208 will contain a large amount of good phrase of finding in corpus.Each phrase in these good phrases will predict that all at least one is not other phrase of its expansion phrase.That is, each good phrase all uses with enough frequencies, and independently represents significant notion or thought represented in the corpus.Different with the existing system of the phrase that uses predetermined or artificial selection, good list of phrases has reflected the actual phrase that uses in the corpus.In addition, because new document adds to and makes in the document databse and periodically repeat above-mentioned creeping and the produce index process, so directory system 110 detects described new phrase automatically when new phrase enters dictionary.
2. identification relevant phrases and relevant phrases troops
Referring to Fig. 4, the relevant phrases identifying comprises following functional performance:
400: identification has the relevant phrases of high information gain value;
402: discern trooping of relevant phrases;
404: storage cluster bit vector and cluster number.
Describe each operation in these operations now in detail.
At first recall, occur matrix 212 simultaneously and contained phrase gj, wherein each phrase predicts that all at least one has other the good phrase gk greater than the information gain of information gain threshold.Then, in order to discern 400 relevant phrases, (gj gk), compares information gain and relevant phrases threshold value (for example, 100) to good phrase for each.That is, when
I (gj, gk)＞100 o'clock,
Gj and gk are relevant phrases.
Occur when using this high threshold to discern well to surpass the good phrase of statistical expection rate.On statistics, its mean phrase gj and gk simultaneously occurrence rate surpass 100 times of expection while occurrence rate.For instance, the phrase in the given document " Monica Lewin sky ", if phrase " Bill Clinton " may occurrence rate be its 100 times more in same document, then phrase " Bill Clinton " may appear in the document of selecting at random arbitrarily.Because occurrence rate is 100: 1, be 99.999% so another kind of form of presentation is a prediction accuracy.
Therefore, will (with referring expression gj, gk be uncorrelated for gj, gk) zeroing less than any an article or item in a contract of relevant phrases threshold value.Now, occur in the matrix 212 any residue an article or item in a contract simultaneously and all indicate all relevant phrases.
Then, (gj gk) comes the row gk ordering among each the row gj that occurs matrix 212 simultaneously, makes at first to list to have the relevant phrases gk of high information gain by information gain value I.Therefore, to be that a given phrase gj identifies according to which other phrase most probable of information gain relevant in this ordering.
Next step is to determine that 402 which relevant phrases form relevant phrases together and troop.Trooping is the set of relevant phrases, and wherein each phrase has high information gain with respect at least one other phrase.The identification of trooping in one embodiment, is as follows.
In the every capable gj of matrix, one or more other phrase relevant with phrase gj will be had.This set is exactly relevant phrases set Rj, R={gk wherein, gl...gm}.
For each the relevant phrases m among the Rj, directory system 110 determines whether each other relevant phrases among the R is also relevant with gj.Therefore, if (that gj, gk and gl are parts of trooping to I for gk, gl) also non-zero.To among the R each to (gl gm) repeats this test of trooping.
For instance, supposed that phrase " Bill Clinton " and phrase " President ", " Monica Lewinsky " are relevant, this is because each these phrase all surpasses the relevant phrases threshold value with respect to the information gain of " Bill Clinton ".In addition, suppose that phrase " Monica Lewinsky " is relevant with phrase " purse designer ".So these phrases form set R.For determining to troop, directory system 110 gains by the corresponding information of determining these phrases and assesses the information gain of each phrase with respect to other phrase.Therefore, directory system 110 is determined all information gain I to phrase (" President ", " Monica Lewinsky "), I (" President ", " purse designer ") among the R or the like.In this example, " Bill Clinton ", " President " form one with " Monica Lewinsky " and troop, " Bill Clinton " forms second with " President " and troops, and " Monica Lewinsky " forms the 3rd with " purse designer " and troops, and " Monica Lewinsky ", " Bill Clinton " and " purse designer " formation four group collection.Although this is that " Monica Lewinsky " still predicts this two phrases because " Bill Clinton " do not have enough information gains to predict " purse designer ".
For writing down 404 cluster information, to each appointment unique cluster number (ID troops) of trooping.Then, write down this information together in conjunction with each good phrase gj.
In one embodiment, cluster number is to be determined by the bit vector of trooping, and the bit vector of trooping is the orthogonality relation between the referring expression also.The bit vector of trooping is that length is the sequence of the position of n, and wherein n has been the quantity of the good phrase in the list of phrases 208.Give for one and to reserve phrase gj, the relevant phrases R of position, position after corresponding to the ordering of gj.If relevant phrases gk among the R and phrase gj in same trooping, then set a position.More in general, this means, then set the corresponding positions in the bit vector of trooping if on the either direction between gj and the gk, have information gain.
So cluster number is exactly the value of gained bit string.This embodiment has such characteristic, and the relevant phrases that promptly has multidirectional or unidirectional information gain appears in the same cluster.
A following example that is to use the bit vector of trooping of above-mentioned phrase:
So summarize it, after this process, will discern one group of relevant phrases R for each good phrase gj, (gj, gk) order is from high to low arranged according to information gain I for it.In addition, for each good phrase gj, the bit vector of trooping all will be arranged, and its value is a cluster number of mainly trooping that is used to discern under the phrase gj, and in the relevant phrases among its quadrature value (is 1 or 0 for each position) indication R which phrase and gj to be in common group concentrated.Therefore, in above-mentioned example, " Bill Clinton ", " President " and " Monica Lewinsky " are in trooping in 14 based on the value of the position in the row of phrase " Bill Clinton ".
For storing this information, can use two kinds of basic representations.The first, as mentioned above, information stores can be occurred in the matrix 212, wherein at the same time:
The capable j of an article or item in a contract G[, row k]=(I (j, k), cluster number, the bit vector of trooping).
Perhaps, can avoid matrix representation, and with all information stores in good list of phrases 208, wherein every row is represented a good phrase gj;
The capable j=tabulation of phrase [phrase gk, (and I (j, k), cluster number, the bit vector of trooping)].
The method provides a kind of useful set of clusters weave.At first, the method is not a strictness and the theme that defines arbitrarily usually and the classification of notion, but the theme shown in the approval relevant phrases forms the relation table of a complexity, wherein some phrase is relevant with many other phrases, and the scope of some phrase is more limited, and wherein each the relation may be mutual (other phrase predicted in each phrase) or unidirectional (other phrase predicted in a phrase, otherwise but then can not).It is " part " that the result can characterize paired each good phrase with trooping, so some is trooped overlapping owing to have one or more common relevant phrases.
So for a given good phrase gj, relevant phrases provides a kind of classification that named phrase troops that is used for according to the sequencing of information gain: the name of trooping is to have the title of the relevant phrases of high information gain in trooping.
Said method provides a kind of very strong mode of the effective phrase that is used for identifying present document databse and these relevant phrases to be used in the mode of nature in " trooping " together in reality is implemented.Therefore, to this data-driven of relevant phrases troop " editor " of any artificial guiding of the relational language of having avoided common in many systems and notion select intrinsic deviation.
With phrase and relevant phrases to the document produce index
Given comprising about the good list of phrases 208 of relevant phrases with the information of trooping, the next functional performance of directory system 110 be about good phrase with troop to the document produce index in the document databse, and the information stores after will upgrading is in index 150.Fig. 5 illustrates this process, comprising the establishment literature index the following functional stage:
500: the charging in the tabulation of the good phrase that document is charged in the literature to be found;
502: the example counting and relevant phrases bit vector that upgrade relevant phrases and secondary relevant phrases;
504: come the note document with relevant phrases information;
506: come index an article or item in a contract sequencing again according to charging to list size.
To describe in more detail these stages now.
As mentioned above, the literature collection that travels through or creep; This can be identical or different literature collection.For a given document d,, be that the window sequence 302 of n word for word travels through 500 documents with length in the above described manner from position i.
In a given phrase window 302, begin all good phrases the identification window from position i.Each good phrase all is expressed as gi.Therefore, g1 is first good phrase, and g2 is second good phrase, and the rest may be inferred.
For each good phrase gi (example gl " President " with g4 " President of ATT "), the document identification symbol (for example, URL) is logged into the charging in the tabulation of good phrase gi in the index 150.This renewal identifies, and phrase gi occurred in this specific document.
In one embodiment, following logical form is adopted in the tabulation of charging to of phrase gj:
Phrase gj: tabulation: (document d, [tabulation: relevant phrases counting] [relevant phrases information]).
For each phrase gj, a document d tabulation that described phrase occurs is arranged all.For each document, the count list of the occurrence number of a relevant phrases R who appears at the phrase gj among the document d is equally arranged all.
In one embodiment, relevant phrases information is a relevant phrases bit vector.This bit vector can be characterized by " dibit " vector, and this is because for each relevant phrases gk, position, two positions is all arranged: gk-1 and gk-2.Whether first location storage one indication exists the label (that is, the counting of the gk among the document d is greater than 0) of relevant phrases gk in document d.Whether second location storage one indication also exists the label of the relevant phrases gl of phrase gk in document d.The relevant phrases gl of the relevant phrases gk of phrase gj is called " the secondary relevant phrases of gj " in this article.Described counting and the canonic ordering (order according to the information gain of successively decreasing arrange) of position, position corresponding to phrase among the R.This sort order produces such effect, make that promptly the relevant phrases gk of gj topnotch prediction is relevant with the Must Significant Bit of relevant phrases bit vector, and the relevant phrases gl of the minimum prediction of gj is relevant with least significant bit (LSB).
Notice more usefully that for a given phrase g with regard to all documents that contain g, the association between the individual bits of the length of relevant phrases bit vector and relevant phrases and described vector is all identical.This embodiment has following characteristic, even system easily relatively contains the relevant phrases bit vector of any (or owning) document of g, has given relevant phrases to observe which document.This helps promoting search procedure response search inquiry to discern document.Therefore, given document will appear at charging in the tabulation of many different phrases, and this type of is charged in the tabulation at each, and the relevant phrases vector of described document will be exclusively used in and have the described phrase of charging to tabulation.This respect has kept the locality of relevant phrases bit vector with respect to indivedual phrases and document.
Therefore, next stage 502 comprise the current index position of traversal in the document secondary window 304 (as previously mentioned ,+/-the secondary window of K item (for example 30)), for example from i-K to i+K.For each the relevant phrases gk that appears at the gi in the secondary window 304, directory system 110 makes the count increments of gk with respect to the document d in the relevant phrases counting.If gi occurs in the literature after a while and find relevant phrases once more in secondary window after a while, then increase progressively counting once more.
As mentioned above, set corresponding first gk-1 in the relevant phrases position mapping based on counting, if the counting of gk＞0, then the position is set to 1, if or described counting equal 0, then it is set to 0.
Then, in index 150, search relevant phrases gk,, check the secondary relevant phrases counting (or position) of any relevant phrases of gk then, thereby set second gk-2 in an article or item in a contract of charging to identification document d in the tabulation of gk.If set any of these secondary relevant phrases counting/position, then also there is the secondary relevant phrases of gj in this indication in document d.
When handling document d fully in this way, directory system 110 will identify:
I) the good phrase gj of each among the document d;
Ii) identify in document d, there is its which relevant phrases gk for each good phrase gj;
Iii) identify in document d, also there is its which relevant phrases gl (the secondary relevant phrases of gj) for each the relevant phrases gk that is present among the document d.
A) determine document subject
To the document produce index and use cluster information that another advantage of directory system 110 is provided, promptly can determine the theme of document by phrase based on relevant phrases information.
Suppose that for a given phrase gj and a given document d it is as follows to charge to the tabulation an article or item in a contract:
Gj: document d: relevant phrases counting :=3,4,3,0,0,2,1,1,0}
Relevant phrases bit vector :={ 11 11 10 00 00 10 10 10 01}
Wherein, to be shown as dibit right for the relevant phrases bit vector.
From the relevant phrases bit vector, we can determine one-level and the secondary theme of document d.Main subject heading is indicated (1,1) by the position, and the secondary theme is indicated (1,0) by the position.The relevant phrases position is to existing right relevant phrases gk of institute's rheme and secondary relevant phrases gl simultaneously among (1,1) indication document d.This can be interpreted as meaning that the author of document has used some relevant phrases gj, gk and gl together when writing described document d.The position exists gj and gk simultaneously to (1,0) indication, but does not have any other secondary relevant phrases of gk, so this is so not effective theme.
B) improve graduate document note
Given document d in the document databse can have the outer link to other document of some.Each outer link (hyperlink) all comprises the document identification symbol of anchor text and target literature.In order to explain, the current document d that is handling to be called URL0, and the target literature of the outer link on the document d is called URL1.In order to wait a moment the document graduation that is used for Search Results, for each link among the URL0 that points to some other URLi, directory system 110 is created described link with respect to the outer link mark of the anchor phrase of URL0 and the described anchor phrase internal chaining mark with respect to URLi.That is, each link in the document databse all has a pair of mark, i.e. an outer link mark and an internal chaining mark.Being calculated as follows of these marks.
On given document URL0, directory system 110 identifications are to each outer link of another document URL1, and wherein anchor text A is a phrase in good list of phrases 208.Fig. 8 a schematically illustrates this relation, and wherein the anchor text " A " among the document URL0 is used for hyperlink 800.
Charging in the tabulation of phrase A, URL0 is charged to as the outer link of phrase A, and URL1 is charged to as the internal chaining of phrase A.For URL0, finish the relevant phrases bit vector as mentioned above, to discern relevant phrases and the secondary relevant phrases of the A that exists among the URL0.With the outer link mark of this relevant phrases bit vector as link from URL0 to the URL1 that contains anchor phrase A.
Then, following definite internal chaining mark.For each internal chaining to the URL1 that contains anchor phrase A, directory system 110 scanning URL1, and determine phrase A in the main body of URL1, whether to occur.If phrase A not only points to URL1 (by the outer link on the URL0), and appears in the content of URL1 itself, it is inner relevant with the notion of phrase A representative that this just shows that URL1 can be called.Fig. 8 b has illustrated this situation, and wherein phrase A appears in the main body of URL0 (as the anchor text) and URL1.Under this situation, with the relevant phrases bit vector of the phrase A of URL1 internal chaining mark as link from URL0 to the URL1 that contains phrase A.
If appearing in the main body of URL1, anchor phrase A (as Fig. 8 a), then just do not take different steps to determine the internal chaining mark.Under this situation, directory system 110 is created the relevant phrases bit vector (just looking like to have phrase A at URL1) of the URL1 that is used for phrase A, and which relevant phrases of its referring expression A appears among the URL1.Then, with the internal chaining mark of this relevant phrases bit vector as the link from URL0 to URL1.
For instance, suppose the following phrase of initial existence in URL0 and URL1:
(in above-mentioned and following table, not showing the secondary relevant phrases).URL0 is capable to be outer link mark from the link of anchor text A, and URL1 capable be the internal chaining mark of described link.Here, URL0 contains the anchor phrase that target is URL1 " Australian Shepard ".In five relevant phrases of " Australian Shepard ", only one " Aussie " appears among the URL0.So intuitively, URL0 is only weak relevant with Australian Shepards.By comparing, URL1 not only has the phrase " Australian Shepherd " that is present in the document main body, but also has a plurality of relevant phrases " blue merle ", " red merle " and " tricolor ".Therefore, owing to anchor phrase " AustralianShepard " appears among URL0 and the URL1, so the internal chaining mark of the outer link mark of URL0 and URL1 is above-mentioned corresponding line.
Above-mentioned second kind of situation is meant the situation that does not occur anchor phrase A among the URL1.Under the sort of situation, there is which phrase among relevant phrases " Aussie ", " blue merle ", " red merle ", " tricolor " and " the agility training " in directory system 110 scanning URL1 and determining in URL1, and therefore produce a relevant phrases bit vector, for example:
Here, this shows that URL1 does not contain anchor phrase " Australian Shepard ", but contains relevant phrases " blue merle ", " red merle " and " tricolor ".
The method helps preventing fully webpage (a class document) is carried out the manipulation of the distortion Search Results of some type.Have in a large number by manual creation and to point to the graduation algorithm that page or leaf that institute wants the given anchor text of page or leaf can " bombard " use and depend on the link number of the given document of sensing and come the graduate search engine of described document.Therefore, when the search inquiry of anchor text is used in input, can return institute usually and want page, though in fact this page almost or fully it doesn't matter with the anchor text.The relevant bits vector from being input to the relevant phrases bit vector of phrase A of document URL0, has been eliminated target literature URL1 search system to pointing to URL1 with as among the URL0 of the indication of validity or the phrase A among the URL1 and the dependence of the relation between the anchor text phrases.
Based on the frequency of occurrences of each phrase in corpus in the index 150, also give a phrase number for each phrase.Phrase is common more, and its phrase that receives in index number is just low more.Then, directory system 110 is charged to phrase number listed document number in the tabulation according to each and is come in the index 150 all are charged to tabulation descending sort 506, makes the phrase of at first listing the most frequent appearance.So, can use weak point
Particular phrase number searched in language.
III. search system
600: the phrase in the identification inquiry;
602: retrieve the document relevant with query phrase;
604: the document in the Search Results is classified according to phrase.
The details in each stage in these stages is as follows.
1. the phrase during identification inquiry and expansion are inquired about
The phase one 600 of search system 120 is to discern any phrase of existence in the inquiry so that search for its index effectively.Use following term in this section:
Q: the inquiry of being imported and receive by search system 120;
Qp: the phrase that exists in the described inquiry;
The relevant phrases of Qr:Qp;
The expansion phrase of Qe:Qp;
The union of Q:Qp and Qr.
Receive inquiry q from user side 190, described inquiry q has the character or the word of a certain maximum quantity at the most.
At each the window's position, all will there be N item (or still less) in the window.These constitute a possible query phrase.In good list of phrases 208, search the possibility phrase, judge that it is a good phrase.If there is this may phrase in the good list of phrases 208, return a phrase number to phrase so; Now, this may phrase be exactly candidate's phrase.
In testing each window might phrase with after judging that whether they be good candidate's phrase, search system 120 will be given one group of phrase number for the corresponding phrase in the inquiry.Then, with number ordering (descending) of these phrases.
From as the highest phrase of first candidate's phrase number, whether the stationary digital distance in the tabulations that search system 120 is judged after ordering is interior another candidate's phrase, and promptly the difference between the phrase number is in the critical quantity of (for example) 20,000.If have, select the effective query phrase Qp of leftmost phrase conduct in the inquiry so.From candidate's list of phrases, remove this query phrase and all subphrases thereof, and with described tabulation rearrangement and repetition said process.The result of this process is one group of effective query phrase Qp.
For example, suppose that search inquiry is " Hillary Rodham Clinton Bill on the Senate Floor (senator Hillary Luo Dehan Clinton Bill) ".Search system 120 can be discerned following candidate's phrase: " Hillary Rodham Clinton Billon ", " Hillary Rodham ClintonBill " reach " Hillary Rodham Clinton ".Delete preceding two, and keep last as effective query phrase.Then, search system 120 can be discerned " senator Bill (Bill on the Senate Floor) " and subphrase " Bill on the Senate ", " Bill on the ", " Bill on ", " Bill ", and can select " Bill " as effective query phrase Qp.At last, search system 120 can be decomposed " on the Senate Floor ", and identification " Senate Floor " is as effective query phrase.
Then, search system 120 is adjusted the initial caps of effective phrase Qp.When decomposition query, the potential initial caps in search system 120 each effective phrase of identification.This can be by utilizing known initial caps table (for example, the initial caps of " united states " is " United States ") or utilizing and finish based on the initial caps algorithm of grammer.This produces the query phrase set of suitable initial caps.
Then, when having phrase and subphrase thereof simultaneously in this set, search system 120 can be checked the phrase of initial caps second time, and only selects the Far Left letter of those phrases that it is become capitalization.For example, the capitalization to the search of " president of the united states " will be " Presidentof the United States ".
In next stage, search system 120 identifications 602 those documents relevant with query phrase Q.Search system 120 then retrieval and inquisition phrase Q charge to tabulation, and these tabulations are intersected to judge that all (or some) which document appears at query phrase charge in the tabulation.If one group of expansion phrase Qe (hereinafter will further explain) is arranged among the phrase Q in the inquiry, search system 120 at first forms the union of charging to tabulation of described expansion phrase so, make then its and these to charge to tabulation crossing.As mentioned above, search system 120 is discerned the expansion phrase by search each query phrase Q in imperfect list of phrases 216.
The result who intersects is one group of document associated with the query.By phrase and relevant phrases establishment literature index, phrase Q in the identification inquiry, then with query expansion to comprising the expansion phrase, thereby produce one group of selected works than traditional search system document more associated with the query based on boolean, in traditional search system, only select those to contain the document of described query term based on boolean.
In one embodiment, search system 120 can use an optimization mechanism to respond inquiry identification document and not necessarily make query phrase Q all charge to tabulation and intersect.Because the structure of index 150 so for each phrase gj, its relevant phrases gk all knows, and is discerned in the relevant phrases bit vector of gk.Therefore, this information can be used for simplifying wherein that two or more query phrases are phrase that is relative to each other or the crossing process with common relevant phrases.Under those situations, but relevant phrases bit vector direct access is used for then retrieving corresponding document then.The method is hereinafter more fully described.
Given any two query phrase Q1 and Q2 have three kinds of possible relevant situation:
1) Q2 is the relevant phrases of Q1;
2) Q2 is not the relevant phrases of Q1, and its relevant phrases Qr1 and Qr2 non-intersect (that is, not having common relevant phrases) separately; And
3) Q2 is not the relevant phrases of Q1, but its relevant phrases Qr1 and Qr2 separately intersects.
To query phrase, search system 120 is determined suitable situation by the relevant phrases bit vector of searching query phrase Qp for each.
If first kind of situation is applicable to Q2, search system 120 scanning Q1 charge to the relevant phrases bit vector of each document in the tabulation so, so that judge the position that wherein whether is provided with Q2.If the document d that Q1 charges in the tabulation does not establish this position, so just mean that Q2 does not appear in that document.Therefore, can immediately this document be got rid of outside considering.Then, can be to the score of residue document.This tabulation of charging to that means that also search system 120 need not to handle Q2 checks which document it also is present in, thereby has saved computing time.
If second kind of situation is applicable to Q2, these two phrases are irrelevant each other so.For example, inquiry " cheap bolt action rifle (cheap manual rifle bolt rifle) " has two phrases " cheap " and " bolt action rifle ".None is relevant for these phrases, and in addition, the relevant phrases of each phrase in these phrases is not overlapping; Promptly the relevant phrases of " cheap " has " low cost ", " inexpensive ", " discount ", " bargain basement " and " lousy ", and the relevant phrases of " bolt action rifle " has " gun ", " 22caliber ", " magazine fed " and " Armalite AR30M ", so these tabulations are non-intersect.In the case, search system 120 makes the tabulation canonical (regular) of charging to of Q1 and Q2 intersect so that obtain document and be used for score.
If the third situation is suitable for, though two phrase Q1 are uncorrelated with Q2 so, they have at least one common relevant phrases.For example, phrase " bolt action rifle " and " 22 " all can have " gun " as relevant phrases.In the case, search system 120 these two phrase Q1 of retrieval and Q's 2 charges to tabulation and makes these tabulations intersect the list of documents that contains these two phrases with generation.
Then, search system 120 can be apace to each the document score in the gained document.At first, search system 120 is determined the mark adjusted value of each document.The mark adjusted value be by in the relevant phrases bit vector of a document corresponding to the formed mask in position of the position of query phrase Q1 and Q 2.For example, suppose Q 1 and Q2 corresponding to the 3rd and the 6th dibit position in the relevant phrases bit vector of document d, and the place value of the 3rd position is that the place value of (1,1) and the 6th position is (1,0), the mark adjusted value is exactly bitmask " 00 00 11 00 00 10 " so.Then, use the mark adjusted value to shield the relevant phrases bit vector of document, then revised phrase bit vector is written into graduation function (as described below) for use in the body mark that calculates described document.
2. graduation
A) based on contained phrase document is classified
As mentioned above, for arbitrary given phrase gj, each document d that charges in the tabulation of gj has one to be used for being identified in the relevant phrases bit vector together that document d exists which relevant phrases gk and which secondary relevant phrases g i.The relevant phrases and the secondary relevant phrases that exist in the one given document are many more, and many more positions just will be set in the document relevant phrases bit vector of given phrase.The position that is provided with is many more, and the numerical value of relevant phrases bit vector is just big more.
Therefore, in one embodiment, search system 120 comes the document in the Search Results is sorted according to the value of the relevant phrases bit vector of document.Contain the relevant phrases bit vector that will have mxm. with the document of the maximally related phrase of query phrase Q, and these documents will be the documents of the highest ranking in the Search Results.
The method is why more satisfactory to be that these documents are the most relevant with query phrase on theme because semantically.Notice that the method can provide the document of height correlation, although these documents do not contain high-frequency input inquiry item q, this is because relevant phrases information not only is used to discern pertinent literature, and then to these document graduation.Document with low-frequency input inquiry item still can have a large amount of relevant phrases of query term, so it comparablely has high-frequency input inquiry item with phrase but not have the document of relevant phrases more relevant.
In a second embodiment, search system 120 is come each document score according to the relevant phrases of the query phrase Q that each document contained in the results set.This finishes in the following way.
Will there be the phrase Qr relevant with described query phrase of a certain quantity N in given each query phrase Q, and it can be discerned in the phrase identifying.As mentioned above, come sequencing according to relevant inquiring phrase Qr from the information gain of query phrase Q to relevant inquiring phrase Qr.Then, these relevant phrases appointments are counted, be earlier the first relevant phrases Qr1 (promptly, have relevant phrases Qr from the highest information gain of Q) assign N point, be that next relevant phrases Qr2 assigns N-1 point then, for Q3 assigns N-2 point, the rest may be inferred then, therefore last relevant phrases QrN is assigned as 1 point.
Then, determine to exist which relevant phrases Qr of query phrase Q, and give and be assigned to counting of each these relevant phrases Qr for described document, thereby to each document score in the Search Results.Then with described document according to from high to low mark ordering.
As another improvement, search system 120 can be from results set selected document.In some cases, document may be about many different themes; Especially all the more so for offering than long article.In many cases, than the document relevant with many different themes, the represented closely-related document of single theme during the user prefers those and inquires about.
For a kind of document in selected back, the cluster information in the bit vector of trooping of search system 120 use query phrases, and remove any document of trooping that wherein has more than critical mass.For example, search system 120 can be removed any document of trooping more than two that contains.This threshold value of trooping can pre-determine, or to be set by the user be a search parameter.
B) based on the anchor phrase document is classified
Except the body hits based on query phrase Q come the graduation of the document in the Search Results, in one embodiment, search system 120 also comes document is classified based on the query phrase Q and the relevant inquiring phrase Qr that occur with the anchor to other documents.In one embodiment, search system 120 is calculated the mark of each document, and described mark is the function (for example, linear combination) of two marks (that is, body hit mark and anchor hits mark).
For example, the calculating of the document mark of a given document can be as follows:
Mark=.30* (body hits mark)+.70* (anchor hits mark).
.30 can adjust as required with the weights of .70.With the given query phrase Qp of aforesaid mode, then the body of a document hits the numerical value of relevant phrases bit vector that mark is exactly the mxm. of described document.Perhaps, search system 120 can directly obtain described value in the following way: search each the query phrase Q in the index 150, visit document, the bit vector of access relevant phrases then from the tabulation of charging to of query phrase Q.
The anchor of document d hits the function that mark is the relevant phrases bit vector of query phrase Q, and wherein Q is the anchor item in the document of a citing document d.When directory system 110 was document produce index in the document databse, it was that list of documents preserved in each phrase, and wherein said phrase is the anchor text in the outer link, was the internal chaining (with the anchor text that be associated) of each document preservation from other documents simultaneously.The internal chaining of a document is quoting from other documents (citing document) to given document (for example a, hyperlink).
For the anchor of determining given document d hits mark, search system 120 usefulness anchor phrase Q go up iteration in the citing document R set of listing with index (i=1-citing document number) then, then to following product summation:
Ri.Q. relevant phrases bit vector * D.Q. relevant phrases bit vector.
The product value here is the mark of the expression anchor phrase Q degree relevant with document D theme.Here this mark is called " inbound minute number vector ".This product effectively by reference the relevant bits vector of the anchor phrase among the document R come relevant bits vector weighting to current document D.If citing document R itself relevant with query phrase Q the relevant phrases bit vector of high value (and therefore have), this can increase the validity of current document D mark so.Then, assembly hits mark and anchor hits mark so that produce the document mark as mentioned above.
Then, be each citing document R, obtain the relevant phrases bit vector of each anchor phrase Q.This is the tolerance to anchor phrase Q and document R theme correlation degree.Here this value is called " departures divide number vector ".
From index 150, extract all (citing document, document is cited) right anchor phrase Q then.Come these ordering by these right (departures divide number vector, inbound minute number vector) values that are associated then.According to the difference of implementing, the arbitrary component in these components all can be used as main sort key, and another component can be the minor sort key word.Then, the result after the ordering is presented to the user.According to the departures fractional component to the highest grade that the document ordering can make those have the document that many phrases associated with the query hit as anchor, thus be " expert " document with these document representations.Ordering can make the grade of those documents that often are cited because of the anchor item the highest according to inbound document mark.
3. based on the search personalization of phrase
Another aspect of search system 120 is according to the graduation of the next self-defined Search Results of model of user's special interests or makes its personalization 606.In this way, those more may the document relevant with user's interest can come the higher level in the Search Results.Search Results personalized as follows.
As preparation, more just inquiry and document (these two available phrases are represented) define user interest (for example, being used for model).For an inputted search inquiry, an inquiry is to be represented by the relevant phrases of query phrase Q, Qr and the expansion phrase Qe of query phrase Qp.Therefore, the implication of inquiring about represented in this group term and phrase.Then, use the phrase that is associated with page or leaf to represent the implication of document.As mentioned above, given inquiry and document are determined the relevant phrases of described document from the body mark (relevant bits vector) of the genitive phrase of described literature index indication.At last, can subscriber's meter be shown as the union of a group polling and one group of document according to the phrase of representing each element in these elements.The document that can from user's Search Results formerly, select, perhaps usually by (for example browsing corpus, document on the access internet), uses the user side instrument of supervisory user action and destination, determine the specific document of representative of consumer included in the described set.
Construction and use user model are as follows to carry out personalized graduate process.
At first, be a given user, last K the inquiry that preservation was visited and the tabulation of P document, wherein K and P are preferable respectively is about 250.These tabulations can be kept in the user account data storehouse, and wherein the user comes identification by registration or by browser cookies.For a given user, these tabulations will be empty when the user provides inquiry for the first time.
Then, receive inquiry q from the user.Retrieve relevant phrases Qr and the expansion phrase of q in aforesaid mode.This forms interrogation model.
(for example, if do not store any Query Information of user) just returns document relevant with user inquiring in the Search Results after search system 120 runnings in first pass, and not other self-defined graduation.
User side browser tool monitors user is by (for example) which document in the Search Results of having clicked document links and accesses in the Search Results.Be used for to become the part of user model as these accessed documents on the basis of selecting which phrase.This type of accessed document for each, the model of literature of the described document of search system 120 retrievals, it is a row phrase relevant with described document.The phrase that each is relevant with described accessed document adds in the user model.
Then, given and the relevant phrase of an accessed document can be determined and trooping that these phrases are associated from the bit vector of trooping of each phrase.Troop for each, determine each phrase as the described group member who troops by in containing the relevant phrases tabulation that cluster number or the aforesaid bit vector of trooping represent, searching phrase.Then, this cluster number is added in the user model.In addition,, preserve a counter, and when each phrase during that is trooped adds in the user model, counter is increased progressively for each this type of cluster.As described below, these technology can be used as power.Therefore, express on the document of interest existing the trooping included phrase by access from the user and set up user model.
Same universal method can focus on more accurately captures the user and shows than only visiting the more high-grade phrase information of document (to this, the user may be just be to judge that document is relevant at needs).For example, phrase is collected to be limited to those users in the user model and to print, preserve, be stored as and like or link, transfer by telegram giving another user or in browser window, opening the elongated segment time document of (for example, 10 minutes).These and other action all shows the more high-grade interest to document.
When receiving another inquiry from the user, retrieval relevant inquiring phrase Qr.Phrase listed in these relevant inquiring phrase Qr and the user model is intersected, have which phrase simultaneously in described inquiry and the user model so that determine.The masked bits vector of the relevant phrases Qr of the described inquiry of initialization.As mentioned above, this bit vector is a dibit vector.For each the relevant phrases Qr that is present in the described inquiry in the user model simultaneously, two positions of this relevant phrases are set in the masked bits vector.Therefore, the representative of masked bits vector is present in the relevant phrases in inquiry and the user model simultaneously.
Then, use the masked bits vector to come to be undertaken shielding described relevant phrases bit vector with operation (ANDing) by the relevant phrases bit vector and the described masked bits vector that make each document in the current search results set.This reaches the effect of hitting mark by masked bits vector adjustment body mark and anchor.Then, calculate the body mark and the anchor mark of document and be presented to the user as previously mentioned.The method mainly needs document to have the query phrase in the user model of being included in so that be discharged to higher level.
As the alternate embodiment that can not force aforementioned strict constraint, the masked bits vector can be lined up array, so that each all can be used to the counting weighting of trooping to the relevant phrases in the user model.Therefore, each counting of trooping all is multiplied by 0 or 1, thereby to make counting effectively be 0 or keep former counting.Then, use these countings just as the right to use and itself take advantage of the relevant phrases of each document of scoring.The benefit of the method is to allow still suitably to score which does not have the document of query phrase as relevant phrases.
At last, user model can be limited to current dialogue, wherein dialogue is the time interval of duration of response in the search, after this dialogue, and the dump user model.Perhaps, sustainable a period of time of a given user user model, make its weights decline or expired then.
IV. the result shows
The Search Results that display system 130 receives through scoring and sorting from search system 120, and carry out its hetero-organization, note and the operation of trooping, then the result is presented to the user.These operations help the content that the user understands Search Results, remove reproducible results, and the more representational sampling to Search Results is provided.Fig. 7 illustrates the following main function operation of display system 120:
700: according to the theme document of trooping;
702: produce document description;
704: remove and repeat document.
Each operation in these operations is all adopted with inputted search result 701 and the revised Search Results 703 of output.As shown in Figure 7, the order of these operations is independently, and can change according to the needs of a given embodiment, therefore, and mode that can streamline rather than parallelly as shown in the figure carry these inputs.
1. the dynamic cataloging that shows produces
For a given inquiry, can return individual even several thousand documents that satisfy described inquiry of possibility of hundreds of usually.In many cases, though some document content difference each other, it is enough relevant to form the significant pertinent literature of a group, is exactly one basically and troops.Yet most of users can not see the document beyond preceding 30 or 40 in the Search Results.Therefore, if preceding (for example) 100 documents are trooped from three, but other 4 of ensuing 100 documents representative troop, so without under further adjusting, the user can not see these documents of back usually, but in fact these documents may be very relevant with user inquiring, because they have represented various different themes associated with the query.Therefore, need here, thereby represent wideer selected works from the different documents of Search Results to the user for the user provides the sample of trooping from each document.Display system 130 following carrying out.
As other aspects of homologous ray 100, display system 130 is utilized the relevant phrases bit vector of each document d in the Search Results.In more detail, for each query phrase Q, and, there is which relevant phrases Qr in the relevant phrases bit vector indication document for each document d in the tabulation of charging to of Q.On the literature collection in Search Results,, determine that corresponding to the place value of the position, position of Qr how many documents of expression contain the counting of relevant phrases Qr then by total for each relevant phrases Qr.When to Search Results summation and ordering, with the indication relevant phrases Qr of frequent appearance, each relevant phrases Qr wherein will be that a document is trooped.The relevant phrases of frequent appearance is first to troop, gets its relevant phrases Qr as its title, and trooping for the highest three to five, the rest may be inferred.Therefore, discerned each the highest trooping, got phrase Qr as the title or the title of trooping.
Now, can present to the user by in the future individual in every way each document of trooping.In one uses, can show fixed qty from each document of trooping, for example in each document score at preceding 10 document.In Another Application, can be shown as ratio quantity from each document of trooping.Therefore, if 100 documents are arranged in the Search Results, wherein 50 from trooping 1,30 from trooping 2,10 from trooping 3,7 from trooping 4, and 3 from trooping 5, and wish only to show 20 documents, the selection of document is as follows so: 10 documents are from trooping 1, from trooping 3, and 1 document is from trooping 4 from 2,2 documents of trooping for 7 documents.Then, be referred to as under the title after the grouping, each document is showed the user in the suitable name of trooping.
For example, suppose that search inquiry is " blue merle agility training (the quick training of blue Gadamer) ", receives 100 documents to this search system 120.Search system 120 will be discerned " blue merle " and " agility training " as query phrase.The relevant phrases of these query phrases is:
“blue?merle”：“Australian Sphepherd”、“red merle”、“tricolor”、“aussie”；
“agility training”：“weave?poles”、“teeter”、“tunnel”、“obstacle”、“border?collie”。
2. based on the document description of theme
Second function of display system 130 is to create 702 document descriptions, and described document description can insert in the Search Results demonstration of each document.These explanations are based on existing relevant phrases in each document, so what content helps the user to understand described document in mode associated with the query in terms of content be about.Document description can be general, also can be to user individual.
A) general motif document explanation
As mentioned above, a given inquiry, search system 120 is determined the relevant inquiring phrase Qr and the expansion phrase of query phrase earlier, is inquiry identification pertinent literature then.Each document in display system 130 access search results is also carried out following operation.
At first, display system 130 is come the graduation of document sentence by the instance number of query phrase Q, relevant inquiring phrase Qr and expansion phrase Qp, and then preserves the counting of these three aspects for each sentence of document.
Then, count to the sentence ordering by these, wherein first sort key is the counting of query phrase Q, and second sort key is the counting of relevant inquiring phrase Qr, and last sort key is the counting of expansion phrase Qp.
At last, with the individual sentence of preceding N (for example 5) after the ordering as document description.This can be organized sentence format, and it is included in during document in the revised Search Results 703 shows.Document to the some in the Search Results repeats this process, and can be under each user's request one page carry out on request as a result the time.
B) Ge Xinghua document description based on theme
In the embodiment of the personalization that Search Results is provided, can make document description personalized equally so that reflect represented user interest in the user model.Display system 130 following carrying out.
At first, as mentioned above, display system intersects to determine and user-dependent relevant phrases by making inquiry relevant phrases Qr and user model (it has listed the phrase that appears at by in the document of user capture).
Then, display system 130 is come the stable ordering to this group user relevant phrases Ur according to the value of bit vector itself, the tabulation after the ordering is prepended in the tabulation of inquiry relevant phrases Qr, and removes any repetition phrase.Stable sort has kept the existing order of the phrase of same grade.This generation and inquiry or the set of user-dependent relevant phrases are called set Qu.
Now, to be similar to the mode of above-mentioned general document description method, display system 130 uses this orderly list of phrases conduct to the graduate basis of sentence in each document in the Search Results.Therefore, for a given document, display system 130 is come the graduation of the sentence in the document by each user's relevant phrases and the instance number of inquiry relevant phrases Qu, and comes the ordering of the sentence after the graduation according to query counts, last expansion phrase number ordering based on each this type of phrase.And former, the order of sort key is query phrase Q, relevant inquiring phrase Qr and expansion phrase Qp, but the order of the sort key here is user's relevant phrases Qr of grade from high to low.
Again, the document in the Search Results is repeated this process (on request or in advance).So for each this type of document, the gained document description comprises the sentence from N highest ranking of described document.Herein, these sentences will be the sentences with the highest user's relevant phrases Ur quantity, therefore represent the critical sentence of representing in the document with maximally related notion of user and theme (at least according to the information of being captured in the user model).
3. repeating document detects and removes
In the big corpus such as the internet, it is very common wherein having a plurality of examples of same document or a plurality of parts of a document at many diverse locations.For example, the one piece of given news article that is produced by an Information Bureau (for example, Associated Press (Associated Press)) may be replicated on a dozen or a dozen above website or each newspaper.Respond search inquiry and comprise that all these repeat documents and only can make the unnecessary information of burden for users, rather than response inquiry usefully.Therefore, display system 130 provides another to be used for discerning the ability 704 that those may repeat or only comprise at Search Results near the document that repeats a document in these documents each other.Therefore, the user receives more diversified and more powerful results set, and those documents that repeat each other of needn't losing time.It is functional as follows that display system 130 is provided.
Each document that display system 130 is handled in the search result set 701.For each document d, the tabulation of the at first definite relevant phrases R that is associated with described document of display system 130.For each phrase in these relevant phrases, display system 130 comes the sentence of N (for example, 5 to 10) highest ranking is selected in the graduation of the sentence in the document then according to the frequency of occurrences of each phrase in these phrases.Then this group sentence is combined storage with described document.A method of doing like this is to connect these selected sentences, utilizes hash table to store the document identification symbol then.
Then, display system 130 compares the selected sentence of each document d and the selected sentence of other documents in the Search Results 701, if these selected sentence couplings (in permissible error) are so just thought that described document repeats, and one of them document are removed from Search Results.For example, display system 130 can be done hash with the sentence after connecting, if had an article or item in a contract of described hashed value in the hash table, this just shows current document and the document repetition of hash not long ago.Then, display system 130 can be upgraded this table with the document ID of a document in the described document.Preferably, display system 130 keeps the document of that higher page or leaf grade with document validity or the irrelevant tolerance of other inquiries.In addition, display system 130 can be revised index 150 to remove the repetition document, makes it can not appear in the Search Results of any inquiry in the future.
