Abstract
The present disclosure describes systems and methods for User Equipment (UE) limited service mode for wireless communications. For a User Equipment (UE) that is wirelessly communicating with a base station, a service mode manager determines (705) that a thermal, power, or battery condition local to the UE violates a threshold, and causes the UE to transmit (710) a message indicating a request for the UE to enter a UE limited service mode. The base station allocates (715) a set of resources of an air interface for wireless communication when the UE enters a UE limited service mode. The base station then transmits (720) a message to the UE instructing the UE to enter a UE limited service mode and wirelessly communicate with the base station using the allocated set of resources of the air interface.
Description
Background
While wireless communication with a base station is being performed, a User Equipment (UE) may experience conditions that are adverse to the wireless communication or the UE. As an example, a smartphone performing high bandwidth data transfer to a base station according to the fifth generation new radio (5GNR) protocol may experience a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) that alters the thermal conditions local to the smartphone. If the thermal condition violates a temperature rating of a component of the smartphone, the component of the smartphone may degrade and shorten the smartphone's useful life. As another example, while the smartphone is performing high bandwidth data transfers, the current draw may cause the power or battery conditions local to the smartphone to violate a corresponding thermal, power, or battery condition threshold, causing the smartphone to shut down or terminate wireless communications with the base station.
In some cases, the desired state may include the UE maintaining consistent attachment with the base station. As a first example, a UE may scan a search space as defined by resource elements corresponding to the frequency and time domains of the air interface for a message from a base station that includes Downlink Control Information (DCI) required for the UE to receive a critical command. During an interrupted radio link, the UE may have intermittent knowledge of the search space, resulting in the UE scanning an excessive number of resource elements of the air interface when the wireless radio link is resumed, resulting in inefficient scanning operations. As another example, the UE may transmit high priority data to the core network or another UE, where the interrupted wireless communication would compromise the user equipment's effectiveness in transmitting the high priority data.
The systems and methods implemented today and noted above may compromise the effectiveness and efficiency of UE operation. Opportunities may be taken to improve current systems and methods to manage a wireless radio link between a UE and a base station in response to thermal, battery, or power conditions local to the UE.
Disclosure of Invention
Systems and methods for limited service mode for a UE are described herein. For a User Equipment (UE) wirelessly linked with a base station, the UE may transmit a first message indicating a request to enter a limited service mode of the UE. The base station allocates a second set of resources for the air interface of the radio link when the UE enters the UE limited service mode. The base station then transmits a second message to the UE instructing the UE to enter the UE limited service mode and wirelessly communicate with the base station using the allocated second set of resources of the air interface.
Some aspects describe a method performed by a User Equipment (UE) wirelessly attached to a base station using a first set of resources of an air interface. The method comprises the following steps: the UE determines that a condition local to the UE violates a threshold and the UE transmits a first message to the base station. The first message indicates to the base station a request for the UE to enter the UE limited service mode. The UE then receives a second message from the base station, the second message including a limited service radio network temporary identifier that identifies the allocated second set of resources of the air interface and directs the UE to (i) enter the UE limited service mode and (ii) wirelessly communicate with the base station using the allocated second set of resources of the air interface.
Other aspects describe a method performed by a base station wirelessly attached to a User Equipment (UE) using a first set of resources of an air interface. The method comprises the following steps: the base station receives a first message from the UE indicating to the base station a request for the UE to enter a UE limited service mode in response to the UE determining that a condition local to the UE violates a threshold. The base station then allocates a second set of resources of the air interface to be used between the UE and the base station when the UE enters the UE limited service mode. The method continues with the base station transmitting a second message to the UE instructing the UE to enter the UE limited service mode and wirelessly communicate with the base station using the allocated second set of resources of the air interface.

Detailed Description
The following discussion describes an operating environment that implements a limited service mode for a UE. In the context of the present disclosure, reference is made to an operating environment by way of example only.
Operating environment
Fig. 1 illustrates an example environment 100 that includes a plurality of user equipment 110(UE 110), shown as UE 111, UE 112, and UE 113. Each UE110 may communicate with a base station 120 (shown as base stations 121, 122, 123, and 124) over one or more wireless communication links 130 (wireless links 130), shown as wireless links 131 and 132. For simplicity, the UE110 is implemented as a smartphone, but may be implemented as any suitable computing or electronic device, such as a mobile communication device, modem, cellular telephone, gaming device, navigation device, media device, laptop computer, desktop computer, tablet computer, smart appliance, vehicle-based communication system, or internet of things (IoT) device. The base stations 120 (e.g., evolved universal terrestrial radio access network node B, E-UTRAN node B, evolved node B, e node B, eNB, next generation node B, g node B, gNB, ng-eNB, etc.) may be implemented in a macro cell, a micro cell, a small cell, a pico cell, etc., or any combination thereof.
The base stations 120 are collectively a radio access network 140 (e.g., RAN, evolved universal terrestrial radio access network, E-UTRAN, 5G NR RAN, or NR RAN). The RAN 140 is shown as NR RAN 141 and E-UTRAN 142. The base stations 121 and 123 in the NR RAN 141 are connected to a fifth generation core 150(5GC 150) network. Base stations 122 and 124 in E-UTRAN 142 are connected to evolved packet core network 160(EPC 160). Alternatively or additionally, base station 122 may be connected to both the 5GC150 and EPC 160 networks.
In addition to the connection to the core network, the base stations 120 may also communicate with each other. For example, base stations 121 and 123 communicate using the Xn application protocol (XnAP) over an Xn interface at 103, base stations 122 and 123 communicate over an Xn interface at 105, and base stations 122 and 124 communicate over X2 at 107.
The 5GC150 includes an access and mobility management function 152(AMF 152) that provides control plane functions such as registration and authentication of multiple UEs 110, authorization in a 5G NR network, and mobility management. The EPC 160 includes a mobility management entity 162(MME 162) that provides control plane functions such as registration and authentication of multiple UEs 110, authorization or mobility management in an E-UTRA network. The AMF 152 and MME 162 communicate with the base station 120 in the RAN 140 and also communicate with a plurality of UEs 110 using the base station 120.
In some cases, UE110 may wirelessly communicate with base station 120 using wireless link 130 and determine that a condition local to UE110 violates a threshold (e.g., thermal condition, power condition, battery condition). As an example, the functionality of supporting high bandwidth data transmission over a wireless link 130 utilizing a first set of resources (e.g., resources defined by the frequency and time domains of the air interface) may consume high current and dissipate a significant amount of power local to the UE110 in the form of heat. Due to the thermal characteristics of the UE110, semiconductor devices (e.g., processors, transceivers, controllers, memory devices) of the UE110 may exceed allowable junction temperature thresholds and shorten the lifetime of the semiconductor devices. Furthermore, in addition to high current consumption resulting in node temperature threshold violations, high current consumption may also curtail power stored in the battery of UE110, thereby causing UE110 to terminate wireless communications with base station 120.
In this case, it may be beneficial for UE110 to enter a UE limited service mode that reduces current draw. To enter the UE limited-service mode, UE110 may transmit a first message to another device (e.g., base station 120 or, alternatively, a controller in the core network) to initiate a transition of UE110 into the UE limited-service mode. In response to receiving the first message from UE110, an apparatus (e.g., base station 120 or a controller of a core network) may perform operations comprising: sending a second message to UE110 instructing UE110 to enter a UE limited service mode and communicate with base station 120 using a reduced set of resources (e.g., resources of the air interface) has the effect of reducing the current consumption of UE 110.
The second message may include information that UE110 uses to configure the wireless communication hardware of UE110 to wirelessly communicate with base station 120 in the UE limited service mode using the reduced set of resources. The information may include, by way of example, a limited service radio network temporary identifier (LS-RNTI), a set of parameters, and an identification of a waveform format or beam.
The first and second messages may be transmitted using protocols defined for layers of a radio network stack used by UE110, base station 120, and a controller of the core network. In some cases, the protocol may correspond to a protocol associated with a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer, or a non-access stratum (NAS) layer.
Example System
Fig. 2 shows an example device diagram 200 of a plurality of UEs 110 and base stations 120. The plurality of UEs 110 and base stations 120 may include additional functions and interfaces that have been omitted from fig. 2 for clarity. UE110 includes an antenna 202, a radio frequency front end 204(RF front end 204), an LTE transceiver 206, and a 5G NR transceiver 208 for communicating with base stations 120 in 5G RAN 141 and/or E-UTRAN 142. RF front end 204 of UE110 may couple or connect LTE transceiver 206 and 5G NR transceiver 208 to antenna 202 to facilitate various types of wireless communication. The antenna 202 of the UE110 may include an array of multiple antennas configured to be similar to each other or different from each other. The antenna 202 and the RF front end 204 may be tuned and/or tunable to one or more frequency bands defined by the 3GPP LTE and 5G NR communication standards and implemented by the LTE transceiver 206 and/or the 5G NR transceiver 208. Additionally, the antennas 202, RF front ends 204, LTE transceivers 206, and/or 5G NR transceivers 208 may be configured to support beamforming for transmission and reception of communications with the base station 120. By way of example and not limitation, antenna 202 and RF front end 204 may be implemented for operation in sub-gigahertz frequency bands, frequency bands below 6GHz, and/or frequency bands above 6GHz as defined by the 3GPP LTE and 5G NR communication standards.
UE110 also includes condition detector circuitry 210 for detecting conditions local to the UE and to help determine thermal, power, and/or battery conditions local to the UE. The condition detector circuitry 210 may include circuitry such as a sensor that detects one or more temperatures of the UE110, and/or circuitry that detects current draw by the UE110, or circuitry that detects charge or potential of a battery of the UE 110.
The UE110 also includes one or more processors 212 and computer-readable storage media 214(CRM 214). The processor 212 may be a single core processor or a multi-core processor composed of a variety of materials, such as silicon, polysilicon, high-K dielectric, copper, etc. The computer-readable storage media described herein do not include propagated signals. The CRM 212 may include any suitable memory or storage device, such as Random Access Memory (RAM), Static RAM (SRAM), Dynamic RAM (DRAM), non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), read-only memory (ROM), or flash memory.
The CRM 214 also includes a service mode manager 216 having executable code. Alternatively or additionally, service mode manager 216 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of UE 110. In at least some aspects, execution of the code of the service mode manager 216 configures the RF front end 204, the LTE transceiver 206, the 5GNR transceiver 208, and/or the condition detector circuit 210 to implement the techniques for UE limited service mode described herein.
In some cases, a system on a chip (SoC) may physically combine one or more elements of UE 110. As an example, the SoC may include a condition detector circuit 210, a CRM 214, an LTE transceiver 206, and a 5G NR transceiver 208.
The apparatus diagram of the base station 120 shown in fig. 2 comprises a single network node (e.g., a enode B). The functionality of the base station 120 may be distributed over multiple network nodes or devices, and may be distributed in any manner suitable for performing the functionality described herein. Base station 120 includes an antenna 252, a radio frequency front end 254(RF front end 254), one or more LTE transceivers 256, and/or one or more 5G NR transceivers 258 for communicating with UE 110. The RF front end 254 of the base station 120 may couple or connect an LTE transceiver 256 and a 5G NR transceiver 258 to the antenna 252 to facilitate various types of wireless communication. The antenna 252 of the base station 120 may include an array of multiple antennas configured to be similar to each other or different from each other. The antenna 252 and the RF front end 254 may be tuned and/or tunable to one or more frequency bands defined by the 3GPP LTE and 5G NR communication standards and implemented by the LTE transceiver 256 and/or the 5G NR transceiver 258. Further, the antennas 252, the RF front end 254, the LTE transceiver 256, and/or the 5G NR transceiver 258 may be configured to support beamforming, such as massive MIMO, for transmission and reception of communications with the UE 110.
The CRM 262 also includes a base station manager 266 having executable code. Alternatively or additionally, the base station manager 266 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated or separate from other components of the base station 120. In at least some aspects, code executing base station manager 266 may allocate resources of the radio access network (e.g., resources corresponding to an air interface compliant with a 3GPP LTE or 5G NR wireless communication protocol standard) and also configure LTE transceiver 256 and 5G NR transceiver 258 for communicating with UE110 in accordance with the UE limited service mode described herein.
Fig. 3 illustrates example details 300 of an air interface in accordance with one or more aspects of a UE limited service mode. The air interface 302 may be divided into resource units 304, each occupying some intersection of frequency spectrum and elapsed time. A portion of air interface 302 is graphically illustrated in a grid or matrix having a plurality of resource blocks 310, including example resource blocks 311, 312, 313, 314. An example of a resource unit 304 thus includes at least one resource block 310. As shown, time is depicted in the horizontal dimension as the abscissa axis, and frequency is depicted in the vertical dimension as the ordinate axis. Air interface 302, as defined by a given communication protocol or standard, may span any suitable specified frequency range and/or may be divided into intervals of any specified duration. The increment of time may correspond to, for example, milliseconds (mSec). The increase in frequency may correspond to megahertz (MHz), for example.
Generally, in an example operation, base station 120 allocates portions of air interface 302 (e.g., resource units 304) for uplink and downlink communications. Each resource block 310 of network access resources may be allocated to support a respective wireless communication link 130 for multiple UEs 110. In the lower left corner of the grid, a resource block 311 may span a specified frequency range 306 and include multiple subcarriers or frequency subbands as defined by a given communication protocol. Resource block 311 may include any suitable number of subcarriers (e.g., 12), each corresponding to a respective portion (e.g., 15kHz) of a specified frequency range 306 (e.g., 180 kHz). Resource blocks 311 may also span a specified time interval 308 or slot (e.g., lasting approximately one-half millisecond or 7 Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols) as defined by a given communication protocol. Time interval 308 comprises sub-intervals that may each correspond to a symbol, such as an OFDM symbol. As shown in fig. 3, each resource block 310 may include a plurality of resource elements 320 (REs) corresponding to or defined by the subcarriers of frequency range 306 and the subintervals (or symbols) of time interval 308. Alternatively, a given resource element 320 may span more than one frequency subcarrier or symbol. Thus, a resource unit 304 may include at least one resource block 310, at least one resource element 320, and so on.
In an example embodiment, UE110 may communicate with base station 120 using a set of resources allocated to respective channels of a wireless network stack. Furthermore, in some cases, the allocation to the respective channels may vary. For example, UE110 may wirelessly communicate with base station 120 using a first set of resources spanning a first frequency range and having a first frequency bandwidth. However, UE110, while in the UE limited service mode, may wirelessly communicate with base station 120 using a second set of resources that span a second frequency range that is lower than the first frequency range and that have a second frequency bandwidth that is smaller than the first frequency bandwidth.
Fig. 4 illustrates an example wireless network stack 400 with which various aspects of the UE limited service mode may be implemented. The wireless network stack 400 includes a user plane 402 and a control plane 404. The upper layers of the user plane 402 and the control plane 404 share a common lower layer in the wireless network stack 400. A wireless device, such as UE110 or base station 120, implements each layer as an entity for communicating with another device using the protocols defined for that layer.
The shared lower layers include a physical layer 406(PHY layer 406), a medium access control layer 408(MAC layer 408), a radio link control layer 410(RLC layer 410), and a packet data convergence protocol layer 412(PDCP layer 412). The physical layer 406 provides hardware specifications for devices that communicate with each other. In this way, the physical layer 406 establishes how the devices connect to each other, thereby helping to manage how communication resources are shared among the devices, and so on.
The MAC layer 408 specifies how data is transmitted between devices. In general, the MAC layer 408 provides a way in which a data packet being transmitted is encoded and decoded into bits as part of the transmission protocol.
The RLC layer 410 provides data transmission services to higher layers in the radio network stack 400. In general, the RLC layer 410 provides management including error correction, packet segmentation and reassembly, and data transmission in various modes such as acknowledged mode, unacknowledged mode, or transparent mode.
The PDCP layer 412 provides data transfer services to higher layers in the radio network stack 400. In general, the PDCP layer 412 provides transport, header compression, ciphering, and integrity protection of user plane 402 and control plane 404 data.
Above the PDCP layer 412, the radio network stack is divided into a user plane 402 and a control plane 404. The user plane 402 layers include an optional service data adaptation protocol layer 414(SDAP414), an Internet protocol layer 416(IP 416), a transport control protocol/user datagram protocol layer 418(TCP/UDP 418), and an application 420 for transferring data. An optional SDAP layer 414 exists in the 5G NR network and maps quality of service (QoS) flows for each data radio bearer and marks the QoS flow identifiers in the uplink and downlink data packets of each packet data session. IP layer 416 specifies how data from application 420 is to be transmitted to the destination node. TCP/UDP layer 418 is used to verify that a data packet intended for transmission to a destination node arrives at the destination node using TCP or UDP of the data transmission of application 420.
The control plane 404 includes a radio resource control 422(RRC 422) layer and a non-access stratum 424(NAS 424) layer. RRC 422 establishes and releases connections and radio bearers, broadcasts system information, performs power control, and so on. NAS 424 provides support for mobility management and packet data bearer context between UE110 and entities or functions in the core network.
In the UE110, each layer in both the user plane 402 and the control plane 404 of the wireless network stack 400 interacts with a corresponding peer layer or entity in the base station 120, a core network entity or function, and/or a remote service to support user application and control operations of the UE110 in the radio access network.
Example method
Fig. 5 illustrates an example method 500 performed by a UE in accordance with one or more aspects of a UE limited service mode. Method 500 may be performed by UE110 in wireless communication with base station 120 using a first set of resources of an air interface (e.g., air interface 302). In some cases, the UE and the base station may communicate wirelessly according to a third generation partnership project long term evolution (3GPP LTE), a fifth generation new radio (5G NR), or a sixth generation (6G) wireless-communication protocol. The base station may perform operations to manage resources (e.g., resource units 304) for a radio link between the UE and the base station.
At operation 502, the UE determines that a condition local to the UE violates a threshold. The code of the service mode manager 216, which may be executed by the processor 212, uses the measurements made by the condition detector circuit 210 to make such a determination. The UE may attach to and, in some cases, wirelessly communicate with the base station.
In some cases, the condition may be a thermal, power, or battery condition resulting from the UE transmitting data to the base station. In other cases, the condition may be a thermal, power, or battery condition that is a result of playing a game on the UE, playing media content stored on the UE, or running an application that does not require wireless communication with the base station.
In operation 504, the UE transmits a first message to the base station indicating a request to enter the UE limited service mode to the base station. The first message causes the base station (e.g., processor 260 executing the code of base station manager 266) to allocate a second set of resources for the radio link between the UE and the base station when the UE enters the UE limited service mode, and may include allocation of a Random Access Channel (RACH) sequence in some cases. The first message may be transmitted according to a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer 408 protocol or a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer 422 protocol.
At operation 506, the UE receives a second message from the base station, the second message including a limited service radio network temporary identifier (LS-RNTI) identifying the allocated second set of resources of the air interface. The second message directs the UE to enter a UE limited service mode and wirelessly communicate with the base station using the allocated second set of resources of the air interface and, in some cases, utilizing a contention-free Random Access Channel (RACH) according to an allocated RACH sequence. The second message may be received according to a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer 408 protocol or a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer 422 protocol.
In general, and as part of the method 500, the first set of resources and the allocated second set of resources can be associated with a channel defined by a wireless communication protocol. Further, the allocated second set of resources may be changed compared to the first set of resources. As a first example, the first set of resources and the allocated second set of resources may be resources of a transmission channel, wherein the allocated second set of resources has a smaller frequency bandwidth than the first set of resources. In this first example, wirelessly communicating with the base station using the allocated second set of resources of the air interface may include the UE transmitting uplink data to the base station and receiving downlink data from the base station. In general, each of the described allocations is by way of example only and may be performed alone or in combination with other allocations of other channels.
As a second example, the first set of resources and the allocated second set of resources may be resources of a control channel, wherein the allocated second set of resources has a smaller frequency bandwidth and a more restricted search space than the first set of resources. In this second example, wirelessly communicating with the base station using the allocated second set of resources of the air interface may include: the UE monitors the allocated second set of resources of the air interface for unicast messages from the base station to the UE. While monitoring the thus allocated second set of resources (having a smaller frequency bandwidth and a more restricted search space than the first set of resources), the UE may utilize a lower clock rate and consume less power.
The second message may include wireless communication parameters, such as a set of parameters or a waveform format used by the UE and the base station when the UE is in the UE limited service mode. In the case where the second message includes a parameter set, the parameter set may correspond to a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) size that becomes smaller when the UE enters the UE limited service mode, which in turn reduces the processing power consumed by the UE. In the case where the second message includes a waveform format, the waveform format may have a peak-to-average ratio that reduces power consumption of the UE.
The second message may also include wireless communication parameters corresponding to an identification of a beam of the wireless communication when the UE is in the UE limited service mode. In some cases, such identification may identify beams that provide wider coverage than other beams used by the UE and the base station before the UE enters the UE limited service mode. When equipped with the identification of beams that provide wider coverage, the UE may search for or locate beams faster, which in turn reduces the power consumption of the UE.
The second message may also include radio communication parameters corresponding to a Random Access Channel (RACH) sequence. The RACH sequence may be a contention-free RACH sequence that reduces power consumed by the UE. While the UE is in the UE limited service mode, the UE may transmit (and receive) data according to different types of wireless communication parameters included in the second message. In general, each described wireless communication parameter is by way of example only and may be included in the second message alone or in combination with each other described wireless communication parameter.
Fig. 6 illustrates an example method 600 performed by a base station in accordance with one or more aspects of a UE limited service mode. Method 600 may be performed by a base station 120 in wireless communication with a UE110 using a first set of resources of an air interface (e.g., air interface 302). In some cases, the base station and the UE communicate wirelessly according to a third generation partnership project long term evolution (3GPP LTE), a fifth generation new radio (5G NR), or a sixth generation (6G) wireless communication protocol. The base station may perform operations to manage resources (e.g., resource units 304) of the air interface 302 for the radio link between the UE and the base station.
In operation 602, the base station receives a first message from the UE indicating a request to the base station to enter a limited service mode of the UE. At operation 604, the base station (e.g., processor 260 executing the codes of base station manager 266) allocates a second set of resources for the radio link between the UE and the base station when the UE enters the UE limited service mode. The first message may be transmitted according to a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer 408 protocol or a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer 422 protocol. The allocated second set of resources reduces power consumption of the UE by, for example, having a smaller frequency bandwidth than the first set of resources, a smaller fast fourier transform size than the first set of resources, or a transmission time interval greater than the first set of resources.
Further, and as part of the method 600, the second message may include different types of wireless communication parameters that may be used by the UE and the base station for wireless communication while the UE is in the UE limited service mode. A first example of a wireless communication parameter included in the second message is a limited service radio network temporary identifier (LS-RNTI) identifying the allocated second set of resources of the air interface. A second example of the wireless communication parameters included in the second message is an identification of a beam used for wireless communication while the UE is in the UE limited service mode. A third example of the wireless communication parameters included in the second message are a parameter set and a waveform format used by the UE and the base station while the UE is in the UE limited service mode.
In general, example methods 500 and 600 are part of mitigating power, thermal, or battery conditions local to UE110 in the context of base station 120 performing resource allocation operations. However, apparatuses other than the base station 120 may perform such resource allocation operation instead of the base station 120. As an example, a controller associated with the core network (e.g., 5GC150 of fig. 1) may allocate a second set of resources to be used by the UE and the base station after the UE enters the UE limited service mode in response to receiving a request from the UE (e.g., via a message received from the UE according to a non-access stratum (NAS) layer 424 protocol). In addition to allocating the second set of resources to mitigate power, thermal, or battery conditions local to the UE, the core network may prioritize and adjust messages transmitted to the UE after the UE enters the UE limited service mode. This is effective to reduce wireless communication with the UE and further mitigate power, thermal, or battery conditions.
Example Signaling and control transactions
Fig. 7 illustrates details 700 of example signaling and control transactions associated with various aspects of a UE limited service mode. Although various combinations and permutations of UE limited service modes are possible, fig. 7 is illustrated in the context of a UE (e.g., UE 110) communicating with a base station (e.g., base station 120) that allocates resources to be used for an air interface (e.g., air interface 302) of a radio link between base station 120 and UE110 after UE110 enters the UE limited service mode. UE110 and base station 120 may perform signaling and control actions using protocols associated with layers included in the wireless network stack, examples of which include protocols that may be associated with MAC layer 408 or RRC layer 422 of wireless network stack 400.
At 710, and after determining at 705 that a thermal, power, or battery condition local to UE110 violates a corresponding thermal, power, or battery condition threshold, UE110 transmits a first message to base station 120 indicating to base station 120 a request for UE110 to enter a UE limited service mode. Although shown as a single message at 710, the first message may be a plurality of messages or a combination of messages. The message may specify a threshold violation (e.g., thermal, power, or battery) and/or an amount of violation (e.g., remaining battery life estimate at 101% or 110% of the thermal threshold, 100% or 120% of the PAPR threshold, which is below the 15% threshold).
At 715, after UE110 enters UE limited service mode, base station 120 allocates resources to be used for air interface 302 of the radio link between base station 120 and UE 110. The allocated resources of air interface 302 may affect wireless communication between UE110 and base station 120 in a number of ways including, for example, UE110 communicating with base station 120 using a smaller frequency bandwidth, using a lower frequency assignment, using a lower clock rate, or using a wider beam (one or more of which may reduce power consumption of UE 110).
At 720, base station 120 transmits a second message to UE 110. The second message, e.g., a UE limited service mode Acknowledgement (ACK) message, directs UE110 to enter the UE limited service mode according to wireless communication parameters included in the second message. Although shown as a single message at 720, the second message may be a plurality of messages or a combination of messages.
Such wireless communication parameters may include a limited service radio network temporary identifier (LS-RNTI), a parameter set and a waveform format, an identification of a beam used for wireless communication, and/or a Random Access Channel (RACH) sequence. After UE110 enters the UE limited service mode, UE110 may use the wireless communication parameters to wirelessly communicate with base station 120, either alone or in one of a number of possible combinations.
Additional signaling and control transactions may occur that enable UE110 to exit the UE limited service mode. For example, at 730, and after UE110 determines at 725 that the thermal, power, or battery condition no longer violates a corresponding threshold, a third message can be sent to base station 120, such as a request to exit UE limited service mode (after which base station 120 can allocate resources without regard to UE limited service mode).
Fig. 8 illustrates details 800 of example signaling and control transactions associated with various aspects of a UE limited service mode. Although various combinations and permutations of UE limited service modes are possible, fig. 8 is shown in the context of a UE (e.g., UE 110) communicating with a core network (e.g., 5GC150 network of fig. 1), where the 5GC150 network allocates resources to be used for an air interface (e.g., air interface 302) of a radio link between base station 120 and UE110 after UE110 enters the UE limited service mode. The signaling and control actions may use protocols associated with layers included in the wireless network stack (examples of which include protocols associated with the NAS layer 424 of the wireless network stack 400 of fig. 4).
At 810, and after determining at 805 that a thermal, power, or battery condition local to the UE110 violates a corresponding thermal, power, or battery condition threshold, the UE110 transmits, by the base station 120, a first message to the 5GC network 150 indicating to the 5GC network 150 a request for the UE110 to enter the limited-service mode. Although shown as a single message at 810, the first message may be a plurality of messages or a combination of messages. The message may specify a threshold parameter of violation (e.g., thermal, power, or battery), and optionally a current value of the parameter.
At 815, the 5GC network 150 allocates resources of the air interface 302 to be used for the radio link between the base station 120 and the UE110 after the UE110 enters the UE limited service mode. The allocated resources of air interface 302 may affect wireless communications between UE110 and base station 120 in a number of aspects including, for example, UE110 communicating with base station 120 using a smaller frequency bandwidth, using a lower frequency assignment, using a lower clock rate, or using a wider beam (one or more of which may reduce power consumption of UE 110).
In some cases, the 5GC network 150 may have the advantage over base stations of allocating resources for communicating Internet Protocol (IP) traffic. Such advantages may be realized by the 5GC network 150 having an integrated view of the multiple base stations of the 5GC network 150, aggregated traffic of the 5GC network 150 network, and so on.
At 820, the 5GC network 150 transmits a second message to the UE110 through the base station 120. The second message, a UE limited service mode Acknowledgement (ACK) message, directs UE110 to enter the UE limited service mode according to wireless communication parameters included in the second message. Such wireless communication parameters may include a limited service radio network temporary identifier (LS-RNTI), a parameter set and a waveform format, an identification of a beam used for wireless communication, or a Random Access Channel (RACH) sequence. Although shown as a single message at 804, the second message may be a plurality of messages or a combination of messages.
At 825, 5GC network 150 transmits a third message, a UE limited service mode change message, to base station 120. The third message may include the same wireless communication parameters as included in the second message, such that base station 120 may align with UE110 in terms of resources and wireless communication parameters for wireless communication between base station 120 and UE110 after UE110 enters UE limited service mode.
Additional signaling and control transactions may occur that enable UE110 to exit the UE limited service mode. For example, at 835, and after the UE110 determines at 830 that the thermal, power, or battery condition no longer violates the threshold, a fourth message may be sent to the 5GC network 150, such as a request to exit the UE limited service mode (after which the 5GC network 150 may allocate resources without regard to supporting the UE limited service mode).
Unless otherwise noted, the described signaling and control transactions are exemplary only and are not constrained by the sequence or order of presentation. Further, in certain aspects, additional signaling and control transactions may augment or replace the described signaling and control transactions.
Variants
Many variations and permutations of the foregoing methods and systems are possible. Consider a first example variation in which a UE is dually connected to a base station using a 3GPP LTE radio link and a 5G NR radio link. Using variations of the foregoing methods and systems, the UE may enter the UE limited service mode using one of the connections (e.g., using a 5G NR radio link) without requesting the UE limited service mode using another connection (e.g., using a 3GPP LTE radio link).
A second example variation includes additional different types of wireless communication parameters that may be used by the UE and the base station for wireless communication while the UE is in the UE limited service mode. Such additional different types of wireless communication parameters may include wireless communication parameters applicable to discrete fourier transform/orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM), Transmission Time Interval (TTI), uplink transmission power settings of the UE, or a time window available to the UE for operation in a UE limited service mode.
A third example variation includes manual triggering of the UE limited service mode by a user of the UE. In this case, the user may select (via an optional user interface) the UE limited service mode and trigger a request to the base station, as opposed to the service mode manager determining that a thermal, power or battery condition is violated.
A fourth example variation includes the base station over allocating resources to the UE. In this case, the UE may select a subset of the over-allocated resources to use when in the UE limited service mode.
A fifth example variation includes a first additional method performed by a UE attached to a base station using a first set of resources of an air interface. A first additional method includes determining, by the UE, that a thermal, power, or battery condition local to the UE violates a threshold. The first additional method further includes transmitting, by the UE to the base station, a first message requesting entry into a UE limited service mode and receiving, by the UE from the base station, a second message specifying the allocated second set of resources of the air interface. A first additional method includes directing the UE to enter a UE limited service mode and wirelessly communicate with the base station using the allocated second set of resources of the air interface. As part of a first additional method, the UE and the base station operate according to a third generation partnership project long term evolution (3GPP LTE), a fifth generation new radio (5G NR), or a sixth generation (6G) wireless communication protocol. Also as part of the first additional method, the first message is transmitted according to a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer protocol or a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer protocol, and the second message is received according to the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer protocol or the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer protocol.
A sixth example variation includes a second additional method performed by a UE attached to a base station using a first set of resources of an air interface. A second additional method includes determining, by the UE, that a thermal, power, or battery condition local to the UE violates a threshold. The second additional method also includes transmitting, by the UE, a first message to the base station requesting entry into the UE limited service mode, and receiving, by the UE, a second message from the base station specifying the allocated second set of resources of the air interface. A second additional method includes directing the UE to enter a UE limited service mode and wirelessly communicate with the base station using the allocated second set of resources of the air interface. As part of a second additional method, wirelessly communicating with the base station using the allocated second set of resources of the air interface includes monitoring the allocated second set of resources for unicast messages from the base station to the UE.
A seventh example variation includes a third additional method performed by a base station wirelessly attached to a UE using a first set of resources of an air interface. The method comprises the following steps: receiving, by the base station, a first message from the UE indicating a request for the UE to enter a UE limited service mode in response to the UE determining that a thermal, power, or battery condition local to the UE violates a threshold. A third additional method comprises: a second set of resources to be used for an air interface of a radio link between the UE and the base station is allocated by the base station when the UE enters the UE limited service mode, and a second message is transmitted by the base station to the UE. The second message directs the UE to enter a UE limited service mode and wirelessly communicate with the base station using the allocated second set of resources of the air interface. As part of a third example method, the base station and the UE wirelessly communicate in accordance with a third generation partnership project long term evolution (3GPP LTE), a fifth generation new radio (5GNR), or a sixth generation (6G) wireless communication protocol. Also as part of the third example method, the first message and the second message are transmitted according to a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer protocol or a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer protocol.
An eighth example variation includes another UE including detection circuitry, a wireless communication transceiver, a processor, and a computer-readable storage medium. The computer storage medium includes a service mode manager application having instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the UE to determine, using detection circuitry, that a thermal, power, or battery condition local to the UE violates a threshold, and transmit, using a wireless communication transceiver and through a base station, a first message to a core network, the first message (i) indicating to the core network a request for another UE to enter a UE limited service mode and (ii) directing the core network to determine a second set of resources to be used for an air interface of a radio link between the UE and the base station of the core network when the UE enters the UE limited service mode. The other UE also receives, using the wireless communication transceiver, a second message specifying the allocated second set of resources of the air interface and directing the UE to enter the UE limited service mode and engage in a wireless communication network with a base station of the core network using the second set of resources of the air interface. The first message and the second message are transmitted according to a non-access stratum (NAS) layer protocol.
