Embodiment
Generally speaking, the disclosure has been described the technology that is used for revealing to the application of carrying out at the browser that operates on the standard on equipment, non-expansion the resource capability of equipment.Based on the web of browser use typically can not be present in application based on browser with the outer component communication of the security protocol of its operation.So, unless browser is made special expansion, application programming interface (API) or other such modifications, the two-way bidding protocol between the application of carrying out in browser and the system resource of equipment is generally unavailable.
According to the technology of describing in the disclosure, use to the web that carries out in the browser of standard, non-expansion so two-way bidding protocol is provided.As used in this, word " non-expansion " also is not intended to and means that browser must lack any expansion or API, but browser not yet clearly is extended to the direct control system resource.Alternatively, web use to use common HTTP connection mode (for example, GET and POST message) to communicate by letter with Resource Server, and this Resource Server and then communicate by letter with system resource and reveal the ability of system resource to the web application.As an example of these technology, the relevant web of the phone that operates in standard browser uses the telephony hardware ability that can be used for monitoring and/or operating via the call resource server mobile device.
Fig. 1 is that diagram is for the concept map of the exemplary architecture 100 of resource capability from computing equipment to the browser of carrying out that reveal computing equipment on.As shown, computing equipment 110,115 each comprise that can carry out web uses 130 browser 120.Web uses 130 and is couple to communicatedly one or more Resource Servers, such as camera server 140 and/or telephony server 145.And then Resource Server is couple to the system resource of computing equipment communicatedly.For example, camera server 140 is couple to camera hardware 160 communicatedly, and telephony server 145 is couple to telephony hardware 165 communicatedly.
As shown, computing equipment 110,115 corresponds respectively to mobile device and laptop computer.Yet computing equipment 110,115 can be the computing equipment that can carry out any type of browser 120.So, the computing machine that example calculations equipment can comprise any type (for example, desk-top computer, workstation, panel computer, notebook, net book, large scale computer, terminal etc.), the portable equipment (for example, smart mobile phone, personal digital assistant etc.) of any type etc.
Generally speaking, the web application is the computer software application of carrying out in the computing environment based on browser.For example, show the web that carries out in the sight of browser 120 and use 130.The language that can support with any amount of different browsers (for example, JavaScript) is used web and is encoded.Can move simultaneously a plurality of web with single browser 120 uses.For example, Email and calendar web use both and can show in the different pages of browser 120 or label or can show on the same page in browser.
In exemplary architecture 100, show and be couple to communicatedly two Resource Servers 140,145 web uses 130.This couples and is shown as dotted line to indicate the communication channel between each in web application 130 and Resource Server 140,145 not have by the direct interface such as API or browser extension.Alternatively, Resource Server 140, the web server of 145 runnings for operating outside browser 120 are to use 130 provisioning resources to the web that carries out in browser 120.Described in the disclosure, this architecture permission web application 130 interior runnings of web browser 120 in standard, non-expansion visit the ability such as the various system resources of camera hardware 160 or telephony hardware 165.
Although web uses 130 in the interior execution of browser 120, yet it can be hosted in the place away from browser 120.For example, web uses 130 and can be hosted on one or more in Resource Server 140,145, and each Resource Server can be used by the one or more web of trustship.For example, server 140 can be used by trustship camera web, and server 145 can be used by trustship phone web.These and other web use to be used to be connected with the HTTP of suitable server by browser 120 and visit.For example, when the user of browser 120 navigate to the html page of quoting of the web application that covers on that is hosted in Resource Server, browser can be downloaded this web application and this application is carried out in beginning in browser.In some embodiments, web uses on 130 servers that can be hosted in as an alternative away from client device, such as web server.
In some embodiments, be configured to be hosted on this Resource Server with the web application of specific resources server communication.For example, be that camera web uses if web uses 130, it can be hosted on camera Resource Server 140.In such embodiment, the territory source policy can not be hosted in malice web application access Resource Server on Resource Server by potential prevention, Resource Server and then stop the system resource of potential malice web application access equipment provides safe floor.In other embodiments, Resource Server can serve as the agency by the position that provides web to use the host, and it also provides the safeguard protection that exempts from as mentioned above malicious code level.
Can also realize that other safety practices guarantee not allow web to use and the various system resources of other code malice access means.For example, can require the user to select to allow the ability of the various system resources of web application access.For example, when starting the web just attempting by the Resource Server access system resources and use, allowing before this action carries out, whether user that can inquiry unit allows such access.In some embodiments, the user can select respectively access for each system resource.In other embodiments, can cover access to a plurality of or whole abilities of particular device with the selection feature.In addition, can distinguish or the certain capabilities of common choice particular system resource.For example, the user can select to allow the photograph taking ability of web application access camera, opens or closes camera but the user may select not allow to use web to use.Can realize these and other safety practices in web application, Resource Server or its combination.
Resource Server 140,145 can be similar to traditional web server running, because they are intercepted, receive and cleanup standard HTTP order.As mentioned above, in some embodiments, the web application that Resource Server 140,145 trustships and specific resources (for example, difference camera hardware 160 or telephony hardware 165) are relevant or the agency who web is used with work.So, when the browser readable page (for example, html page) pointed to Resource Server and request web application, it was directly served or is provided by the agency by Resource Server.By this way, can guarantee that it is not maliciously that web uses to browser 120, and browser 120 can move the web application as the trust process.
Can clearly divide to be used in the URL scheme that the access resources server is hosted or the web agency uses, web is provided by the access that provides system resource with identification.As example, can be with dev: //URL of www.foo.com/telephone is defined as the phone web of access on Resource Server foo.com and uses.The dev of URL: // part can indicate this URL relevant with device resource, makes to use known search instrument and agreement (URL that for example, has " dev " agreement by search) to come the seemingly device resource of mark of search class easily.
In the above example, the NameSpace that is used for call resource can comprise two URL---a state that is used for monitoring this resource, and another is used for controlling this resource.For example, state for the monitoring telephone resource, web (for example uses, web uses 130) can be to dev: //www.foo.com/telephone/state transmission HTTP GET calls, for example XMLHttpRequest (XHR) GET calls, dev: //www.foo.com/telephone/state can be after the state of resource changes the return state response object.In some embodiments, can make this GET call the GET that stays open as long-time running calls, it stays open, until GET (for example expires, after 30 seconds, 1 minute etc.) or until return to the condition responsive object of the renewal of indexed resource state from Resource Server (for example, telephony server 145).For example, the relevant web of phone uses and can come the continuously state of monitoring telephone hardware 145 by the GET that sends continuous long-time running to telephony server 145.Maintenance GET request is opened a period of time, rather than successive poll Resource Server, can provide the battery life of prolongation for equipment, and still, in some embodiments, continuous or poll intermittently also can be used as the alternative of the GET of long-time running.
Similarly, in order to control call resource, web uses 130 can be to dev: //the www.foo.com/telephone/cmd transmission calls with the HTTP POST of the order corresponding with the input of using from web, and for example XHR POST calls.For example, if the user selects " calling " button in web application 130, the expectation that phone is called calling " is picked up " in its indication, web uses 130 and can generate the message that indexed resource server 145 control telephony hardwares 165 come the operation of carry out desired, for example JavaScript object encoding method (JSON) object.Only for purpose of explanation, the example URL above providing, and it should not be considered to restriction.Generally speaking, can realize aspect of the present disclosure with other suitable http communication agreements that is independent of platform.
As mentioned above, Resource Server 140,145 runnings for the web of running in browser 120 use 130 and one or more system resources of for example camera hardware 160 and telephony hardware 165 between bridge.Resource Server operates outside the virtual memory space of browser 120, and is not administered browser 120 and retrain in the security protocol of the application of browser 120 interior execution.So, Resource Server 140,145 can be accessed the machine API of control system resource, the such the machine API of the direct access of application that stops simultaneously the browser of non-expansion and move in the browser of this non-expansion.
In some embodiments, can provide access to a plurality of resources with the single resource server.For example, the single resource server can be used as web use 130 and a plurality of system resource between bridge, rather than provide access to camera hardware 160 and telephony hardware 165 with independent camera server 140 and telephony server 145 respectively.In other embodiments, can provide access to single resource with a plurality of Resource Servers.For example, the individual system resource can have a plurality of abilities or capability class, its each can use the independent resource server to visit.In other embodiments, different Resource Servers can be carried out on different processors.For example, camera server 140 can operate on the processor that is exclusively used in camera hardware 160, and telephony server 145 can operate on the processor that is exclusively used in telephony hardware 165.
That computing equipment 110,115 can have is more than those shown in Fig. 1, still less or the dissimilar system resource that is associated.For example, except or be not camera hardware 160 and telephony hardware 165, computing equipment can comprise one or more other addressable system resources (for example, sensor, tactile feedback mechanism, gyroscope etc.).Only for purpose of explanation, this document has usually been described hardware based system resource, and should be understood that, otherwise concerning the web that carries out in the web browser of non-expansion uses the system resource of the other types of inaccessible also in the scope of the present disclosure.
Fig. 2 is the block diagram of the example communication between the assembly that is shown in the architecture of Fig. 1.In this block diagram, web uses 225 and carries out in browser 220 and be configured to by server 240 control hardwares 260.As mentioned above, browser 220 can be the web browser of standard, non-expansion or any other the suitable browser that not yet is extended to the interface of the system resource that comprises control such as hardware 260.Web application 225 is configured to Application standard HTTP connection mode and communicates by letter with server 240.For example, as shown, web uses 225 and sends HTTP GET and POST message to server 240, and server 240 responds with HTTP RESPONSE message.
As mentioned above, web uses 225 and can be configured to use the state that the HTTP GET of server 240 is called to monitor the specific hardware resource, and uses the HTTP POST to server 240 to call the control hardware resource.Any in calling in response to these, server 240 can respond with suitable HTTP RESPONSE message.For example, in response to monitoring message, server 240 can respond when hardware 260 changes state, and can respond with the message of the update mode of describing hardware 260.As another example, in response to control message, server 240 can respond the control of asking that received this particular message and successful execution.Server 240 can also come based on performed control to respond with the update mode of hardware 260.
Server 240 comprises the hardware interface controller 245 that docks with the hardware control 262 of hardware 260.Hardware interface controller 245 can comprise how description is processed from web and use the instruction that 225 the HTTP that comes in calls, and can also comprise for using local resource API or other suitable interfaces to visit and the instruction of the ability of the system resource of control example such as hardware device 265.For example, call in response to use the 225 HTTP GET that receive from web, hardware control interface 245 can utilize the machine API of hardware 260 to ask the state of hardware device 265.In some embodiments, server 240 can ask directly to respond to HTTP GET with the current state of hardware 265.In such embodiment, web uses 225 can utilize the state that the continuous poll of server 240 is come monitoring hardware equipment 265.In other embodiments, server 240 can only just request responds to HTTP GET when having upgraded the state of hardware device 265.In such embodiment, web application 225 can utilize the GET of a series of long-time running to call the state of monitoring hardware equipment 265.
In some embodiments, server 240 can be communicated by letter with hardware 260 by the command set of realizing in hardware control interface 245.For example, in response to the HTTP POST order corresponding with the specific operation of hardware device 265, hardware control interface 245 can resolve this order, process this order and generate control message corresponding to desired operation.Server 240 then can be with this transmission of messages to hardware 260, and wherein hardware control 262 can receive similarly this order and impel equipment 265 according to the request executable operations.Hardware control 262 then can be for example with the state of desired operation---for example, by indicating whether success or pass through the return state code of this operation, server 240 is responded.In some embodiments, then hardware control interface 245 can make an explanation to state or other responses from hardware control 262, so that the update mode of hardware device 265 to be provided to browser 220.
Hardware 260 comprises hardware control 262 and hardware device 265.Hardware control 262 is according to routine techniques, such as by providing one or more control signals to come operational hardware equipment 265 to hardware device 265.Hardware control 262 can have to outside caller provides one or more API that are associated to the access of the function of hardware device 265.Typically, these API are used available to some the machine that operates on equipment, but do not make the web that operates in the browser of these API to the non-expansion that operates on equipment use available.So, according to the technology of describing in the disclosure, with server 240 as the bridge between browser 220 and hardware 260, be provided at web use 225 and hardware device 265 between two-way bidding protocol.
Fig. 3 is that diagram be used for to be used the swimming lane figure of instantiation procedure 300 that should be used for the control system resource that operates at browser.Process 300 can be for example carried out by the various assemblies of architecture 100, and only for clear statement, describes subsequently architecture 100 is used as basis for the example of describing this process.For example, can realize by application (for example, web uses 130), Resource Server (for example, telephony server 145) and the system resource (for example, telephony hardware 165) of running in browser 120 in the step shown in this process.Yet, can make up implementation 300 with other assemblies or assembly.
The application that process 300 operates in the browser of non-expansion begins when receiving input (305).This input can from correspondence be used for saying outside source (such as, user's input or the external call to using), maybe can be to use the automatic input (using application or the task timer of the time that should take specific action such as indication) that self generates.For illustrative purposes, can suppose that the user has clicked the button on the webpage that is just showing in the browser of mobile device, the telephony hardware with mobile device of its indicating user comes the expectation of place calls.
In response to this input, use to Resource Server message transfer (310).In this particular example, the action for the treatment of to be taked by resource due to user's input indication (for example, " picking up " phone thinks that user's place calls prepares), therefore, this message can be to comprise the order corresponding with desired operation (for example, CALL) the form of HTTP POST message.
After receiving the message of transmitting, Resource Server is processed (315) to this message, and generates control message (320).Can be based on the order that sends in POST message, it is CALL in this example, generates this control message.Resource Server can will comprise that the HTTP POST message maps of CALL is to the suitable the machine API that is used for system resource.For example, if this machine API does not comprise the CALL operation, but alternatively comprise corresponding prepare Telephone and dial Telephone process, Resource Server can generate the control message that utilizes the process that this machine API reveals, and can suitably fill any parameter that is associated with those processes.Resource Server is then to this control message of resource transmission (325).
After receiving the control message that transmits, resource is processed (330) to this control message, and carries out operation (335) indicated in this control message.For example, the device driver of call resource can make telephony hardware be ready to place calls.This resource then can return state (340), for example whether success the or state of telephony hardware has been updated to " connection " state from the on-hook state of operation of its indication.
After the resource accepting state, Resource Server is processed (345) to this state.For example, if resource does not provide the status information of renewal, but only provide operation successful designator, Resource Server can be construed to this state the state that means telephony hardware and be updated to " connection " state from the on-hook state.By this way, more complicated processing and state-maintenance responsibility and Resource Server, resource or both can be associated.
After the Resource Server accepting state, use and also can process to this state (350).As using the example that state is processed, application can resource-based current state provide the demonstration of renewal to indicate may moving that the user can use to the user.For example, when telephony hardware is in the on-hook state, can button, dialing option etc. be used to the dialing that picks up the telephone be shown to the user, and when hardware is in " connections " state, can illustrate for disconnecting or the button of cancellation calling to the user.
