- Referring to
FIG. 1 , asystem 100 can be used, for example, for commercial activities. Thesystem 100 includesconsumer terminals advertiser 110. Theadvertiser 110 provides, in addition to selected goods and/or services, advertisements or other promotional information for such goods and/or services. For example, theadvertiser 110 can provide one or more display advertisements, email advertisements, paid search advertisements, coupons, and/or other information over anetwork 190, such as the Internet. In some implementations, the advertiser can distribute advertisements to web pages or other locations, which are accessible by theconsumer terminals applications publisher 120 that controls one or more such web pages or other locations may sell advertisement space to theadvertiser 110 directly, such as through a direct sales force, through anadvertisement delivery platform 130, or through a combination thereof. Thus, when a potential customer visits a web page or other location controlled by thepublisher 120 using theconsumer terminal 103, an advertisement provided by theadvertiser 110 can be displayed to the potential customer on theconsumer terminal 103. - The
advertisement delivery platform 130, such as the ADWORDS system or the ADSENSE system, each operated by Google Inc., or another advertisement delivery system, is configured to select an advertisement for delivery to a particular potential customer based on any number of factors, such as one or more of demographic information, historical advertisement selection information, advertisement performance information, and targeting criteria provided by theadvertiser 110, among other factors. As such, theadvertisement delivery platform 130 can be operable with atracker 140 that is operable to receive and store information regarding activity involving theconsumer terminals consumer terminals tracker 140. The historical usage information is stored in ahistorical information repository 145 and can include, for example, location information regarding locations visited by potential customers, information regarding advertisements delivered to the potential customers at those locations, information regarding interactions with the delivered advertisements, or other historical information. Thetracker 140 and/or theadvertisement delivery platform 130 can acquire or create the historical information and/or information regarding the potential customers in an anonymous form, or take other precautions to avoid unauthorized or undesired dissemination of sensitive personal information of the potential customers. Additionally, potential consumers may be assigned a profile for use in selecting advertisements. - The
advertisement delivery platform 130 is also operable with anattribution system 150 that is configured to assign attribution credit between or among advertisements which were delivered to a potential customer before a sale, or other action, such as an account creation. The attribution credit represents to theadvertiser 110, thepublisher 120, and/or the advertisement delivery platform 130 a causal link between the delivery of the advertisement and the subsequent action involving the potential customer. Accordingly, the attribution credit can be used, for example, to distribute or apportion revenue associated with the subsequent action between or among the publishers associated with the delivery of the advertisements to the potential customer. In one example, a referral fee or other payment made by theadvertiser 110 based on a sale or other completed action can be divided among and distributed to two or more publishers based on attribution credit assigned to each publisher. Theattribution system 150 can be configured to assign attribution credit based on one or more customizable attribution model(s) stored in theattribution model repository 155. The attribution models are configured such that theattribution system 150 assigns attribution credit based on historical information, such as historical information regarding a potential customer involved in a selected action, and one or more factors, such as an amount of time between delivery of an advertisement and completion of the selected action, a type of advertisement that was delivered to the potential customer, and/or an indication that the potential customer interacted with the advertisement, among others. - The
survey system 160 is configured to obtain survey response information frompotential customers advertiser 110, theadvertisement delivery platform 130, and/or theattribution system 150, or to another component of thesystem 100. For example, with reference toFIG. 2A , thesurvey system 160 performs aprocess 200 for customizing surveys, in which thesurvey system 160 receives historical information regarding activity of a potential customer from the historical information repository 145 (201). The historical information includes browsing history information and advertisement delivery history information. Thesurvey system 160 also receives a survey request (203). The survey request may be, for example, an indication that a predetermined action was taken involving a potential customer, or a request for a survey to be sent to the potential customer in response to completion of the predetermined action. For example, when a potential customer completes a purchase process or an account creation process, theconsumer terminal 103 associated with the potential customer can transmit a survey request to thesurvey system 160. The survey request can include information regarding the purchase or account creation process, information regarding theadvertiser 110, and/or information regarding the potential customer. - In response to the request, the
survey system 160 creates a customized survey for the potential customer based on historical information (205). In some implementations, thesurvey system 160 can create the customized survey by retrieving a survey form from asurvey form repository 165 based on information included in the request, such as information that identifies an advertiser whose goods and/or services were purchased, and by populating the form with customized questions that include and/or are based on the historical information specific to the potential customer. For example, when a potential customer completes a purchase, thesurvey system 160 populates a survey form with a question regarding the potential customer's perception of a causal relationship between viewing various advertisements that were delivered to the potential customer and the decision to make the purchase. Additionally, thesurvey system 160 can create customized survey questions that are verifiable based on the historical information. For example, thesurvey system 160 can populate a survey form with a question regarding whether the potential customer received a particular advertisement, where the historical information indicates that the advertisement was delivered to the potential customer. - When the creation of the customized survey is completed, or at least as questions are generated, the survey is provided to the potential customer (207). After completion by the potential customer of one or more survey questions, the survey response information, such as answers or responses to the survey questions, is received by the survey system 160 (209). The survey response information can be stored for subsequent use and/or can be retransmitted to another component of the
system 100, such as theattribution system 150. Alternatively, the survey response information can be sent directly to another component of thesystem 100, such that the survey results are initially received by the other component, such as theattribution system 150. In some implementations, the survey response information can be used by thesurvey system 160 to create and transmit additional survey questions, such as follow-up questions, or questions that are designed to elicit additional information regarding previously-received response information. - One or more of the components of the
system 100, such as theconsumer terminals advertisement delivery platform 130, thetracker 140, theattribution system 150, thesurvey system 160, and/or theanalyzer 170 can include one or more computer systems, such as thecomputer system 300 ofFIG. 3 . Thecomputer system 300 includes aprocessor 310,memory modules 330, astorage device 320, and an input-output module 340 connected by asystem bus 360. The input-output module 340 is operable with one or more input and/oroutput devices 350, including a communication device for operable connection with thenetwork 190 and with the other components of thesystem 100. The one ormore computer systems 300 can perform the various functions of the components of thesystem 100 by executing computer-readable instructions, such as computer software stored on a computer-readable storage device. - In one example implementation of the
process 200, as illustrated by theprocess 400 inFIG. 4 , the potential customer visits a web page that includes one or more advertisements using abrowser application 107 of the consumer terminal 103 (401). Based on visiting the web page, theadvertisement delivery platform 130 selects and delivers an advertisement to the potential customer for display and transmits historical information regarding the visit and regarding the advertisement selection is transmitted to thetracker 140 by the advertisement delivery platform 130 (403). Additionally, theconsumer terminal 103 and/or a server computer that hosts the web page can also transmit historical information regarding the visit to thetracker 140. Thetracker 140 receives and stores the historical information (405), and can associate the stored historical information with one or more of thepublisher 120, the visited web site, the potential customer, theconsumer terminal 103, theadvertiser 110, and/or the selected advertisement. An indication of any interaction with the selected advertisement, such as clicking on the advertisement, is also sent to thetracker 140 and recorded. As the potential customer interacts with the web page, a determination is made regarding whether the potential customer has completed a selected action, such as purchasing a product (407). If the selected action has not been completed, and the potential customer continues browsing, the browser activity and the advertisement delivery platform activity are recorded by thetracker 140. - If, however, the selected action is completed, the
browser application 107 automatically requests a survey (409) from thesurvey system 160. As discussed above with respect toFIG. 2A , when thesurvey system 160 receives the request for the survey, thesurvey system 160 can request historical information associated with the potential customer, theconsumer terminal 103, thebrowser application 107, and/or the advertisement selections from the tracker 140 (411). When thetracker 140 receives the request for information, thetracker 140 retrieves the requested information from thehistorical information repository 145, and transmits the historical information to the survey system 160 (413). After receiving the historical information, thesurvey system 160 creates a customized survey (415) and transmits the customized survey to the potential customer for completion. For example, the survey can be provided to the potential customer via thebrowser application 107. After receiving the customized survey (417), the potential customer then completes the survey (419) and transmits survey response information to thesurvey system 160. - As mentioned above, the
survey system 160 can create the customized survey by accessing a survey form from thesurvey form repository 165 based on an identity of theadvertiser 110 with whom the potential customer completed the selected action. Additionally, multiple survey forms in thesurvey form repository 165 can be associated with anadvertiser 110, and thesurvey system 160 can select a survey form from among the survey forms associated with theadvertiser 110 at random, based on information about the potential customer, based on information about the selected action, and/or based on information about the advertisements delivered to the potential customer. The survey forms include instructions or information regarding formulation of survey questions, including question text and/or question format. - For example, a survey form may indicate that a first question is a ranking question and includes the phrase “Rank the following advertisements according to influence on your purchase, where the first advertisement was most influential.” A second question could ask the potential customer to rate the influence of specific advertisements that were displayed to the potential customer, or with which the potential customer interacted. A third question could ask whether the potential customer saw one or more advertisements shown in the survey question. Other questions can relate to the perceived causal contribution of various advertisements and/or various advertisement channels to the potential customer's action. The questions can also relate to an effect of an amount of time between the advertisement delivery and the potential customer's action, and/or a perceived causal contribution of non-advertising sources, such as referrals from friends or news reports about the goods or services or about the
advertiser 110. - The
survey system 160 can then populate the form with information regarding the advertisements of theadvertiser 110 based on the historical information. For example, instructions associated with the survey form can cause thesurvey system 160 to identify the four most recent advertisements displayed to the potential customer, and to add an image of each identified advertisement to a field of the survey associated with the first question for ranking by the potential customer. Thus, the customized survey is designed to elicit subjective survey response information regarding selected aspects of the potential customer's use of thesystem 100. - When the
survey system 160 receives the survey response information (421), thesurvey system 160 transmits the survey response information, information regarding the customized survey, and/or historical information to ananalyzer 170. Theanalyzer 170 can analyze the survey response information to create analysis information and/or theanalyzer 170 can aggregate the survey response information and/or the analysis information (423). For example, theanalyzer 170 can analyze each survey question response to determine whether the responses provided by the potential customer are inconsistent with the historical information, such as by identifying where a potential customer indicated that they did not see an advertisement that the historical information indicates was, in fact, delivered to the potential customer. This kind of comparison of the survey response information with the historical information can be used as, or used to create, an indication of accuracy and/or reliability of the survey results. The survey accuracy or reliability information can be used as a basis to completely ignore the survey results or to modify how the results are used, such as by discounting the results by applying a lower weighting factor than is applied to more accurate or reliable survey results. - In addition to comparing the survey response information with the historical information, the
analyzer 170 can perform other analyses to determine the analysis information. For example, theanalyzer 170 may determine which advertisement was identified by the potential customer as the most influential regarding the decision to complete the selected action. Theanalyzer 170 may also note historical information corresponding to the identified advertisement, such as a time of delivery of the advertisement relative to the time of completion of the selected action, or the address of the web page on which the identified advertisement was displayed. Additionally, theanalyzer 170 can aggregate the survey response information to generate statistical information. For example, theanalyzer 170 may determine from survey response information from multiple surveys that a certain category of advertisements is most often indicated by potential customers as being the most influential, such as display advertisements which are located on web pages visited by potential customers after clicking on a search result link included in a list of search results. In another example, the category of most influential advertisements could be the advertisements delivered most closely in time before the completion of the selected action, or those delivered in a window of time before completion of the selected action, such as during the preceding day and not within 6 hours of the time of completion of the selected action. - After analyzing and/or aggregating the survey response information, the
analyzer 170 distributes selected analysis information to theadvertiser 110, theadvertisement delivery platform 130, and/or theattribution system 150, among others, for subsequent use by the receiving party. For example, when theadvertiser 110 receives the analysis information, theadvertiser 110 can create, modify, and/or validate advertisement campaign settings and/or media mix decisions (425). Referring to the example above, based on the selected analysis information, such as analysis information indicating that display advertisements are statistically the most influential in potential customer's decisions to purchase a product, theadvertiser 110 can decide to increase the budgets associated with display advertisements that fall into the category of most influential advertisements. If theadvertiser 110 maintains a fixed budget for the campaign, or for all media costs, the increase in the budgets for advertisements that fall into the category of most influential advertisements may be offset by decreases in budgets for other display advertisement campaigns, for other types of advertisement campaigns, such as paid search campaigns, or both. Thus, the advertiser can optimize the effectiveness of a fixed media budget by adjusting one or more aspects of the budget based on the analysis information received from theanalyzer 170. Optionally, this type of analysis information can additionally, or alternatively, be send to an advertisement management system that can then provide recommendations to the advertiser regarding media budget adjustments, or automatically make such adjustments. - Similarly, based on selected analysis information, the
advertisement delivery platform 130 can create, modify, and/or validate distribution settings, targeting settings, and/or targeting groups (427) in order to improve the effectiveness of the advertisement selections that it makes when deciding which advertisement from among many candidate advertisements to send to a given potential customer. The distribution settings, targeting settings, and/or targeting groups can be those for the potential customer, those for a group including the potential customer, and/or those used for all selections. Additionally, theattribution system 150, theadvertiser 110, or both, can use the analysis information to create, modify, and/or validate an attribution model that determines assignment of attribution credit among various advertisements delivered to a potential customer that has completed the selected action, or among various publishers who control web pages or other locations through which the advertisements are delivered to the potential customer (429). - In some implementations, as illustrated in
FIG. 2B , thesurvey system 160 is configured to obtain survey response information from potential customers by performing aprocess 250 for customizing surveys, in which thesurvey system 160 receives historical information regarding activity of the potential customer from the historical information repository 145 (251). Thesurvey system 160 also receives a survey request in response to completion of the selected action (253). Based on the request, thesurvey system 160 provides a survey associated with theadvertiser 110 to the potential customer (255). After the survey is completed by the potential customer, or as the survey is completed, the survey response information is transmitted to the survey system 160 (257). Thesurvey system 160 can then customize the survey by retrieving the historical information specific to the potential customer and by analyzing the survey response information based on the historical information (259). For example, when a potential customer completes a purchase, thesurvey system 160 provides a generic survey form to the potential customer for completion. The generic survey may include a question that asks the potential customer to describe the advertisement that contributed most to their decision to purchase a product. The response can then be analyzed by comparison of the described advertisement to the advertisements that were delivered to thepotential customer 103 by referring to the historical information to customize the survey information. When the survey response information is customized, or at least as survey response information is customized, the survey response information can be provided to selected components of thesystem 100 for use, such as described above. - Referring to
FIG. 5 , aprocess 500 provides one example of implementation of theprocess 250. Initially, the potential customer visits a web page using a browser application (501). Based on the potential customer's visit of the web page, theadvertisement delivery platform 130 selects and delivers an advertisement to the potential customer for display (503). Additionally, historical information regarding the visit and historical information regarding the advertisement selection are transmitted to thetracker 140, and thetracker 140 stores the historical information (505). Any interaction with the selected advertisement, such as clicking on the advertisement, is also sent to thetracker 140 and recorded. As the potential customer interacts with the web page, a determination is made regarding whether thepotential customer 103 has completed a selected action (507), such as purchasing a product. If the selected action has not been completed, and the potential customer continues browsing, the browser activity and the advertisement delivery platform activity are recorded. - If, however, the selected action is completed, the browser program automatically requests a survey (509) from the
survey system 160. As discussed above with respect toFIG. 2B , when thesurvey system 160 receives the request for the survey, thesurvey system 160 transmits a survey associated with the advertiser to the browser program (511). When the browser program receives the survey (513), the potential customer then completes the survey (515) and transmits survey response information to thesurvey system 160. Before or after thesurvey system 160 receives the survey response information (517), thesurvey system 160 requests historical information from thetracker 140 associated with the potential customer (519). In response to receiving the request for historical information from thesurvey system 160, thetracker 140 transmits historical information associated with the potential customer to the survey system 160 (521). - When the
survey system 160 has received the historical information and the survey response information, thesurvey system 160 analyzes the survey response information based on the historical information (523) in order to customize the survey response information. For example, thesurvey system 160 can compare the survey response information and the historical information, such as by determining that an advertisement indicated in the survey response information as being viewed before and contributing to the completion of the selected action was, in fact, delivered to the potential customer before the selected action was completed. Additionally, where the survey delivered to the potential customer is generic, thesurvey system 160 can determine whether other survey response information is accurate, such as survey response information indicating a certain product that was purchased by the potential customer. - When the
survey system 160 completes the analysis, thesurvey system 160 transmits the customized survey response information and/or historical information to ananalyzer 170. Theanalyzer 170 can analyze the survey response information to obtain analysis information, and/or theanalyzer 170 can aggregate the survey response information and/or the analysis information (525). For example, theanalyzer 170 can analyze and/or aggregate the customized survey response information as described above. After analyzing and/or aggregating the survey response information, theanalyzer 170 distributes selected analysis information to theadvertiser 110, theadvertisement delivery platform 130, and/or theattribution system 150, among other components, for subsequent use by the receiving component. For example, theadvertiser 110 can create, modify, and/or validate advertisement campaign settings and/or a media mix (527). Theattribution system 150 can create, modify, and/or validate an attribution model for the individual potential customer, an attribution model for a group including the potential customer, or a global attribution model (5297). The advertisement delivery platform can create, modify, and/or validate settings for advertisement selection and distribution for the potential customer, a group including the potential customer, or global settings (531). - While some implementations are described above, these should not be viewed as exhaustive or limiting, but rather should be viewed as exemplary, and included to provide descriptions of various features. It will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the
system 100 can be a non-commercial system for content distribution. However, in many or all implementations, the system can include some or all of the components and/or functionality described herein. Alternatively, the functions described above can be performed by other components, including two or more different components, and in other contexts. - Furthermore, it should be noted that actions described or recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and by different actors. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments can, in some implementations, be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can, in some implementations, be implemented separately, or in any suitable sub-combination.
- Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order and/or in association with a particular system component or user, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations must be performed, or must be performed by the associated component or user, to achieve desirable results. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments.
- As an example, while customized surveys relating to advertisement delivery and assignment of causal attribution are discussed above, other types of surveys can be customized, such as political or educational surveys.
