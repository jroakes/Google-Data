- Search results can be augmented with supplemental content, such as suggestions for additional search queries that may be related to the search query entered by the user.
- supplemental content may also be provided, to the user, along with the search results.
- One possible implementation may be directed to a method performed by one or more devices.
- the method may include receiving a search query from a user; obtaining a search result document responsive to the search query, the search result document including one or more search results that are initially presented to the user and one or more suggested search queries, relating to the search query, that are initially not presented to the user.
- the method may further include detecting performance of a sequence of actions by the user, the sequence of actions including a scroll down operation followed by a scroll up operation; and presenting, by the device, the one or more suggested search queries to the user in response to the detection of the sequence of actions.
- a computer-readable medium may include one or more instructions, which when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to receive a search query from a user; one or more instructions, which when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to obtain a search result document responsive to the search query, the search result document including one or more search results that are initially presented to the user and one or more suggested search queries, relating to the search query, that are initially not presented to the user; one or more instructions, which when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to detect performance of a sequence of actions by the user, the sequence of actions including a scroll down operation followed by a scroll up operation; and one or more instructions, which when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to present the one or more suggested search queries to the user in response to the detection of the sequence of actions.

- Figs. 8A - 8C are diagrams illustrating examples of user interfaces that may be provided to a user.
- User actions when interacting with search results, may be monitored, and certain actions may be used to trigger modification of the provided search results. For example, if a user performs a "scroll down" operation followed by a "scroll up" operation, when navigating a search result document, the search result document may be modified to include suggested search queries, at a top of a search result document. In this situation, the scroll down operation followed by the scroll up operation may be an indication that the user has viewed the top search results, was not satisfied with the top search results, and is navigating back to the top of the search result document to enter a new search query. Providing additional potential search queries at the top of the search result document may save the user from having to type a new search query.
- Figs. 1 A and IB are diagrams illustrating an example of a search session performed on a mobile device. Assume that a user desires to find information relating to the search query "brad pitt.” As shown in Fig. 1A, a number of search results 110 may be initially presented on a screen of a mobile device 100. Search results 110 may be provided below a search box 120, in which a user may enter a search query. The screen of mobile device 100 may be a touch sensitive screen, allowing the user to scroll down, to view additional results of search results 110, using a touch operation. Search results 130 may represent the viewable search results after a scroll down operation. Referring to Fig. IB, assume that the user does not find a desirable result in search results 110 and 130. The user may perform a scroll up operation to access search box 120.
- mobile device 100 may provide, below search box 120, supplemental content that was not initially provided to the user, such as search query suggestions 140 in which the user may be interested.
- search query suggestions 140 in which the user may be interested.
- the user may select one of search query suggestions 140 to initiate a new search using the selected search query suggestion rather than having to enter a new search query into search box 120.
- the user's search experience may be improved as the user may not need to type a new search. This can be particularly useful for devices, such as mobile devices, in which typing text can be a relatively cumbersome task.
- a scroll down operation followed by scroll up operation is an example of a sequence of operations that may be used to trigger the providing of supplemental content.
- other trigger conditions such as a single scroll up operation or another operation or sequence of operations, may be used to trigger the providing of the supplemental content.
- search query suggestions 140 are illustrated in Figs. 1A and IB as an example of supplemental content, other types of supplemental content may alternatively be provided.
- a document may be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product.
- a document may include, for example, an e-mail, a web site, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a news article, a blog, a business listing, an electronic version of printed text, a web advertisement, etc.
- a common document is a web page.
- Documents often include textual information and may include embedded information, such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc., and/or embedded instructions, such as Javascript, etc.
- a link is to be broadly interpreted to include any reference to/from a document from/to another document or another part of the same document.

- Process 500 may include receiving a search query (block 510).
- the search query may be received from a client 205, and may be, for example, a search query relating to a general web search, a news search, an image search, or another type of search.
- search results may be determined (block 520).
- Search server 210 may, for instance, determine one or more documents that are relevant to the search query, such as documents that were previously indexed from web servers connected to network 230.
- Search server 210 may include links, to the relevant documents, in a search result document, which may be, for example, an HTML document.
- the search result document may include other information, such as snippet text that may be based on text that is obtained from the relevant documents.
- the search result document may additionally include logic to implement trigger detection component 410 and/or supplemental content presentation component 430.
- the search result document may include computer programming instructions, such as JavaScript, to monitor user interactions with the interface in which the search result document is provided, and to send a trigger signal to search server 210 when a trigger condition is detected.
- the search result document may also include programming instructions or other mechanisms, to provide the supplemental content, that is received from search server 210, to the user.
- the search result document, transmitted by search server 210 may only include logic to implement trigger detection component 410 and/or supplemental content presentation component 430, for certain types of client devices 205.
- client devices 205 that request a mobile search interface may include logic to implement trigger detection component 410.
- the mobile search interface may be an interface provided by search server 210, in which search server 210 optimizes the presentation of search results for relatively small graphical interfaces, such as those that are typically associated with smartphones or other highly portable devices.
- Process 500 may further include transmitting the search result document to the client, such as a client 205 (block 530).
- Client 205 in response to receiving the search result document, may provide the search result document to the user.
- a web browser executing at client 205 may render the search result document in a user interface at client 205.
- a trigger signal such as a trigger signal from client 205
- the trigger signal may indicate that a trigger condition has been detected at client 205.
- a trigger condition may be a scroll down operation followed by a scroll up operation.
- the trigger signal may include additional information, such as the current search query.
- the trigger signal may include a message that is transmitted, by client 205, in response to client 205 detecting a trigger condition.
- Process 500 may further include, when a trigger signal is received from client 205 (block 540 - YES), determining supplemental content (block 550).
- the supplemental content may include search query suggestions.
- the supplemental content may include other content, such as advertisements, search refinement suggestions, or other types of content.
- the supplemental content may be determined based on the search query but may be distinct from the search results.
- the supplemental content may be identified when the initial search result document is being generated. In this case, the supplemental content may be stored, by search server 210, until the trigger signal is received.
- Process 500 may further include transmitting the supplemental content to client 205 for presentation by client 205 within the search result document (block 560).
- the search result document that is currently being presented to the user i.e., the web page showing the search result document
- An example of supplemental content provided in a search result document is illustrated in Fig. IB, in which the search result document shown in Fig. 1 A is modified to include supplemental content, illustrated as search query suggestions 140.
- the supplemental content may be viewable when the user scrolls back to the top of the search result document.
- Fig. 6 is a flow chart of an example process 600, according to another possible implementation, for including supplemental content in a search result document.
- Process 600 may be performed by, for example, search server 210.
- process 600 may include supplemental content that is embedded, although not necessarily initially viewable, within the search result document that is initially transmitted to client 205.
- Process 600 may include receiving a search query (block 610).
- the search query may be received from a client 205, and may be, for example, a search query relating to a general web search, a news search, an image search, or another type of search.
- Process 600 may further include generating a search result document (block 620).
- the search result document may include the main search results and the supplemental content (block 620).
- the main search results may include links to one or more documents that are determined to be relevant to the search query.
- the search result document may include other information, such as snippets of text that summarize the relevant documents, and/or other information.
- the supplemental content may be initially hidden such that a user viewing the search result document in a browser will not see the supplemental content.
- the search result document may additionally include logic to implement trigger detection component 410 and/or supplemental content presentation component 430.
- the search result document may include computer programming instructions, such as JavaScript, to monitor user interactions with the interface in which the search result document is provided, and to issue a trigger signal when a trigger condition is detected.
- Content presentation component 430 may respond to the trigger signal to make the supplemental content visible to the user.
- Process 600 may further include transmitting the search result document to client 205 (block 630).
- Client 205 may receive the search result document and provide via, for example, a web browser, the search result document to the user.
- Fig. 7 is a flow chart of an example process 700 for presenting supplemental content to a user.
- Process 700 may be performed by, for example, client 205.
- Process 700 may include receiving a search query (block 710).
- the search query may, for example, be a search query entered by a user in a web browser executing at client 205.
- Process 700 may further include transmitting the search query to a server (block 720).
- the search query may be transmitted to a search engine, such as a search engine implemented by search server 210.
- search server 210 The corresponding operation of search server 210 was described with respect to Fig. 6.
- Process 700 may further include, in response to transmitting the search query, receiving a search result document, which may include hidden supplemental content (block 730).
- the search result document may additionally include the main search results.
- the main search results may be presented to the user, such as by rendering the search result document in a browser window.
- Process 700 may further include determining, based on user interaction with the search result document, whether a trigger condition occurs (block 740).
- a trigger condition may be a user action or a sequence of user interactions.
- a trigger condition may include a scroll down operation followed by a scroll up operation.
- Other trigger conditions may alternatively, or additionally, be used.
- Process 700 may further include, when a trigger condition occurs, making the
- the supplemental content may be made visible near the top of the search result document, such as within an area below a search box. This positioning of the supplemental content may be particularly useful when the trigger condition indicates that the user may be scrolling towards the top of the document as the user may be scrolling back to the search box and is likely to notice the supplemental content.
- the supplemental content may be made visible in another part of the search result document, such as in a side margin.
- the supplemental content may be rendered in a portion of the search result document that is not immediately visible to the user and that does not modify the viewable area of the browser. This can be useful as it may not interrupt the browsing of the user.
- supplemental content may include a number of different types of supplemental content, such as search query suggestions, advertisements, query refinements, or other types of supplemental content.
- search query suggestions are shown as textual links.
- search query suggestions may be shown in other ways, such as an image that generally represents a topic or query. Examples of supplemental content in the form of advertisements, query refinements, and images will next be given with reference to Figs. 8A, 8B, and 8C.
- Fig. 8 A is a diagram illustrating an example user interface 810 that may be provided to the user.
- the user interface may be provided, by a browser program and on a mobile device 800, in response to submission of a search query to a search engine.
- This user interface 810 may include a search box 820, a quantity of search results 830 (search result 1 through search result N), and supplemental content 840, where supplemental content 840 is particularly illustrated as an advertisement (ad).
- the state of user interface 810 is a state that is provided after detection of a trigger condition.
- supplemental comment 840 may not be visible in user interface 810.
- the first and second search results may extend horizontally across user interface 810.
- the trigger condition may be a user scroll down operation followed by a scroll up operation. Other trigger conditions may alternatively be used.
- Fig. 8B is a diagram illustrating an example of another implementation of user interface 810.
- the user interface may be provided, by a browser program and on a mobile device 800, in response to submission of a search query to a search engine.
- User interface 810 may include search box 820, quantity of search results 830 (search result 1 through search result N), and supplemental content 850, where supplemental content 850 is particularly illustrated as an interface in which search query refinements are provided.
- the search query refinements include the ability to refine a user search query by date. For instance, by selecting a link, a user may refine the search results to only include search results that are published in the past 24 hours or past three days. Refining search results by date may be particularly useful for news searches.
- the version of user interface 810 is a version that is provided after detection of a trigger condition.
- supplemental content 850 may not be visible in user interface 810.
- the search results 830 may be displayed directly below the search box 820.
- the trigger condition may be a user scroll down operation followed by a scroll up operation. Other trigger conditions may alternatively be used.
- the search query refinements, corresponding to supplemental content 850 can include additional or alternative refinement conditions, other than date-based refinements. For example, refinement options relating to specific locations or content type, such as news documents, images, etc., may also be presented. Still further, supplemental content 850 may also include controls relating to the formatting of supplemental content 850. For example, supplemental content 850 may include a minimization control, expansion control, and/or a hide control, which may allow a user to selectively minimize, expand, and/or hide supplemental content 850.
- the supplemental content may be displayed in a manner in which the overall layout or structure of a search result document is not changed.
- the screen area taken by supplemental content 850 may, when the user initially views the search result document, be used to display other information, such as images or advertisements. In this situation, the images may be replaced by supplemental content 850.
- the supplemental content in response to the trigger condition, may be moved within the structure of the search result document. For example, supplemental content 850 may be initially provided at the bottom of a search result document. In response to detection of the trigger condition, however, supplemental content 850 may be moved to a top of the search result document.
- Fig. 8C is a diagram illustrating an example of another implementation of user interface 810.
- Fig. 8C may be similar to Fig. 8B, except that in Fig. 8C the supplemental content 860 may include images.
- the images may include thumbnail images of larger images and may represent, for example, content, search query suggestions, or query refinements.
- the trigger condition may include one or more user actions with respect to an user interface in which the document is provided.
- the trigger condition may be based on detection of a scroll down operation followed by a scroll up operation while browsing a webpage.
- Presenting supplemental content, in response to a trigger condition may allow the supplemental content to be targeted to certain situations in which it is likely that the user is interested in the supplemental content. For example, a scroll down operation followed by a scroll up operation may mean that the user is likely to be interested in refining the previous search query, so providing supplemental content that assists the user in refining the search query may improve the browsing experience.
