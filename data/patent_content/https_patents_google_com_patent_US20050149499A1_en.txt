- FIG. 5 illustrates a process 500 by which a search engine, such as search engine 112 in FIG. 1 , might use the index 400 illustrated in FIG. 4 to provide search results in response to a query.
- Search engine 112 receives a query (block 502 ), and uses an index, such as index 400 , to determine which documents correspond to that query (block 504 ).
- index 400 For example, boolean logic can be used to match the query with the documents, or a term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) based information retrieval score could be used, with the words in the query combined with the words in each document.
- search engine 112 could use index 400 to determine that “abendzeitung” appears in documents 302 and 306 . These documents, and/or a reference thereto, are then returned to the user (block 506 ).
- a search may fail to identify documents that do not contain the exact query terms. For instance, in the example described in connection with FIG. 5 , the query “abendzeitung” failed to locate document 304 , which contains the term “abend-zeitung.”
- One way to improve search results is to expand queries to include possible variants of the query terms, thereby ensuring that responsive documents that contain these variants are not missed.
- a variety of linguistic features such as compound words, inflections, and orthographic (e.g., spelling) variations are used for this purpose.
- this problem can be solved or ameliorated by generating a list of potential compound words, then using this list to expand queries containing one or more compound words from the list.
- the list of word pairs can be generated in a variety of ways. For example, it could be formed using a dictionary, or by dynamically searching across a corpus of documents (e.g., Internet web pages) and generating a list of compound terms.
- FIG. 6A shows an example of such a method 600 .
- a list of potential word pairs is generated by searching a set of documents for hyphenated words (block 602 ), then searching the documents for the corresponding unhyphenated version of each word (block 604 ).
- a list can then be generated of each word pair (e.g., “AB or A-B”) that was identified (block 606 ).
- the resulting list may then be shortened by, e.g., removing word pairs that occur with a relatively low frequency in the set of documents (block 608 ). For example, an examination could be made of the number of times that “AB” appears in the corpus, the number of times that “A-B” appears, and/or the like.
- the set of documents could also be searched for instances in which “compound” words appear as pairs (or triplets, etc.) of separate, unhyphenated words (e.g., “A B”).
- the resulting list of compound words can then be used to expand queries that contain one or more of the words on the list. For example, when a query is received (block 652 ), it can be examined to determine if it contains any words in the list of word pairs. If the query contains a word that is part of a compound pair, the query can be supplemented to include the other part of the pair (block 654 ). For example, the word can be replaced by a disjunction of both forms of the word. For example, “AB” could be replaced by “AB OR A-B”; “A-B” could be replaced by “A-B OR AB”; and so forth. Thus, for example, the query “abendzeitung,” discussed above in connection with FIG. 5 , would be expanded to “abendzeitung OR abend-zeitung,” and would yield documents 302 , 304 , and 306 (rather than just documents 302 and 306 ) when compared with the index.
- the list of compound words described above can be used to improve search results in other ways as well.
- documents written in formats such as Postscript (PS) or Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) often include hyphenation to break words at the end of lines. These words may be indexed improperly as hyphenated words.
- the list of compound words described above can be used at document indexing (or parsing) time. When a hyphenated word is encountered, it is compared to the list of compound words, and if it is not located, the hyphen can be removed when the word is indexed.
- German has a wide variety of inflectional forms as well. For example, “abirrung” and “abirrept” are different inflectional forms of the same root, as are “spiel,” “person,” “full,” “Instituts,” and “spiels.” Thus, a query that uses one inflectional form, but not the others, may fail to identify documents that would be of interest to the user who generated the query.
- sets of inflectional forms are assembled, and then used to expand queries.
- the inflection sets can be obtained in a variety of ways, such as by consulting a dictionary or by using an automated tool. For example, if German is the query language, the inflection sets could be generated using a language analysis or generation tool with a relatively large lexicon of root forms, such as with any suitable word form analyzer.
- a set of inflectional forms can be created by collecting a set of words from a corpus of documents (e.g., web pages) (block 702 ).
- a word form analyzer can then be applied to this set of words, yielding a set of mappings between inflected words and roots (block 704 ).
- the set of mappings can be filtered by using only those words that appear in some suitable number or percentage of the documents (e.g., those words that appear in at least 100 documents) (block 706 ).
- the table can then be inverted, resulting in a set of mappings between roots and inflected forms (block 708 ).
- FIG. 7B shows a method for performing query expansion using inflection sets generated using a method such as that shown in FIG. 7A .
- a query contains a word that is a member of an inflection set (block 752 )
- the query is augmented by including the disjunction of all the members in the inflection set (or some suitable subset) (block 754 ).
- the query “auto spiel” could become “(auto OR autos) (spiel OR implicaciones OR spiel OR implicates OR spiels).”
- the expanded query is then used to perform a search of the document database (e.g., by comparing the search with an index of the database) (block 756 ), and the results of the search are presented to the user (block 758 ).
- a search of the document database e.g., by comparing the search with an index of the database
- the results of the search are presented to the user (block 758 ).
- a user submitted a query containing the word “abisolieren” this could be expanded to “abisolieren OR abisol striv OR abisoliert,” thereby enabling a search of the documents shown in FIG. 3 to identify documents 306 and 308 in addition to document 304 .
- FIGS. 7A and 7B It will be appreciated that a number of variations can be made to the basic concepts illustrated in FIGS. 7A and 7B .
- other variants of the root forms of the query terms could be included in the expansion, regardless of whether those variants were, strictly speaking, inflections of the query terms.
- the inflection sets used to perform the query expansion could be generated by consulting a dictionary or other source, rather than applying a word form analyzer in the manner described in connection with FIG. 7A .
- German words include a number of words that can be spelled in different ways. For example, many German words have different spellings due to dialectical variations and/or the recent spelling reform. Examples of common German spelling variations include the interchangeability of “ph” and “f” (e.g., “telefon” or “telephon”), “ ⁇ ” and “ss” (e.g., “ma ⁇ e” or “masse”), the interchangeability of various repeat letter sequences (e.g., “wagon” or “waggon,” “bettuch” or “betttuch,” etc.), and the use of apostrophes (e.g., “kantsch” or “kant'sch”).
- a table is created of orthographic variations. This can be accomplished, e.g., by consulting a dictionary or other source. For example, many of the variations in German spelling can be obtained by examining data relating to the German spelling reform (e.g., using any suitable word form analyzer), and/or the like. As an example, information on the German spelling reform is provided by Institut fuer Deutsche Erasmus (Institute for the German Language) at http://www.ids-mannheim.de/org/, a foundation that has published extensive information about the German language. As shown in FIG. 8 , this table can be used to expand user queries (blocks 802 - 804 ), which can then be used to search for responsive documents (blocks 806 - 808 ).
- FIG. 9 illustrates the general process of applying linguistic techniques such as those described above to perform searches on an index or database of documents.
- a query is received from a user (block 902 )
- it is expanded through application of one or more of the techniques described above (block 904 ).
- the expanded query is then compared to a database index to locate responsive documents (block 906 ), which are then returned or identified to the user (block 908 ).
- multiple searches could be performed in response to a user's query. For example, a search could first be performed using the user's original query, followed by one or more searches using expanded or re-written versions of that query. The results of these searches could be evaluated (e.g., using information regarding the user's preferences and search history), and the results determined to be most likely to be useful could be returned.
- the highest quality results from the original query could be supplemented with results from the expanded query if those results were determined to be of higher or comparable quality.
- the terms in the expanded query could be weighted differently. For example, a higher weighting could be assigned to the original query terms, and lower weightings could be assigned to the terms added via expansion.
- FIG. 10 shows an example of such an expanded index for the documents shown in FIG. 3 .
- the various compound terms, inflection sets, and orthographic variations are grouped together in the left-hand column of the index, and the documents that contain any term in the group are listed in the right-hand column.
- FIG. 11 once the expanded index is generated (block 1102 ), user queries (block 1104 ) can be compared directly with the index (block 1106 ) without performing query expansion. Alternatively, some combination of index expansion and query expansion could be used.
Abstract
Systems and methods are disclosed for improving search quality. Search queries are expanded using a variety of linguistic techniques. For example, the words in a query can be supplemented with related words obtained from a database of compound words, inflectional forms, and/or orthographic variations. The expanded queries can be used to perform searches for responsive documents. A document index can be expanded using similar techniques.

As shown inFIG. 2 ,memory 204 may also include one or more programs for expanding queries and/or documents using the techniques described in more detail below, and a user-interface application 232 for operatinguser interface 206 and/or for serving user interface web pages to remote users overnetwork 220. AlthoughFIG. 2 illustrates a system that is primarily software-based, it will be appreciated that in other embodiments special-purpose circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions to implement processes consistent with the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software. - It should be appreciated that the systems and methods of the present invention can be practiced with devices and/or architectures that lack some of the components shown in
FIGS. 1 and 2 and/or that have other components that are not shown. Thus, it should be appreciated thatFIGS. 1 and 2 are provided for purposes of illustration and not limitation as to the scope of the invention. For example, it should be appreciated that while, for purposes of illustration,system 200 is depicted as a single, general-purpose computing device such as a personal computer or a network server, inother embodiments system 200 could comprise one or more such systems operating together using distributed computing techniques. In such embodiments, some or all of the components and functionality depicted inFIG. 2 could be spread amongst multiple systems at multiple locations and/or operated by multiple parties. For example,query expansion application 231 could be implemented on a system that is separate from the system on whichdocument database 229 is hosted (e.g., query expansion could, in some embodiments be performed on the client, rather than the server). It will be readily apparent that many similar variations could be made to the illustrations shown inFIGS. 1 and 2 without departing from the principles of the present invention. - As previously indicated, the systems shown in
FIGS. 1 and 2 can be used to facilitate the retrieval of documents (e.g., web pages) responsive to user queries.FIG. 3 illustrates a set of German-language documents documents more servers FIG. 1 . As shown inFIG. 3 , afirst document 302 contains the words “abendzeitung,” “autotelefon,” “abirrungen,” and “betttuch.” Asecond document 304 contains the words “abend-zeitung,” “abirrung,” “autotelephon,” and “abisolieren.” Athird document 306 contains the words “bettuch,” “bahnwagon,” “abisolierten,” and “abendzeitung.” And afourth document 308 contains the words “autotelefon,” “bahnwaggon,” “abisolierte,” and “abirrung.”Documents FIG. 3 shows documents written in German, it will be appreciated that the documents could be written in any language or combination of languages. -
FIG. 4 illustrates anindex 400 based on the documents shown inFIG. 3 . The first column of the index contains a list of terms, and the second column contains a list of documents corresponding to those terms. Some terms, such as “bahnwaggon,” only correspond to (e.g., appear in) one document (i.e., document 308). Other terms, such as “autotelefon,” correspond to multiple documents (i.e.,documents 302 and 308). -
FIG. 5 illustrates aprocess 500 by which a search engine, such assearch engine 112 inFIG. 1 , might use theindex 400 illustrated inFIG. 4 to provide search results in response to a query.Search engine 112 receives a query (block 502), and uses an index, such asindex 400, to determine which documents correspond to that query (block 504). For example, boolean logic can be used to match the query with the documents, or a term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) based information retrieval score could be used, with the words in the query combined with the words in each document. Thus, for example, if the query were “abendzeitung,”search engine 112 could useindex 400 to determine that “abendzeitung” appears indocuments - As seen in the foregoing example, a search may fail to identify documents that do not contain the exact query terms. For instance, in the example described in connection with
FIG. 5 , the query “abendzeitung” failed to locatedocument 304, which contains the term “abend-zeitung.” - One way to improve search results is to expand queries to include possible variants of the query terms, thereby ensuring that responsive documents that contain these variants are not missed. In a preferred embodiment, a variety of linguistic features such as compound words, inflections, and orthographic (e.g., spelling) variations are used for this purpose.
- Compounds
- In many languages, certain word pairs can be written separately, written as compounds, or hyphenated. For example, in the German language many nouns can be concatenated to form longer nominal compounds. In many cases, there is not a standard way to write these words (e.g., concatenated, hyphenated, or separated), and thus different forms may be used in different documents. For example, the term “fernsehprogramm” (meaning television program) can be written either as “fernsehprogramm” or “fernseh-programm.” Thus, a query that uses one form of this word, but not the other, may fail to locate responsive documents.
- In one embodiment, this problem can be solved or ameliorated by generating a list of potential compound words, then using this list to expand queries containing one or more compound words from the list. The list of word pairs (or triplets, etc.) can be generated in a variety of ways. For example, it could be formed using a dictionary, or by dynamically searching across a corpus of documents (e.g., Internet web pages) and generating a list of compound terms.
-
FIG. 6A shows an example of such amethod 600. As shown inFIG. 6A , a list of potential word pairs is generated by searching a set of documents for hyphenated words (block 602), then searching the documents for the corresponding unhyphenated version of each word (block 604). A list can then be generated of each word pair (e.g., “AB or A-B”) that was identified (block 606). In some embodiments, the resulting list may then be shortened by, e.g., removing word pairs that occur with a relatively low frequency in the set of documents (block 608). For example, an examination could be made of the number of times that “AB” appears in the corpus, the number of times that “A-B” appears, and/or the like. It will be appreciated that a number of variations can be made to the basic process shown inFIG. 6A . For example, in some embodiments the set of documents could also be searched for instances in which “compound” words appear as pairs (or triplets, etc.) of separate, unhyphenated words (e.g., “A B”). - As shown in
FIG. 6B , the resulting list of compound words can then be used to expand queries that contain one or more of the words on the list. For example, when a query is received (block 652), it can be examined to determine if it contains any words in the list of word pairs. If the query contains a word that is part of a compound pair, the query can be supplemented to include the other part of the pair (block 654). For example, the word can be replaced by a disjunction of both forms of the word. For example, “AB” could be replaced by “AB OR A-B”; “A-B” could be replaced by “A-B OR AB”; and so forth. Thus, for example, the query “abendzeitung,” discussed above in connection withFIG. 5 , would be expanded to “abendzeitung OR abend-zeitung,” and would yielddocuments - In some embodiments, the list of compound words described above can be used to improve search results in other ways as well. For example, documents written in formats such as Postscript (PS) or Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) often include hyphenation to break words at the end of lines. These words may be indexed improperly as hyphenated words. Thus, in one embodiment the list of compound words described above can be used at document indexing (or parsing) time. When a hyphenated word is encountered, it is compared to the list of compound words, and if it is not located, the hyphen can be removed when the word is indexed.
- Inflections
- Similarly, many words have a variety of inflectional forms for expressing grammatical relationships such as case, gender, number, person, tense, or mood. Examples of English inflections include the addition of “s” to a noun to form a plural, or the addition of “ed” to a verb to express the past tense. Other inflections involve changing the base word itself, as illustrated by the inflection set “speak,” “spoke,” and “spoken.”
- German has a wide variety of inflectional forms as well. For example, “abirrung” and “abirrungen” are different inflectional forms of the same root, as are “spiel,” “spiele,” “spielen,” “spieles,” and “spiels.” Thus, a query that uses one inflectional form, but not the others, may fail to identify documents that would be of interest to the user who generated the query.
- Thus, in one embodiment sets of inflectional forms are assembled, and then used to expand queries. The inflection sets can be obtained in a variety of ways, such as by consulting a dictionary or by using an automated tool. For example, if German is the query language, the inflection sets could be generated using a language analysis or generation tool with a relatively large lexicon of root forms, such as with any suitable word form analyzer.
- As shown in
FIG. 7A , in one embodiment a set of inflectional forms can be created by collecting a set of words from a corpus of documents (e.g., web pages) (block 702). A word form analyzer can then be applied to this set of words, yielding a set of mappings between inflected words and roots (block 704). In some embodiments, the set of mappings can be filtered by using only those words that appear in some suitable number or percentage of the documents (e.g., those words that appear in at least 100 documents) (block 706). The table can then be inverted, resulting in a set of mappings between roots and inflected forms (block 708). -
FIG. 7B shows a method for performing query expansion using inflection sets generated using a method such as that shown inFIG. 7A . As shown inFIG. 7B , if a query contains a word that is a member of an inflection set (block 752), the query is augmented by including the disjunction of all the members in the inflection set (or some suitable subset) (block 754). For example, the query “auto spiel” could become “(auto OR autos) (spiel OR spiele OR spiel OR spiele OR spielen OR spieles OR spiels).” The expanded query is then used to perform a search of the document database (e.g., by comparing the search with an index of the database) (block 756), and the results of the search are presented to the user (block 758). Thus, for example, if a user submitted a query containing the word “abisolieren,” this could be expanded to “abisolieren OR abisolierten OR abisolierte,” thereby enabling a search of the documents shown inFIG. 3 to identifydocuments document 304. - It will be appreciated that a number of variations can be made to the basic concepts illustrated in
FIGS. 7A and 7B . For example, other variants of the root forms of the query terms could be included in the expansion, regardless of whether those variants were, strictly speaking, inflections of the query terms. As another example, in some embodiments the inflection sets used to perform the query expansion could be generated by consulting a dictionary or other source, rather than applying a word form analyzer in the manner described in connection withFIG. 7A . - Orthographic Variations
- Many languages include a number of words that can be spelled in different ways. For example, many German words have different spellings due to dialectical variations and/or the recent spelling reform. Examples of common German spelling variations include the interchangeability of “ph” and “f” (e.g., “telefon” or “telephon”), “β” and “ss” (e.g., “maβe” or “masse”), the interchangeability of various repeat letter sequences (e.g., “wagon” or “waggon,” “bettuch” or “betttuch,” etc.), and the use of apostrophes (e.g., “kantsch” or “kant'sch”).
- Thus, in one embodiment a table is created of orthographic variations. This can be accomplished, e.g., by consulting a dictionary or other source. For example, many of the variations in German spelling can be obtained by examining data relating to the German spelling reform (e.g., using any suitable word form analyzer), and/or the like. As an example, information on the German spelling reform is provided by Institut fuer Deutsche Sprache (Institute for the German Language) at http://www.ids-mannheim.de/org/, a foundation that has published extensive information about the German language. As shown in
FIG. 8 , this table can be used to expand user queries (blocks 802-804), which can then be used to search for responsive documents (blocks 806-808). - Thus a variety of techniques have been described for improving search results. It will be appreciated that these techniques can be applied individually, or in combination with each other and/or with other techniques.
FIG. 9 illustrates the general process of applying linguistic techniques such as those described above to perform searches on an index or database of documents. As shown inFIG. 9 , when a query is received from a user (block 902), it is expanded through application of one or more of the techniques described above (block 904). The expanded query is then compared to a database index to locate responsive documents (block 906), which are then returned or identified to the user (block 908). - It will be appreciated that a variety of changes can be made to the systems and methods described above in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. For example, the techniques described above can be applied in combination with other techniques, such as spelling correction, synonym and/or related-word expansion, language translation, spam reduction, and/or the like, to further enhance search results. As another example, in some embodiments multiple searches could be performed in response to a user's query. For example, a search could first be performed using the user's original query, followed by one or more searches using expanded or re-written versions of that query. The results of these searches could be evaluated (e.g., using information regarding the user's preferences and search history), and the results determined to be most likely to be useful could be returned. For example, the highest quality results from the original query could be supplemented with results from the expanded query if those results were determined to be of higher or comparable quality. Alternatively, or in addition, the terms in the expanded query could be weighted differently. For example, a higher weighting could be assigned to the original query terms, and lower weightings could be assigned to the terms added via expansion.
- In addition, although the examples described above involve expansion of the user's query, in other embodiments the document index itself can be expanded instead (or in addition).
FIG. 10 shows an example of such an expanded index for the documents shown inFIG. 3 . As shown inFIG. 10 , the various compound terms, inflection sets, and orthographic variations are grouped together in the left-hand column of the index, and the documents that contain any term in the group are listed in the right-hand column. As shown inFIG. 11 , once the expanded index is generated (block 1102), user queries (block 1104) can be compared directly with the index (block 1106) without performing query expansion. Alternatively, some combination of index expansion and query expansion could be used. - Moreover, while many of the examples provided above have been in the context of the German language, it will be appreciated that the techniques that have been described are readily applicable to other languages as well. Each language has its own set of linguistic features that pose problems for search. Thus, to design a search engine for a given language, and/or a general-purpose search engine, an effort can be made to identify these problems and to address them. For example, random searches can be performed to see what search terms cause problems. The search terms can then be varied to see if improvements can be made. User sessions can also be analyzed to find patterns in users' searching behavior. For example, users may apply certain transformations to compensate for problematic aspects of the language. Once a set of problem areas are identified, work can be done to generate solutions. Potential solutions can be tested or simulated to determine their effectiveness and the amount of effort needed to implement them.
- While the preferred embodiments of the present invention are described and illustrated herein, it will be appreciated that they are merely illustrative and that modifications can be made to these embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, the invention is intended to be defined only in terms of the following claims.
