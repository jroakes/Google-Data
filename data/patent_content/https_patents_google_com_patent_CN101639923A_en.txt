The less content specific the node is, the less targeted the advertisement will be, and therefore, the less valuable the advertisement will be to the advertising entity. Targeted advertising tomultiple levels of content specific nodes is enabled.
Description
The application be that July 16, application number in 2003 are 03816821.9 the applying date, denomination of invention divides an application for the application for a patent for invention of " providing advertisement by the Internet ".
Technical field
The present invention relates to be used to the content-based system of coordination certain content node distribution formula on the Internet that the system and method for targeted advertisements is provided.
Background technology
Targeted advertisements is advertisement delivery and is the long-term objective of the company of advertisement paying.Advertisement is all very expensive in any medium.Therefore, company only is willing to usually to mean and may or serves interested individual colony with the advertisement paying of watching to the commodity of the said firm.
On the Internet, a kind of advertisement form is the paying arrangement to the Search Results in the search engine.In these systems, thereby advertiser can select to provide the different amount of money that advertisement is arranged in the Search Results for predetermined search word, and the Search Results that search engine returns will be paid the amount of money to advertiser's rank according to the advertiser that pays by predetermined search word.For example, if the consumer searches for " plane ticket " in paying list search engine, then produce course line tabulation, thereby the consumer can click tabulation and visit and this tabulation corresponding website with corresponding url list.Each advertiser relevant with tabulation pays the expense of certain amount of money for " click " that enter this advertiser website at every turn to search engine.Advertiser's title arrangement position in search result list is high more, and the URL (for example website) that enters this advertiser and provide might be provided the user more.Usually, the every click cost of advertising company is high more, and the tabulation of its company is more near the first place of Search Results.
Above-mentioned existing system allows certain target localization of advertising expenditure, but this type systematic can not provide other targeted advertisements mode on the Internet.
There are many shortcomings in existing system.
Summary of the invention
Embodiments of the present invention relate to the system in different stage mapping internet content zone (content node), the themes with content node at different levels specific advertisement.System provides the mechanism of advertisement user by the interface placing advertisement that allows, and the advertiser of interface permission expectation placing advertisement is from content nodes dynamic and at least two different stages of editor's control classification selection, so that advertisement packets is contained in these content nodes.The interface makes advertiser carry out the position in can the location advertising Ask-Bid System in content node and bids, and allows advertiser to specify different bid amount in the concrete rank of difference.For example, in the system that 5 node levels are provided, based on the selected node content and with the relation of the advertisement of being placed, advertiser may bid into: the location advertising Shi $0.10/ of each content node clicks in the system, the location advertising Shi $0.12/ of a two-level node clicks, the location advertising Shi $0.15/ of three grades of nodes clicks, and the location advertising Shi $0.17/ of a level Four node clicks, and the location advertising Shi $0.25/ of a Pyatyi node clicks.By advertiser can assigned address be bidded, and provide bigger specifics in different grain size (granularity) level, best advertising campaign can independently be selected by the performance of monitoring advertisement in the concrete level of difference by advertiser.Therefore, can increase or reduce, thereby provide tip heigh effective ad system in bid amount not at the same level.
So the content provider of system and participation is the mapping content node in some way, for the spectators of content node provide advertisement context view.System storage and keep content node that advertiser shines upon and the relation between the advertisement.
In an embodiment of the invention, based on gray selection, system is mapped to the content node classification with advertiser for the request of position, and it has the target level that increases progressively from general level to concrete webpage.Content node can be the concrete internet content or the grouping of any this content, comprises webpage, newsletter, chat, newsgroup, or any this analog derivative.Content node can have title, illustrate, depth level, rule, and with based on the degree of depth may concern as other content node of father node or child node.
The content node title can be to be used for determining the information that content area is comprised or the Short Description symbol of message type.Any father node title conceptive also can be the part of node title descriptor.For example, the title under father's content node " pet " is the content node of " vitamin ", and the title that is different under the father node " health " is the content node of " vitamin ".In a preferred embodiment, title can be writing a Chinese character in simplified form such as the naming system of the similar catalogue of " pet/vitamin " and " health/vitamin ".
The content node explanation is a long descriptor, helps to determine will appear at details where about the advertising listing that is mapped to this content node to advertiser.
Along with the increase of content node depth level, spectators' user interest location also strengthens.Usually, given depth is with reference to concrete title, but the number of depths of name and concrete title changes, and is determined by content detail and granularity that publisher provides.
Rule can be regarded as the abstract of any business rules, and it can be applicable to advertising listing is mapped to given content node.For example, for newsletter content node, system can implement a rule, requires advertiser at its account's Zhi Shaoyou $2000, thereby in this newsletter content node advertisement.If sell with every click cost, rule also can put teeth in the minimum purchase prices that Zhu Ru $0.5/ clicks.Rule also allows to inherit from father node.For example, do not allow when every click cost is less than or equal to every click cost of father node, to shine upon given content node.
A content node has definable relation for other content node: no matter it has father node, child node or fraternal content node.Must notice that the content node of the same degree of depth can have different set of relationship.For example, two fraternal content nodes (content node with same father's content node) can or cannot have child node independently.Should point out that this will make asymmetric content node classification become possibility.
Conceptive existence only is converted to the top-level root content node of general position request, and it is indefinite to be positioned at any concrete internet content except that language (being English).Top-level node allows the General Visitors of the Internet, advertiser location.Being mapped in top advertising listing can appear at simultaneously such as msn.com, on the site home page of yahoo.com and about.com.Top-level content nodes does not have father node.
Passage (channel) level node can be regarded as the content area of location a bit general.It is used for the most basic known interest and does not have the content area of detail.An example of channel level node is " bringing up and family ".In this kind situation, content area shows that the user has general interest to raising or family, and does not know other.Channel level content nodes has top-level node, also can further have the brotgher of node and child node.
Subject level node can be regarded as the object content zone.It is used for the internet content zone of known special interests.An example of subject level node is: " bringing up and family/pregnancy and production ", wherein " pregnancy and production " is the subject level node title, " bringing up and family " is the father, the channel level node title.In this kind situation, the content of subject level node is for " conceived and production " there being user's design of special interests.The advertiser that is mapped to this content node may expect advertisement is placed on subject matter level content nodes, thereby the terminal user of accessed this subject matter level content nodes watches.Subject matter level content nodes has father node, also has the brotgher of node and child node.
Document level nodes is defined as in the present embodiment content element of concrete location.File-level is used to locate real unique particular content.An example of file-level content node only navigates to specific URL, or particular news communication mail.An example of file-level content node is " bringing up and family/pregnancy and production/breast-feeding ", wherein " breast-feeding " is the actual headings of file-level content node, " conceived and production " is the father, the actual headings of subject content node, " bringing up and family " is the channel level content nodes title.For example, the advertiser that is mapped to this content node may expect, the breast-feeding page advertisement-printing in the pregnancy.about.com website.The file-level content node may not have child node, but the brotgher of node or father node can be arranged.
Obviously, in other embodiments, can have additional node level about the additional specificity of content.Native system allows placing advertisement on other node of different content specificity level, makes advertiser buy the commodity of institute's advertisement or the higher amount of money of advertisement payment of service for spectators have interest.In addition, content and commodity that provided and the comparatively irrelevant node of service also can be provided advertisement in advertiser, and the possibility that therefore produces sales volume is less.When placing advertisement is provided, give advertiser bigger dirigibility like this, make advertiser more can specifically locate its spectators.Usually, advertisement is positioned to become its buyer's spectators more, and advertiser can obtain more multivalence value more from its advertising fee.The present invention also has and allows advertiser extensively or the advantage of driftlessness ground releasing advertisements.Because it is less that this driftlessness advertisement produces the sales volume possibility, advertiser can be the low amount of money of its payment.
Internet advertising system is used for receiving from gray advertising message, thereby by the content-based hierarchy system issue of multinode, internet advertising system has mutual database server, receive advertising listing information from a plurality of advertiser users system that is connected to internet advertising system by the Internet, advertising listing information comprises ad title and URL, the selection of the one or more node levels relevant with advertising listing information, the bid amount of each selected node, the database of stores advertisements list information, send the NetWare file server of web page contents and advertising listing with a plurality of terminal users, send content and advertisement based on terminal user's selected node for requesting node in the multinode hierarchy system.The URL that is provided is according to the selection of the advertising listing of the webpage that sends to the terminal user, and appointment will send to terminal user's target web.NetWare file server is based on the rank of the advertising listing that specific node is relevant with higher level nodes therewith, for specific requesting node sends advertising listing.In order to ensure the quality of products control and guarantee certain relation between the related with it node of advertising listing and advertiser expectation, system can further provide the one group of rule that is applied to internet advertising system, it checks module application by rule, be used to determine whether the advertisement that is provided meets this group rule, if do not meet, this information is offered the refusal transport module, and its transmission is for any refusal information that does not meet the expection advertisement of this group rule.

Embodiment
The ad system that is provided allows advertiser to provide different bid amount on the different stage of the multistage hierarchy of certain content node.Though as described below, the user can be to the advertisement bidding based on keyword, this ad system makes advertiser can customize it in content-based system and bids and pay.For contextual purpose, Fig. 1 has described the example of the hierarchy of content node, though it is not the proprietary type of the applicable hierarchy system of embodiments of the present invention.
According to the described embodiment of Fig. 1, top-level node 100 is corresponding to the specificity rank such as the language of website text.For example, owing to thinking that the basketball advertisement publishing more likely produces sales volume at the Chinese webpage for the advertising audience than publication at English content field webpage, the advertiser of selling basketball can be from English, selects the English top-level node in the top-level node of Chinese and Spanish.As described later, should be understood that advertiser can be at all top-level node advertisement-printings, the every grade of difference of bidding.Though the user who is desirably in one or more content level nodes advertisement-printings usually can be each tabulation and selects a top-level node 100.For example, it is desirable to only use usually same language advertisement as content of pages for system.Therefore, it is that a top-level node 100 is selected in each tabulation that advertiser can be pointed out by system, or advertisement language.
Select to select based on this after the top-level node 100, be desirably in the user who more specifically locatees its spectators on one or more content nodes and can select channel level node 110, it further specifies the theme of expectation tabulation.For example, the advertiser of selling basketball can be from 110 motions of channel level node, health, selector channel level node 110 motions in amusement and the religion are because more may be correlated with for the spectators that its webpage spectators compare the religion content page in the basketball advertisement that has on the motion component webpage.Advertiser can be desirably in the channel level node health and also list advertisement, thereby makes the basket baller of recuperation can watch its advertisement.Though advertiser may think that the advertisement meeting that places healthy content attracts less spectators to click.Therefore, advertiser places the amount of money of the advertisement payment of healthy content page to be less than the advertisement that places the motion component webpage.
And, after the selector channel level node 110, select based on this, subject level node 120 can be selected by the advertiser that expectation uses coordination certain content node further to locate its spectators, it further specifies the theme of expectation tabulation, even further specified file level node 130.For example, the advertiser of selling basketball can be from subject level node 120 rugbies, and baseball is selected subject level node 120 basketballs in basketball and the football.And advertiser can be from document level nodes 130NBA, WNBA, and NCAA, rule, select File level node 130 equipment in statistics and the equipment are further located its spectators.Therefore, with respect to the document level nodes rule, advertiser is for to pay the more amount of money at first arrangement position of document level nodes equipment, because advertiser thinks, watches about the user of basketball device content and buys basketball than watching user about the basketball rules content more to have interest.
And advertiser can require first position of the All Files level node 130 of subject level node 120 basketballs.According to the embodiment of the present invention, advertiser can be this subject level node and bids.Therefore, provide an ad system, allow advertiser to bid in the proposition difference not at the same level of multistage content-based hierarchy system.
According to embodiments of the present invention shown in Figure 1, document level nodes 130 is the most concrete ranks in the hierarchy.But between top-level node 100 and document level nodes 130, there is any amount of additional specificity rank.According to the embodiment of the present invention, tabulate and just be stored in the relational database with respective directories once setting up.As those skilled in the art will recognize that also and can use other database structure, comprise OODB Object Oriented Data Base, flat file, chained list and other file layout.
For example, if expectation is sold the advertiser of basketball for placing document level nodes 130 equipment, subject level node 120 basketballs, 110 motions of channel level node, and the advertisement of top-level node 100 English payment Maximum Amount, tabulation can be stored as " English/motion/basketball/equipment/1 " (being relational database) in database.By finishing Fig. 2 to step shown in Figure 13, theme shown in Figure 1 can be selected by advertiser, or node, rank.

And ad system can make advertiser watch and edit any information that sends to ad system so far as requested.Therefore, Figure 13 is the Snipping Tool of presentation graphic user interface embodiment, makes advertiser can take " registering account " step 1300 according to the present invention, thereby in classification node advertisement.This step may be that tabulation 1300, the final chance of contact details 1320 or bill information 1330 are revised by advertiser.In a single day advertiser takes this step and register list, just according to the node structure advertisement in suitable document level listings.
Should be understood that advertiser can place a plurality of similar or identical advertisements at a plurality of different nodes of system, therefore make up to analyze the advertisement of determining in the multinode hierarchy system with tip heigh benefit for it offers an opportunity.For example, find to click and to click, can produce maximum ad clicks and/or obtain booming income by click at a specific document level nodes Jing Jia $0.50/ at channel level node Jing Jia $0.10/.
Provide Figure 14 how to issue with the advertisement of understanding placement like this.Figure 14 is the synoptic diagram of expression ad system, and advertiser can be according to the theme specificity rank advertisement on the certain content webpage that changes, for example by the described numerous embodiments of Fig. 2-Figure 13 thus.Many advertiser system 1410 can connect 1415 by http and be connected to the Internet, the visit ad system.Though can utilize aforesaid other safety practice, it can be safe connection (https) as requested that http connects 1415.Advertiser system 1410 can be by the database 1465 of database server 1425 access certain content.Thereby database server 1425 can provide the graphic user interface shown in the example embodiment that software operation alternatively provides Fig. 2-Figure 13, reception is from the content of graphic user interface, with content stores to database, provide then subsequently error message or suitable affirmation message.Database server also can based on shown in predetermined relationship between the graphic user interface page be user's page that sorts.The example how to realize is to be used to store the advertisement content Object table database 1435 relevant with content by the database server read-write.And database server 1425 makes advertiser can read rule table database 1430, and it provides the artificial system constraint about advertising listing.Artificial system constraint can be designed to can produce from commercial angle the rule of top gain.For example, based on user advertising and theme, but system's recommended advertisements combination is to maximize its advertising results.Should be understood that Figure 14 described be a NetWare file server, database server, content object table and rule list, but, can provide a plurality of these class objects for the extensibility and the optimization thereof of system operation.
When advertiser system 1410 is an advertising listing when bidding, this bids and is stored in the content object table database 1435.NetWare file server 1440 is regularly visited the advertisement that is stored in the content object table database 1435 by database server 1425, and with its write structure content data base 1465.
In addition, a plurality of terminal users 1445 can be connected to a plurality of issue co-workers by the Internet, thereby are connected to the content of the content-based hierarchy system of multinode.For example, the content-based hierarchy system of multinode can be expressed as the website, assignee for example of the present invention,
Www.about.com About.comAnd each co-worker of host computer system can participate in main frame, and some or all content of its website is provided.For example, expect the subject level node of issue about the website of women's problem about women's problem.So by the issue co-worker will be therewith the relevant advertisement of node and node content send to terminal user on the Internet.
In a single day ad system is received in the location advertising of specific node and bids, and ad system just can be with ad distribution to the certain content node.For example, advertising listing can be published to above-mentioned website.For example, document level nodes can comprise having the information content, link, picture, chat and other and subject matter level, the webpage of channel level and top relevant feature.Can be shown as some or all advertiser of this specificity rank placing advertisement in the webpage.Figure 15 is the Snipping Tool of expression about a document level nodes webpage of document level nodes.Webpage provides 3 highest bidder of this document level nodes, comprises the highest bidder of high one-level node.For example, a Guang Gaoshangjingjia $0.25 makes its advertisement place channel level, so its rank at each webpage shown in this channel level will be based on Jing Jia $0.25, unless it has higher (or lower) to bid for the specific webpage in this structure.
The URL of document level nodes can be presented at URL part 1510.For each content-based node, this URL can be unique, also can be expressed as relational directory fonnat.In the example shown in Figure 15, spectators' selector channel level node is brought up and family 1520, subject level node conceived and fertility 1530 and document level nodes breast-feeding 1540.Therefore, spectators receive the subject content 1550 of selected file level node, and in this situation, article title is " breast-feeding child's a benefit ".
Except receiving the subject content 1550 of selected file level node, spectators also receive 3 advertising listings, 1570,1580 and 1590.The advertiser of expectation sale B-P breast pump node location for this reason bids the highest.Therefore, this gray tabulation ranks the first.Advertising listing can comprise title 1555, " selling the B-P breast pump "; Illustrate 1560, " buying now ... the B-P breast pump is provided " in limited time; With demonstration URL 1565,
Www.b-p.com modelBShow that URL shows spectators and where will be redirected to if click advertising listing.In this example, advertiser's node location payment click for this reason of B-P breast pump is sold in expectation.And in the position 2 and the advertising listing 1580 of position 3 and 1590 pay less.Because spectators may become client, the advertiser of B-P breast pump can be ready that the primary importance bid of specific node is higher for this reason, but advertiser also can require to be reluctant in the position of no articulation point the same amount of money in the last position of Zhi Fuyu.
For example, for the present invention, same advertiser can place same advertising listing the node about conceived content, and payment is less than tabulation is placed node about the breast-feeding content.Figure 16 is that expression is arranged in the Snipping Tool about the subject matter specific nodes of pregnancy in the subject matter specific nodes structure according to the present invention.The URL at ad distribution place is presented at 1610.For each content-based node, this URL is unique, also can be expressed as relational directory fonnat.In the example shown in Figure 16, spectators' selector channel level node is brought up and family 1620, subject level node conceived and fertility 1630 and document level nodes pregnancy 1640.Therefore, spectators receive the subject content 1650 of selected file level node, are the ovulation calendar in this situation.
Except that the content 1650 that receives about conceived theme, spectators also receive 3 advertising listings, 1670,1680 and 1690.To bid be that $0.03/ clicks in the position of node for this reason in the advertiser that the B-P breast pump is sold in expectation.It is not the highest bid of this node location that $0.03/ clicks.Therefore, B-P breast pump tabulation 1690 does not rank the first.The position 1 of advertising listing and 2,1670 and 1680 bids are higher.
Therefore, ad system makes the advertiser can be for placing the advertisement paying of the page with certain content, and it is different from same advertisement is placed the usefulness that the page is paid with other subject content.Thereby advertiser is watched its advertising expenditure in the spectators that most possibly become the buyer.To make the advertisement variation like this, price is more reasonable, and is therefore favourable to advertiser.Ad system will allow more advertisers having the highest rank with the maximally related page of its sale.Therefore, more potential customers can watch advertisement, still less watch advertisement for the commodity of institute's advertisement and the uninterested spectators of service, therefore cost and the identical advertising fee of former system, and ad system of the present invention can be advertiser bigger sales volume is provided.
Though above description comprises details and feature, should to understand this details and feature and only be in order to illustrate, and should not be construed as restriction the present invention.Without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention the time, can carry out multiple modification to above-mentioned embodiment, be contained in following claims and legal equivalents thereof.
