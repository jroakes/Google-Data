Definitions
- the present invention is directed to a method for improving presentation of results of a search in a structured database. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a method for ranking the results of a search in a structured database and presenting the results in ranked order.
- Search engines for structured databases typically use conjunctive strategies for retrieving documents. For instance, if the search query includes two or more attribute/value pairs, then the search engine only returns those documents, or pointers to those documents, which satisfy all of the attribute/value pairs specified in the query. If one of the attribute/value pairs is not found in a given document, then that document is not considered to be a proper response to the query and is disregarded. As a consequence, the results to a search request can be somewhat limited in that the requester will only be provided documents that exactly match the search query.
- the present invention provides a method for presenting the results of a search in a structured database. More particularly, the present invention provides a method for ranking the results of a search of a structured database where a search query includes at least two attribute/value pairs.
- a search engine identifies each record from the structured database that minimally matches the search query. In a more specific embodiment the minimal match requires that the document or record include at least one of the attribute/value pairs in the search query. Having identified a plurality of records that minimally match the search query, each document or record is assigned a weight.
- the weight may have two components: a first component that is indicative of the extent to which the record matches the entire search query; and a second component that indicates the relative frequency with which an attribute/value pair that matches the record also matches the remaining records in the structured database.
- the embodiment then presents search results in an order according to the assigned weights.
- the method of the present invention avoids the necessity of finding a complete match between a search query and a document and presents search results in a fashion most easily used with the records most likely satisfying the search request being presented first.
- FIGS. 1A to 1E illustrate samples of records which may be searched in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of a system for conducting a search in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 provides a flow chart illustrating a process flow for implementing a method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
- a search engine identifies all documents or records in a structured database which minimally match a search query that includes two or more attribute/value pairs.
- a document that minimally matches the search query is one that includes at least one attribute/value pair from a plurality of attribute/value pairs found in the search query.
- the ranking process is based on a determination of the semantic difference between a given record and the complete search query.
- This semantic difference can be determined in a number of different ways.
- the semantic difference is constituted by two components. The first is a simple determination of the level of matching to the search query that depends on the number of matching attribute/value pairs found in the record as compared to the total number of such pairs in the search query. For instance, if the search query includes five attribute/value pairs and the document matches three such pairs then it would be placed into a matching level with all other documents including three matching attribute/value pairs.
- the second component of the semantic difference relates to the relative frequency with which a given attribute/value pair in a document appears throughout the database.
- a weight is assigned to each document at a certain matching level based on the relative frequency with which the attribute value pairs of that document can be found throughout the database.
- An example of a weight calculation will be described in more detail in the following.
- FIGS. 1A to 1E show samples of documents (also referred to as records) which may be of interest to a person generating a query in or across a structured database.
- Documents 100A and 100C are of the same basic format with attribute fields identifying a name, area code, telephone number and e-mail address.
- Documents 100B and 100D also are of similar format having attribute fields of name, street address, city, state, zip code and e-mail address.
- document 100E is a more complete document having attribute fields of name, street address, city, state, zip code, e-mail address, area code and telephone number.
- FIGS. 1A to 1D would be returned in response to such a query because each document is missing at least one attribute/value pair. For instance, FIGS. 1A and 1C fail to include the zip code attribute/value pair while FIGS.
- FIG. 3 A process flow describing how an embodiment of the present invention may be implemented is set forth in FIG. 3.
- the system receives a search request, step 300. This would correspond in the above example to the trio of attribute/value pairs.
- the process identifies each document that minimally satisfies the received request.
- a document that contains at least one attribute value pair of the plurality of attribute/value pairs defined in the search query minimally matches or minimally satisfies the received request.
- the present invention could be modified to require two or more attribute value pairs be found in a given document before it is considered to minimally satisfy the received request.
- all four documents of FIGS. 1A to 1D would be considered to minimally satisfy the search query in that all contain at least two attribute/value pairs of the three set forth in the search query.
- the process of the present invention determines the level of matching for each document in step 310.
- the present invention determines the number of attribute/value pairs from the search request that are found to be contained in the identified record or document.
- the level matching could however be even more sophisticated. For example, rather than consider all documents which match any two attribute/value pairs the system could be modified to attribute more significance to particular attribute/value pairs.
- the documents of the same level are referred to and the process determines the relative weight of each document of the same level, step 315.
- the relative weight of a given document within a particular level refers to the extent to which the attribute/value pair in the record that matches the search query appears throughout other documents in the structured database. As an example in a database which includes residential information for the entirety of the city of Washington, D.C., there are far more entries that match the attribute/value pair, zip code: 20011, than match the attribute/value pair name: Jones.
- This determination of the relative frequency of the match in the structured database forms the basis of the assignment of relative weights in step 315.
- the present invention ranked the documents based on the relative weight and level of matching, step 320.
- the results of the search are then presented in rank order, step 325.
- documents 100A to 100D each match two attribute/value pairs we will consider them to be at the same level of matching.
- documents 100A and 100C match the area code 202 which presently applies to the entirety of Washington, D.C., and therefore encompasses all of the zip codes of Washington, D.C., it would presumably appear more frequently as a matching attribute/value pair throughout the structured database than any document which includes the attribute/value pair, zip code: 20011. Therefore, documents 100B and 100D would be attributed a relative weight which causes them to be ranked ahead of documents 100A and 100C.
- search engine could present either the documents themselves or pointers to the documents or identifiers of the documents which would enable the search requester to retrieve copies of the documents.
- search results could take the form of a list of URLs for the documents or records which at least partially satisfy the search request, ranked in accordance with the method of the present invention.
- documents 100B and 100D are presented to the search requester, based on the present search query the documents may have similar weight and so the presentation of the documents to the user as could be done on an arbitrary basis.
- the search requester could select the document of higher interest based on the remaining attribute/value pairs which appear in the record.
- the requester would be able to select which of the two records 100B or 100D would be of most interest.
- the user may not be interested in either of these two documents even though they were ranked higher in the order of presentation. The user would then still be able to observe the content of records 100A and/or 100C since the search engine retrieved these documents as well even though they too were incomplete matches to the search query.
- the rank retrieval approach Given a query on a structured database specified by a set of attribute/value pairs AV, the rank retrieval approach would return those records that match any of the attribute/value pairs in AV with the semantic distance of the record to the attribute/value pairs in AV forming the basis for ordering the records in the answer set.
- a 1 , . . . A n be the attributes in the structured database with domains D 1 , . . . D n respectively, that is the values in attribute A i are from domain D 1 .
- f ij be the fraction of the total number of records in which value v j occurs in attribute A i .
- Each record r which is an element of R ends up with a non-negative weight and records are ranked in order of decreasing weight, that is records with a higher weight are presented before records with lower weight. It should be noted that -log f ij is just one choice for a weighting function.
- a processor 201 includes a search engine 201a.
- the processor can be coupled or connected to a display 210 and search query input device 209.
- the processor can be coupled to one or more databases 205 to 207.
- Each database is presumed to store a plurality of records or documents.
- the processor and the search engine can operate to search either one database or a plurality of databases in response to a given search query.
- the coupling to the databases could be by means of a network such as a packet switched network like the one commonly referred to as the Internet.
- the processor could constitute a node of the network and the display device 210 could be coupled to the processor via the same network or another network.
- the display could then be incorporated with processing capabilities for generating a search query for transmission to the processor.
- a typical device which would incorporate such a display would be a personal computer.
- the computer could be running a browser such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer or Netscape's Navigator.
- the present invention provides an improved searching scheme for finding relevant documents or records in a structured database and presenting them in a more useful way to the search requester.
