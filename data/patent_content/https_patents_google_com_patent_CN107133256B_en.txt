Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example communication system, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to fig. 1, a communication system 100 is shown. The communication system may include a content processing device 102, a communication network 130, and a plurality of data processing devices 110 in which the data processing devices 110a-110d are illustrated.
The content processing device 102 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, interfaces and/or code that may be operable to store content such as, for example, audio content, video content, book content and/or applications associated with multiple user accounts. For example, the content processing device 102 may be a content library server or a content library device. The content may be accessible from, for example, one or more of the plurality of data processing devices 110a-110 d. In an example embodiment of the present disclosure, the content processing device 102 may be operable to provide a list of items that may be customized or updated for each user account. The list of items may include, for example, content information along with update information associated with the content.
A data processing apparatus, such as data processing apparatus 110a, may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, interfaces and/or code that may be operable to process data or signals. The data processing device 110a is operable to communicate signals over the communication network 130. The data processing device 110 may include, for example, a smart phone, a mobile phone, a tablet, a PC, and/or other similar types of computing devices. In an example embodiment of the present disclosure, a data processing device 110a, which may be associated with a particular user account of the content processing device 102, is operable to receive a customized list of items from the content processing device 102, the customized list of items including content information along with corresponding update information.
The communication network 130 may comprise suitable logic, circuitry, interfaces, devices, and/or code that may be operable to provide data and voice communication services to various devices using various wireless and/or wired communication techniques. The communication network 130 may include, for example, the internet, a cellular network, and/or other multimedia networks. In an example embodiment of the present disclosure, the communication network 130 is operable to provide communication between the content processing device 102 and the plurality of data processing devices 110a-110 d.
In operation, the content processing device 102 is operable to analyze activity information associated with particular content identified in a content repository associated with a user account. One or more entities associated with particular content may be identified by the content processing device 102. In this regard, the particular content may include, for example, textual content, video content, and/or audio content. For example, the specific content may be a book, a movie, or a music album. An entity may include, for example, a thing, person, place, subject, or object that may be covered/included/referenced in the particular content. For example, a documentary entitled "processing orange juice" may include entities such as "orange," "orange juice," "orange yield," or "orange orchard" in the movie content. The activity information may include, for example, actions taken by a user of the user account and/or by someone who is socially networked or connected to the user. For example, the user may be socially networked or connected to friends via, for example, a social network. The activity information associated with the documentary entitled "orange juice" may include, for example, the user's interaction with the content repository for viewing portions (or no portions) of the documentary, the friend's interaction with the friend's content repository for viewing portions (or no portions) of the documentary, the user's or friend's recent search for articles related to "orange juice", the user's or friend's viewing of video clips related to "orange juice", the user's or friend's downloading/viewing/reading of content samples related to "orange juice", and/or the user's or friend's sharing of links/releases related to "orange juice".
The content processing device 102 may be operable to collect information about each of the identified one or more entities from various sources. For example, in the case of a documentary entitled "processed orange juice", the pertinent information may include, for example, news having a primary story on "orange juice production" in certain parts of the country this year. The content processing device 102 may be operable to determine update information for particular content based on one or both of the results of the analysis of the activity information and the collected information related to each of the identified one or more entities. For example, in the case of a documentary entitled "process orange juice", where the user may not have viewed movie content stored in the content repository and the friend may share a posting with the text "must view this movie", the determined updated information may include, for example, a posting by the friend with the text "must view this movie", and/or news with a primary story about "orange juice production" in certain parts of the country this year.
The content processing device 102 is then operable to add item information including the particular content, along with the determined update information, to a list of items associated with the user account based on one or more ranking factors. In this regard, the one or more ranking factors may include, for example, time of occurrence, entity identification, entity frequency, entity matching, interest level, cluster interest, and/or library activity. With respect to the time of occurrence, for example, news that occurred one hour ago (news such as "orange juice production") would be considered very recent. With respect to entity identification, various techniques for identifying entities shown at a given site may be utilized. For example, the entity may be able to be identified on a website page. For audio content, this entity identification can be done by making a transcript, and then running an analysis to identify the entity. With respect to entity frequency, the number of times a given entity appears in content can be analyzed. With respect to entity matching, an attempt may be made to match an entity (such as news) identified at a given location with an entity identified in particular content in the content store. For example, the entity "orange juice" identified in the documentary entitled "processed orange juice" may be matched with the entity "orange juice" in the "orange juice yield" news.
With respect to interest levels, interests may be identified explicitly or implicitly via a user based on activities, such as consumed content and actions taken within or outside of a content library. For example, a user may publish content about the entity "orange juice", may search for the past entity "orange" and consume (e.g., read/purchase/interact with) articles about "orange juice". Recent interests based on recent activities may tend to be weighted higher. For example, news that is not recent but is considered very interesting based on user activity or interaction may still be selected to show. The long-term interests may include interests that the user has consistently over time. For example, a user may search for objects related to "orange" every day for the past 2 years. Regarding cluster interests, it may make sense to consider interests related to each other together. For example, "orange" may be associated with an entity (e.g., a company) that provides orange juice, and "orange" may also be associated with an entity (e.g., a location) in which the orange is grown. With respect to library activities, for example, a user may have recently clicked on to access (e.g., to play) a particular content such as a documentary movie entitled "process orange juice", the user may have shared content (e.g., links or releases) to someone else or the public, the user may have viewed a given proportion of the total content (such as 3% of the playing time of a documentary entitled "process orange juice") one month ago, the user may have viewed a particular content multiple times such as viewing 3% but viewing that portion 100 times due to a very long bar of view of "orange orchard", and/or the user may have viewed a video clip related to such as "orange farmer" describing the harvesting process.
Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example content processing device, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to fig. 2, a content processing device 102 is shown. Content processing device 102 may include, for example, library customization module 202, processor 208, and memory 210.

In operation, the library customization module 202 in the content processing device 102 is operable to analyze activity information associated with particular content identified in a content library associated with the user account, such as the content library 206 a. One or more entities associated with the particular content may be identified by the library customization module 202. The library customization module 202 may be operable to collect information about each of the identified one or more entities from various sources. The library customization module 202 may be operable to determine updated information for the particular content based on one or both of the results of the analysis of the activity information and the collected information related to each of the identified one or more entities. The library customization module 202 may then be operable to add the item information including the particular content, along with the determined update information, to an item list associated with the user account, such as item list 207a, based on one or more ranking factors. In this regard, the item list 207a may be generated and customized by the library customization module 202 for the content library 206a associated with the user account.
The processor 208 in the content processing device 102 is operable to receive an indication from a data processing device, such as the data processing device 110a, to access the content repository 206a associated with the user account. The processor 208 is then operable to communicate the customized project list 207a to the data processing device 110a as a content consumption interface for the user account based on the indication.
Fig. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example data processing apparatus displaying a list of items, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to fig. 3, a data processing apparatus 110a is shown. The data processing device 110a may be described, for example, with reference to fig. 1. The scenario depicted in fig. 3 is provided by way of illustration and not limitation.
In an example operation, the data processing device 110a, which may be associated with the user account, is operable to communicate an indication to the content processing device 102 to access the content repository 206 a. For example, a user may log into the user account via the data processing device 110a for interaction with the content repository 206 a. The data processing device 110a may then receive the list of items 207a associated with the content repository 206 a. The item list 207a may comprise, for example, item information comprising the content 301-.
In example embodiments of the present disclosure, update information 311 may include, for example, information about one or more particular pages in the textual content, such as content 301, that may reference one or more identified entities. In an example scenario, a famous inventor awarded honor at anniversary due to breakthrough progression may be identified in recent news and note that the inventor is referred to certain pages on textual content 301 (e.g., a book) that the user has not yet read. In this case, the identified entity associated with the text content 301 (this book) may be the name of the inventor. For example, based on many published articles, news stories about the inventor may be so important that the item information of the textual content 301 may be ranked at or near the top of the list of items 207a, even though the user has not interacted with the inventor to express interest.
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating example steps for a customized content consumption interface, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to fig. 4, the exemplary steps begin at step 401. In step 402, the library customization module 202 in the content processing device 102 is operable to analyze activity information associated with particular content, such as content 301 identified in a content library associated with a user account, such as the content library 206 a.
