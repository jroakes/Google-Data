Definitions
- Embodiments of this invention relate generally to microb logging and, more particularly, to special purpose machines, systems, methods and computer instructions for associating microposts with geographic locations.
- Microblog services provide a broadcast medium that enables users to exchange small elements of content in the form of microposts that include short sentences, messages, video links, or the like.
- services such as Twitter
- Tets short messages
- social networking sites such as Google+
- users include certain tokens in their microposts.
- tokens may include words, phrases, symbols or the like that are intended to associate the micropost with a given thing (e.g., an entity, location, event, subject, or the like).
- a micropost may include a hashtag (denoted by a "#" followed by keyword or phrase) that is associated with a given entity, location, event, or the like.
- a user may, for example, include the hashtag "#qpr" within a micropost to associate the micropost with the Queens Park Rangers soccer team.
- Such tokens may enable simplified categorizing of microposts. For example, a user may simply click a hashtag of a micropost to access other microposts that include the same hashtag.
- microblog services provide for the exchange of short elements of information, they may only provide a limited amount of information about users, locations, events or the like associated with the microposts. For example, although a user may be able to quickly access a large number of microposts about an event by simply clicking on a hashtag,
- microposts may not be aware of tokens that are related to their microposts and, thus may not make use of them.
- a user's micropost may not be categorized with related microposts due to the fact it does not contain a corresponding token.
- a computer- implemented method that includes receiving microposts including tokens, identifying a subset of the microposts that include a given token, determining a geographic location corresponding to the subset of the microposts that include the given token, associating the given token with the geographic location, and updating an index to reflect an association between the given token and the geographic location.
- a non-transitory computer readable medium having program instructions stored thereon that are executable by a processor to cause the following steps: receiving microposts including tokens, identifying a subset of the microposts that include a given token, determining a geographic location corresponding to the subset of the microposts that include the given token, associating the given token with the geographic location, and updating an index to reflect an association between the given token and the geographic location.
- a system including one or more memories storing instructions, and one or more processors coupled to the one or more memories and configured to execute the instructions stored thereon to perform the following steps: receiving microposts including tokens, identifying a subset of the microposts that include a given token, determining a geographic location corresponding to the subset of the microposts that include the given token, associating the given token with the geographic location, and updating an index to reflect an association between the given token and the geographic location.
- FIG. 1 is a flowchart that illustrates a method of associating a microblog token with a geographic location in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a table that illustrates a log of received microposts in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 3 is a table that illustrates a subset of microposts associated with a token in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 is a table that illustrates a token-location index in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart that illustrates a method of providing a suggested token to be included in a micropost in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary microblog environment in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- FIG. 7 is a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary computer system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- a "micropost” may refer to content posted via a microblog service.
- a micropost may include, for example, short messages (e.g., a "Tweet", a social network status update, or the like) that is generated by an entity (e.g., a user, business or the like), and is broadcast to other entities (e.g., followers, subscribers, friends, or the like) that have expressed an interest in receiving content generated by the entity.
- a micropost may include a limited amount of content (e.g., up to about 150 characters).
- a micropost may be associated with one or more tokens.
- a token may be contained in, or otherwise associated with, the micropost that is intended to associate the micropost with a given thing (e.g., an entity, location, event, subject, or the like).
- a token may include a hashtag denoted by a "#" followed by keyword or phrase
- a micropost may include the hashtag "#qpr" (which is associated with the Queens Park Rangers soccer team) to associate the micropost with the Queens Park Rangers soccer team.
- Microposts that include, or are otherwise associated with, a similar hashtag may be categorized together. In some instances, a user may simply click a hashtag in a micropost to access other microposts in the same category (e.g., that include the same hashtag).
- a micropost may be associated with geographic location (“geolocation") information.
- a micropost that is generated using an electronic device such as a cellular phone, may be "geo-tagged" with information indicative of a geolocation of the electronic device at or near a time of generating the micropost.
- Geo-tagging a micropost may include adding geolocation metadata (e.g., geographic coordinates) to the micropost or otherwise associating geolocation metadata with the micropost.
- a geo- tagged micropost generated using a mobile phone may include the micropost content and a geo- tag that includes geographic coordinates indicative of a geolocation of the mobile phone at or near a time the micropost is generated by the user.
- geolocation information associated with microposts is used to identify one or more geolocations to be associated with a micropost token. For example, if a large number of microposts are generated that include the hashtag "#qpr" and that are geo-tagged with location information corresponding to Loftus Road Stadium in London, the hashtag "#qpr" may be associated with the geolocation of Loftus Road Stadium.
- a geolocation identified as being associated with a given token is used to provide suggested tokens to be associated with a micropost. For example, where a user is generating a micropost while standing near Loftus Road Stadium, the user's proximity to Loftus Road Stadium may be identified, and the user may be prompted with the suggested hashtag "#qpr". Such suggested tokens may apprise users of tokens that they are not aware of and/or may enable a user to add a hashtag to a micropost quickly and easily.
- an entity associated with a given token is associated with the identified geolocation. For example, where the hashtag "#qpr" is associated with a soccer match that is played by the Queens Park Rangers soccer team, the soccer match is associated with the
- Such an association can be used to extract location information for an event that may otherwise be unavailable. For example, where a soccer match played by the Queens Park Rangers soccer team is not publicized, a geolocation for the match can be identified based at least in part on geolocation information obtained in association with microposts that include the hashtag "#qpr".
- the location of a user can be identified based at least in part on their submission of a micropost that includes a given token and the given token being associated with a location. For example, where the hashtag "#qpr" is associated with the location of Loftus Road Stadium, a user that generates a micropost that includes the hashtag "#qpr” may be associated with the location of Loftus Road Stadium. Such an association can be used to determine a location of the user. Such information can be used in the context of personalizing search results.
- FIG. 1 is a flowchart that illustrates a method 100 of associating a microblog token with a geolocation in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- Method 100 may generally include receiving microposts that include microblog tokens, identifying a subset of the received microposts that include a given microblog token, identifying a geolocation corresponding to the subset of microposts, and associating the given microblog token with the geolocation identified.
- Method 100 may include receiving microposts that include microblog tokens ("tokens"), as depicted block 102.
- receiving microposts that include tokens includes receiving one or more microposts from one or more users.
- a microblog server e.g., microblog server 602
- the submitted microposts may be received and collected by the microblog server.
- the microblog server may store a log of the received microposts in a database.
- at least some of the microposts received include microblog tokens associated therewith.
- at least some of the microposts generated by the users may include one more hashtags embedded in the content of the micropost.
- FIG. 2 is a table that illustrates a log 200 of received microposts 202 in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- the illustrated portion of index 200 includes nine microposts 202 that each includes an identifier, an author, a time, a location (if available) and corresponding micropost content.
- the identifier may uniquely identify the respective micropost relative to the other microposts of log 200.
- the author may include an identifier that is indicative of the entity that generated the corresponding micropost.
- the author may include a user name (e.g., a screen name) that is associated with a microblog account used to generate the corresponding micropost.
- Time may include a timestamp that is indicative of a time when the corresponding micropost was generated.
- the author's consent is required to use the author's location information to geotag the micropost.
- the author's consent is required to store information linking the author to a particular time and location corresponding to the micropost, or to share that information with other users.
- log 200 may only store the micropost identifier, the time and the location of the micropost.
- the location may be indicative of a location from which the corresponding micropost is generated.
- the location may be derived from geolocation data provided in association with the corresponding micropost. For example, where a user submits a micropost from a mobile electronic device having a global positioning (GPS) device integrated therein, using the GPS device, the mobile electronic device may determine its geographic coordinates at or near the time of the user generating the micropost, and may geo-tag the micropost with geolocation metadata that includes the geographic coordinates.
- GPS global positioning
- the microblog server determines the corresponding location based at least in part on the geolocation metadata.
- any suitable locating techniques may be employed to determine the location information.
- the location of the electronic device at or near the time of generating the micropost may be derived using triangulation locating techniques, using internet-protocol (IP) locating techniques (e.g., IP lookup tables), and/or the like.
- IP internet-protocol
- the illustrated locations are denoted as "LN" for illustrative purposes, each of the denoted locations may be representative of any variety of location data, such as geographic coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates).
- location e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates.
- location information is available for some microposts, whereas location information may not be available for other microposts.
- location information has been identified for each of the first eight microposts (e.g., microposts 1-8), whereas location information has not been identified for the ninth micropost (e.g., micropost 9).
- the micropost content may include the text string of the corresponding micropost.
- the microposts may have one or more tokens (e.g., hashtags) embedded within their content, whereas other microposts do not.
- each of the microposts 1 and 3-9 have a hashtag (e.g., "#qpr" or "#olympics") embedded within their content, whereas the micropost 2 does not.
- Method 100 may include identifying a subset of microposts that include a given microblog token, as depicted at block 104.
- identifying a subset of microposts that include a given microblog token includes identifying a given token and filtering the received micropost to identify a subset of the received microposts that each include or are otherwise associated with the given token.
- the microblog server may identify the hashtag "#qpr" as a token of interest, and identify a subset of micropost of log 200 that have the substring "#qpr" embedded within their content.
- the subset of microposts is limited to microposts that occur within a given period of time.
- the subset may include only microposts that have time stamps indicative of them being generated within the last two hours.
- a timeframe of two hours is provided for illustrative purposes, although any suitable timeframe may be used (e.g., ten minutes, thirty minutes, one hour, five hours, twenty- four hours, week, and so forth).
- FIG. 3 is a table that illustrates a subset 300 of microposts associated with the hashtag "#qpr" in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- subset 300 includes microposts 202 submitted in the last two hours that have the substring "#qpr" embedded within their content, and excludes micropost entries 202 that were generated more than two hours prior or do not have the substring "#qpr" embedded within their content.
- each of the micropost 1 (which was has a time that indicates it was generated more than two hours prior), the micropost 2 (which does not include a hashtag), and the micropost 6 (which includes the hashtag "#olymipics", but does not include the hashtag "#qpr”) are excluded
- subset 300 includes six microposts for illustrative purposes, it will be appreciated that a subset can include any number of microposts that satisfy the filtering criteria (e.g., that are associated with the token of interest and generated in the specified timeframe).
- Method 100 may include identifying one or more geolocations corresponding to the subset of microposts including the given token, as depicted at block 106.
- identifying one or more geolocations corresponding to the subset of microposts is based at least in part on the location information associated with the subset of microposts.
- one or more geolocations may be identified for the subset 300 based at least in part on locations L1-L5, L7, L8 and so forth.
- the one or more locations are identified using a clustering technique. For example, a dbscan, or similar, clustering algorithm can be used to identify one or more cluster locations based on the locations L1-L5, L7, L8 and so forth.
- a location may not be identified as a result of the assessment. For example, where the locations L1-L5, L7, L8 and so forth are wide spread and do not have an identifiable density in a given location, the clustering algorithm may not identify a location to be associated with subset 300.
- a single location may be identified as a result of the assessment. For example, where the locations L1-L5, L7, L8 and so forth have an identifiable density about in a single location, the clustering algorithm may identify the single location for association with subset 300. Such a single location may be identified, for example, where an event, such as a soccer match, has a single venue.
- a clustering algorithm may identify a location "L9" that corresponds to the geolocation of Loftus Road Stadium.
- multiple locations may be identified as a result of the assessment.
- the clustering algorithm may identify the two or more locations for association with subset 300. Multiple locations may be identified, for example, where an event, such as the Olympic Games, has multiple venues.
- application of a clustering algorithm may identify a location "L10” that corresponds to the geolocation of the Olympic swimming facility and a location "Ll l” that corresponds to the geolocation of the Olympic track and field facility.
- the step of identifying one or more geolocations corresponding to a subset of microposts including the given token may only be completed where the subset meets one or more threshold criteria.
- the step of identifying one or more geolocations corresponding to the subset of microposts including the given token may be taken if some or all of the following conditions are met: (1) the subset of microposts includes at least a threshold number of microposts (n); (2) the subset of microposts includes at least a threshold number of microposts that include location information (p); and (3) the subset of microposts includes at least a threshold number of unique authors (q).
- the illustrated subset 300 includes at least six microposts (e.g., microposts 3-5 and 7-9), at least five unique authors (e.g., alex, jane, john l, josh, and qpr_player), and at least five micropost having location information (e.g., L3, L4, L5, L7 and L8).
- microposts e.g., microposts 3-5 and 7-9
- unique authors e.g., alex, jane, john l, josh, and qpr_player
- micropost having location information e.g., L3, L4, L5, L7 and L8.
- subset 300 may meet the threshold criteria, and the subset may be assessed as discussed above (e.g., via application of a clustering algorithm) in an attempt to identify one or more geolocations corresponding to subset 300.
- exemplary threshold criteria is provided for illustrative purposes, and may include any suitable values and combinations of criteria.
- Method 100 may include associating the given token with the one or more geolocations identified, as depicted at block 108.
- associating the given token with the one or more geolocations identified includes updating an index to reflect the identified association between the given token of interest and the one or more geolocations identified. For example, where the geographic location L9 is identified based at least in part on subset 300 which includes of microposts associated with the hashtag "#qpr", a token location index may be updated to reflect the association between the hashtag "#qpr" and the location L9.
- FIG. 4 is a table that illustrates a token-location index 400 in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- a first entry of index 400 reflects an association between the hashtag "#qpr" and the location L9.
- the location L9 is a token-location index 400 in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- index 400 may correspond to the geo location of Loftus Road Stadium in London. Further, a second entry of index 400 reflects an association between the hashtag "#olympic" and the locations L10 and Ll l . As noted above, the location L10 and Ll l may correspond to the geo locations of an Olympic swimming facility and an Olympic track and field facility, respectively. Index 400 may be stored (e.g., in a database 610 of a microblog server 602) for reference.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart that illustrates a method 500 of suggesting a token to be included in a micropost in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.
- Method 500 may include receiving user input relating to generation of a micropost, as depicted at block 502.
- a user may open a microblog application on a mobile device and select an option to generate a micropost, or even begin to enter content of a micropost in an input field of the microblog application.
- the user input, or at least an indication of the user input, may be relayed to the microblog server.
- the microblog server may, then, identify a location associated with the user, as depicted at block 504.
- the location of the user may be determined using any suitable techniques, such as assessment of geolocation metadata (e.g., geo-tag data), triangulation locating techniques, internet-protocol (IP) locating techniques (e.g., IP lookup tables), and/or the like.
- IP internet-protocol
- the microblog server may identify the geolocation L12 as the location of the user.
- Method 500 may include identifying a token associated with the identified geolocation, as depicted at block 506.
- identifying a token associated with the identified geolocation includes identifying one or more tokens that are associated with a location that is proximate to the identified location of the user.
- the microblog server may assess token-location index 400 to identify tokens corresponding to locations that fall within a threshold distance of the identified location LI 2. Referring to the token location index of FIG. 4, where a threshold distance of one kilometer is specified, and location L12 is within one kilometer of location L9, the hashtag "#qpr" may be identified as a token associated with the identified location. As a further example, where a threshold distance of two kilometers is
- the location L12 is within two kilometers of location L9, and the location L12 is within two kilometers of at least one of locations "L10" or "Ll l", the hashtags "#qpr" and "#olympics" may both be identified as tokens associated with the identified location.
- the user's consent to use the user's location information is required.
- the user can consent to using the user's current location to suggest a micropost token.
- the user's consent can also be required to use the user's current location to refine the location associated with the micropost token.
- the user's consent can be required to store the user's current location with the micropost token identifier in log 200.
- the user's consent can also be required to store the user's identifier and location with the token identifier in log 200, or to share the user's stored location information with other users who view the micropost.
- Method 500 may include providing a suggested token for inclusion with the micropost, as depicted at block 508.
- providing a suggested token for inclusion with the micropost may include providing one or more of the identified tokens for use in the micropost.
- a display of the electronic device may include a field for entering the micropost content along with a user selectable option to include one or both of the hashtags "#qpr" and "#olympics".
- a user may simply select one or more of the hashtags to include it within their micropost.
- the identified token(s) may be used to provide an auto-complete feature for entering hashtags.
- the hashtag “#qpr” may be auto-populated into the field such that the user does not have to enter the entirety of the hashtag.
- a thing, such as an event, that is associated with a token may be associated with a location that corresponds to the token. For example, where a soccer match is associated with the hashtag "#qpr" and the location L9 has been identified as corresponding to the hashtag "#qpr", the soccer match may be associated with the location L9.
- an index may be updated to reflect the association between the thing and the location. For example, an event-location index (e.g., stored in database 610 of a microblog server 602) may be updated to include an entry that reflects the soccer match being located at location
- Such an association may be used to identify and provide location information that may not otherwise be available.
- a search sever e.g., search server 602b
- Such an event-location index can provide a historical log of the locations of event that are not well publicized.
- a user that provides a token in a micropost is associated with a location that corresponds to the token. For example, where a user submits a micropost that includes the hashtag "#qpr" and the location L9 has been identified as corresponding to the hashtag "#qpr" (e.g., as discussed herein), the user may be associated with the location L9.
- user consent is required to associate the user with the location associated with the micropost token.
- an index may be updated to reflect the association between the user and the location. For example, a user-location index (e.g., stored in database 610 of a microblog server 602) may be updated to include an entry that reflects the user being located at location L9.
- Such an association may be used to identify locations which can be used to provide personalized content to users. For example, where a user submits a micropost that includes the hashtag "#qpr" from their electronic device and the user subsequently submits a search query for "hotels" from the electronic device, the search server (e.g., server 602b) may determine that the user is located at location L9 based on an assessment of the user-location index, and may identify and rank a set of search results based on the user's being associated with the location L9. Where L9 is located in London, for example, the search results for hotels in the London area may receive a boost in ranking.
- L9 is located in London
- the search results for hotels in the London area may receive a boost in ranking.
- embodiments may incorporate any variety of techniques to protect the identity of users. For example, the name of the author may not be collected, or if collected, may be anonymized to
- the data that is obtained may be subject to a retention policy that responsibly expunges data once it has been used for processing.
- the micropost may be expunged after a specified timeframe has passed (e.g., two hours), or once the data has been processed and the information of interest has been extracted.
- author or user consent is required to collect information such as location information from the author or user. If the author or user does not provide consent to use their location information, certain functionality describe herein (e.g., personalized search results) may be unavailable to such persons.
- Methods 100 and 500 are exemplary embodiments of methods that may be employed in accordance with techniques described herein. Methods 100 and 500 may be modified to facilitate variations of its implementations and uses. The order of the steps of methods 100 and 500 may be changed, and various elements may be added, reordered, combined, omitted, modified, etc. Methods 100 and 500 may be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination thereof. Some or all of methods 100 and 500 may be implemented by one or more of the modules/applications described herein, such as microblog processing module 612a, search module 602b, and/or applications 608 depicted and described in more detail below with regard to microblog environment 600 of FIG. 6.
