In some implementations, content data base 130 can comprise the entity data bak of the mapping of the relation comprised between entity etc.In some implementations, entity is the theme of delivering a speech.In some implementations, entity be people, place, concept and/or can be quoted by text chunk (such as word or phrase) and the things of mutually difference (such as based on context).Such as, inquiry or webpage in text " bush " multiple entity can be quoted potentially, such as President George Herbert Walker Bush, President George Walker Bush, shrub (shrub) and rock band Bush.In some implementations, can by being used for identifying the sole entity identifier reference entity of entity.Sole entity identifier can be associated with entity and/or with one or more attributes that other entities are associated.Such as, in some implementations, one or more entity data bak can comprise the attribute be associated with the unique identifier of one or more entity.Such as, for each in multiple entity, can mapping (such as, the data of definition association) in entity data bak between identified entities and one or more attribute and/or other entities relevant with entity.Such as, the unique identifier for the entity be associated with " LAX " can be associated with the entity type attribute " airport " in the title of " Los Angeles International Airport " or alias property " LAX ", another alias property (usually quoting the alternative title of LAX), phone number property, address properties and/or entity attribute database.In addition and/or alternative attribute can be associated with the entity in one or more databases of such as entity data bak.Such as, as said, entity can be associated with one or more entity class.Such as, the entity be associated with the city of san francisco in California can be associated with entity class " city ", " large cities ", " cities in California " and " cities with a bay ".
In this manual, word " database " will be widely used for the set referring to any data.The data of database do not need with any ad hoc fashion structuring or not structuring and one or more positions that can store on a storage device completely.Thus, such as, database can comprise multiple set of data, differently can organize and access each data acquisition.
In some implementations, content data base 130 can comprise quoting of the Search Results of the search inquiry of first submit and/or the inquiry of first submit.Such as, user can by being directly submitted to search engine 125 by inquiry or being supplied to the query suggestion of user in the partial query submitted to by user by Response to selection, submit Query " restaurants in San Francisco ".Submitted to inquiry " restaurants in San Francisco " can be stored in content data base 130.
In some implementations, template generator 115 can based on such as determining query template from one or more inquiries of the inquiry of content data base.In some implementations, can based on determining that the multiple queries meeting query template determines query template.In some implementations, query template can be determined from single query.Such as, template generator can identify inquiry " bike shops in san diego ".Then query template can be determined as the inquiry of the word " bike shops in " of the additional word " san diego " of the member of entity class [city] based on comprising.In some implementations, template generator 115 can access queries and entity map, as said, determine additional word " san diego " with and the entity that is associated of the Diego California in California be associated.In some implementations, template generator 115 access entity mapping can determine that the entity be associated with the Diego California in California is the member of entity class [city] further.Therefore, query template " bike shops in [city] " can be determined.In some implementations, query template can be constructed by user and according to one or more technology rank described herein.
In some implementations, template generator 115 can identify one or more inquiry from content data base 130 and determine whether inquiry conforms to query template.The determination of the multiple templates conformed to query template can be utilized to determine query template and/or to determined query template rank.In some implementations, the inquiry identified by template generator 115 can be by the inquiry of the first submit of one or more user.If multiple queries shares the one or more coupling words except one or more words of the member as entity class, multiple queries can be defined as conforming to query template by template generator 115.As said, the coupling of word can comprise the exact matching of word and/or the soft coupling of word.Such as, template generator 115 can identify inquiry " bike shops in san diego ", " bike shops in los angeles " and " bike shops in louisville " from content data base 130.Based on being included in then as all inquiries of the common word " bike shops in " of the one or more additional word of the member of entity class " city ", can determine that inquiry conforms to query template.Therefore, immediately preceding inquiry conforms to query template " bike shops in [city] ".
In some implementations, template generator 115, when determining whether one or more inquiry meets query template, can ignore one or more word, such as stop word (such as " a ", " of " and " in ").Such as, template generator 115 can determine " bike shops in los angeles ", " bike shops in san diego " and " bike shops around louisville " meet query template " bike shops in [city] ".In some implementations, template generator 115 can be ignored in the inquiry of first submit between word blank and/or lack space between word.Such as, can determine that " bikeshops in losangeles " and " bike shops san diego " meets query template " bike shops in [city] ".In some implementations, the inquiry comprising the coupling word being in diverse location can be defined as meeting the inquiry of query template by template generator 115.Such as, template generator 115 can determine that " bike shops los angeles " and " san diego bike shops " meets query template " bike shops [city] " and/or query template " [city] bike shops ".In some implementations, the one or more words criterions of inquiry can be become determine to inquire about whether to meet standard tense in query template and/or plural form by template generator 115.Such as, template generator 115 can be determined " flows west mississippi river " and " flowing west ohio river " has common word " flow west " and/or " flowing west ", and determines that they meet query template " flow west [river] ".And such as, template generator 115 can be determined " lakes near detroit " and " lake near chicago " has common word " lake near ", and determine that they meet query template " lake near [city] ".
In some implementations, determining in the degree of conformity with query template, can not revise otherwise and/or can be able to be one or more words of stop word by specification.Whether revising one or more word can based on the grammer such as inquired about and/or semantic attribute and/or in response to inquiring about the search result document returned.Such as, " rivers near ohio " and " river ohio " can not be identified as meeting query template, because the possible implication of inquiry is different, such as " rivers near ohio " is as the inquiry of the document returned about the river near Ohio, and " river ohio " is as the inquiry of the document returned about river, Ohio.
As described in, template generator 115 can determine that the one or more words in identified inquiry are as determining whether identified inquiry meets the word of the member of the entity class in query template.Such as, template generator 115 can determine that " los angeles " is the word of the another name of member as entity class " city ".And such as, " san diego " can be identified as the word of the another name of the member as entity class " city " by template generator 115.In some implementations, template generator 115 can via the word of the database identification of such as content data base 130 as the given inquiry of the member of given entity class.Such as, in some implementations, database can comprise and mapping for the inquiry of multiple queries and entity.For each inquiry, query entity maps can by query mappings to one or more entity of being associated of inquiry and/or the one or more words inquired about to be mapped to the one or more entities be associated with such a or multiple word.Mapping between inquiry and one or more entity can comprise the determination of one or more entity based on the search result document such as in response to inquiry.Such as, for inquiry " battleship movie ", can determine mainly to concentrate on the entity that is associated with film " Battleship " in response to the search result document of this inquiry.Mapping between inquiry " battleship movie " and the entity be associated with film " Battleship " can based on such determination.
Such as, inquiry " battleship gross sales " can be mapped to the entity be associated with film " Battleship ".Can determine that word " Battleship " is the another name of the entity be associated with film " Battleship " and determine that the entity be associated with film " Battleship " is the member of entity class [films] by reference entity database.Therefore, can determine that the word " Battleship " inquired about in " battleship gross sales " is the member of entity class [films].Based on such determination, can determine that inquiry " battle ship gross sales " meets query template " [film] total sales ".And, such as, inquiry " board game battleship " can be mapped to the entity be associated with Trivial Pursuit Unhinged " Battleship ".Can determine that word " Battleship " is the another name of the entity be associated with Trivial Pursuit Unhinged " Battleship " by reference entity database, and determine that the entity be associated with Trivial Pursuit Unhinged " Battleship " is the member of entity class [board game].Therefore, can determine that " Battleship " inquired about in " board game battleship " is the member of entity class [board game].Based on such determination, can determine that inquiry " board game battleship " meets query template " board game [board game] ".It should be noted that in some implementations, word " Battleship " in inquiry " board game battleship " will not be confirmed as the member of entity class [film], because inquiry " board game battleship " can not be mapped to the entity be associated with film " Battleship ".
In some implementations, whether the one or more words such as in determining to inquire about are the realizations utilizing query entity to map in the word of the member of entity class, only can utilize that to be mapped in the entity of inquiry one or more.Such as, in example above, inquiry " board game battleship " can be mapped to the entity be associated with film " Battleship ", but to can be associated with relative weak rank with the mapping of the entity that film is associated (such as, reflect in response to this inquiry with the relative low importance of the Search Results that this film is associated).In some implementations, only can utilize and be mapped to this inquiry and the entity be at least associated with threshold value rank.In some implementations, the highest rank entity being mapped to this inquiry can only be utilized.
In some implementations, determining whether the one or more words in identified inquiry are in the word of the member of entity class, can directly with reference to the list of the word be associated with entity class.Such as, the database of such as content data base 130 can comprise multiple entity class, and the list of word for the member as this entity class of each entity class.If given inquiry packet is containing the word being mapped to entity class, is determining whether this given inquiry meets in query template, can determine that this word is the member of this entity class.In some implementations, must determine that the word inquired about is mapped to entity class and this inquiry is mapped to the entity be included in entity class (such as mapping via query entity).In some implementations, template generator 115 by identifying the another name being mapped to the entity of the same alike result indicating given classification, can determine the word of the member as entity class.Such as, template generator 115 can be all the another name of the entity being mapped to entity attribute [city] based on " los angeles " and " san diego ", determines that " los angeles " and " san diego " belongs to entity class [city].In some implementations, template generator 115 can determine that the another name of entity belongs to multiple entity class.Such as, " los angeles ", " san diego " and " louisville " can be the another names of entity class " city ", and " los angeles " and " san diego " can be the another name of entity class " California cities ", and the another name of " louisville " can not be mapped to " California cities " that entity is associated.
In some implementations, template generator 115 can determine the rank of determined query template.Rank instruction is at the serviceability forming query template in query suggestion.In some implementations, the rank of query template can be used for determining whether template is effective template.In some implementations, the rank of query template can be associated in addition and/or as an alternative with this template and be used in determine to be formed in query suggestion whether utilize query template and/or the rank for determining the query suggestion formed based on query template.
In some implementations, the rank of query template can based on the cohesion of entity class.The cohesion of entity class can indicate the similarity between the entity of entity class, and similarity is higher, indicates larger cohesion.High similarity between the entity of entity class is by more to affect rank than the low similarity between entity.Such as, except being associated with entity class [movie subject], such as the entity class of [movie subject] can comprise multiple entities each other with low similarity.Such as, [movie subject] can comprise the multiple entities be associated with the different themes of such as " aliens ", " art " and " wars ".Therefore, in some implementations, entity class [movie subject] can be identified as there is low cohesion level.On the other hand, entity class [U.S.presidents] can comprise the entity each other with high similarity.Rank based on the query template of the cohesion of entity class can indicate and can produce query template that is useless and/or Unnecessary queries suggestion.Such as, the rank based on the query template of the cohesion of entity class can make the query template of the entity class comprising the threshold level that can not meet cohesion not be considered effective query template.
In some implementations, the rank of query template can based on the quantity of inquiry of the first submit identified meeting query template.Such as, in some implementations, when the quantity of inquiry of the first submit identified meeting query template meets threshold value, template generator 115 can be determined actively to affect rank.And, such as, in some implementations, template generator 115 can determine based on meet template the first submit identified inquiry quantity degree on actively affect rank (such as, what meet is more, and rank is higher).In some implementations, determine that the quantity of the inquiry of the first submit identified meeting query template can consider the frequency of the one or more appearance in inquiry.Such as, submitted to 10 times given inquiry (such as count 10 times, or counting be greater than 1 time) can weighting higher than only submitted to once another inquiry.In some implementations, determine that the quantity of the inquiry of the first submit identified meeting query template can ignore the one or more frequency of occurrences (such as, each inquiry only counts once, has nothing to do with the frequency of occurrences) in inquiry.
In some implementations, whether the quantity that the rank of query template can comprise based on the inquiry of the first submit identified meeting this template meets threshold value, determines that whether this template is effective.Such as, template generator 115 can identify 1,000,000 inquiry previously identified and identify the first query template " bike shop [city] " and the second query template " independently owned bike shop [city] ".Can definite threshold be carried out based on the quantity of the inquiry previously identified and/or determine in addition (such as, default threshold value).Such as, threshold value can be 20.Template generator 115 can determine that 500 in the inquiry of first submit meet the first query template " bike shop [city] " and determine that the first query template is effectively potential.On the other hand, template generator 115 can determine in the inquiry of first submit only 10 meet the second template " independently owned bike shop [city] " and determine that the second query template is potential invalid.In some implementations, the quantity and/or the threshold value that meet the inquiry of the first submit identified of query template can based on number percents.
In some implementations, the rank of query template can be present in the quantity of the entity at least one inquiry previously identified meeting this template based on the member determined as the entity class of query template.Such as, query template can be that " restaurants in [city] " and entity class [city] can be associated with 100,000 entity.Template generator 115 can determine that 10,000 entity be associated with entity class [city] is present in previous the identified inquiry meeting template " restaurants in [city] ".Therefore, as 10% being present in previous the identified inquiry meeting template " restaurants in [city] " of entity of the member of entity class [city].Along with as entity class member and be present in the entity at least one previous identified inquiry quantity increase, actively affect rank.Therefore, if 20 of the entity as the member of entity class [city], 000 is present in the rank affecting query template " restaurants in [city] " in previous the identified inquiry meeting template " restaurants in [city] " than 10,000 that only there is entity more energetically.
In some implementations, determine that rank can comprise the member based on the entity class as query template and whether the quantity being present in the entity at least one previous the identified inquiry meeting this template meets threshold value, determine that whether this template is effective.Such as, template generator 115 can identify the first query template " bike shop [city] " and the second query template " independently owned bike shop [city] ".Template generator 115 can determine that the entity class be associated with [city] can be associated with 100,000 entity further.Based on the quantity definite threshold of the entity be associated and/or can determine in addition (such as default threshold value).Such as, threshold value can be 5% of entity.Template generator 115 can determine that 7% of the entity of the member as classification [city] to be present in the inquiry of the first submit meeting the first query template " bike shop [city] " and to determine that the first query template is effectively potential.On the other hand, template generator 115 can determine only 1% being present in the inquiry of the first submit meeting the second query template " independently owned bike shop [city] " of the entity of the member as classification [city], and determines that the second query template is potential invalid.
In some implementations, query template rank can based on determine the entity class met in previous the identified inquiry of this template member the frequency of occurrences and comprise the inquiry not meeting this template other previous identified inquiry set in same entity the frequency of occurrences between similarity.When similarity between the frequency of occurrences of the same entity in the frequency of occurrences of the entity of the entity class in previous the identified inquiry meeting this template and the set of other previous identified inquiry increases, affect rank energetically.Such as, query template can be " restaurants in [city] " and can determine in previous the identified inquiry meeting query template, and the entity be associated with San Francisco occurs with first frequency and can determine that the entity be associated with Santiago in previous the identified inquiry meeting query template occurs with second frequency.Such as, can determine that the entity be associated with San Francisco occurs to meet 0.08% in the inquiry of this query template, and the entity be associated with Santiago occurs to meet 0.06% in the inquiry of this query template.Can determine that the entity be associated with San Francisco is comprising other previous the identified query set of the inquiry not meeting this template (such as further, all identified inquiries, comprise all the identified inquiry of the entity of classification [city]) in occur with the 3rd frequency, and can determine that the entity be associated with Santiago occurs with the 4th frequency in other query set.Such as, can determine that the entity that is associated with San Francisco occurs with 0.08% in inquiring about in other query set, and the entity be associated with Santiago occurs with 0.06% in the inquiry meeting other query set.Therefore, it is identical that being distributed between San Francisco and the frequency of occurrences in Santiago meets between the inquiry of this template and other query set.Based on such distribution similarity, the rank of query template can be affected energetically.For simplicity, the frequency of occurrences more only between two entities is discussed in the example above.As said, the distribution similarity between more than 2 entities can be considered.
In some implementations, determine whether the similarity that rank can comprise between the frequency of occurrences of the member determining entity class in previous the identified inquiry meeting this template and the frequency of occurrences of identical entity in other previous the identified query set comprising the inquiry not meeting this template meets threshold value.Such as, can based on the frequency of occurrences of the member of entity class in previous the identified inquiry meeting template with comprise the inquiry not meeting template other previous identified inquiry set in identical entity the frequency of occurrences between similarity, determine similarity measurement.If similarity measurement meets threshold value, this query template can be considered as effectively potential.If similarity measurement can not meet this threshold value, then it is potential invalid this query template can be considered as.
With reference to figure 6A-7B, provide based on the member of entity class in previous the identified inquiry determining to meet template the frequency of occurrences with comprise the inquiry not meeting this template other previous identified inquiry set in identical entity the frequency of occurrences between similarity, determine the other example of the rank of query template.
In fig. 6, the exemplary histograms of the frequency of occurrences of four entities of entity class [city] in the query set meeting query template " restaurants in [city] " is illustrated.In fig. 6b, the exemplary histograms of the frequency of occurrences of same four entities in the other query set identified comprising the inquiry not meeting this query template is illustrated.In some implementations, it is one or more that other query set can comprise in the inquiry meeting template " restaurants in [city] ".In some implementations, other query set can comprise all inquiries of the daily record from past inquiry.In some implementations, other query set only can comprise the inquiry of the entity comprising entity class [city].Fig. 6 A and 6B illustrates template generator 115 and can determine to have high similarity between set and the histogram that can affect the frequency of occurrences of the rank of query template energetically.
With reference to figure 6A, illustrate city " Los Angeles, CA ", " Louisville, KY ", " San Francisco, CA " and " Salem, OR ".Although illustrate only four cities, it will be appreciated that and other city can be utilized to determine the similarity of the frequency of occurrences.Such as, in some implementations, all cities be present in the query set meeting query template " restaurants in [city] " can be utilized.And, such as, in some implementations, the subset (such as, the city of 200 Stochastic choice) in the city be present in the query set meeting query template " restaurants in [city] " can be utilized.
Template generator 115 can be identified in the frequency of occurrences of four diagram members of entity class [city] in the inquiry meeting template " restaurants in [city] ".In illustrated histogram, represented the frequency of occurrences in the city in inquiry by the height of bar.Such as, this template is met and the inquiry comprising the entity be associated with " los angeles " occurs about 120 times.As said, in some implementations, determining in the frequency of occurrences, template generator 115 can comprise the multiple another names for entity.Such as, can comprise in inquiry " restaurants in Los Angeles " for the frequency of occurrences counting of " los angeles " and occur 70 times and inquire about " restaurants in LA " and occur 50 times.
With reference to figure 6B, illustrate the frequency of occurrences of the identical member of the classification [city] to the query set comprising the inquiry not meeting template " restaurants in [city] ".In some implementations, query set can comprise the inquiry that meets query template and not meet inquiry.Such as, query set can comprise " restaurants in Los Angeles " and inquiry " basketball team los angeles ".And, such as, can only utilize the inquiry not meeting template to determine counting.The frequency of occurrences in the city in Fig. 6 B is similar to the frequency of occurrences in the city in Fig. 6 A in distribution.Each of city in Fig. 6 B has about 2 times of the frequency of occurrences as illustrated in figure 6 a, but represents similar distribution relative to each other.The larger frequency of occurrences of Fig. 6 B can be due to such as considered larger query set.
The frequency of occurrences that template generator 115 can determine to meet the member of classification in previous the identified inquiry of template and comprise the inquiry not meeting this template other previous identified query set in identical entity the frequency of occurrences between similarity.Such as, template generator 115 can use one or more statistical method, and such as grade of fit test, chi-square analysis and/or the method based on entropy determine similarity.
In fig. 7, the exemplary histograms of the frequency of occurrences of four entities of entity class [city] in the query set meeting query template " NBA teams in [city] " is illustrated.In figure 7b, the exemplary histograms of the frequency of occurrences of same four entities in previous the identified query set comprising the inquiry not meeting query template is illustrated.Fig. 7 A and 7B illustrates template generator 115 and can determine adversely to affect the rank of query template and/or only not have the histogram of the frequency of occurrences of high similarity between the positive set affecting the rank of query template in limited extent ground.
With reference to figure 7A, illustrate " Los Angeles, CA ", " Louisville, KY ", " Chicago, IL " and " Salem, OR ".Although illustrate only four cities, it will be appreciated that and other city can be utilized to determine the similarity of the frequency of occurrences.Template generator 115 can identify the frequency of occurrences of four illustrated members of entity class [city] in the inquiry meeting template " NBA teams in [city] ".As illustrated, the entity be associated with " Los Angeles; CA " and " Chicago; IL " in fig. 7 has the frequency of occurrences of about 225, wherein, the entity be associated with " Louisville, KY " and " Salem; OR " has the minimum frequency of occurrences (because the limited inquiry such as met for the query template of those entities is submitted to, because there is not NBA team in those cities).
With reference to figure 7B, illustrate the frequency of occurrences of the identical member of the classification [city] of the other query set comprising the inquiry not meeting template " NBA teams in [city] ".In some implementations, other query set can comprise the inquiry that meets query template and not meet inquiry.And, such as, can only utilize the inquiry not meeting template to determine the frequency of occurrences.The frequency of occurrences in the city in Fig. 7 B is dissimilar with the frequency of occurrences in the city of Fig. 7 A in distribution.Such as, the entity list be associated with " Louisville, KY " and " Salem, OR " shows in figure 7b than the frequency of occurrences larger in fig. 7.
Template generator 115 can determine the member of classification in previous the identified inquiry meeting template the frequency of occurrences and in other previous the identified query set comprising the inquiry not meeting template identical entity the frequency of occurrences between similarity.Such as, template generator 115 can use one or more statistical method, and such as grade of fit test, chi-square analysis and/or the method based on entropy determine similarity.
There is described herein the various technology of the rank determining query template.The rank of query template can based on one or more such technology and/or other technology.Such as, whether query template is that effective query template can be based on: the cohesion of the entity class of query template, as identical entity in the member of entity class and the frequency of occurrences being present in the member of entity class in the quantity of the entity at least one inquiry previously identified meeting query template, multiple the identified previous submit Query meeting query template and previous the identified inquiry meeting template and other previous the identified query set comprising the inquiry not meeting this template the frequency of occurrences between similarity.Such as, if accumulation rank usually can be determined and add up rank to meet threshold value in cause based on all, this query template can be considered as effectively.And, such as, individual rank can be determined for each in front factor, and if each in individual rank meet threshold value, can be considered as effectively by this query template.The other of one or more technology described herein and/or alternative combination can be utilized to determine the rank of query template.
In some implementations, the query template determined can be stored in content data base 130 by template generator 115.In some implementations, when being defined as effective by template generator 115 by template, query template only can be stored as effective query template.In some implementations, any determined rank be associated with query template can associate with the query template in content data base 130 alternatively.
Query suggestion engine 120 can identify one or more query template of being formulated by template generator 115 and utilize this query template in formulation is for the query suggestion of partial query.In some implementations, query template can be utilized to formulate query suggestion to expand the database of existing query suggestion.In some implementations, query template can be utilized to formulate query suggestion in real time.
As the example formulating query suggestion based on query template, query suggestion engine 120 can be inquired about and determine the query template of the one or more words comprised from partial query by identification division.Such as, for partial query " restaurant i ", query template " restaurants in [city] " can be identified.Then, one or more query suggestion can be determined based on identified query template.Such as, can by determining query suggestion by being used for inserting in query template from the another name of the entity of entity class [city].In some implementations, being inserted by which another name of entity in query template can based on the popularity of the popularity of entity and/or another name.Popularity can based on one or more factor, the popularity of such as passing by inquiry.Such as, with city of san francisco, the entity that CA is associated can than Anchorage, and the entity that AK is associated is more popular.Similarly, the another name SF that the another name " San Francisco " that the entity be associated with San Francisco city is associated can be associated than the entity be associated with city of san francisco is more popular.
In some implementations, the another name of the entity inserted in query template can based on other and/or alternative factor.Such as, when formulating query suggestion in response to the partial query from specific user, the another name inserting the entity in query template can based on the relation between user and entity and/or between user and another name.Such as, user may be in Anchorage, AK and based on the position of user, more may selecting and Anchorage city, the entity that AK is associated.And such as, when just formulating query suggestion in response to the partial query from specific user, the another name inserting the entity in query template can based on the entity be associated with the prior searches request of user.Such as, user may send and entity Anchorage continually, the search inquiry that AK is associated, and the search inquiry in past based on user, more may select and Anchorage city, the entity that AK is associated.
In some implementations, when partial query comprises one or more character of the entity class of query template, query suggestion engine 120 can come based on the one or more potential another name of one or more character recognition by access entity database.Such as, for partial query " restaurants in s ", query template " restaurants in [city] " can be identified.Then, by being inserted in query template with the another name that " s " starts to the entity from entity class [city], one or more query suggestion can be determined based on identified query template.Such as, the another name in city can be identified, such as " San Francisco ", " Santa Monica " and " Santa Fe ".And such as, partial query " bike shops s " can be input as partial query by user.Template " bike shops [city] " based on partial query and the template comprising word " bike shops ", can be identified as potential template by query suggestion engine 120.Query suggestion engine 120 can access entity database and identify and be used for the entity of entity class [city], and can identify one or more another names of the entity of the entity class [city] being mapped to such as " San Diego " and " San Francisco " further.Query suggestion engine can word " s " in identification division inquiry and one or more another names in entity data bak (such as, similarity between " San Diego " and " San Francisco ", and query suggestion engine 120 can meet this template and the one or more query suggestion comprising the another name started with " s " for user provides.Such as, query suggestion engine 120 can provide query suggestion " bike shops in San Diego " and " bike shops in San Francisco ", as the potential complete query of the partial query for user for user.User can select in query suggestion one and selected query suggestion is submitted to search engine 125, and/or user can input other character to generate new partial query (such as, inputting " bike shops in sa ").
As another example formulating query suggestion based on query template, query suggestion engine 120 can be inquired about and determine the entity class of the one or more words be mapped to from partial query by identification division.Such as, for partial query " snow white and the huntsman ", word " snow white and the huntsman " can be identified as and be mapped to entity class [film].In some implementations, entity data bak described herein can be utilized, identify the entity class for the one or more words inquired about.Based on entity class [film], the one or more query templates comprising entity class [film] can be identified, such as query template " [film] actors ".Then, identified query template can be utilized to determine query suggestion " snow white and the huntsman actors ".And, such as, for partial query " snow white and the huntsman gr ", word " snow white and the huntsman " can be identified as and be mapped to entity class [film].Based on entity class [film], and the other character " gr " after entity class [film], the one or more query templates comprising entity class film and character " gr " can be identified, such as " [film] gross sales ".Then, identified query template can be utilized to determine query suggestion " snow white and the huntsman gross sales ".And, such as, for partial query " snow white and the hu ", word " snow white and the huntsman " can be identified based on the existing query suggestion for " snow white and the hu ".Word " snow white and the huntsman " can be mapped to entity class [film].Based on entity class [film], the one or more query templates comprising entity class [film] can be identified, such as query template " [film] actors ".Then utilize the query template identified to determine query suggestion " snow white and the huntsman actors ".
In some implementations, query suggestion engine 120 can carry out rank to based on the determined one or more query suggestion of query template.In some implementations, the rank of query suggestion can based on the rank of query suggestion template being used for formulating query suggestion.Such as, based on one or more standard described herein, template generator 115 can determine that query template " rivers in [state] " rank is higher than the query template " rivers in [city] " for query suggestion, and based on such rank, determine the rank of the query suggestion based on query template.In some implementations, the rank based on the determined query suggestion of query template can in addition and/or as an alternative based on another name and/or the popularity of entity that is associated with the another name be input in query suggestion.Such as, the popularity of query suggestion can based on being inserted into the popularity of the another name forming query suggestion in query template and the popularity based on the entity be associated with the another name be inserted in query suggestion.As said, one or more database can store the epidemic information of the another name of concerned entity and/or entity.Such as, query suggestion engine 120 can identify that the entity be associated with " San Antonio " is more popular than the entity be associated with " Saskatoon " and determine to comprise the rank of query suggestion of " San Antonio " and/or " Saskatoon " based on such popularity.And, such as, query suggestion engine 120 can identify that the another name " San Antonio " be associated with entity " San Antonio " is more popular than the another name " SAT " be associated with entity " Saskatoon ", and based on such popularity, determine the rank of the query suggestion comprising " San Antonio " and/or " SAT ".
In some implementations, query suggestion engine 120 can based on specific to this user information to be used for formed query suggestion one or more entity and/or another name rank.Query suggestion engine 120 can use the document of user, such as Email, navigation history, from the information of one or more application of user and/or the associated information (interest of the position of such as user, the age group of user, user) of the characteristic of user about having identified.Such as, query suggestion engine 120 can identify the webpage of the previous browsed entity about being associated with Diego California of user, and query suggestion engine 120 can based on user to the one or more other document possibility more interested than another city that may select in addition identified about Santiago, sorting query suggestion " restaurant in Santiago " (determining based on query template).In some implementations, query suggestion engine 120 can identify user current location and utilize this position based on query template sort be used in formed for the entity in the query suggestion of user and/or another name.Such as, query suggestion engine 120 can based on the information of user in Santiago, such as from the information of the IP address of GPS and/or computing equipment 105, the query suggestion comprising " san diego " is promoted to the query suggestion higher than comprising " San Antonio ".
It is possible for having than other configurations many of the more or less assembly of the environment shown in Fig. 1.Such as, although respectively illustrate query suggestion engine 120 and template generator 115 in FIG individually, it will be appreciated that, in some implementations, query suggestion engine 120 and/or template generator 115 can alternatively combination with one another and/or with the one or more combinations in search engine 125 and/or computing equipment 105.
With reference to figure 2, provide the process flow diagram that diagram determines the illustrative methods of query template and rank query template.Other realizations can perform step with different orders, omit some step and/or perform different from shown in Fig. 2 and/or other steps.By the one or more assemblies shown in Fig. 1, such as template generator 115, the step of the method shown in Fig. 2 can be performed.
In step 200, identify entity class.Such as, template generator 115 can identify entity class by accessing the database sharing one or more characteristic with content data base 130.Such as, template generator 115 can identify entity class [city], and wherein, the multiple entities be associated with city can be the members of entity class.And such as, template generator 115 can identify entity class [animal], wherein, the multiple entities be associated with animal can be the members of entity class.
In step 205, for the entity be associated with the entity class identified in step 200, identify another name.The another name of the entity be associated can be the text representation be associated of entity, such as the title " los angeles " in Los Angeles city in California.In some implementations, entity can be associated with multiple another name.Such as, the entity with another name " los angeles " can be associated with the other another name of the entity in another name " LA " and " City of Angles ", Los Angeles city in addition.
In step 210, identify the one or more inquiry group shared in one or more coupling word and the another name that identifies in step 205.Can, based on the strict identification of such as word coupling, coupling, editing distance and/or word based on prefix, determine to mate word.Such as, inquiry " cities in New York (city, New York) " and " adding cities in California (Li Funiya city) " can be identified as the another name of the entity comprising coupling word " cities in " and be mapped to entity class [state].In some implementations, via one or more soft matching technique, such as ignore optional stopping word, the one or more word of specification, softening word position demand etc., word is defined as coupling.
In some implementations, before step 200 and 205, perform step 210 alternatively.Such as, first template generator 115 can identify the inquiry comprising coupling word, is then identified in not mating and can be one or more words of the member of identical category between inquiry from same queries.Whether template generator 115 can access entity database and the non-matching word determining from multiple queries be the another name of the entity be associated with an entity class, and if identify entity class.Such as, inquiry " Oscar winner1939 " and " Oscar winner2002 " can be identified as and comprises common word " Oscar winner " and do not mate word " 1939 " and " 2002 " by template generator 115.Template generator 115 can identify the entity with another name " 1939 " and " 2002 " in entity data bak, and identifies that these two entities are all associated with entity class [year].
In step 215, determine query template.In some implementations, query template can be determined based on the one or more inquiries identified in step 210.In some implementations, can perform step 200,205 and 210 one or more before determine this template.Such as, by determining the entity class be associated with the word of single query and the other word identifying single query, can come based on this single query determination query template.The entity class of determined query template can be utilized to identify entity class in step 200, and step 205 and 210 can be utilized to identify meet the inquiry group of query template.Template can comprise one or more common word from identified inquiry and entity class.Such as, inquiry " best picture winner gone with the wind " can be identified as the sequence comprising word " best picture winner " and the word as the another name of the entity for being associated with entity class [movie] by template generator 115.
In step 220, to the query template determination rank determined in step 215.In some implementations, rank can be utilized to determine whether this template is effective query template.In some implementations, this rank can be utilized determine by query suggestion engine 120 rank of the one or more query suggestion determined based on query template.Such as, can determine that template has makes template will be used for for a large amount of partial query provides query suggestion to be impossible rank.And such as, query template can be defined as effective or invalid based on the rank of query template by template generator 115.
One or more technology described herein can be utilized to determine the rank of template.Such as, the rank for effective query template can be based on: the cohesion of the entity class of query template, as entity class member and be present in the quantity of the entity at least one previous the identified inquiry meeting this query template, the inquiry meeting multiple the identified first submit of query template and the similarity met between the frequency of occurrences of member of the entity class in previous the identified inquiry of template and the frequency of occurrences of the identical entity in other previous the identified query set comprising the inquiry not meeting template.
With reference to figure 3, provide diagram provides the exemplary method of one or more query suggestion to user process flow diagram based on query template.Other realizations can perform step with different order, omit some step and/or perform different from the step shown in Fig. 3 and/or other steps.The step of the method shown in Fig. 3 can perform by one or more assemblies as shown in Figure 1.Such as, the step of the method for Fig. 3 can be performed by query suggestion engine 120.
