Definitions
- the present invention relates to software, and more particularly, to modeling signal energy propagation.
- the hand-held radio and mobile device industry is constantly challenged in the market place for high audio quality products which provide good reception and coverage.
- Good coverage and reception are generally a function of signal propagation and signal strength.
- Signal strength and propagation can be compromised in environments having reflective objects. Radio frequency signals transmitted in a cluttered environment can reflect off the objects causing interference. This can lower the signal strength or introduce distortion in the received signal thereby deteriorating reception quality.
- due to reflections and initial directions, some of the propagating signals may never reach the mobile device. These signals may not contribute to the reception at the mobile device.
- Radio frequency signal propagation in an adverse environment can be performed via simulation.
- reflective properties of the objects can be modeled in order to characterize the effects on signal propagation.
- Ray propagation is one method used for analyzing signal propagation.
- a ray can be defined as a straight line normal to the wave front in the propagation of radiant energy. Referring to FIG. 1 , an illustration for ray propagation 100 is shown.
- a source 110 can transmit a ray 111 that can strike a target 120 , either directly, or by reflection off an object or surface 115 .
- a ray may directly strike a target, such as a mobile device, or reflect off objects in the environment before reaching the target. Reflected rays may have a lower signal strength due to the reflection.
- Ray tracing is one prior art method used for modeling signal propagation. Ray tracing is based on tracing signal paths from an observation point 120 to a source 110 . This is in contrast to other methods which start from the source 110 and determine the path to the observation point 120 . Referring to FIG. 2 , an illustration of ray tracing 160 is shown. Ray tracing 160 operates by tracing, in reverse, a path that could have been taken by a ray received at the observation point 120 . Notably, the rays are traced from the target 120 to the source 110 for determining which rays have struck the target. Ray tracing 160 takes into account reflective objects, or surfaces, that contribute to the reception of signals at the observation point.
- Ray tracing is a computationally expensive method for determining the number of rays that strike a target.
- ray tracing has some significant disadvantages.
- Ray tracing in three-dimensional environment can require complex databases having complex tracing structures that fail to converge.
- Ray tracing also typically requires an assumption of planar surfaces in the environment contributing to reflection.
- Ray tracing cannot also adequately account for rounded or cylindrical surfaces in the environment.
- embodiments of the invention are directed to a method and system for ray launching.
- Ray launching is a technique wherein a plurality rays are emitted at an initial angle. A path of the rays can then be traced until a certain termination condition is met. The termination condition can be a direct strike of the target or a direct strike of the target due to a given number of reflections.
- Ray launching is a continuing process wherein a first plurality of rays are launched followed by a second plurality of rays. The plurality of rays are successively reduced based on a success of a previous plurality of rays to focus a concentration of energy on a target.
- the initial angle of ray launching can be successively reduced to increase a resolution and a number of rays that strike a target. The number of rays launched for each succession depends on the success of previous rays striking a target, either directly or by reflection.
- the system can include a transmitter for successively launching a plurality of rays in an environment having reflection objects, and a receiver in the environment for receiving transmission rays from the transmitter and reflection rays from the reflection objects.
- the transmitter can eliminate successive rays that do not reach the receiver using successive angular spacing reduction.
- the transmitter can include a controller for determining an angular spacing for launching the plurality of rays, and selectively adjusting the angular spacing for successive launches to focus an energy of transmission rays and reflection rays on the receiver.
- the method can include eliminating pre-launch rays that have no tagged neighbors, and eliminating pre-launch rays that are less than a predetermined angle.
- the method can include tagging rays that successfully strike the observation region directly, via reflection, via transmission, or via combinations thereof, or via any set of pre-defined energy changing events.
- the system can include a source for successively launching a plurality of rays in an environment having energy operation objects, and a sink in the environment for coupling the energy rays from the operations of the energy on the objects.
- the source can eliminate successive rays that do not reach the sink using successive angular spacing reduction.
- the method can include launching a plurality of rays in the environment from a source, evaluating an incidence of transmission rays and reflection rays on an observation region, and selectively adjusting the launching in view of the incidence to focus an energy of the transmission rays and reflection rays on the observation region.
- the method can further include estimating a ray propagation from the source to the observation region, and determining a ray reception quality at the observation region from the signal propagation.
- Another embodiment is directed to a method of tracking successful rays.
- the method can include creating a reflection binary tree consisting of transmission nodes and reflection nodes for determining whether a transmission is received or a reflection is received, and pruning nodes in the binary reflection tree that do not contribute to the incidence. The pruning can eliminate rays that do not generate a transmission or a reflection on the observation region
- the method can further include terminating a ray propagation if an incidence of the ray is below a threshold, terminating a ray propagation based on a number of reflections supported per ray, terminating a ray propagation based on a number of transmissions supported per ray, terminating a ray propagation based on a number of diffractions supported per ray, or terminating a ray based on a combination thereof.
- the method can include weighting a ray proportional to a number of reflections required to reach the observation region, weighting a ray proportional to a number of transmissions required to reach the observation region, weighting a ray proportional to a distance between reflections, weighting a ray proportional to a distance between transmissions, or weighting a ray based on a combination thereof.
- Another embodiment is directed to a method for parallelizing ray launching.
- the method can include partitioning the source into distinct ray launching regions and assigning each region to a different processing engine.
- the method can also include partitioning the ray launch in terms of total number of rays to launch, wherein the partitioning is based on a total number of rays launched.

- ray launching 170 an illustration for ray launching 170 is shown.

- the termination condition can be assessed at the observation point or during ray propagation.
- a termination condition can be a failing of a ray to strike a target, a failing of a received energy level of the ray to meet a threshold, an exceeding a number of predetermined reflections prior to strike, or exceeding a number of transmissions supported per ray.
- the angles are successively reduced depending on the number of rays that reach the target. Rays that successfully reach the target are preserved, and new rays are spawned adjacent to the successful rays.
- Rays that do not reach the target are eliminated.
- a ray that is eliminated is no longer traced in subsequent ray launches.
- the tracing occurs from the source to the target.
- the source 110 can transmit multiple rays 111 at various angles in a multitude of directions. Some of the rays 111 will strike the target 120 via direct transmission or via reflection off an object or a surface 115 .
- the angles of transmitted rays can be successively reduced depending on the number of rays 111 that successfully reach the target. This includes rays 111 that are incident on the target 120 either by direct transmission or reflection.
- a first ray 121 may strike the target 120 . If the first ray 121 does not successfully strike the target 120 , the first ray 121 is eliminated from successive launches. If the first ray 121 is successful in striking the target 120 , the initial angle ⁇ 131 is reduced to ⁇ /2 132 .
- the reduction can be any factor of the original angle and is not limited to a halving operation (i.e. divide by 2).
- a halving operation provides a fast binary search.
- the first ray 121 is then accompanied by at least one adjacent ray 122 .
- the first ray 121 can spawn a single ray.
- the first ray 121 has spawned two side rays as a result of the successful strike.
- the first ray 121 and the second ray(s) 122 can be emitted.
- Each ray can be evaluated for success.
- a ray that succeeds in striking a target can spawn new rays at new angles for successive launches. Each successive launch can reduce the angle of launch for successful rays to spawn at least one new ray.
- Rays that do not strike the target can be eliminated from successive launch.
- ray launching is an adaptive process that focuses a concentration of energy on the target 120 based on the success of rays reaching a target. It is adaptive in the sense that it can use previous ray launch results to launch subsequent rays.
- the communication system 200 can provide wireless connectivity to a mobile device 109 over a radio frequency (RF) communication network or a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).
- RF radio frequency
- WLAN Wireless Local Area Network
- the communication system 200 can include a base station 250 operating over a RF link, and/or a wireless router 140 for providing a Wi-Fi link, but is not limited to these.
- the mobile device 109 can communicate with other base stations or cellular towers (not shown) using a standard communication protocol such as CDMA, GSM, OFDM, or iDEN but is not limited to these.
- Objects 115 within the environment can affect RF transmission from the base station 250 or the router 140 to the mobile device 109 .
- the objects can cause RF interference that degrades a signal reception quality.
- Ray launching 170 can be used to assess a reception coverage of the mobile device 109 in the communication system 200 .
- the base station 250 can include a controller 151 .
- the controller 151 can assess a reception of RF signals at the mobile device 109 using ray launching.
- the base station 250 and the mobile device 109 can be communicatively coupled, thereby allowing the mobile device 109 to inform the base station 250 of ray propagation success, and accordingly signal quality reception.
- the mobile device 109 can also include a Quality of Service (QoS) module for assessing the reception.

- the physical layer can use a variety of technologies such as 802.11b or 802.11g Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) technologies.
- the physical layer may use infrared, frequency hopping spread spectrum in the 2.4 GHz Band, or direct sequence spread spectrum in the 2.4 GHz Band, or any other suitable communication technology.
- ray launching may be viewed as an energy transfer mechanism in which the energy interacts with an environment. It is not limited to only modeling RF propagation in a communication system. From this perspective, then, ray launching can be applied in other areas such as the simulation of diffusion in semiconductors, or in the simulation of fiber optic transmissions. From this more general perspective, the ray may have distinct attributes not necessarily related with RF signal descriptors. For example, in the simulation of diffusion in semiconductors, the rays consist of dopant densities, and the interaction medium is the semiconductor material. In this case, the ray actually supports a physical entity that performs energy transfer (energy transmission to the atoms in the semiconductor lattice) as well as modifications to the medium (energy reflection to other atoms).
- Ray launching can also be extended to the simulation of diffraction phenomenon in a communication, whereby the rays are emitted from the source and proceed to the sink via diffraction along edges. These edges can be due to over-the-roof diffraction or around-the-side diffraction.
- ray launching 170 an illustration of ray launching 170 is shown.
- a point source 110 “radiates” rays 111 in all directions based on a specified angular spacing 131 (See FIG. 4 ).
- the angular spacing 131 may be specified in terms of ⁇ (azimuthal) or ⁇ (elevation) independently or jointly.
- ⁇ azimuthal
- ⁇ elevation
- a distance parameter identifies the distance the ray has traveled during propagation.
- a ray 111 may encounter an obstacle in which two events simultaneously occur: transmission and reflection.
- one of the first launched rays 112 strikes the object 115 .
- the striking of the ray on the object can cause a direct transmission and a reflection. Both the direct transmission and the reflection can proceed to strike the target 120 .
- the illustration of FIG. 6 only shows a reflection ray off the object 115 .
- the structure of the object causing the reflection can be represented as a facet.
- the simplest facet structure is a triangle, which consists of three nodes (vertices), three edges, and a single face. With the facet is associated the material properties (permittivity, conductivity, etc.).
- a ray 112 that encounters such a facet on the object 115 can produce a transmission and a reflection.
- a transmission ray is a new ray generated as a result of the ray 112 striking the facet.
- a reflection ray is the ray 112 that reflects off the facet. That is, the single ray 112 can produce a dual event.
- a normal vector of the facet allows quick evaluation of the transmission and reflection signal levels due to the material properties.
- a normal vector is a vector that is orthogonal to the single face of the facet.
- the material properties of the facet can be used to control transmission and reflection of the ray 112 in the medium.
- the medium is the space encompassing the point source 110 , the objects 115 , and the observation point. In the case of RF communication signals, the medium is air.
- an object 115 that is a pure electrical conductor (PEC) can reflect all incident energy of the ray 112 . That is, the object 115 will not produce transmission rays. Only a phase of the reflected ray is affected.
- Simulation environments attempt to model the interactions between rays, objects, and targets in an environment.
- Various methods of modeling the objects can be considered. For example, a half-space method treats the material of the object 115 with inherent material properties that not allow ray transmission. In this case, the object is considered only to reflect a ray. The object is not allowed to introduce transmissions. In practice, the simulation prevents the object from transmitting rays. This half-space condition allows for non-metal reflections while “absorbing” the transmitted energy.
- ray launching 170 a plurality of rays are launched successively in time. For example, a first set of rays denoted by the (1) in FIG. 6 are launched at an initial angle. After the launch, an analysis is conducted to determine the number of successful rays reaching the target. For instance, ray 111 is a direct transmission on the target 120 . The target 120 is considered the observation point in the analysis. Ray 112 is also a successful ray since the ray reflects off the object 115 and strikes the target 120 . Other rays that do not strike the target are unsuccessful and eliminated from future launch. Upon analysis at the observation point, new rays are spawned for successful rays.
- a second set of rays denoted by the (2) in FIG. 6 are launched based on the success of the rays in the first launch.
- the process continues, with each set of new launches based on a success of previous launches.
- a set of pre-launch rays are created after each launch.
- ray interaction and transmission/reflection is an assumption that the ray is a physical entity describing only length; ray interaction with a facet consists of a “point” event. It is important now to clarify that there are actually two options for implementing the ray:
- a ray is modeled as a “ray tube” for the purposes of propagation. This ray tube establishes an area for the wave front and gives the ray a cone shape with associated volume. Ray events are still at the “point” of the ray, but the ray occupies space. This allows for the receivers used to measure signal properties/descriptors to be represented by a single point. All rays containing the receiver point in their volume have therefore contributed to the reception, and their statistics are used to calculate the individual contributions to the signal.
- a ray is modeled as an entity of length only (i.e., not ray tubes) and interactions with a facet occur at a “point” on the facet.
- a receiver is treated as a point in space, the likelihood that an actual ray goes through that point is extremely low.
- it is necessary to define a volume around the receiver point, typically a sphere with a specified radius. In this case, the rays going through the volume are contributors to the receiver.
- a method 300 for ray launching 170 is shown.
- the method 300 can be practiced with more or less than the number of steps shown.
- the method 300 can be implemented entirely in hardware or software, such as a DSP, a microprocessor, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), or any other suitable software or hardware.
- a controller such as the controller 141 or controller 151 in FIG. 5 , can implement the method 300 for ray tracing.
- a controller as described performs the method steps.
- the method 300 can contain a greater or a fewer number of steps than those shown in FIG. 7 .
- the method 300 can start.
- the method 300 can start in a state wherein a plurality of rays are prepared to launch.
- the rays can be directed in a multitude of directions.
- the rays can be uniformly angularly spaced so as to be directed in all directions in the environment.
- the source 110 can prepare launch for a plurality of rays in all directions.
- a minimum angle spacing can be determined.
- the minimum angle spacing identifies the direction each ray will be launched.
- the initial angular spacing ⁇ o also corresponds to a number of rays.
- each ray will have an associated computational cost, since each ray needs to be traced along a path from the source 110 to an end condition.
- the minimum angular spacing can correspond to an angular spacing that provides the most efficient allocation of computational resources.
- an initial step angle can be determined.
- the step angle ⁇ i determines the spacing between the rays for a successive launch, and accordingly sets the number of rays to launch.
- the rays can be launched. Rays are launched in a direction corresponding to the current angular spacing ⁇ o . Referring to FIG. 6 , a first set of rays (1) can be launched in all directions. Some of the rays will strike the target 120 via direct transmission or via reflection off a surface 115 .
- rays that strike the target 120 can be tagged.
- a tagging identifies a ray as successfully striking a target 120 .
- a tag may contain information identifying the ray, the direction of the ray, the power of the ray, or any other attribute that defines features of the ray. In the most general sense, a tag is an index number identifying the ray among the plurality of rays.
- a new angle can be created.
- the angle can be created from the previous launch angle.
- the step 312 can be considered an angular bisecting method. It should be noted that the step 312 is not limited to bisection.
- the angle can be reduced by other factors, and factors that can include a weighting based on a success of a ray.
- the minimum angle may correspond to a certain maximum number of computations.
- the method step 314 introduced new rays at a new angle. New rays that are adjacent to at least one tagged ray are kept for launch at step 320 . New rays that are not adjacent to any tagged rays are eliminated. In practice, these rays are bypassed and not set for launch. More specifically, rays in a pre-launch are pruned prior to launch based on the success of their neighbor rays. For example, referring to FIG. 6 , rays that are adjacent a tagged ray can be set for launch.
- the method 300 can successively continue at step 308 for launching new rays at a reduced angular spacing based on a success of previous rays.
- the method 300 can terminate when the angular spacing is below a minimum angle, such as at step 314 , or some other terminating condition is met.
- the controller 141 begins ray launch at a pre-defined angular spacing between rays.
- the controller 141 examines the rays that impact the regions to be examined (time observation region) and “tags” the rays.
- the controller 141 can divide the ray launch angle by 2. Based on the tagged rays, the controller 141 can either launch or delete new rays.
- the controller 141 divides the angular spacing by a factor of 2 initializes pre-launch lays. The controller 141 then decides which new rays to launch at the ray at the new angle.
- the decision is based upon whether an “adjacent” ray is tagged as having struck the region(s) of interest.
- the controller 141 can implement a simple rule: If all rays adjacent to the pre-launch ray are not tagged, the ray is not launched. A ray is adjacent if it has a minimal distance to the pre-launch ray.
- the controller 141 can space the rays with respect to a distance metric, such as a Euclidean distance, though other distance metrics are herein contemplated. The spacing is not limited to a distance metric and can include other measures of evaluating separation.
- the controller 141 can generate a “reflection tree” to model the ray propagation.
- the “reflection tree” can be generated via software for keeping track of successful rays.
- a “binary tree” 400 is shown.
- the root node 402 in the reflection tree can be a first transmission/reflection event.
- the controller 141 can generate a binary tree 400 for each ray 111 .
- the controller 141 keeps track of a ray's transmissions and reflections during propagation to the target 120 using the binary tree 400 .
- the binary tree 400 is an efficient structure for allowing the controller 141 to model a plurality of rays in accordance with method 300 .
- the tree is binary since one branch 404 corresponds to the transmission and the other branch 406 corresponds to the reflection. Each node of a branch 406 can produce another branch having a reflection node 408 or a transmission node 410 . It should be noted that the binary tree 400 does not need not be balanced.
- the structure and the depth of the tree can also be set by termination conditions.
- controller 141 reduces the number of rays launched to reduce the number of computations in the method 300 . This will eliminate any computations associated with deleted rays, and allow for the inclusion of additional parameters in the ray calculations. Furthermore, by eliminating those rays that do not contribute to the results prior to launching, the controller 141 can dedicate computational effort to greater resolution in the regions with successful ray impact.
- the set of terminating conditions identifies criteria that terminate ray propagation.
- the controller 141 can implement the set of terminating conditions.
- a ray that is terminated is no longer followed; i.e. traced.
- rays that are terminated by the controller 141 are no longer considered for direct transmission or reflective transmission on a target. That is, a contribution of the ray is no longer considered once the ray is terminated.
- the controller 141 reduces a computational load of the analysis.
- the controller 141 can prune the signal propagation analysis for non-successful rays and concentrate computational resources on only those rays that strike a target, or that contribute to the strike due to reflection.
- a ray can be terminated if the signal level of the ray detected at the target is below a threshold.
- a ray can be terminated based on a number of reflections supported per ray.
- the binary tree 400 of FIG. 8 demonstrates a fully symmetric tree.
- a ray can be terminated based on a number of transmissions supported per ray.
- the controller 141 can terminate a tracing of the ray upon recognizing the condition.
- a ray can also be terminated based on a combination of level, number of reflections, and/or number of transmissions (cases 332 - 336 ). This is a means of biasing the ray launch towards supporting more reflections (for example, for an outdoor environment), or more transmissions (for an indoor environment). In this case, for each transmission (reflection) m reflections (transmissions) are branched off.
- the success of method 300 depends on the initial angular spacing. Accordingly, the controller 141 can choose the initial angular to be sufficiently “dense” to guarantee at least one ray strikes the target 120 (e.g., observation region). If the controller 141 fails in a first attempt at obtaining a tagged ray (for example, in the case of a small observation region and large initial angular spacings), then the controller 141 may be necessary to proceed with angular bisection until a tagged ray is obtained. To improve computational efficiency and speed of search, the angular spacing may be 2 N (2, 4, 8 or 16°) so that division by 2 corresponds to an accumulator shift operation.
- the controller 141 can implement the methods 340 for increasing computational speed.
- the methods 340 can be practiced individually or in combination, and are not limited to those shown.
- the controller 141 can increase a computational efficiency by weighting rays.
- the controller 141 can assign a “weight” based on some criterion.
- the controller 141 can adjust the angular spacing in accordance with the weight. Accordingly, the controller 141 can proceed with a finer angular spacing 1/p with p>2 in the direction of a strongest-weighted ray.
- the controller 141 can impose various criteria to weight a ray based on its interaction with the geometry of the environment:
- the controller 141 can weight a ray based on method steps 342 - 346 .
- a ray can be weighted in proportion to the number of reflections required to reach the target receiver.
- ray propagation is extremely sensitive to ray incidence angle, especially over long distances.
- a ray can be weighted in proportion to the number of transmissions required to reach the target receiver. This can be useful for modeling signal propagation in indoor environments.
- a ray can be weighted based on a measure relating to distances. For example, weight the ray based on the longest distance between reflections. The ray can also be weighted in proportion to a defined combination of transmissions and reflections required to reach the target receiver as described in methods 342 - 344 .
- the method 300 of ray launching can be considered adaptive ray launching.
- the method 300 of ray launching 170 shown in FIG. 6 is complemented with the method of ray weighting shown in FIG. 11 .
- a first ray launch results in a successful strike which results in the addition of two new rays in close proximity of the first ray launch.
- a more detailed view of the first ray launch is shown in FIG. 13 .
- the pre-launch rays 123 for the third ray launch has a closer angular spacing to the strongly weighted ray 111 .
- the steps of method 300 still apply during weighting. The only modification is in the angular spacing to take advantage of the fact that rays with greater weight have succeeded in striking the target receiver to a greater degree than other simpler interaction mechanisms.
- Method 300 of adaptive ray launch technique can alleviate the initial computational load by tracking the most successful rays that strike the target region.
- FIG. 14 a modification to the binary tree 400 of FIG. 8 is shown.
- a set of method steps 502 - 506 are also shown for describing the generation of nodes on the binary tree 400 .
- the modification can also yield good results in subsequent ray launches.
- the controller 141 can generate the binary tree 400 in software for keeping track of successful ray propagations.
- the controller 141 can practice the method steps 502 - 506 .
- a selection of nodes ( 510 - 512 - 514 ) corresponding to the original successful ray are presented. To do this, the actual ray path is traced to the successful end-node 514 , as illustrated.
- a successful ray trace can be replicated on a next launch.
- the smaller angle due to the higher weighted ray
- the same path 510 - 512 - 514
- the tree is traced back to the next higher node ( 512 ).
- the next ray tracing operation is then performed at this node 512 . If unsuccessful again, the next higher node ( 510 ) is utilized and the process is repeated until successful or the root node is reached.
- the method steps 502 - 506 can be applied to method 300 . That is, the controller 141 can implement the method steps to increase a computational performance. Accordingly, the method 300 , including methods 340 of adaptive weighting, and methods 500 for increasing speed of search in the binary tree 400 , are dependent on the initial ray launch interval. If the rays are too dispersed, it is possible that none of the rays will strike a target region. The method 300 prescribes that another ray launch be performed at the new angular spacing and the process continues until at least one ray is successful. In such regard, computational resources associated with carrying out the method 300 may consume as much computation as the method without adaptation.
- the method 300 can further include adding a “bias” to the adaptive ray launching to minimize excess use of computational resources. This can be done by performing some pre-calculations of the environment and simulation conditions prior to any ray launch. Some examples of such pre-calculations include, but are not limited to:
- LOS line-of-sight
- the number of transmissions and reflections are important for propagation simulation results. Too few of any one of these parameters may result in insufficient energy captured in the receiver area of interest, leading to inaccurate results. Too many of any one of these parameters increases the computational load. Accordingly, the method 300 can be optimized with respect to the reflections/transmissions supported in addition to the ray launch.
- indoor and outdoor environments may call for different reflections/transmissions settings depending on the location of the receiver area.
- the obstacle facets can be set to the half-space construct and the number of reflections should be set higher than the number of transmissions.
- the number of transmissions may need to be higher in order to penetrate through the obstacles to reach an internal receiver area. This can be set by the user through an appropriate interface, but this does not constitute adaptive reflection and/or transmission setting as considered here.
- the method 300 can further treat each launched ray separately.
- the method 300 can be initiated through the adaptive ray launch described in method 340 of FIG. 9 .
- the method 300 for treating each ray separately can also include pre-calculation as previously described. The method is briefly discussed in the foregoing.
- terminating condition would be the setting of supported reflections and/or transmissions for that particular ray until the received power does not vary by such user-defined bound.
- Another terminating condition may be based on the comparison of relative signal levels between the original successful ray (i.e., the ray that reached the target receiver region) and any of the spawned reflected/transmitted waves based on time adaptive R/T technique.
- Time adaptive R/T technique may invariably result in an increase in the size of the binary reflection tree 400 (See FIG. 8 ), but only along the nodes of the successful rays.
- the number of calculations required to support the technique can be reduced by comparing the relative signal levels, instead of measuring the actual levels for each ray.
- the following measure can be employed:
- ⁇ direct ⁇ ⁇ path ⁇ ⁇ length reflected ⁇ ⁇ path ⁇ ⁇ length
- direct path length is the original successful ray's path length from the previous event (reflection or transmission)
- reflected path length is the path length of any one of the reflected rays spawned from the original successful ray.
- ⁇ >0 as the reflected path length increases, and if it goes beyond a certain threshold (set through ⁇ ) that ray is ignored as it will not contribute significantly to the results.
- the Time adaptive R/T technique is a complementary technique to the adaptive ray launching method proposed herein.
- adaptive R/T setting can result in higher accuracy with superior computational efficiency for propagation simulations based on the ray launching method.
- Ray launching can also be extended to diffraction rays where the binary tree consists of paths resorting to over-the-roof or around-the-side diffraction.
- Diffraction rays can be generated in response to reflection rays that are incident on a sink.
- the ray launch sphere can be partitioned into distinct regions or quadrants and assign each quadrant to a different processing engine.
- the ray launch sphere can be any object for applications in which the ray launch does not proceed from a point source Step 601 is straightforward, but has the limitation that some quadrants may have few rays to operate with while others may have too many.
- a means of reducing the overhead of specific quadrants is to repartition the sphere excluding the regions with no ray launches. This allows for adaptive partitioning.
- the ray launch can be partitioned in terms of total number of rays to be launched, the partition de-pending on the total number of distinct processing engines.
- the partitioning is dependent upon the ray launch density, and the intent is to assign the same density to each processing engine.
- the system 605 can include a centralized server 610 , a load balancer 620 , and one or more clusters 630 .
- Each cluster can include a processing engine 632 to perform one aspect of the ray launching computation.
- the term “processing engine” considered above can refer to a distinct processor or to a cluster processors that are networked.
- the system 605 can be distributed over a network, distributed over a multi-core processing unit, or distributed over any multi-unit processing system.
- the parallel operations are not restricted to large scale operation as shown in FIG. 15 .
- the system 605 of FIG. 15 can also be considered an architecture for a single integrated circuit, or an embedded system.
- each of the processing engines 632 can be different processing cores on a printed circuit board.
- the centralized server 610 can be the controller 141 for delegating processing tasks for off chip components.
- the methods steps 601 and 602 parallelize the adaptive ray launch method 300 .
- An alternative approach to parallelize the method 300 is to consider time adaptive reflection/transmission (R/T) method as well.
- R/T time adaptive reflection/transmission
- the continuation of that ray launch is taken over by a new processing engine. This frees up the previous processing engine to consider a new ray launch or to handle another R/T even from another processor.
- a method 300 for reducing the number of computations in a ray-launching propagation system 170 has been provided.
- the method 300 consists of initiating the ray launch with a certain angular spacing and then continuing to reduce the angular spacing by a pre-determined factor and launching rays based on a simple rule.
- An enhancement to the method allows for the angular spacing to be varied depending on the weight assigned to adjacent rays. This approach takes advantage of the fact that multiple reflected rays tend to be more sensitive to angular deviations, hence a smaller angular resolution is needed. Rays with lower weights proceed at the nominal angular spacing. To further improve the technique with weighted rays, a successful ray path is traced and then replicated in the weighted ray to minimize memory usage and computations.
- the method 300 has also been shown capable of supporting pre-calculation of the environment to bias the adaptive ray launch technique for greater chances at successful ray launches. It was noted that pre-calculation can add significantly to the computational load so a measure was derived for bounding the pre-calculation load based on the initial conditions of the simulation (ray density and supported reflections).
- the method 300 was complemented with adaptive reflection/transmission to address time variability of the geometries treated by the ray-launch method. It was proposed to bias the ray launch technique to treat the distinct environments independently while increasing the accuracy of the simulation through concentrated ray transmission and reflections in the areas of interest. This embodiment can be important to distinguish simulation in outdoor and indoor environments.
- a parallelization system 605 of the method on multiple processing engines was provided. In such regard, both adaptive ray launching as well as adaptive reflection/transmission can benefit from parallelization. Several techniques were discussed and it was alluded that the techniques may be combined to maximize the throughput of the simulator on multiple processing engines.
- the adaptive ray-launch amid adaptive reflection/transmission techniques search for conditions which improve the chances of success above the standard ray-launch technique. Furthermore, it is possible to concentrate the computational effort in the regions of interest and to the level of accuracy desired.
- the techniques can be readily parallelized through an appropriate partitioning of the ray launch or the ray events in a scattering environment. Furthermore, the principles described herein can be applied to the ray launch as applied to diffraction events around edges of a facet.
- the present embodiments of the invention can be realized in hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software. Any kind of computer system or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein are suitable.
- a typical combination of hardware and software can be a mobile communications device with a computer program that, when being loaded and executed, can control the mobile communications device such that it carries out the methods described herein.
- Portions of the present method and system may also be embedded in a computer program product, which comprises all the features enabling the implementation of the methods described herein and which when loaded in a computer system, is able to carry out these methods.
Abstract
Description
where “direct path length” is the original successful ray's path length from the previous event (reflection or transmission), and “reflected path length” is the path length of any one of the reflected rays spawned from the original successful ray. The measure above gives δ=1 when the contribution of the original amid reflected rays are similar. On the other hand, δ−>0 as the reflected path length increases, and if it goes beyond a certain threshold (set through δ) that ray is ignored as it will not contribute significantly to the results. The Time adaptive R/T technique is a complementary technique to the adaptive ray launching method proposed herein. When combined with adaptive ray launching, adaptive R/T setting can result in higher accuracy with superior computational efficiency for propagation simulations based on the ray launching method. Ray launching can also be extended to diffraction rays where the binary tree consists of paths resorting to over-the-roof or around-the-side diffraction. Diffraction rays can be generated in response to reflection rays that are incident on a sink.
