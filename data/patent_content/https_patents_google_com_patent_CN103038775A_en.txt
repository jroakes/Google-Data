Embodiment
This document has been described a kind of system and technology for for non-permitted user and/or equipment the unauthorized use used being protected by center applications shop (or app shop) distribution and the software application of selling.This system and utilization a kind of permission schemes, whether it for example suitably permits this user and/or equipment by comparing to identify application with the purchaser record set with user or device-dependent information, check the current License Status of application, and the License Status of using is back to application in order to suitably process.For example, this is used when the not licensed use of License Status inspection indication active user, and then this application can be so that some feature that forbidding only can be used permitted user.In some cases, permission schemes as described herein can also be used to protect by using other digital content of shop supply.
Such function can be provided by the single software dispatch service of operation for a plurality of different software publishers' application shop.Licensing system can be issued for carrying out mutual guide with it, needn't set up its oneself verification system thereby individual publisher can secure permission protection quite expediently and such system is operated.On the contrary, they can upload its application in order to be presented on and use in the shop in the mode of suitable standard, and can be so that the license restrictions that realizes for them, and the information relevant with the license affairs is reported to them.
Software publishing side can use it (or app) and be uploaded to together and use the shop together with appropriate metadata (for example, price, text description, icon, be used for receiving from the user who downloads this application the account number of payment, etc.).Such publisher may wish that the Licensing Methods with law and technical combination limits the copy right piracy of its application.The technical elements of the method can apply restriction to the non-permission to use of software, and the law aspect of the method then can limit the corresponding authority of using this software aspect the consistent law of technical limitation.The publisher can be from being used for defining one of technology and legal restrictions or the options menu of these two (is for example selected, licensing system by and standard known from some is selected, all licensing systems of increasing income as is known), and/or can be fully ownly define such restriction, such as by its oneself license language is provided.
As described in more detail below, for example be allowed to before client device operation is used the user, the licensed service of being trusted can be come by checking that the License Status of using controls the access to its application for the publisher provides reliable mode.When the License Status at application review permit server place, this permit server can use the response of private key signature License Status, and this private key can be used to confirm that this License Status response is generated by permit server.This private key for example can be a part right with application or the unique public/private keys that is associated of publisher's account.Application can comprise corresponding PKI at it in the binary code of compiling, and can use public-key/integrality of private key to verifying that License Status responds.
In order to help the publisher that licensing function is incorporated in the application, operation licensed service or provide trusted organization (for example, the same tissue in shop is used in running) to its access to provide can be embedded into code library among the application.Be described to the license related communication that the code library in License Authentication storehouse (LVL) can carry out the market user's end that operates with client device the user here and process, and market user's end can then with long-range permit server on the licensed service that operates communicate.Use Embedded LVL, application can receive by calling License Check device method and realization the readjustment (callback) of License Status and determine its current License Status in from the signature response of long-range permit server.
Fig. 1 is the concept map of using and check the system 100 of the corresponding License Status of using for distributing software.In this system, equipment 102 communicates with the server 104 of trustship (host) such as the application market 106 of using the shop.Such communication can be carried out (for example, internet, LAN, WAN, WiMAX or its combination in any) at arbitrarily suitable network.Client device 102 is depicted as smart phone, but the client device of other type (for example, desk-top computer, laptop computer, net basis, panel computer, set-top box etc.) also can communicate with server 104.Similarly, server 104 is depicted as separate server, but server 104 can represent server cluster, server zone, perhaps is used to other server grouping that application market 106 is possessed in trustship.In some implementations, server 104 can be operated by the trusted organization that licensed service as described herein is provided.
Client device 102 can be configured to the equipment that is implemented as provides the software application of any amount of various types of functions (or app).A kind of application type can provide and being connected and carrying out with it mutual market user and hold application of application market 106.The market user holds application to be associated with trusted organization, and can be provided for the purpose in access application market 106 by trusted organization.Use the market user to hold application, the user of client device 102 can browse application market 106 or the search concrete application of issuing by application market 106.
In typical marketing, the user be such as can identifying interested application by search or browse application market 106, and can determine subsequently to buy this application.Go out as shown by arrow A, client device 102 for example can send the request of purchase 108 of using to application market 106 from market user's end that equipment is carried out.Application market 106 can be for example by for using to user's charge and such as registering this purchase by the electronical record that creates transaction and transaction being processed.The electronical record of transaction can be used to subsequently verify that buying the user who uses is the permitted user of this application.As shown by arrow B, application market 106 can be delivered to client device 102 with the binary code 110 of ask application subsequently.
As described above, the user of client device 102 can also obtain application binary code 110 by illegal channels.For example, application binary code 110 can be copied and/or again distribution by the user who is not done like this by the license of software publishing side.Under these circumstances, software publishing side may be difficult to control the not permission to use of its application to a certain extent.
Like this, according to technology as described herein, software publishing side can use the License Status check system to determine whether the specific copy of using is attempted carrying out the suitably license of user institute of this application.For example, do not buy this application by application market 106 if attempt the user of execution application, can think that then this application this specific user is permitted.The License Status check system can also or be used to determine alternatively particular device whether use by licensed execution.For example, software publishing side can bundle the license of using so that have the user of a plurality of equipment and only can be allowed to be applied thereon on the licensed one or more equipment of reality at this it is used with particular device.Alternatively, equipment can bundle with its account of logining, and license can be associated with the account, then can't carry out same application (unless they are as first user login or their also this application of licensed use of account) at this equipment thereby the user can carry out other user of application at a plurality of equipment.
As described in more detail below, as shown by arrow C, utilize the application of License Status check system as described herein to send License Check request 112 to the server 104 of trustship License Check device service 116.As an example, this application can comprise so that send the instruction of License Check request 112 when application is enabled.In some implementations, application itself possibly can't directly communicate with server 104, but can communicate with market user's end of carrying out at client device 102 equally in addition.Market user's end can be associated with application market 206 and provide access to it.Market user's end can be configured to send License Check request 112 to License Check device service 116, and receives any response of beaming back from License Check device service 116.Therefore, market user end can be used for impelling for each the License Status inspection in a plurality of application on the equipment, and can be called or be called such as the determined appropriate time of each respective service each one of the application when being performed.
License Check request 112 can be transferred to server 104 by arbitrarily suitable network (for example, internet, LAN, WAN, WiMAX or its combination in any).Server 104 is depicted as hosts applications market 106 and License Check device service 116, but should be understood that, the function of application market 106 and License Check device service 116 can trustship on different server.In addition, the function of each can further be divided (segment) and is hosted on the different server of any right quantity in application market 106 and the License Check device service 116, in order to for example stride additional network device distributing network business load.
License Check request 112 can comprise various data such as Types Below, and whether this data allow License Check device service 116 to determine to use the active user that attempts carrying out this application or equipment are suitably permitted.For example, License Check request 112 can comprise the application identities symbol (for example, bag title) of the application-specific that the designated user trial is carried out.License Check request 112 can also comprise that this application can be used for random number or interim number (nonce) that its any response that receives from License Check device service 116 is verified subsequently.
These data types and other application-specific information can self be identified or be generated by using.Yet in some cases, application may not have enough permissibilities to visit in data that whether determine to use other type that comes in handy when suitably permitting for specific user or equipment.Like this, in some implementations, market user's end that application can be carried out on the client device 102 provide interim number, application identities symbol and/or any other relevant application-specific information, and market user's end can collect to be included in the License Check request 112 with user and device-dependent additional information.In some cases, market user's end can have the permissibility larger than application, and can access optional equipment and/or user specific information.For example, the market user holds main account user name that may can the identification equipment user, the international mobile subscriber identity code (IMSI) of device dependent connection, and other equipment and/or user specific information.
In some implementations, application can for example be called the market user by communication (IPC) between remote process and be held to initiate License Check, and market user's end can be collected the additional information that will be included in the License Check request 112.Market user's end can represent subsequently to use to License Check device service 116 and send License Check request 112, and it can comprise that application and market user hold the combination of collected information.In realization described above, the API that network connection is relevant with license can rather than use by market user's end and manage.In such realization, use the connection or the needs that self do not need to manage permit server and understand the relevant API of some license, and therefore application code especially can more concentrate on its designing institute for specific function (size of therefore for the publisher, having simplified exploitation and may having dwindled application, this can a plurality of used to alleviate be correlated with when this burden and this burden place in the single License Check system on the contrary).
When receiving License Check request 112, License Check device service 116 can be assessed to determine whether and can set up user identity to certain level of trust by the information pointer from this request this request.In some implementations, this system can use trust threshold, thereby the user (for example can utilize certain level of trust, 80 percent probability) identifies, License Check can be proceeded as described below, if but level of trust is lower than threshold value, then License Check can stop and/or procedural (programmatic) response can be provided.Can comprise the production error code or in response, send default License Status such as " non-license " for the example of the procedural response that does not reach the threshold value level of trust.
Level of trust can be based on direct or indirect factor corresponding to the information in the request.For example, the user name of device dependent connection can be considered to the direct factor for the identification user, and location identifier (for example, by the IP address, from the GPS reading of equipment or the current geographic position of cell tower or the determined equipment of other access point location) then can be considered to indirect factor.Different user identification factor can be equal in various realizations or aniso-being weighted.For example, be equal in the example of weighting in all factors, wherein four or five factors think that the user who uses is the specific people, and system just can confirm that this user is exactly that people in 80 percent ground.In other example, different factors can differently be weighted, and for example the identity according to this factor and definite user has heterogeneous pass to come weighting.
In some implementations, request can comprise the token that is associated with the authenticated of client device.For example, the information that is associated with the user can be authenticated by licensed service or Third Party Authentication service, and such authentication can represent with the token form.Token can be stored on the client device, and for example can be conducted interviews to be included in the License Check request by application or market user's end.Comprise that such token can be considered to the strong directly indication of user identity, and therefore can be carried out large weight about other direct or indirect designator.In some implementations, comprise that such token can be considered to determine user identity.
If License Check device service 116 can be determined with enough level of trust user's identity, the purchaser record that then can contrast application checks user identity, and License Check device 116 can return License Check response 118, and market user's end can be back to application with this License Check response by the IPC readjustment subsequently.For example, if the user in the user who identifies and the purchaser record is complementary, then License Check device 116 can return " license " response.If be not complementary, then can return " non-license " response.In some implementations, License Check device service 116 can alternatively or additionally be assessed request based on device-specific information, and can contrast purchaser record checkout facility identity to determine whether application is suitably permitted for concrete equipment.
In order to ensure the integrality of License Check response 118, response can use private keys to sign or encrypt by License Check device service 116.This private key can be specific to publisher's account or application, and can be issue software publishing side or by the right part of the public/private keys of its generation.Key to the realization that is generated by the publisher in, the publisher can be uploaded to private key permit server to use when the response of signature License Check.
In some implementations, trusted organization can generate license key pair for each publisher's account, and can provide PKI in the profile page of publisher's account.The publisher can copy subsequently this PKI and it is embedded in the application source code, and this source code will be compiled to subsequently to be used in the package.Private key can be kept by trusted organization, and it subsequently can be with the sign permission response of the application of issuing for the publisher's account that is associated of this private key.For example, when receiving the License Check request, License Check device service 116 can determine that the License Status of which application is requested, and can identify the private key that is associated with this application-specific in order to use when the signature permission response.
Can sign subsequently License Check response 118 and this response sent it back client device 102 of License Check device service 116.The permission response of signing can be decrypted by included PKI in the application use application package subsequently.Use public-key by this way/whether License Check response 118 has been tampered private key or cheated the integrality of having guaranteed License Status inspection query script to detecting by the permission application.
In case receive effectively (for example, not having cheated) License Check response 118, just use and to take arbitrarily suitable action based on the content that responds.Such action can be compiled among the strategy of how to make a response when control is applied in it and receives specific response.For example, if the response indicating user is used by suitable permission to use, then this application can be programmed to continue normal execution.On the other hand, if the not licensed use of response indicating user is used, then this application can be carried out different programming responses, such as the unauthorized use of notifying the user to using and forbid, and provides link or other mechanism that allows the user to secure permission.Application can also be closed voluntarily, prevents thus any further use to this application.
When in some cases, this strategy is also controlled and is applied in it and for example receives not auth response owing to server error or application examples as in the situation that equipment off-line how to make a response when not receiving response at all.In such example, this strategy can be determined suitably action based on passing License Check response.For example, if use the License Check request before having sent ten, and ten License Check responses of licensed this application of use of indicating user and/or equipment have been received, then this strategy can auth response or response disappearance be as unusually ignoring with this, and this application can be allowed to continue normal execution.Similarly, if use the License Check response that has received ten these users of indication and/or not licensed this application of use of equipment, then this strategy can be forbidden the further execution of this application.
Other customization constraint also can or alternatively be included in this strategy.For example, use when suitably not permitted when response indication, this application can continue to carry out, but can such as by forbidding only to licensed user can with feature only provide limited function to non-permitted user.Use therefore and can as free version (freemium) distribution network model of free mode, operate, make the user have an opportunity to take to move to upgrade to senior version (premium) pattern of complete feature.As another example, before by complete or partial invalidity, whether application examples is as being worth the user of purchase to allow the non-permission to use of certain quantity for Test Application.In other cases, application can provide for example seven days trial period, does not have licensedly also can use all or part of function even use during this period.The constraint of these and other type can be set up by software publishing side, and it can be processed the License Status that is returned in the License Check response in any mode that the publisher thinks fit.
In some implementations, the operating system of carrying out on the equipment can be alternatively or additionally is configured to receive the License Check response that sends from License Check device service 116 and it is made a response.In such realization, the mode that can react is similar with using as described above, and operating system can respond at 118 o'clock and initiate suitably action receiving effective License Check.For example, use and not have the licensed License Check that uses at client device to respond at 118 o'clock receiving indication, operating system can stop using.
Fig. 2 is the concept map for the multilayer system 200 of the License Status that checks software application.In system 200, it is 210 resident and be executed on the client device that the application 205 of myApp by name and market user hold.The market user holds 210 can be configured to communicate with permit server 215 in the long-range execution of client device, with the License Status of the myApp 205 that determines to move at client device.In order to check the License Status of myApp 205, this application examples be as can holding 210 to transmit the License Check requests to the market user by remote I PC 240, and the market user holds 210 then can inquire about permit server 215 for the License Status of myApp 205.
MyApp 205 can compile to comprise for example license storehouse, main activities module 225 and the PKI 230 of LVL 220 by software publishing side.Usually, LVL 220 can be used to carry out as described herein various License Check technology, main activities module 225 can comprise the instruction relevant with the major function of using, and PKI 230 can be used to myApp205 is verified from the permission response that permit server 215 receives.In some implementations, software publishing side can carry out Fuzzy Processing (obfuscation) or the scale-of-two package of application, and this can be so that illegal user be difficult to change or distort and use or LVL.
LVL 220 can be developed and safeguarded by the trusted organization of operation licensed service, and can be provided to software publishing side to simplify the realization of License Check in its application.LVL 220 can comprise the internal sorting that all or part function of carrying out is processed during License Status inquiry, hold 210 initiating the License Status request such as the contact market user, and checking and confirm any response to the License Status request.LVL 220 can also provide one or more interfaces, and it allows software publishing side to insert custom code in order to define suitable admission policy and based on the access control of the response of License Status request being managed to using.
In some implementations, LVL 220 comprises the API that facilitates for the request of the current License Status of using.Can accept one or more parameters to calling of this API.For example, API Calls can accept to use the random number that generates, and it can be used to confirm any permission response of returning.API Calls can also be accepted application identities symbol parameter, such as the defined application package title that can allow licensed service identification to use in the inventory (manifest) from application market.API Calls can also be accepted such as defined application version code parameter in the inventory.API can also receive callback function, and it can process asynchronous response from permit server 215 as representing function.
Main active module 225 can comprise the instruction relevant with the major function of using, and can comprise the one or more of LVL 220 are called.For example, during application start, main active module 225 can comprise calling in early days so that the License Status request is carried out LVL 220.Main active module 225 can also or alternatively comprise other of LVL 220 called so that the concrete execution point place permission status request outside starting.For example, particular game is used first three rank can allow permitted user not to play this game, but may permit for further schedule requirement.Comprise calling LVL 220 during any rank that in this case, main active module 225 can be after the user attempts accessing first three.
In some implementations, permit server 215 can be registered as to buy at user (for example, via the user account of registering with system) and use or use in the situation about can freely use and think that the user is licensed.In order suitably to identify the user and to determine License Status, server can be held 210 form reception and application and user-dependent information with the License Status request from the market user.Such as in the realization that license and equipment rather than specific user bundle, the License Status request can be additionally or is alternatively comprised and the device-dependent information of attempting to carry out application.Like this specific to use, specific to the user and/or specific to the information of equipment can by use, the market user hold 210 or the two combination collected.This information can be used to identify subsequently attempts carrying out specific user or the equipment of using, and whether it can compare to determine to use to be bought by application market by the user who identifies or equipment with purchaser record data 255 subsequently.
According to shown realization, myApp 205 does not directly inquire about permit server 215, holds 210 to initiate license request but call the market user by remote I PC 240.In other was realized, application examples allowed the directly logic of inquiry permit server 215 of this application as comprising in LVL 220.License request can comprise various types of specific to using, determine with permission permit server 215 specific to the user and/or specific to the information of equipment the License Status of using.For example, myApp 205 can deliver to the market user with interim number with its package title and hold 210 in remote I PC calls.MyApp 205 can also send readjustment, can hold the 210 asynchronous myApp of being back to 205 from the market user by this readjustment from the response of permit server 215.
In some implementations, the market user holds 210 can have the permissibility larger than myApp 205, and the therefore additional information of malice collection and user and/or device-dependent, such as main account user name, IMSI and the out of Memory of equipment.The market user holds 210 can represent subsequently myApp 205 to permit server 215 transmission License Check requests.
In case receive the License Check request, permit server 215 just can be assessed this request by the use suitable available information relevant with user, equipment and/or application when attempting setting up the identity of user and/or equipment with enough level of trust.If the identity of user and/or equipment is set up, permit server 215 just can contrast subsequently purchaser record 255 these identity of inspection of application and return permission response, and the market user holds 210 this permission response can be back to application by the IPC readjustment subsequently.
In order to ensure the integrality of query with permission, permit server 215 can use private key 235 signature permission response data, and this private key 235 can be the right part of RSA key of sharing between server and the Application issuance side.In some implementations, licensed service can for each publisher's account generate license key to and in the profile page of account, provide PKI.The publisher can copy subsequently this PKI and it is embedded in the application source code.When compile source code, PKI 230 is embedded among the application, and this application can be issued in application market subsequently.Permit server 215 can inner keep private key 235 and with its sign permission response of the application of issuing for the account.
When application received the response that utilizes private key 235 signatures, it can use embedded private key 230 verification msgs.The password that uses public-key in licensed service can allow to use to detect to be tampered or cheated response.
Fig. 3 illustrates the License Check of example and the diagram of response.License Status described above check technology before in the example, be applied in whenever using via market of its License Status of wanting to confirm this application permit server inquired about.As shown in Figure 3, application can also improve with cache mechanism the performance of licensing system.Such realization for example can be used in the situation that can not or be not easy to access permission server when application asks for permission state at every turn.For example, can be at equipment for example because this equipment have network connection or use high-speed cache can't communicate with permit server because of the permit server off-line time.In such example, application still is allowed to carry out work based on the license status data of high-speed cache.
Can add one or more License Checks to the main activities module 305 of using as described above with reference to Figure 2.For example, application can comprise License Check in the onCreate of this application () method, thereby just calls License Check when user starts application.License Check can also be added to other concrete execution point place.For example, some application can comprise the active module that a plurality of other application can be carried out.Under these circumstances, be not directly to be started by the user to be able to suitable license even License Check also can be included in those active modules to guarantee to use yet.
License Check can utilize two main interfaces-License Check device interface 310 and License Check device callback interface 315.License Check device interface 310 can comprise calling the method for initiating License Check.For example, in LVL, this can be calling the checkAccess () method of using constructed LicenseChecker object.
License Check device callback interface 315 can comprise the readjustment that returns the License Check result.This interface can be stated two kinds of methods, allow () and dontAllow (), and they can be called based on the result of License Check by LVL.These two kinds of methods can realize allowing or not allowing the user to using to access with arbitrarily suitable logic.Can also state that additional applicationError () method is to process any application error of being dished out during the License Check.
As shown in FIG., the code instance in the main active module 305 of application License Check device 310 and License Check device adjust back 315 objects.When making up License Check device 310, code can be carried and comprise that application context, the strategy that will use and publisher are used for the parameter of the PKI of license.
This code calls the checkAccess () method of License Check device 310 subsequently.The method can access strategy 325 for example to determine whether high-speed cache has effective permission response in this locality.If so, then checkAccess () can call allow () method in the License Check device readjustment 315.Otherwise License Check device 310 can initiate to be sent to the License Check request of permit server.
When receive when response from permit server, License Check device 310 can create License Authentication device 330,330 pairs of license data of signing of this License Authentication device and verify from the various information that response is extracted.This information can be sent to strategy and be used for further assessment to determine that this license is for user whether effective (335).If license is confirmed as effectively, then strategy 325 can should respond by high-speed cache, and can notify validator 330, and this validator 330 can call the allow () method of License Check device readjustment 315 subsequently.If license is also non-effective, then strategy 325 can be notified validator 330, and this validator 330 can call the dontAllow () method of License Check device readjustment 31 subsequently.In some implementations, effective or invalid License Status can be encrypted and local storage on computing equipment, for example is stored in the high-speed cache.In the situation that application error, such as when using the license of attempting the invalid package title of inspection, License Check device 310 can be delivered to errored response the applicationError () method of License Check device readjustment.
Utilize the License Info be cached as described above, to the subsequent calls of checkAccess () can access cache License Info rather than contact license server.In some implementations, the license data of high-speed cache can be used in such as strategy 325 defined concrete situations.For example, when checkAccess () method is called but computing equipment is when lacking the connection of permit server, can return error message to application from the license client.And then application can be obtained the license status data of high-speed cache.
In some implementations, strategy 325 can comprise cache time out information, and it prevents that outmoded license status data is used.For example, strategy 325 can be wiped to be stored and reach for example license status data of the high-speed cache of the concrete time cycle in a week.In other was realized, the license status data of high-speed cache can be retained the longer time section, but strategy 325 can be ignored too outmoded cached data.Why whether the data of high-speed cache are too outmoded determines to depend on the access cache data.For example, accessed cached data can be considered to effectively reach a week owing to lacking network connection, in order to improve the accessed cached data of system performance then only being considered in one hour at the most effectively, perhaps for example effective for specific user's session.
Fig. 4 is the swimming lane figure for the process 400 of the License Status of request and process software application.Process 400 for example can be realized by the multilayer system 200 of Fig. 2.Present for clear, below describe and use multilayer system 200 as the basis of description process 400.Yet, can carry out this process with another system or system in combination.
Usually, the License Status of the application that process 400 can be used to carry out on the verification client device, and can be called by any suitable point the term of execution using.This application be such as can generating safe random number R (405) with the Secure Random function of JAVA, and can preserve this and be worth being used for and quote future.This application can initiate to call to check the License Status (410) of application subsequently, such as by calling the checkLicense () method in the License Authentication storehouse and transmitting R and the callbackFunction parameter.In checkLicense (), also can transmit the additional or alternative parameter specific to application.CheckLicense () method for example can be used subsequently " intent " or " binder " or other suitable mechanism to be invoked at the market user who carries out on the client device and hold application.
The market user holds application can receive intent (415), and can attempt collection and user and/or device-dependent information (420).For example, what the market user held that application can identify the center signs for (sign-on) service-user name, telephone number (MSISDN), IMSI, Mobile Equipment Identifier, and perhaps other is suitable specific to the user or specific to the information of equipment.This information can be known as identity information.In some implementations, identity information may not trusted by market API server, so the identity of user and equipment remains uncertain.On the contrary, this information can be considered to market API server operable signal when it attempts the identity of definite user or equipment.
The market user holds application examples to check the license issue as sending to market API server by HTTPS, and it transmits R, Apply Names and identity information (425).In some implementations, acting server can be used to add MSISDN information with not encryption section transmission, and this can provide can be by the employed more user identity signal of market API server.
In case receive this inspection license issue, market API server just can record all or part information included in this issue, it can be used to help identification duplicity subscriber identity information subsequently.Along with passage of time, a plurality of irregular signal that market API server receives can be used to the identification deception.For example, market API server can keep computing equipment that client application carries out thereon with and carry out related between the identity information that the user of this application is associated.Market API server can also keep track user to carry out quantity and the identity of the equipment of application thereon.In some implementations, if particular user identity is associated with the execution that is applied on the different client devices of some quantity, then this can indicate deception, and this user identity may not be verified as the licensed user of application-specific.Also can realize that other prevents the mechanism of cheating by market API server, and this can be based on the identity information that receives at market API server in time.
Market API server can confirm that user and/or equipment have effective license (430) of use using, such as by checking to check whether Apply Names is registered the user who is associated to this subscriber identity information.Market API server can also be set up the level of trust relevant with user identity (435).For example, market API server can be to being its that people's who is claimed level of trust from the subscriber identity information that receives before issue and institute's data analysis of storing with definite this user.
If use the user be registered to the subscriber identity information, and if market API server for example be sure of that with certain probability rank this user is its people who is claimed, then API server in market can generate the return message of " licensed ".Otherwise market API server can generate the return message of " not licensed ".This return message subsequently can be combined with additional information, and this additional information for example comprises Apply Names, R, package title, the system identifier that is associated with the user and/or timestamp.Market API server can use the private key that is associated with the publisher to return messages and any additional information sign (440).
The data of signing and signature can be returned to market user end subsequently, itself then can return signature result (445) to client application.For example, market user end can utilize and call call back function as the signed data of parameter and signature and be back to client application with the result that will sign.
Client application subsequently can via intent result receive the signature result (450), and can use public-key to the signature result be decrypted (455).This PKI may embed among the client application when application is compiled, and can be used to verify the result's that signs integrality.Client application can also compare the rreturn value (460) in the signed data.For example, the application R that can relatively return is complementary to verify the random number that itself and process are generated when beginning.
In checking this when response during from the significant response of market API server, how client application for example can make a response to allowed results based on strategy decision subsequently.For example, application can be in the situation that the licensed repertoire that provides be provided for return messages indications, and can in the situation that the return messages indication use and not licensedly limited function be provided or function is not provided.In some implementations, client application can be determined suitable the action together with its own signal based on the strategy that is associated with application with the information of signature among the result.
Fig. 5 shows that have can be by License Status check system described above and process the table of the example states code utilize.Table 500 expression can be included in from the market user and hold example states code the response of client application.State code in the table 500 all is included in client application and initiates the mistake that the License Status inspection occurs afterwards and returned by market user's end because permit server does not receive License Status inspection request with unsigning.Client application can be configured to according to the defined strategy of client application these or other state code be processed.
Table 550 expression can be back in response to License Status inspection request the example states code of client application from permit server.Unless otherwise noted, client application can be verified the response from permit server otherwise this state code is signed.Client application can be configured to according to the defined strategy of client application these or other state code be processed as described above.
