Detailed Description
Coordinating logistics and warehouse managers
A warehouse and supply chain coordinator is disclosed herein. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may coordinate and optimize various elements (elements) in one or more supply chains. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may receive data from a plurality of data sources and computer systems, such as, but not limited to: warehouse Management Systems (WMSs) operating in different warehouses, transportation systems (including freight brokerage systems and/or on-board monitoring systems for real-time Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) estimation), and demand forecasting systems. Some or all of the functionality described herein of the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may be implemented using software executing one or more (networked) computing devices; that is, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may be software executing in the "cloud".
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may provide services including, but not limited to: a warehouse control service; a robot control service for controlling robots in a warehouse and/or an autonomous vehicle; services that coordinate inventory replenishment from multiple supply chain levels (levels); coordinating the services of freight and transport transactions, including merging partial vehicle loads, improving vehicle utilization and reducing empty (empty) driving range; and rationalizing the services of the transport network. In some examples, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator is used to control one supply chain; such as a supply chain of a company or other enterprise. In other examples, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator is part of a marketplace and/or ecosystem where service providers for warehousing, freight transportation, etc. match service requirements.
Example warehouse control services include, but are not limited to: yard management services for vehicle arrival to the warehouse, such as routing trucks and/or other vehicles to appropriate loading, staging, and/or parking locations; services related to coordinating robots and/or other agents with vehicle arrival at (loading stations of) a warehouse based on vehicle traceability and real-time ETA to maximize warehouse throughput; services related to controlling robots within a warehouse to move inventory; a service of automatic virtual goods reception based on knowledge of vehicle content and successful robotic offloading; a service for "racking" or locating inventory within a warehouse (e.g., locating inventory based on planned and/or actual Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) speeds); a service for "re-racking" or relocating inventory within the warehouse (e.g., based on changes in planned and/or actual SKU speed and/or available warehouse space); a service that redistributes inventory between customer orders based on priority or required transit time; and services for automated virtual goods delivery based on knowledge of vehicle content and successful robot loading.
In this document, unless explicitly stated otherwise, the term "pallet" means a container of one or more goods that can be brought to, stored in and/or obtained from a warehouse; for example, the tray may include one or more of: trays, boxes, bags, sacks, cartons, crates, packages, packets, and/or other containers (or other objects) associated with the goods that may be brought to, stored in, and/or obtained from the warehouse.
For example, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may estimate arrival and departure times of vehicles arriving and departing from the warehouse or other location. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may determine the pallet arrangement based on arrival and/or departure times. For example, the arrangement of trays associated with the loading dock may include a first tray associated with a first vehicle and a second tray associated with a second vehicle.
If the first vehicle is arranged to reach the loading bay before the second vehicle, the first tray may be closer to the loading bay than the second tray, thereby shortening the distance between the position of the first tray and the position of the first vehicle at the loading bay, thus reducing the loading time of the first vehicle. However, if the estimated arrival time changes such that the first vehicle is now estimated to arrive after the second vehicle, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may responsively command the one or more robots to modify the tray arrangement such that the second tray is closer to the loading station than the first tray, thereby reducing the loading time of the second vehicle. Example arrangements of trays (and/or other objects) may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a row of trays (and/or other objects), a grid of regular or irregular trays (and/or other objects), a stack of trays (and/or other objects), a pyramidal tray (and/or other objects), and/or other tray (and/or other object) arrangement.
As another example, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may manage resources associated with the warehouse, such as load station slots, parking locations, storage space (e.g., space for storing pallets), warehouse access, and robots at the warehouse. Resources may be managed by reserving or allocating resources for one or more vehicles, robots, and/or other entities, releasing or deallocating resources from one or more vehicles, robots, and/or other entities, switching reservations between vehicles, robots, and/or other entities, providing information about managing resources (e.g., scheduling of allocation slots, data whether or not a particular parking space is available at a particular time, information about robot location).
In some cases, resources may be allocated based on estimated and/or actual arrival times; for example, when a vehicle actually arrives at a warehouse, the vehicle may be granted access to the warehouse, a time slot for a loading dock may be reserved for vehicles scheduled to arrive at the warehouse at the time slot, and the robot may be directed to arrive at the loading dock at or about the same time that the vehicle arrives at the loading dock. Then, when the estimated arrival time (or departure time) changes, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may: (1) releasing the original time slot of the loading dock and/or parking space from the vehicle scheduled to arrive at the changed arrival time (or departure time); (2) reserving an original time slot for a loading dock and/or parking space for vehicles scheduled to arrive (or depart) before the changed arrival time (or departure time), (3) reserving a new time slot for a loading dock and/or parking space for vehicles scheduled to arrive (or depart) at the changed arrival time (or departure time), and (4) scheduling one or more robots at the loading dock at or before the original time slot and/or the new time slot. The original and/or new time slot and/or parking space may be based on a changed arrival time (or departure time); for example, a reserved time slot includes/starts at an estimated time of arrival, a reserved time slot ends before/before an estimated time of departure, a parking space is reserved from the estimated time of arrival to the time slot start, and so on.
In addition, other resources (such as warehouse access (access) and robots) may be based on arrival time or departure; for example, a warehouse door may be opened to enable vehicle access at the arrival time and/or departure time, a robot may be scheduled at a loading station at the arrival of the vehicle and/or until the departure of the vehicle, space in the warehouse may be made available for pallets scheduled to be unloaded from vehicles arriving at the ETA, the pallets may be moved toward and/or to the loading station at the estimated arrival time to be loaded onto vehicles arriving at the estimated arrival time. More specifically, the robot may be assigned to a task based on the arrival time or departure time. These tasks may include: at least X minutes before the truck reaches the load station, one or more pallets are picked up and brought to the load station, where X is an estimated number of minutes to bring the pallets from their location in the warehouse to the load station. These tasks may be scheduled based on the estimated arrival time of the truck, thereby reducing or eliminating congestion at the loading dock to reduce or eliminate delays in transporting pallets from the warehouse to the truck.
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may direct the robot to perform various tasks within and around the warehouse, such as, but not limited to: loading a vehicle, unloading a vehicle, pick-and-place operations (where a robot takes (or "picks") one or more items (such as pallets) from one location and then carries (or "places") the one or more items to a second location), inspecting the goods, and exchanging the items between locations.
To inspect the merchandise, the robot may inspect the merchandise tray; for example, a pallet arriving at the vehicle and/or a pallet already stored in a warehouse to determine whether the goods of the pallet meet a contract. For example, assume that under contractual provisions, a pallet of merchandise including 100 mobile devices will be transported by truck T1 to warehouse W1 where robot R1 is located. In this example, it is assumed that truck T1 includes only one pallet P1 to be unloaded at warehouse W1. Then, upon arrival of truck T1, robot R1 may possibly check pallet P1 carried by truck T1 before unloading P1 from truck T1 into warehouse W1 to determine whether pallet P1 actually includes 100 mobile devices. If robot R1 determines that tray P1 includes 100 mobile devices, robot R1 may notify the warehouse and supply chain coordinator that the inspection of tray P1 was successful, and the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may do both: (a) generate a receipt for tray P1 and (b) instruct robot R1 and/or one or more other robots to unload tray P1 from truck T1 into warehouse W1. Otherwise, if robot R1 determines that tray P1 does not include 100 mobile devices, robot R1 may notify the warehouse and supply chain coordinator that the inspection of tray P1 failed, and the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may reject the shipment of tray P1, and direct robot R1 and/or one or more other robots to leave tray P1 on truck T1 as a reject good. In some cases, rejecting shipment of the merchandise tray includes sending a rejection notification to a supplier of the merchandise tray to inform the supplier that the tray has been rejected. Many other examples of checking and/or rejecting merchandise are possible.
In some examples, the warehouse and the supply chain coordinator may coordinate other aspects of the supply chain than the warehouse. For example, a warehouse and supply chain coordinator may determine one or more orders requesting production, storage, and/or shipping of one or more merchandise trays using a supply chain that includes the warehouse and supply chain coordinator. The supply chain may further include locations, such as supplier locations, warehouses, and retail locations, connected by a plurality of routes, such as roads, water routes, and/or empty roads, in which at least one pallet is transferred from a first location to a second location using a vehicle traveling on a route from the first location to the second location, wherein at least one of the first location and the second location includes a warehouse capable of storing the at least one pallet, and wherein the vehicle includes an autonomous vehicle configured to be controlled by the warehouse and supply chain coordinator. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may then determine whether an event related to at least one pallet has occurred. The event may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: events related to the merchandise of the at least one tray, events related to the first location and/or the second location, events related to an autonomous vehicle, weather related events, season related events, events related to search queries and/or results, events related to advertising and/or social media, and other types of events. In some cases, the event comprises an event that the location does not store at least a quantity of the item; for example, relatively low and/or the article is used up.
After determining that the event relates to at least one pallet, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may change the path of the vehicle to a third location in the supply chain. As one particular example, assume that the merchandise tray includes bottled water, and the warehouse and supply chain coordinator determines that an event E1 occurs in which a hurricane or other storm is predicted to reach the third location (thus increasing demand for bottled water at the third location) but not the second location. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may then change the path of the vehicle carrying the tray with bottled water to a third location. As another specific example, assume that the merchandise tray includes football jerseys, and the warehouse and supply chain coordinator determines that event E2 occurs, wherein the location of the scheduled football game is moved from the second location to a third location. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may then change the path of the vehicle carrying the tray with the football suit to a third location. As a third particular example, assume that the merchandise pallet includes item I, and the warehouse and supply chain coordinator determines that event E3 occurred, wherein search queries and/or results including references to item I are substantially increased with respect to the third location, but search queries and/or results including references to item I associated with the second location are not increased. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may then change the path of the vehicle carrying the pallet with item I to a third location. Many other examples are possible.
Some or all locations in the supply chain may have priorities, which may change based on events. Continuing with the bottled water example above, assume that the priority of the second location prior to E1 is P2_ beam and the priority of the third location prior to E1 is P3_ beam, where P2_ beam is higher than P3_ beam because the second location is the destination of the merchandising tray having bottled water. Then, AFTER determining that E1 occurred, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may recalculate or otherwise determine that the priority of the third location is P3_ aft, where P3_ aft is a higher priority than P2_ beam. Then, since P3_ enter is a higher priority than P2_ beam, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may change the path of the vehicle containing the tray with bottled water to a third location.
In some cases, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may trigger replenishment of new orders and/or supplies based on existing orders and/or changed orders. For example, assume that warehouse and supply chain determination order O1 orders quantity Q1 of commodity G1 to be shipped from location L1 to location L2. The warehouse and supply chain may then route and/or otherwise allocate vehicle V1 to extract at least the quantity Q1 of commodity G1 from location L1 and to ship the quantity Q1 of commodity G1 to location L2. In this example, after the routing vehicle V1 extracts quantity Q1 of commodity G1 at location L1, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator determines that location L1 does not have quantity Q1 of commodity G1, but that another location L3 has at least quantity Q1 of commodity G1. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may then reroute and/or otherwise redistribute vehicle V1 to extract at least the quantity Q1 of commodity G1 from location L3.
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may replenish a quantity of merchandise by ordering items from a supplier. Continuing with the above example, after the warehouse and supply chain coordinator determines that location L1 does not have quantity Q1 of commodity G1, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may generate and send to supplier S1 order O1 for quantity Q2 of commodity G1. Upon receiving order O1, the supplier S1 may send a response R1 to the warehouse and supply chain coordinator to indicate that order O1 is fulfilled and awaiting shipment. Upon sending order O1, upon receiving response R1 or at some other time, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may generate and send to vehicle V2 order O2 that draws quantity Q2 of commodity G1 from supplier S1. In some examples, order O2 also instructs vehicle V2 to take at least some of quantity G2 of item G1 from supplier S1 to location L1, where location L1 has no quantity Q1 of item G1. In other examples, order O2 also instructs vehicle V2 to take at least some of quantity Q2 of merchandise G1 from supplier S1 to another location L3. In yet other examples, order O2 also instructs vehicle V2 to bring at least some of quantity Q2 of commodity G1 from supplier S1 to location L1 via landmark location WL 1; for example, the commodity is picked up at WL1 and/or shipped to WL 1. When the vehicle V2 reaches the landmark location WL1 (or location L1), the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may receive information I1: the vehicle V2 has reached the landmark position WL1 (or position L1) or the vehicle V2 is scheduled to reach the landmark position WL1 (or position L1). Upon receiving the information I1, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may generate and send an order O3 to one or more robots at the landmark location WL1 (or location L1) to load and/or unload the vehicle V2. After the robot loads and/or unloads vehicle V2, vehicle V2 may leave landmark position WL1 (or position L1) and proceed to another position. Many other examples of routing vehicles, rerouting vehicles, ordering, replenishing, and/or other operations related to the warehouse and/or the supply chain are also possible.
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may provide services and/or applications related to the rationalization of the transportation network. In some examples, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator determines movement of goods, reviews possible shipping and warehousing permutations, and generates recommendations for a shipping network solution. Such solutions may include, but are not limited to, the following solutions: merging part of vehicle transportation to improve vehicle utilization rate/reduce empty driving range, and transferring goods among warehouses to improve vehicle and/or warehouse utilization rate; warehouse rearrangement and inventory placement to more economically utilize transportation routes and establish more efficient transportation networks, and in some cases, utilize inventory, warehouses, and vehicles owned by multiple parties.
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may efficiently coordinate the robot groups to optimize loading and unloading of vehicles at a facility, such as a loading bay of a warehouse. In particular, when a truck arrives, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator can precisely time the arrival of pallets in front of the loading bay and economically utilize the space of the loading bay; for example as a queue of trays. By planning/coordinating future robotic actions, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator can accurately determine the location of the pallet designated for transport, i.e., when the pallet designated for transport will arrive at the queue, when the pallet designated for transport will be staged at the top of the queue for immediate transport, etc. Designating one or more robots to move pallets in a pallet queue saves minutes for entering the vehicle, which may be more feasible than assigning manpower/drivers to move the pallets with a forklift. In addition, some robots are smaller than standard forklifts and can therefore fit more easily in the narrow spaces of the loading bay. Furthermore, the use of two or more robots directed and coordinated by the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may also allow for easier queue reordering by both reducing the number of operations used in queue reordering and by receiving navigational instructions from a single control system (rather than two autonomous agents attempting to coordinate their actions within the scope of the loading station).
In some examples, instructions and/or messages communicated between the warehouse and the supply chain coordinator and the robot are communicated between the warehouse and the supply chain coordinator and other agents other than the robot, such as, but not limited to, human agents, material handling systems operated and/or managed by humans, and robotic devices assisted by humans. Examples of material handling systems include, but are not limited to, electrical systems, mechanical systems, and electromechanical systems, such as automated pallet wrapping machines, power gates, and the like.
In other examples, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator operates using a work plan. In these examples, the trays may be physically placed on or near the loading station as directed by the work plan's expected tray movement schedule. Then, when the warehouse and supply chain coordinator receives data that the truck arrival time and/or the estimated arrival time has changed, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator may update the work plan according to the changed truck arrival time/estimated arrival time. In these examples, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator changes the work plan based on the truck arrival time/estimated arrival time changes, rather than scheduling a typical workflow of work within the warehouse based on a scheduled appointment for the arriving trucks.
The use of a warehouse and supply chain coordinator may make the supply chain more flexible, thereby increasing efficiency. Other efficiencies may be achieved by coordinating warehouse activity of arriving and departing trucks and time savings may be achieved when the supply chain coordinator schedules robots to wait for entering trucks and to schedule merchandise pallets destined for outgoing trucks near the loading dock. Fuel and time consumed by trucks waiting at the loading dock and the goods in the warehouse can also be saved. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may better provide visibility into the supply chain. By making the supply chain more efficient and flexible, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator can integrate transportation, routes, vehicles, warehouses, and suppliers.
Example warehouse and supply chain coordinator and supply chain
FIG. 1 is a diagram of a supply chain according to an example embodiment. The supply chain includes a warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100, suppliers 110, manufacturers 120, warehouses 130, 140, warehouse/distribution centers 150, warehouse/fulfillment centers 156, retailers 160, and customers 170, 172. These entities are connected by routes traversed by various vehicles including trucks 112, 124, 142, 144, 152, 158, air 134, sea 136 and drones 154, 162. In the supply chain shown in fig. 1, truck 112 traverses a route between supplier 110 and manufacturer 120, truck 124 traverses a route between manufacturer 120 and warehouse 130, and air and sea transports 134 and 136 traverse a route between warehouse 130 and warehouse 140.
As shown by the dashed lines in fig. 1, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may communicate with suppliers 110, manufacturers 120, warehouses 130, 140, warehouse/distribution centers 150, warehouse/fulfillment centers 152, and retailers 160. In some examples, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may communicate with additional entities; for example, some or all of trucks 112, 124, 142, 144, 152, 158, air transports 134, sea transports 136, customers 170, 172, and/or other entities associated with one or more supply chains; such as one or more robots and/or other agents operating in a warehouse, supplier, manufacturer, etc.
Also in the supply chain shown in fig. 1, the routes between the warehouse 140 and the warehouse/fulfillment center 150 are traversed by the truck 142, the routes between the warehouse 140 and the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 are traversed by the truck 144, the routes between the warehouse/fulfillment center 150 and the retailer 160 are traversed by the truck 152 and the drone 154 (i.e., an automated aerial vehicle acting as the drone 154), the routes between the retailer 160 and the customer 170 are traversed by the drone 162, and the routes between the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 and the customer 172 are traversed by the truck 158. In other examples, there may be more, fewer, and/or different routes and vehicle traverse routes in the supply chain. In still other examples, more, fewer and/or other locations are used in the supply chain; for example, there may be more and/or different suppliers, more and/or different manufacturers, more, fewer and/or different warehouses, etc. In even other examples, drones (such as 154, 162, and 164) are used to cover the "last mile" of a warehouse; for example, drones are used to transport items on routes from warehouses (such as warehouse 140, warehouse/distribution center 150, and/or warehouse/fulfillment center 156) to customers (such as customers 170, 172). In particular, fig. 1 shows the drone 164 transporting items from the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 to the customer 172.
In the supply chain shown in FIG. 1, a supplier location provides a manufacturer location with components for manufacturing and/or otherwise preparing one or more goods or shipments. In some examples, the manufacturer location and/or the supplier location store raw materials for manufacturing the components and/or the goods, such as raw materials 122 stored at manufacturer 120.
A supply chain may have one or more owners. For example, supplier 110 may be owned by a first company, manufacturer 120 may be owned by a second company, warehouses 130 and 140 may be owned by a third company, and so on. Furthermore, the vehicles in the supply chain may be owned by a different entity than their own building in the supply chain, where the building is shown in FIG. 1 using rounded rectangles; for example, the customers 170, 172 may be located in a building, such as a home, or in a business-related building, such as an office, factory, and/or other kind of business-related building; some or all of the suppliers 110, manufacturers 120, and warehouses 130, 140 may include one or more buildings or the like.
The supply chain may be managed by one or more entities, which may or may not own any buildings or vehicles in the supply chain. For example, a warehouse management company may operate warehouse 130 for the owner of warehouse 130; in other examples, an owner of repository 130 may manage/operate the repository.
Various data may be used to operate the supply chain. For example, data on a per SKU basis may be maintained; for example, the quantity of the item represented by the SKU at a particular location in the supply chain, SKU speed data, one or more costs, price, weight, size, volume, source and/or destination of the item represented by the SKU, and the like. Data may be maintained about buildings, locations and/or vehicles in the supply chain; for example, one or more locations, costs, prices, weights, sizes, volumes, sources, and/or destinations of buildings and/or vehicles in the supply chain; data about the route.
One or more computing devices executing software may be used as the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100. For example, one or more computing devices acting as a warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may act as a cloud and/or network based solution. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may include and/or communicate with a Warehouse Management System (WMS) for controlling operations within one or more warehouses and/or providing information regarding items/entities "upstream" (or logically closer to the supplier location). In the supply chain, items/entities such as the supplier 110 and/or downstream (or logically closer to customer locations such as the customers 170 or 172).
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may provide a user interface that enables a user to view, create, update, and delete data for operating a supply chain, and may send and receive messages to control various entities such as, but not limited to, robots, vehicles, and doors to access control systems (such as providing access to and/or egress from a building and/or other location). The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may also control various resources used in operating the warehouse and/or supply chain, such as access to facilities, time slots for loading/unloading vehicles, storage locations or "racks," parking spaces, and the capacity of the vehicles. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may provide visibility and control of goods moving through the supply chain; for example, visibility with respect to items upstream and/or downstream of one or more points in the supply chain (e.g., upstream and/or downstream of one or more selected warehouses, suppliers, retailers, and/or customers). Such visibility can be provided by tracking the shipment of goods throughout the supply chain and extracting information from those goods at the SKU level, thereby making a particular good visible in the supply chain; for example, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may provide information regarding the location of items having one or more given SKUs, the shipping location to carry items having one or more given SKUs, orders from one or more suppliers for items having one or more given SKUs to be processed, in progress, and/or fulfilled.
In managing and coordinating the transportation through the supply chain, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may communicate with various modes of transportation, such as air, sea, and land modes of transportation. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may consolidate loads from multiple warehouses into one shipment and consolidate loads from multiple shipments for storage in one warehouse. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may consider various limitations of a given warehouse, such as the number of loading stations, space for loading and/or unloading goods, the total amount of available storage, the type of storage facility (e.g., refrigerated storage, climate controlled storage, storage of liquid and/or gaseous goods), the availability of labor and/or robots to reduce and/or avoid warehouse inefficiencies. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may suspend the goods for order placement on a loading dock to improve the efficiency of loading the goods onto trucks, ships, railcars, airplanes, drones, and/or other vehicles; for example, the articles are temporarily stored in a tray arrangement, ensuring that the tray assigned to the truck at the loading dock is closest to the loading dock. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may also manage storage locations within the warehouse to enable efficient unloading of vehicles at the loading dock; for example, storage approaching a loading dock of an entry vehicle is allocated to the entry vehicle so that merchandise may be quickly unloaded from the entry vehicle into the allocated storage.
Fig. 2 shows a scenario 200 in which Order Related Data (ORD)220 triggers a shipment 222 to a retailer 160, according to an example embodiment. Scenario 200 involves the shipment 210 of an item G200 from the warehouse/distribution center 150 to the retailer 160 via a truck 152. After the shipment 210, order-related data 220 is communicated between the warehouse 140 and the supply chain coordinator 100, resulting in the shipment of the commodity G200 from the warehouse 140 to the warehouse/distribution center 150 via the truck 142.
The scenario 200 begins with the shipment 210 of the commodity G200 from the warehouse/distribution center 150 to the retailer 160 via the truck 152. The transport 210 is triggered by an order O200 from the retailer 160 to the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 for the item G200 (and possibly other items) before the situation 200 occurs. Upon receiving order O200, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 locates a warehouse with enough goods G200 to satisfy order O200; in this case, the warehouse/distribution center 150 has enough of the commodity G200 to satisfy the order O200. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 commands the trucks 152 to reach the warehouse/distribution center 150 to load the commodity G200 (and any other commodities available at the warehouse/distribution center 150 that satisfy the order O200) and to ship the loaded commodity G200 to the retailer 160.
After the truck 152 loads the commodity G200, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 communicates the order-related data 220 with the warehouse 140. In scenario 200, order-related data 220 includes orders from warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 to transport commodity G200 from warehouse 140 to warehouse/distribution center 150, orders to load commodity G200 from warehouse 140 to truck 142, and orders for robots (and possibly other agents) of warehouse 140 to load commodity G200 onto truck 142. In other examples, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 also includes an acknowledgement from warehouse 140 that commodity G200 is available therein or a notification from warehouse 140 that commodity G200 is not available.
After the truck 142 loads the commodity G200 at the warehouse 140, the transportation 222 begins, wherein the truck 142 transfers the commodity G200 (and possibly other commodities) to the warehouse/distribution center 150. Upon arrival at the warehouse/distribution center 150, the commodity G200 is unloaded from the truck 142 and the situation 200 may be completed.
In a related scenario, order related data 220 is communicated before the transport 210 begins. For example, order-related data 220 may include: before the retailer 160 actually places an order for the item G200 through the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100, the retailer 160 will order a forecast of the item G200 and/or a forecast order for the item G200 placed on behalf of the retailer 160. The prediction of the order for the article G200 and/or the predicted order for the article G200 may be based on order prediction data related to one or more entities (such as the retailer 160), where the order prediction data includes, but is not limited to:
point of sale (POS) data from the retailer 160 indicates the sale of the article G200,
inventory G200 of merchandise for the retailer 160 (e.g., if the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines that the retailer 160 has a relatively small quantity of merchandise G200, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may predictively order merchandise G200 for the retailer 160),
data about historical orders from retailers 160 (e.g., retailers 160 order G200 of merchandise at most or daily, three days, weeks, months, quarters, etc., so the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 can predictably order G200 of merchandise for retailers 160),
internet-related data, such as search query data related to the commodity G200, social media data, search conversion rates related to the commodity G200, and/or other data available over the Internet that indicates a customer is interested in the commodity G200 (e.g., if the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines that a relatively large number of searches involving terms such as "G200" have been conducted, perhaps by the retailer 160 or a user in a nearby area, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may order the commodity G200 for the retailer 160 predictably), and
data indicating trends in POS data, inventory data, data relating to historical orders, Internet related data and/or other data
In a related scenario, order related data 220 includes a predicted order for an item G200 of retailer 160, which has been sent to warehouse 140. After communicating the forecasted orders for the good G200 to the warehouse 140, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 orders two shipments: the shipment 210 of the commodity G200 from the warehouse 140 to the warehouse/distribution center 150, and the shipment 222 from the warehouse/distribution center 150 to the retailer 160. If the warehouse/distribution center 150 has enough goods G200 to satisfy the predicted order, then the shipments 210 and 222 may occur in parallel, and/or the shipment 222 may precede the shipment 210. If the warehouse/distribution center 150 does not have enough items G200 to satisfy the predicted order, the shipment 222 may precede the shipment 210.
As such, the scenario 200 may be considered a "reactive" scenario, where the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 reacts to the order O200 of the commodity G200 from the retailer 160 to replenish the warehouse/distribution center 150. Further, the related scenario described above may be considered an "active" scenario, where the retailer 160 does not actually place an order, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 places a predicted order for the article G200 on behalf of the retailer 160.
In general, order related data (such as order related data 220) may include one or more of: the order, order forecast data, order forecasts, forecast orders, order confirmations, event notifications, notifications of orders that cannot be executed and/or satisfied, data regarding inspection of goods in and/or associated with the supply chain, and/or other data related to one or more orders related to the supply chain. In some embodiments, the order-related data may be generated and/or processed using machine learning techniques that utilize a neural network for finding patterns in data, such as order-related data, and generating predicted orders and/or other commands based on patterns found in the data. These modes may include, but are not limited to: patterns in the order forecast data (e.g., data indicating trends) and/or other data described above. Other, and/or additional, techniques may also be used, or instead of, machine learning techniques to generate and/or process order related data.
Fig. 3 shows a scenario 300 in which an event 320 triggers the rerouting of a transport, according to an example embodiment. Scenario 300 involves the occurrence of an event 320 related to the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 while the shipment 310 of an item G300 is on the way from the warehouse 140 to the warehouse/distribution center 150 via truck 142. The warehouse/fulfillment center 156 sends event notifications 322 regarding the events 320 to the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines: due to the event 320, the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 has a higher priority on the item G300 than the warehouse/distribution center 150. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then sends a reroute message 330 to reroute the truck 142 to deliver the item G300 to the warehouse/fulfillment center 156. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a routing message 340 to the truck 144 to route the truck to the warehouse 140 to extract the commodity G300 and to ship the commodity G300 to the warehouse/distribution center 150. In addition, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends an event notification 342 to notify the warehouse/distribution center 150 to: the truck 142 has been rerouted and the truck 144 brought the commodity G300 to the warehouse/distribution center 150.
At the beginning of the situation 300, the truck 142 carries the commodity G300 to the warehouse/distribution center 150 as part of the shipment 310. Then, an event 320 occurs, wherein the event 320 is associated with the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 and the item G300. As one example, if the article G300 comprises bottled water, and the event 320 is a "hurricane landing near the warehouse/fulfillment center 156," the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 may have an increased demand for bottled water. As another example, if the item G300 comprises team a's uniform and the event 320 is "team a has just announced a large game near the warehouse/fulfillment center 156," the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 may have an increased demand for team a's uniform. As a third example, the event 320 may be "the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 has sold a month of the supply of the item G300 within a day," and the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 may have an increased demand for the item G300. Other events related to the item G300 and the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 are also possible.
Upon the occurrence of the event 320, the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 sends an Event Notification (EN)322 notifying the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 of the occurrence of the event 320. In some examples, event notification 322 also includes a request to change the priority of one or more items; for example, when event 320 is a prediction of an impending storm, a request is made to increase the priority of the snow scraper; after canceling the competition with team B, a request is made to lower the priority or the like of the equipment related to team B. In addition to increasing or decreasing demand for items, there are other reasons that may change the priority of shipping (or picking) items to a location, such as the priority of shipping items G300 to warehouse/fulfillment center 156, e.g., reasons related to cost changes, such as monetary costs of shipping and/or items, reasons related to shipment of items; for example, total miles driven by vehicles at a given location, costs associated with carbon footprint, reasons related to entities in the supply chain (such as warehouses, vehicles, manufacturers, or suppliers); for example, the capacity of a increases or decreases, damage to the entity, surplus or deficit in the entity's merchandise, etc. Many other reasons for changing the priority of goods, transports, and/or entities in the supply chain are also possible.
The scenario 300 continues with the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 receiving an event notification 322. Then, based on the event notification 322, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 changes the priority of the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 to have a higher priority than the warehouse/distribution center 150 for the item G300 and then determines to reroute the truck 142 to the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 to ship the high priority item G300. Rerouting the truck 142 effectively eliminates the transport 310 to the warehouse/distribution center 150. In other cases, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may change one or more priorities associated with the items G300, the trucks 142, the warehouse/distribution center 150, the warehouse/fulfillment center 156, and/or the transports 310 for reasons other than the event notification 322; for example, some or all of the reasons listed above for changing the priority.
After the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines to reroute the truck 142, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a reroute message 330 to the truck 142 to reroute the truck 142 to transport the item G300 to the warehouse/fulfillment center 156. In response to the reroute message 330, the truck 142 stops the transportation 310 and then starts the transportation 332 to the warehouse/fulfillment center 156.
The scenario 300 continues with the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determining that a quantity of the commodity G300 is available at the warehouse 140 and that the truck 144 is available to transport the commodity G300 from the warehouse 140 to the warehouse/distribution center 150. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then sends a route message 340 to the truck 144 to route the truck to the warehouse 140 to extract the commodity G300 and to ship the commodity G300 to the warehouse/distribution center 150. In addition, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends an event notification 342 to notify the warehouse/distribution center 150 that the truck 142 is rerouted and that the truck 144 will bring the commodity G300 to the warehouse/distribution center 150. In some examples, event notification 342 includes ETA of truck 142/commodity G300.
After the truck 142 transports the item G300 to the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 as part of the shipment 332, the scenario 300 may be completed. In other cases, the truck 142 transports the item G300 to the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 before the truck 144 is routed to the warehouse 140 and/or before the event notification 342 is sent to the warehouse/distribution center 150.
Fig. 4 shows a scenario 400 according to an example embodiment, where order related data 410 triggers a transportation 424, 426 from supplier to manufacturer and from manufacturer to warehouse. The scenario 400 involves communication of order-related data 410 between the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 and the manufacturer 120, resulting in the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sending an order 420 to the supplier 110, wherein the order 420 requests a shipment 424 of the raw material 122 to the manufacturer 120. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 also sends an order 422 to the manufacturer 120 to request the commodity G400 in the predicted quantity FA400, and then transports the commodity G400 to the warehouse 130. The manufacturer 120 manufactures a commodity G400 in a predicted quantity FA400 and uses the truck 124 to be shipped to the warehouse 130 as part of the shipment 426. Once the transport 426 reaches the warehouse 130, and the commodity G400 is unloaded from the truck 124 at the warehouse 130, the scenario 400 ends.
FIG. 4 illustrates a scenario 400 beginning with the communication of order related data 410 between the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 and the manufacturer 120. Specifically, for scenario 400, order-related data 410 includes a request from the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 for the maximum number of items G400 that can be manufactured based on the amount of raw materials 122 at the manufacturer 120. In response to the request, the manufacturer 120 sends a response message informing the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 of the quantity a400 of the good G400 that can be manufactured using the quantity of raw material 122 at the manufacturer 120, and the raw material 122 is the limiting factor; that is, the number of commercial products G400 that can be manufactured is limited by the number of raw materials 122.
After receiving the response message, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines a predicted quantity FA400 of the good G400 that may be needed at the warehouse 130. In scenario 400, the predicted quantity FA400 for the item G400 is determined using order prediction data for the item G400, which is discussed in the context of scenario 200 and FIG. 2. More specifically, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines the forecasted quantity FA400 based on trends in orders for the good G400 and order data indicating orders for the good G400 that are likely to arrive in the near future.
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 also determines in the response message that the predicted quantity FA400 of the good G400 is greater than the quantity a400 provided by the manufacturer 120. The response message also indicates that the raw material 122 is the limiting factor for producing the article G400. Since the raw materials 122 are the limiting factor in producing the commodity G400, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines that the manufacturer 120 will require more raw materials 122 to produce the commodity G400 for at least the predicted quantity FA 400.
After determining that the manufacturer 120 will need more raw materials 122, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends an order 420 to the supplier 110 of raw materials 122 on behalf of the manufacturer 120. In response to the order 420, the supplier 110 produces the raw material 122 and places the raw material 122 on the truck 112 as part of the shipment 424 to the manufacturer 120. In some cases, the supplier 110 notifies the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 and/or the manufacturer 120 of the raw material 122 on the truck 112 as part of the shipment 424.
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 also sends an order 422 to the manufacturer 120 to request the commodity G400 in the predicted quantity FA400 and subsequently ship the commodity G400 to the warehouse 130. The order 422 also notifies the manufacturer 120 that the order 420 for the raw material 122 has been placed on behalf of the manufacturer 120. In some cases, order 422 includes information about shipment 424 and/or truck 112; such as ETA for shipment 424, as well as identifying information about truck 112, the carrier providing shipment 424, and the like.
After unloading raw materials 122 in shipment 424 at manufacturer 120, and manufacturer 120 receives an order 422 for the predicted quantity of commodity G400 for FA400, manufacturer 120 manufactures the commodity G400 for the predicted quantity FA 400. After the predicted quantity FA400 of commodity G400 is manufactured, the predicted quantity FA400 of commodity G400 is shipped to the warehouse 130 using the truck 124 as part of the shipment 426. Once the transport 426 reaches the warehouse 130, and the commodity G400 is unloaded from the truck 124 at the warehouse 130, the scenario 400 ends.
The scenario 400 may be considered an active scenario because the order for the raw materials 420 is to be completed before the order 422 for the item G400. In a related passive scenario, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 first places an order 422 to the manufacturer 120, and then the manufacturer 120 places an order 420 for the raw material 122 to the supplier 110.
Fig. 5 shows a scenario 500 according to an example embodiment, where order related data 510, 520, 530, 540, 550 triggers a transportation 512, 522, 532, 542, 552 throughout the supply chain. Scenario 500 involves order related data 510, 520, 530, 540, 550 relating to an item G500 communicated between warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 and retailers 160, warehouse 140, warehouse 130, manufacturer 120 and supplier 110, respectively. Based on the order-related data 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, a respective shipment 512, 522, 532, 542, 552 associated with the commodity G500 is manufactured, the shipment 512 being between warehouse/distribution center 150 and retailer 160, the shipment 522 being between warehouse 140 and warehouse/distribution center 150, the shipment 532 being between warehouse 130 and warehouse 140 (sea shipment), the shipment 542 being between manufacturer 120 and warehouse 130, and the shipment 542 being between supplier 110 and manufacturer 120. After all transports 512, 522, 532, 542, 552 are completed, scenario 500 may be complete.
The scenario 500 is an active scenario in which the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 first receives order-related data 510, including POS data indicative of the sale of the item G500 at the retailer 160. Using the POS data in the order-related data 510 and other predictable order data, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines a predicted number FA500 of items G500 to be offered throughout the supply chain as shown in FIG. 5. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 also determines, based on the POS data, that there are sufficient supplies of the commodity G500 to satisfy the predicted quantity FA500 in the entire supply chain, that the manufacturer 120 requires more raw material of the commodity G500 to produce the commodity G500 of the predicted quantity FA500, and that some of the commodity G500 of the predicted quantity FA500 will be stored in each of the warehouse 130, the warehouse 140, the warehouse/distribution center 150 and order an additional quantity AM500 of the commodity G500 on behalf of the retailer 160.
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then communicates the order-related data 550 with the suppliers 110 to order raw material supplies for the goods G500 on behalf of the manufacturers 120 and to coordinate the shipment of the raw material supplies for the goods G500 to be shipped to the manufacturers 120 as part of the shipment 552 by the trucks 112. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 communicates order-related data 540 with the manufacturer 120 to inform the manufacturer 120 of the supply of raw materials for the commodity G500 arriving via the transport 552/truck 112, to order the commodity G500 in the predicted quantity FA500, and to coordinate the transport of the commodity G500 in the predicted quantity FA500 to the warehouse 130 as part of the transport 542 by the truck 124.
The scenario 500 continues with the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 and the warehouse 130 communicating the order-related data 530 to inform the warehouse 130 of the shipment 542 of the predicted quantity FA500 of the commodity G500 arriving via the truck 124, to store a portion P130 of the commodity G500 of the predicted quantity FA500 in the warehouse 130, and to coordinate the shipment of the remaining quantity RA130 of the commodity G500 to the warehouse 140 as part of the shipment 532 via the sea 136. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 and the warehouse 140 then communicate the order-related data 520 to inform the warehouse 140 of the shipment 532 of the remaining amount RA130 of the commodity G500 arriving via the sea 136, to store a portion P140 of the remaining amount RA130 of the commodity G500 in the warehouse 140, and to coordinate the shipment of the current remaining amount RA140 of the commodity G500 to the warehouse/distribution center 150 as part of the shipment 522 via the truck 142.
The scenario 500 continues with the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 and the warehouse 140 communicating the order related data 520 to inform the warehouse 140 of the shipment of the remaining amount RA130 of the commodity G500 arrived by the sea 136, to store a portion P140 of the commodity G500 of the remaining amount RA130 in the warehouse 140, and to coordinate the shipment 522 performed by the truck 142 to ship the additional amount AM500 of the commodity G500 to the retailer 160. In the scenario 500, the shipment 522 is unexpectedly terminated at the warehouse/distribution center 150, and thus the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 schedules a shipment 512 to be performed by the truck 152 of an additional quantity of the commodity G500 of AM500 to the retailer 160. After the transport 512 is complete, the scenario 500 may be complete.
In a related proactive scenario, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 first receives order related data 550 from the suppliers 110 indicating that raw materials for producing the commodity G500 are available and ready for shipment to the manufacturers 120. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then communicates the order related data 540 to the manufacturer 120 to request production of the commodity G500 and transports the produced commodity G500 to the warehouse 130 via a transport 542 on a truck 542 and communicates additional order related data 550 to the supplier 110, ordering raw materials for the commodity G500 to be transported to the manufacturer 120 via a transport 552 on a truck 112.
After the shipment 552 receives the raw material of the commodity G500, the manufacturer 120 produces the commodity G500, and transports the produced commodity G500 to the warehouse 130 by the shipment 542 on the truck 124. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 communicates the order-related data 530 to the warehouse 130, requesting storage of the commodity G500 received through the shipment 542, and then transports the commodity G500 to the warehouse 140 as part of the shipment 532 performed through the shipping 136. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 communicates the order-related data 520 to the warehouse 140, requesting storage of the commodity G500 received via the shipment 532 and then shipping the commodity G500 to the warehouse/distribution center 150 as part of the shipment 522 performed by the truck 142.
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 communicates the order related data 510 to the retailer 160 indicating that an order for the item G500 placed on behalf of the retailer 160 will arrive from the warehouse/distribution center 150 via a transport 512 performed by the truck 152. In such a related scenario, retailer 160 may have an order for unresolved, unfulfilled item G500 fulfilled at least in part by an order for item G500 arrived through shipment 512.
In a related passive scenario, the retailer 160 sends the order related data 510 to the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 along with an order for an additional quantity AM500 of the item G500. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 queries the manufacturers 120, warehouses 130, and warehouses 140 as part of the respective order-related data 540, 530, and 520 to locate an additional quantity AM500 of items G500, but no available items G500. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then coordinates with the supplier 110 through the order-related data 550 and with the manufacturer 120 to order at least an additional quantity AM500 of raw materials for the commodity G500 from the supplier 110 and to transport the raw materials 112 through the transports 552 performed by the trucks 112. Upon receiving the raw materials, the manufacturer 120 manufactures at least an additional quantity of the commodity G500 of AM500 and notifies the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 that at least the additional quantity of the commodity G500 of AM500 is ready for shipment.
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 uses the order-related data 530, 520, and 510 to coordinate the shipment of the item G500 to the retailer 160 through the following additional quantities AM 500: a transport 542 to warehouse 130 by truck 124, a transport 532 to warehouse 140 by sea 532, a transport 522 to retailer 160 by truck 142 bypassing warehouse/distribution center 150. After shipping 522 is complete and an additional quantity of the article G500 of AM500 is shipped to retailer 160, the associated reaction scenario may be completed. Other active and passive scenarios are also possible.
FIG. 6 illustrates a scenario 600 where order related data 610, 612 from a customer 170, 172 triggers an order 620 and a shipment 622, 624, 626, 628, 630, 632 throughout the supply chain, according to an example embodiment.
The scenario 600 begins with the order related data 610 from the customer 170 and the order related data 612 from the customer 172 being sent to the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100. In scenario 600, order-related data 610 includes an indication of an e-commerce (e-commerce) purchase of a quantity Q170 of commodity G600, order-related data 612 includes search query data related to commodity G600, and the search query is then converted to an e-commerce purchase of a quantity Q172 of commodity G600. In other situations, other and/or additional order related data 610, 612 are possible.
In scenario 600, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 analyzes the order-related data 610, 612 and additional data (such as, but not limited to, the order prediction data described above) to fulfill purchases by the respective customers 170, 172 and order additional items G600 to be stored in the supply chain; for example, at the warehouse/distribution center 150, the warehouse/fulfillment center 156, and/or the retailer 160, for future distribution of the items G600. After receiving order related data 610, 612, warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends order 620 for commodity G600 for full quantity CQ600 to manufacturer 120.
In scenario 600, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 schedules the shipment 622 of the full number CQ600 of items G600 to warehouse 130 via truck 124. For example, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may send an order to the shipper associated with truck 124, order the extraction of the full quantity CQ600 of items G600 on a first commonly agreed upon date, and then ship the full quantity CQ600 of items G600 to warehouse 130 on a second commonly agreed upon date. In another example where the truck 124 is an autonomous vehicle in communication with the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines the extraction time PT600 for the complete number CQ600 of items G600 at the manufacturer 120. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then directs the truck/autonomous vehicle 124 to reach the manufacturer 120 at PT600 to extract the full quantity of the CQ600 of the commodity G600, and then to ship the commodity to the warehouse 130. Other techniques for arranging the shipment of goods using the supply chain coordinator 100 are possible; for example, the supply chain coordinator 100 schedules the transportation 622 by communicating directly with a vehicle that is a non-autonomous vehicle and/or communicating directly with a vehicle owned by the same entity that owns the warehouse and the supply chain coordinator 100.
After producing the full quantity of CQ600 commodity G600, truck 124 extracts the full quantity of CQ600 commodity G600 and transfers the commodity to warehouse 130 as part of shipment 622. Then, the complete number of articles G600 of CQ600 are unloaded and stored in warehouse 130. Warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 schedules a shipment 624 of a first portion FP600 of a complete quantity CQ600 of commodity G600 from warehouse 130 to warehouse 140 via air transport 134, wherein FP600 ≦ CQ 600. In case 600, FP600 equals CQ 600; that is, a complete number of articles G600 of CQ600 are shipped to warehouse 140 by ship 624/air ship 134. In other cases where FP600< CQ600, the remainder of quantity (CQ 600-FP 600) of commodity G600 may be stored in warehouse 130; i.e., for later transport by air 134, sea 136, and/or by another mode of transport.
After arrival of the airborne commodity 134, the first portion FP600 of the commodity G600 is unloaded from the airborne commodity 134 and then stored in the warehouse 140. In the first portion FP600 of the article G600, a second portion SP600 of the article G600 is loaded onto the truck 142 as part of the shipment 626 and a third portion TP600 of the article G600 is loaded onto the truck 144 as part of the shipment 630. Both shipments 626 and 630 are scheduled by the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100.
In case 600, the second part SP600 and the third part TP600 are equal to the first part FP 600; in other cases, some of the second portion SP600 and/or the third portion TP600 of the article G600 are stored in the warehouse 140; i.e., for later transport by truck 142, truck 144, and/or by another vehicle.
After the truck 142 carrying the goods 626 arrives at the warehouse/distribution center 150, the second portion SP600 of the goods G600 is unloaded from the truck 142 and stored at the warehouse/distribution center 150. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then schedules the shipment 628 by truck 152 of a few quantities of the items G600 of Q170 from the warehouse/distribution center 150 to the retailer 160, and then the quantities of the items G600 of G170 from the retailer 160 to the customer 170 by the drone 162 to fulfill the order placed as part of the order related data 610.
When the truck 144 making the shipment 630 arrives at the warehouse/fulfillment center 156, a third portion TP600 of the items G600 is unloaded from the truck 144 and stored at the warehouse/fulfillment center 156. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then schedules the shipment 632 of the quantity Q172 of the item G600 from the warehouse/fulfillment center 156 to the customer 172 via the transport 632 by the truck 158 to fulfill the order placed as part of the order-related data 612. Once the orders placed as part of the order related data 610, 612 are fulfilled, the scenario 600 may be completed.
In scenario 600, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 obtains at least the transportation and tracking information for all shipments of supply and goods throughout the supply chain shown in FIG. 6, including the shipment of goods G600. For example, upon receiving an order from a customer 170 as part of the order related information 610 for the quantity Q170 of the good G600, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 searches its own data to determine if the good G600 can be supplied from an existing good G600 inventory; for example, the number of items G600 that are greater than Q170 and that are located in a warehouse or other facility in communication with the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100. In the scenario 600, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 cannot find the quantity Q170 of the commodity G600, so the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends the order 620 to the manufacturer 120 of the commodity G600. In addition, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 updates the shipping information for the order placed by the customer 170 to indicate that the quantity Q170 of the good G600 is in order. In this case, when the estimated number Q170 of the articles G600 arrive at the customer 170, the estimated shipping date is determined; i.e., by transport 622, 624, 626, 628 and a drone 162.
Both while shipments 622, 624, 626, 628 are ongoing and when each shipment is complete, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 updates the shipping information for the customer 170. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 also maintains tracking information for trucks or air transports that transport the commodity G600 from the manufacturer 120 to the customer 170. That is, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 maintains time and location information for each shipment 622, 624, 626, 628; for example, at time T622, shipped item 622 is 50 miles west (or 80 kilometers) in warehouse 130, expected to arrive at warehouse 130 at a later time T623, and shipment 624/air 134 is to exit warehouse 130 at time T624 to destination warehouse 140.
In addition, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may maintain manifest information for some or all of the transports in the supply chain shown in fig. 2-6. For example, manifest information for shipment 622 includes an inventory of items included in the shipment; for example, the manifest includes the full number CQ600 of articles G600, as well as any other articles shipped from manufacturer 120 to warehouse 130 by truck 124, which is part of shipment 622.
Fig. 7 depicts a system 700 having a warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 associated with the warehouse 140, wherein the system 700 includes a door 712 and robots 750, 752, 754, 756, 758, 760 in communication with the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100, as shown in dashed lines, according to an example embodiment. In some examples, system 700 further includes some or all of trucks 770, 772, 774, 776, 778, 780, 782, 784, 786, 788, and 790.
Fig. 7 shows a warehouse 140 surrounded by a warehouse yard 710 where vehicles such as trucks 770 and 790 may be maneuvered within and around the warehouse 140, loading merchandise to the warehouse 140 and unloading trademarks from the warehouse 140 using loading stations 720 and 736 and parking them in parking areas 714a, 714 b. Warehouse 140 and warehouse yard 710 are protected by door 712. The doors 712 may be opened and closed according to commands/messages from the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100.
Fig. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 show a situation 800 in which trucks arrive, load, unload and leave the warehouse. Scenario 800 begins with a truck 810 arriving at warehouse yard 710 and at door 712 of warehouse 140. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines that the truck 810 must park and waits a time slot at the inbound dock, thus allocating the parking space 842 for the truck 810 to park the truck 810. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then begins allocating time slots for inbound loaders 724 for the trucks 810 at time T1, allocating space within the warehouse 140 for storing the goods G1 loaded by the trucks 810, and allocating robots 752 to unload the trucks 810. Article G1 was inspected by robot 752 and found to be in agreement with article G1. After successfully checking commodity G1, warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 instructs robots 752 and 756 to unload commodity G1 from truck 810 to area 922 in commodity storage 740 of warehouse 140. The truck 810 then exits the warehouse 140 and the warehouse yard 710.
The scenario 800 continues with the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 directing the robots 752, 754, and 756 to move the pallets P10, P11, and P12 to the area 1112 in the packaging area 746 of the warehouse 140 in preparation for the arrival of the truck 1210. Truck 1210 is delayed and truck 1220 arrives before truck 1210. Upon arrival of the truck 1220, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 allows the truck 1220 to enter through the door 712 and allocates time slots to immediately load the truck 1220 to the outbound loading station 734. The truck 1220 enters the warehouse yard 710 and stops on the outbound loading dock 734. During the arrival of the truck 1220 at the outbound loading station 734, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 directs the robots 752 and 756 to rearrange the pallet arrangement 1310 by moving the pallets P20 and P21 closer to the outbound loading station 734 as the pallets P20 and P21 are to be loaded onto the truck 1220. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 also directs the robots 752 and 756 to load pallets P20 and P21 onto the truck 1220. After loading the trays P20 and P21 onto the truck, the truck 1220 exits. Truck 1210 then arrives at warehouse 140 and stops at outbound loading station 734. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 directs the robots 752, 754, and 756 to load pallets P10, P11, and P12 onto the truck 1210. After pallets P20 and P21 are loaded onto truck 1210, truck 1210 exits the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 directs robots 752 and 760 to move pallets P30, P31, and P32 closer to outbound loading dock 734 in preparation for the next incoming truck. Scenario 800 may be completed after trays P30, P31, and P32 have moved closer to the outbound loading station 734.
Fig. 8 illustrates a scenario 800. From truck 810 to door 712 of warehouse yard 710 surrounding warehouse 140. In scenario 800, truck 810 carries commodity G1 destined for warehouse 140. Upon arrival of the truck 810, the gate 712 sends an arrival message 830, notifying the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 of the arrival of the truck 810. In response, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a door open message 832 to the door 712 to open the door and allow the truck 810 to enter the warehouse yard 710.
Upon receiving the arrival message 830, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines that goods are to be loaded onto the truck 810 using the inbound dock 724, and that the inbound dock 724 is currently occupied by the loading of the truck 774, as shown on the left side of fig. 8. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then allocates 840 the parking space 842 to the truck 810 and sends a park message 844 directing the truck 810 to park in the parking space 842.
Fig. 9 shows scenario 800 continuing after truck 810 has been parked in parking space 842. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 allocates a time slot from the inbound loader 724 to the truck 810 beginning at time T1 and notifies the truck 810 of the time slot allocation using the time slot message 910. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 also allocates an area 922 in the commodity store 740 of the warehouse 140 for storing trays unloaded from the trucks 810, as shown by an allocate warehouse store (allocsstore) message 920. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 also sends a go-to (GoTo) message 930 directing the robot 752 to travel to the inbound dock 724. Just prior to time T1, truck 774 departs from the inbound dock and truck 810 travels along path 940, stopping at inbound dock 724 at time T1.
Fig. 10 shows that scenario 800 continues when truck 810 arrives at inbound dock 724 at time T1. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a check message 1010 to the robot 752 to check for the item G1 on the truck 810. Upon receiving check message 1010, robot 752 checks article G1 to determine if it is in compliance with the contract for article G1. In scenario 800, article G1 on truck 810 is under contract, so robot 752 sends a check response (inspectResp) message 1020 indicating that article G1 is under contract "OK". To inspect article G1, robot 752 may visually inspect article G1, scan text, bar codes, radio frequency id (rfid), and/or Quick Response (QR) codes on article G1 and/or associated with article G1, provide video and/or audio information related to article G1 on truck 810 for inspection by another entity, such as warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 and/or a human inspector, physically inspect article G1 using one or more actors and/or sensors, and/or inspect article G1 using other reasonable techniques. Since the commodity G1 is under contract, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a receipt 1022 to the truck 810 for the commodity G1 indicating acceptance of the commodity G1 from the truck 810 at the warehouse 140.
In other cases, article G1 is NOT under contract-in these cases, the check response message indicates article G1 "NOT OK" or is NOT under contract. In these cases, instead of receipt 1022 of commodity G1, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a rejection message rejecting commodity G1. Also in these other cases, at least the rejected good G1 is not unloaded from the truck 810.
In scenario 800, a commercial product G1 is loaded onto two trays, G1P1 and G1P 2. After successfully checking the commodity G1, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a move message 1030 to the robot 752 to move the tray "G1P 1" from the truck 810 to the area 922, and sends a move message 1040 to the robot 756 to move the tray "G1P 2" from the truck 810 to the area 922. Once the trays G1P1 and G1P2 have been unloaded, the truck 810 exits from the inbound dock 724 and exits the warehouse floor 710 through the door 712.
As shown in FIG. 11, the scenario 800 continues with one or more information sources 1110 providing event notifications 1120 to the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100. In scenario 800, event notification 1120 causes warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 to "reschedule" or move three pallets within warehouse 140: p10, P11 and P12. In the scenario 800, the event notification 1120 includes information about the weather-related event, and the commodities in the trays P10, P11, and P12 are available for solving the problem with the weather-related event; for example, sun visors for hot weather, snow shovels for winter storm events. Other types of events and related event information are also possible, such as discussed above at least in the context of fig. 3.
In response to the event notification 1120, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 reschedules the trays P10, P11, and P12 to area 1112 within the packaging area 746; that is, after rearrangement, the trays P10, P11, and P12 are made easier to transport. In scenario 800, a rearrangement occurs when warehouse 140 is not loading or unloading items at loading stations 720, 722, 724, 726, 730, 732, 734, 736; in other cases, the rearrangement occurs as the warehouse 140 loads and/or unloads the goods. In other cases, the rearrangement is based on available storage space within warehouse 140 (e.g., rearranged from a relatively full area to a relatively empty area of warehouse 140), based on anticipated vehicle arrivals/departures and/or commodity shipments, based on one or more commodity speeds, based on a rearranged inventory of pallets maintained by warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100, and/or other reasons.
In other cases, rescheduling includes rescheduling during robot "dead-angle" times; for example, if the robot is instructed to take the tray to a loading station and return to location L in warehouse 140, the robot may return to location L (or another location) in warehouse 140 and the tray is to be rearranged rather than returned to location L empty/dead (i.e., without anything back to location L). Other types of dead time; for example, when unassigned robots perform tasks, they may also be used for rescheduling.
To rearrange trays P10, P11, and P12 to area 1112, warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends respective movement messages 1130, 1132, 1134 to robots 752, 754, 756 to move all three trays P10, P11, and P12 to area 1112.
In scenario 800, trucks 1210, 1220, 1230 are expected to be the next three vehicles in that order to reach warehouse 140. Fig. 12 illustrates that the scenario 800 continues with the information source 1110 sending a new time of arrival ("NewArrTime") message 1232 informing the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 that the truck 1210 has been delayed and is now expected to arrive at a future time T3.
Fig. 12 also shows that a truck 1220 arrives at the door 712 of the warehouse yard 710. The gate 712 sends an arrival message 1240 notifying the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 that the truck 1220 has arrived at the gate 712. In response to the arrival message 1240, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a door open message 1242, indicating that the door 712 is open, allowing the truck 1220 to enter the warehouse yard 710. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 allocates the time slot starting immediately at the outbound load station 734 and sends a time slot message 1250 informing the truck 1220 that it has time slots starting "now" at the outbound load station 734. In response to the time slot message 1250, the truck 1220 begins along path 1252 toward the outbound loading station 734. Upon arrival of the preparation truck 1220 at the outbound loading station 734, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a GoTo message 1260 directing the robot 760 to travel towards the outbound loading station 734.
In some cases, the timeslot at the outbound dock 734 was previously assigned to the truck 1210 because the truck 1210 is expected to be the next arriving vehicle for the outbound dock 734. For example, if vehicle loading and/or unloading is not performed at the warehouse 140 during an "idle" interval (e.g., during an overnight shift), the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may pre-allocate the first time slot to arrive at a vehicle after the idle interval. In these cases, the time slots for the outbound loading station 734 to the truck 1210 may be released before the time slots are allocated to the truck 1220, as discussed above with respect to the time slot message 1250.
Fig. 13 illustrates a portion of warehouse 140, including outbound loading station 734, wrap area 746, and full area 1112, as well as a portion of warehouse yard 710 near outbound loading station 734. The scenario 800 continues with the truck 1220 continuing on a path 1252 toward the outbound loading station 734. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines to rearrange the tray arrangement 1310 as much as possible before the truck 1220 reaches the outbound loading station 734.
Fig. 13 shows that the tray arrangement 1310 has three columns of trays: first columns of trays P10, P11, and P12 intended to be loaded onto truck 1210, second columns of trays P20 and P21 intended to be loaded onto truck 1220, and third columns of trays P30, P31, and P32 intended to be loaded onto truck 1230, wherein the first columns of trays are closer to outbound dock 734 than the second columns of trays, which in turn are closer to outbound dock 734 than the third columns of trays. The pallet arrangement 1310 is arranged so that the truck 1210 can be loaded faster, the truck 1210 being expected to be the next truck to reach the outbound loading bay 734; that is, the first column of pallets is intended to be loaded onto the truck 1210 and closest to the outbound loading dock 734. However, as described above, truck 1210 has been delayed and truck 1220 is now the next truck to arrive at outbound dock 734. In some examples, each column of trays may be considered a queue entry of a tray arrangement, where such queue entries are discussed below in the context of at least fig. 17-22.
To help expedite loading of the truck 1220, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines to swap the first and second ranks of trays, thereby placing the trays P20 and P21 destined for the truck 1220 closer to the outbound loading bay 734 for faster loading onto the truck 1220. However, in scenario 800, there is not enough time to completely swap the first and second columns of pallets before the truck 1220 arrives and stops at the outbound loading station 734. Thus, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends an exchange message 1330 to the robot 752 to exchange the trays P10 and P20 and an exchange message 1332 to the robot 760 to exchange the trays P11 and P21, moving the two trays (P20 and P21) to the truck 1220 closer to the outbound loading dock 734, while the tray P12 to the truck 1210 is still in the first column 1310 of tray arrangements.
The scenario 800 continues with the truck 1220 reaching the outbound loading bay 734. After the truck 1220 reaches the outbound loading station 734, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 instructs the robots 752 and 760 to load the truck 1220. In particular, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a move message 1340 to the robot 752 to move the pallet "P20" to the "truck 1220" loaded at the "OLD" (outbound loading dock) "734", and sends a move message 1342 to the robot 752 to move the pallet "P21" to the "truck 1220" loaded at the "OLD 734". In other cases, instead of exchanging pallets, robots 752 and 760 load truck 1220 with pallets P20 and P21 initially in the second column of pallet arrangement 1310.
Fig. 14 shows robots 752 and 760 loading respective pallets P20 and P21 onto truck 1220. When truck 1220 is loaded, truck 1210 arrives at door 712. The gate 712 sends an arrival message 1410 notifying the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 of the arrival of the truck 1210. In response to the arrival message 1410, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 instructs the door 712 to open via the door open message 1412, allowing the truck 1210 to enter the warehouse yard 710.
Before proceeding to the outbound loading dock 734, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines that the truck 1210 must be parked and waits until the truck 1220 is loaded, thus allocating a parking space 1418 for the truck 1210 as shown by an allocate parking message 1414. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a parking message 1416 to notify the truck 1210 that it is parked in the parking space 1418. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then begins allocating the time slot of the outbound load station 734 to the truck 1210 at time T3 and sends a time slot message 1420 informing the truck 1210 of the allocated time slot.
Fig. 16 shows the scenario 800 continuing with the truck 1210 on the way out of the outbound loading bay 734. Fig. 16 also shows a first column of tray arrangement 1310 with two trays P30 and P32. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 sends a move message 1610 instructing the robot 752 to move the pallet P31 to the first column "Col 1" of the pallet arrangement 1310 in "area 1112". After the robot 752 moves the pallet P31 to the first column of the pallet arrangement 1310, the first column has all three pallets P30, P31, and P32 the destination is the truck 1230, and the truck 1230 is the next truck to reach the outbound loading station 734. The supply chain coordinator 100 also sends a GoTo message 1612 instructing the robot 760 to move to the outbound loading station 736. Once the tray P31 has moved to the first column of the tray arrangement 1310, and the robot 760 has moved to the outbound loading station 736, the scenario 800 may be completed.
Fig. 17 is a flow diagram of a method 1700 according to an example embodiment. The method 1700 is for maintaining a tray arrangement, such as the tray arrangement 1310. The tray arrangement may include QL >0 "queue entries", or may accommodate space for one or more merchandise trays, where each queue entry is numbered sequentially starting with 1 and proceeding to QL. An example tray arrangement of queue entries with QL-3 is shown on the left side of fig. 18 as tray arrangement 1860 located in load station 1850 of warehouse 1870, where queue entry 1 of tray arrangement 1860 is closest to the edge of load station 1850 where trays may be loaded on one or more vehicles. Queue entry 1 is followed by queue entry 2, followed by queue entry 3. Queue entry 3 is followed by the rest of the store 1870.
FIG. 17 indicates that the method 1700 may be performed by the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100; for example, the method 1700 may be included in one or more computer-readable instructions that, when executed by one or more processors of a computing device, cause the computing device to perform some or all of the functions of the method 1700 while performing the features described herein of the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100. In other examples, the method 1700 may be performed by one or more other entities outside of the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100.
Fig. 17 indicates that the method 1700 begins at block 1710, where the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines the time, T NAV, until the next arrival vehicle NAV to reach a facility, such as a warehouse, at block 1710. In some examples, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines whether the next arriving vehicle NAV will arrive before a predetermined time (such as before the beginning of an upcoming idle period). The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may then terminate the method 1700 if the next vehicle NAV does not arrive until after a predetermined time.
At block 1712, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines the queue entry QE associated with the vehicle NAV; for example, the queue entries are used to deposit trays to be loaded on the facility's vehicle NAV.
At block 1720, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines whether the vehicle NAV has reached the facility. For example, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may receive a message that the vehicle NAV has entered a door of a facility (such as the doors 712 of the warehouse 140 and warehouse yard 710 discussed above in the context of fig. 7-16). As another example, a robot or other agent at the facility may detect the vehicle NAV and send a message to notify the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 of the arrival of the vehicle NAL. As yet another example, the vehicle NAV may transmit a message indicating that the vehicle NAV has reached the facility warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100. Other techniques for notifying the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 of the arrival of the vehicle NAV and/or for the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 to determine that the vehicle NAV has arrived at the facility are also possible
If the vehicle NAV has arrived at the facility, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1770. Otherwise, the vehicle NAV has not yet reached the facility and warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1730.
At block 1730, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines whether the queue entry QE associated with the vehicle NAV is equal to 1; i.e. whether the queue entry associated with the vehicle NAV is the closest queue entry to the loading station to which the vehicle NAV will arrive. If QE is equal to 1, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1710. Otherwise, QE is not equal to 1 and the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1740.
At block 1740, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines the number of robots NR that may be used to exchange queue entries. That is, the number of robots that can move a tray from queue entry 1 to queue entry QE (QE ≠ 1 at block 1740), and vice versa. In some embodiments, if NR is 0, then no robot is available to swap pallets, so the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may proceed to block 1710.
At block 1742, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines the time, T _ SWAP, of the NR robots available to exchange queue entries. For example, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may estimate the T _ SWAP of the NR robot based on historical data, one or more mathematical models, data performed during tests or experiments exchanging pallets, and/or using other techniques and/or data.
The value of T _ SWAP may not be strictly inversely proportional to the number of robots, as adding other robots may increase the operating speed. In one example of NR ═ 1, assuming that the action shown in table 1 is an action taken by one robot RS1, one tray PS1 located at position LS1 in queue entry 1 is swapped with tray PS2 located at position LS2 in the other column of queue 2.
TABLE 1
As another example of NR ═ 2, assuming that the actions shown in table 2 are those taken by two robots RS1 and RS2, one pallet PS1 located at position LS1 in queue entry 1 is swapped with another pallet PS2 located at position LS2 in queue entry 2.
TABLE 2
In a particular example, warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 coordinates robots RS1 and RS2 such that robot RS2 brings pallet PS2 to location LS1, and robot RS1 brings pallet PS1 to location LS 2. That is, warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 coordinates robots RS1 and RS2 such that robot RS1 moves pallet PS1 from position LS1 to position LS2 at or about the same time that robot RS2 moves pallet PS2 from position LS2 to position LS 1.
The example described in table 2 assumes that both robots RS1 and RS2 take approximately or exactly the same amount of time to perform the respective steps 1, 2, and 3 listed in table 2. Under this assumption, when robot RS1 attempts to place tray PS1 at position LS2, robot RS2 has cleared tray PS2 from position LS2, so robot RS1 will be free to place tray PS1 at position LS2 without delay. Similarly, when robot RS2 attempts to place tray PS2 in position LS1, robot RS1 will have cleared tray PS1 from position LS1, so robot RS2 will be free to place tray PS2 in position LS1 without delay. In the event that this assumption does not hold, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 coordinates robots RS1 and RS2 so that one robot can wait for a pallet to be cleared. For example, if robot RS1 is not located near LS1 when there is one or more commands to swap trays PS1 and PS2, but at this time RS2 is located near LS2, warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may instruct robot RS2 to extract tray PS2 and wait until robot RS1 has extracted tray PS1 before robot RS2 moves to position LS 1.
If T _ SWAP is inversely proportional to the number of robots, the time taken by the two robot examples shown in Table 2 is (approximately) 1/2 for the one robot example shown in Table 1. However, although one robot has to place the pallet at the temporary position (LTEMP) for exchange, two robots do not need to place the pallet at the temporary position, and thus the number of operations performed by each robot is reduced to 1/3, which is the number of operations of one robot, thereby increasing the speed. Thus, by multiplying NR from 1 to 2, T _ SWAP for NR ═ 2 can be (approximately) 1/3 for the value of T _ SWAP for NR ═ 1, less than 1/2 for the value of T _ SWAP that can be expected (which can be inversely proportional). Other examples of greater than inverse scale T _ SWAP reductions are also possible.
In the case where NR is 0, T _ SWAP is infinite. In some of these examples, T _ SWAP may be expressed as "practically infinite"; that is, numbers less than infinity are much larger than usual/expected. For example, if exchanging trays usually takes no more than several minutes, T _ SWAP may have an almost infinite value representing one day or longer when NR is 0.
At block 1750, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines whether the T _ NAV is greater than the T _ SWAP; that is, whether the amount of time until the vehicle NAV arrives is greater than the amount of time to exchange trays. If the T _ NAV is greater than the T _ SWAP, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1760. Otherwise, T _ SWAP is greater than or equal to T _ NAV and the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1710.
In some examples, instead of or in addition to comparing T _ NAV and T _ SWAP, the value of T _ SWAP is compared to a threshold amount of time THR _ SWAP to exchange trays between queue entries 1 and QEs. If T _ SWAP is greater than THR _ SWAP, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1760 to SWAP trays between queue entries 1 and QEs. Otherwise, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1710 without exchanging pallets. In other examples, instead of or in addition to comparing T _ NAV and T _ SWAP, the value of T _ NAV is compared to a threshold amount of time the vehicle arrives at the facility THR _ NAV. If the T _ NAV is greater than the THR _ NAV, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1760 to exchange trays between queue entries 1 and QEs. Otherwise, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1710 without exchanging pallets.
In other examples, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may determine whether to swap trays between queue entry 1 and the QE; that is, based on the estimated QE load time and the estimated Q1 load time, proceed to block 1760. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may estimate the QE load time as the time to load the next arriving vehicle when its tray is accommodated in queue entry QE, and may estimate the Q1 load time as the time to load the next arriving vehicle when its tray is accommodated in queue entry 1. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may determine the difference DIFF _ QE-LOAD — QE LOAD time Q1 LOAD time. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may consider DIFF _ QE-LOAD, the estimated amount of time saved from queue entry QE to queue entry 1 for the next arriving vehicle exchange tray. Then, in conjunction with comparing the T _ NAV and the T _ SWAP in block 1750, or instead of comparing the T _ NAV and the T _ SWAP in block 1750, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may compare the DIFF _ QE-LOAD and the T _ SWAP. If DIFF _ QE-LOAD is greater than T _ SWAP, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may proceed to block 1760 to SWAP trays between queue entries 1 and QEs. Otherwise, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1710 without exchanging pallets.
Other data and related comparisons may also be used to determine whether to swap trays.
At block 1760, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may determine the vehicle V1 associated with queue entry 1.
At block 1762, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 instructs the NR robots to exchange trays between queue entry 1 and queue entry QE. For example, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may instruct the NR robots to exchange trays between queue entry 1 and queue entry QE using some or all of the techniques mentioned above in the context of tables 1 and/or 2.
At block 1764, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may associate queue entry 1 with the vehicle NAV and queue entry QE with the vehicle V1; that is, the vehicle associations for queue entries 1 and QEs are exchanged as per the pallet exchange performed between queue entry 1 and QE at block 1762. After completion of block 1764, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1710.
At block 1770, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 has determined that the vehicle NAV has reached the loading station. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 then instructs one or more robots to load the pallet from the queue entry QE onto the now arriving vehicle. After loading the tray from the queue entry QE, the vehicle NAV may leave the loading station.
At block 1772, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 instructs one or more robots to move the tray one queue entry at a time, from queue entry QE +1 to the last queue entry; such as queue entries QL. Moving the tray one queue entry at a time may involve moving the tray from a non-empty first queue entry to an adjacent empty second queue entry, thereby emptying the first queue entry. Table 3 shows example operations required for one robot to move up one tray:
TABLE 3
For example, assume that QL is 3 and QE is 1 at the beginning of block 1772. Queue entries 2 and 3 are then moved up during block 1772. To move queue entry 2 up, the tray in queue entry 2 (non-empty first queue entry) is moved up to queue entry 1 (adjacent empty second queue entry) because the tray in queue entry 1 is loaded onto the vehicle NAV and there is no tray in queue entry 1 during block 1770. After queue entry 2 is moved up, queue entry 1 is not empty, queue entry 2 is empty, and queue entry 3 has a tray. Then, when queue entry 3 moves up, the tray in queue entry 3 moves up to queue entry 2, thereby emptying the tray of queue entry 3.
At block 1774, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 moves the vehicle associated with the queue one queue entry at a time, from queue entry QE +1 to the last queue entry QL; such as queue entries QL. Continuing with the QL-3 and QE-1 example starting at block 1772, the vehicle entries associated with queue entries 2 and 3 will move up during block 1774. Assume further that queue entry 1 is associated with a vehicle NAV, queue entry 2 is associated with vehicle V2, and queue entry 3 is associated with vehicle V3, and the vehicle array is for storing the vehicle association, wherein the index in the vehicle array represents the queue entry; for example, vehicle [ ] is an array of three vehicle-associated values, where vehicle [1] ═ NAV, vehicle [2] ═ V2, and vehicle [3] ═ V3. Then, a loop may be performed to move vehicle entries, such as
for i＝(QE+1)to QL
vehicle[i-1]＝vehicle[i]；
end for
At the end of this cycle, vehicle [1] is V2, vehicle [2] is V3, and vehicle [3] is V3. Other representations of associations between queue entries and vehicles other than the vehicle array vehicle [ ] are possible.
At block 1780, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines NewV, which is the next arriving vehicle after the vehicle now associated with the queue entry QL-1, and associates NewV with the queue entry QL. Continuing with the example of blocks 1772 and 1774(QL — 3) above, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may associate NewV with a queue entry QL by allocating vehicle [ QL ] — NewV. In this example, after associating NewV with the queue entry QL, the resulting vehicle array has: vehicle [1] ═ V2, vehicle [2] ═ V3, and vehicle [3] ═ NewV.
In some examples, at block 1780, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 determines whether the next arriving vehicle NewV will arrive before a predetermined time, such as before the start of an upcoming idle period. Then, if the next arriving vehicle NewV does not arrive until after a predetermined time, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may proceed to block 1710, rather than proceeding to block 1782.
At block 1782, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 instructs one or more robots to extract trays destined for vehicle NewV from the facility (e.g., warehouse) and place the trays in queue entries QL. For example, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 may determine that a pallet P _ NEWV located at a location L _ NEWV in the facility is designated for loading onto the vehicle New and instruct the robot to move the pallet P _ NEWV to the queue entry QL following the exemplary procedure in table 4:
TABLE 4
Continuing with the above example of blocks 1772, 1774 and 1780(QL — 3, and vehicle [3] — NewV), during block 1782, the robots in the facility obtain/pick up trays destined for vehicle NewV and place/place these trays in queue entries QL, which are emptied in block 1772. After execution of the procedures of blocks 1772, 1774, 1780 and 1782, queue entry 1 has a tray for vehicle V2, queue entry 2 has a tray for vehicle V3, queue entry 3 has a tray for vehicle new V, and the vehicle array has: vehicle [1] ═ V2, vehicle [2] ═ V3, and vehicle [3] ═ NewV. After completing the procedure of block 1782, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100 proceeds to block 1710.
Fig. 18, 19, 20 and 21 show a situation 1800 according to an example embodiment, where trucks 1810, 1820 and wagons 1830 arrive at a loading bay 1850 of a warehouse 1870, where pallets of a pallet arrangement are loaded into the trucks using the techniques of method 1700.
The left side of fig. 18 shows that at the beginning of the situation 1800, the truck 1820 has just arrived at the loading bay 1850 of the warehouse 1870. The loading station 1850 includes a tray arrangement 1860 with three queue entries: queue entry 1 holds two pallets and is associated with truck 1810, queue entry 2 holds four pallets and is associated with truck 1820, and queue entry 3 holds one pallet and is associated with truck 1820. At time T1, truck 1810 is expected to arrive before truck 1820, while truck 1820 arrives before there is time to swap the pallets between queue entries 1 and 2; that is, in the context of method 1700, at block 1750T _ SWAP > T _ NAV, until NAV 1820 arrives, where QE 2.
In some cases, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator initially reserves the time slot TS1 of the load station 1850 for the truck 1810, where the time slot TS1 of the load station 1850 is a time period that includes time T1. Then, when the warehouse and supply chain coordinator truck 1810 is notified of the delay, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator: the timeslot TS1 for the truck 1810 is released, the truck 1820 is determined to be the next arriving vehicle after the truck 1810, and the timeslot TS1 is reserved for the truck 1820. Truck 1820 then arrives during time slot TS 1. In particular, in these schemes, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator also reserves another time slot TS2 for the truck 1810 immediately following the time slot TS 1.
In particular instances, reserving the time slot for truck TRK may include granting truck TRK access to warehouse 1870 until the beginning of the time slot, and/or releasing the time slot for truck TRK may include revoking truck TRK access to warehouse 1870. In these cases, releasing the timeslot TS1 for the truck 1810 includes revoking access to the warehouse 1870 by the truck 1810, reserving the timeslot TS1 for the truck 1820 includes granting access to the warehouse 1870 by the truck 1820 until the timeslot TS1 begins, and reserving the timeslot TS2 for the truck 1810 includes granting access to the warehouse 1870 by the truck 1810 until the timeslot TS2 begins.
As shown on the right side of fig. 18, at time T2, the tray contained in queue entry 2 is loaded onto truck 1820 as indicated by arrow 1880 using the procedure of block 1770 of method 1700. After loading, the truck 1820 exits the loading bay 1850 as indicated by arrow 1882. Once the procedure of block 1770 is complete, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator executes the procedures of blocks 1772 and 1774 of method 1700 to move the tray of queue entry 3 up to queue entry 2, as shown by arrow 1884, and associates queue entry 2 with truck 1830. At block 1780 of method 1700, a new railcar 1840 is determined to be the next vehicle to arrive at the warehouse 1870 after the truck 1830 and associated with queue entry 3. Then, as indicated by arrow 1886, following the procedure at block 1782 of method 1700, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator instructs one or more robots to extract trays of the rail car 1840 from the warehouse 1870 and place the trays in queue entry 3.
At time T3 of scenario 1800 as shown on the left side of fig. 19, truck 1820 has departed, and the procedure described above with respect to time T2 has completed. The resulting tray arrangement 1860 has queue entry 1 that holds a tray associated with truck 1810, queue entry 2 that holds a tray associated with truck 1830, and queue entry 3 that holds a tray associated with railcar 1840.
At time T3, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator performs blocks 1710 and 1712 of method 1700 to determine that the next arriving vehicle NAV is the truck 1830 associated with the queue entry QE ═ 2, which will arrive in T NAV time units. At T3, the truck 1830 has not yet reached the warehouse 1870, so execution of the method 1700 proceeds from block 1720 to block 1730, where QE ═ 2, to block 1740. After performing blocks 1740 and 1742, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator determines that the number of robots that can exchange queue entries, NR, is >0, and that the time T _ SWAP is less than T _ NAV. Thus, execution of method 1700 proceeds to block 1760, where V1 is set to truck 1810, and then to block 1762, where the warehouse and supply chain coordinator directs the NR robots found available at block 1740 to swap trays between queue entry 1 (associated with truck 1810) and queue entry 2 (associated with truck 1830).
As indicated by an arrow 1910 at time T4 on the right side of fig. 19, the NR robot proceeds to exchange trays between queue entries 1 and 2. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator performs the procedure of block 1764, associating queue entry 1 with truck 1830, and associating queue entry 2 with truck 1810.
At time T5, shown on the left side of FIG. 20, the procedures of blocks 1762 and 1764 discussed above with respect to time T4 have been completed. The resulting pallet arrangement 1860 has queue entry 1 that holds a pallet associated with truck 1830, queue entry 2 that holds a pallet associated with truck 1810, and pallet queue entry 3 that holds a pallet associated with railcar 1840. Also at time T5, truck 1830 arrives at loading dock 1850.
The warehouse and supply chain coordinator performs blocks 1710 and 1712 of method 1700 to determine that the next arriving vehicle NAV is a truck 1830 associated with a queue entry QE ═ 1, which will arrive at T _ NAV for an amount of time of 0 time units. When truck 1830 arrives, execution of method 1700 proceeds from block 1720 to block 1770, where the warehouse and supply chain coordinator instructs one or more robots in warehouse 1870 to load the pallet accommodated in queue entry 1 to truck 1830.
In some cases, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator has reserved the time slot TS2 of the load station 1850 for the truck 1810, with the time slot TS2 of the load station 1850 immediately following the time slot TS1, and the time slot TS2 being a time period that includes T5. Then, when the warehouse and supply chain coordinator truck 1810 is notified of the delay beyond time T5, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator: the timeslot TS2 for truck 1810 is released, the truck 1830 is determined to be the next arriving vehicle after truck 1810, and the timeslot TS2 is reserved for truck 1820. Truck 1820 then arrives during time slot TS 2. Particularly in these cases, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator also reserves another time slot TS3 for the truck 1810 immediately following the time slot TS 2.
In particular instances, releasing the time slot TS2 of the truck 1810 includes revoking access to the warehouse 1870 by the truck 1810, reserving the time slot TS2 for the truck 1830 includes granting access to the warehouse 1870 by the truck 1830 until the beginning of the time slot TS2, and reserving the time slot TS3 for the truck 1810 includes granting access to the warehouse 1870 by the truck 1810 until the beginning of the time slot TS 3.
At time T6 shown on the right side of fig. 20, the pallet contained in queue entry 1 is loaded into the truck 1830 as indicated by arrow 2010 using the program of block 1770 of method 1700. After loading, the truck 1830 exits from the loading dock 1850 as shown by arrow 2012. Once the procedure of block 1770 is complete, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator will execute the procedures of blocks 1772 and 1774 of method 1700 to: (1) directing one or more robots to move the tray of queue entry 2 up to queue entry 1 and associate queue entry 2 with truck 1810, as indicated by arrow 2020, and (2) directing one or more robots to move the tray of queue entry 3 up to queue entry 2 and associate queue entry 2 with railcar 1840, as indicated by arrow 2030. In block 1780 of method 1700, it is determined that the new vehicle (truck 2000) is the next vehicle to arrive at the warehouse 1870 after the railcar 1840 and is associated with queue entry 3. Then, as indicated by arrow 2040, following the procedure of block 1782 of method 1700, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator directs one or more robots to extract trays for truck 2000 from warehouse 1870 and place these trays in queue entry 3.
At time T7 of scenario 1800 as shown on the left side of fig. 21, truck 1830 has left and the procedure described above with respect to time T6 has been completed. The resulting tray arrangement 1860 has queue entry 1 that holds a tray associated with truck 1810, queue entry 2 that holds a tray associated with railcar 1840, and queue entry 3 that holds a tray associated with truck 2000.
Also at time T7, truck 1810 arrives at loading bay 1850. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator performs blocks 1710 and 1712 of method 1700 to determine that the next arriving vehicle NAV is a truck 1810 associated with a queue entry QE of 1 that will arrive at T _ NAV for an amount of time of 0 time units. When truck 1810 arrives, execution of method 1700 proceeds from block 1720 to block 1770, where the warehouse and supply chain coordinator directs one or more robots in warehouse 1870 to load the tray accommodated in queue entry 1 onto truck 1810. In some cases, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator has reserved the time slot TS3 of the loading bay 1850 for the truck 1810, where the time slot TS3 is a time period that includes time T7.
At time T8, shown on the right side of fig. 21, the procedure of block 1770 of method 1700 is used to load the tray contained in queue entry 1 onto truck 1810, as indicated by arrow 2110. After loading, truck 1810 exits loading bay 1850 as indicated by arrow 2112. Once the procedure of block 1770 is complete, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator will execute the procedures of blocks 1772 and 1774 of method 1700 to: (1) directing one or more robots to move the tray of queue entry 2 up to queue entry 1 and associate queue entry 2 with railcar 1840, as indicated by arrow 2120, and (2) directing one or more robots to move the tray of queue entry 3 up to queue entry 2 and associate queue entry 2 with truck 2000, as indicated by arrow 2130. In block 1780 of method 1700, the new vehicle (vessel 2100) is determined to be the next vehicle to arrive at the warehouse 1870 after the truck 2000 and is associated with queue entry 3. Then, as indicated by arrow 2140, following the procedure of block 1782 of method 1700, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator directs one or more robots to extract the pallets of the vessel 2100 from the warehouse 1870 and place these pallets into queue entry 3. After all the pallets of the vessel 2100 are placed in queue entry 3, the scenario 1800 may be complete.
Fig. 22 is a block diagram of a supply chain 2200 in accordance with an example embodiment. A supply chain may have one or more components, where a component includes one or more facilities connected by zero or more paths. A facility is a supply chain entity having a fixed location, such as, but not limited to, one or more buildings associated with a supplier, manufacturer, warehouse, distribution center, maintenance center, and/or fulfillment center. The relative sizes of the facilities in fig. 22-24 represent the concentration of inventory of goods and/or the capacity of the facilities; for example, in fig. 22, the rectangle depicting the facility 2232 is larger than the rectangle depicting the facility 2234, which means that the facility 2232 has a larger inventory concentration and/or volume of items than the facility 2234. The path between facilities may be used to convey goods, vehicles, information, and/or other physical objects between connected facilities, such as path 2262 connecting facilities 2250 and 2252.
The supply chain 2200 has four disconnect components: the assembly 2202 shown at the top left of fig. 22 (including facilities (Fs)2210, 2212 connected by one path); the component 2204 shown centrally to the left in fig. 22 (including facilities 2220, 2222, 2224, 2226, 2228 connected by four paths); a component 2206 (including facilities 2230, 2232, 2234, 2236, 2238, 2240 connected by five pathways) shown at the top right of fig. 22; and a component 2208 (including facilities 2250, 2252, 2254, 2256, 2258, 2260 connected by seven paths) shown at the bottom right of fig. 22. In some examples, goods, vehicles, information, and/or other materials moving between two facilities in the supply chain 2200 must pass through one or more intermediate facilities; for example, goods traveling between the facility 2230 and the facility 2234 must pass through the facility 2232.
In the exemplary supply chain 2200, each of the four components 2202, 2204, 2206, 2208 comprise a separate sub-supply chain, and in the example shown in fig. 22, the four components are not interconnected. In some examples of the supply chain 2200, each component is owned separately; for example, component 2202 is owned by owner a, component 2204 is owned by owner B, component 2206 is owned by owner C, component 2208 is owned by owner D, where owners a, B, C, and D are each different. In other examples of the supply chain 2200, some or all of the components 2202, 2204, 2206, 2208 are commonly owned.
As shown in fig. 22, the four components 2202, 2204, 2206, 2208 of the supply chain 2200 are not directly interconnected. Then, one or more intermediate facilities may be used to transport the merchandise and/or other materials between the components 2202, 2204, 2206, and 2208; for example, merchandise transported from the component 2206 to the component 2204 may be routed through the facility 2236 of the component 2206 and the facility 2226 of the component 2204 for transport to a destination in the component 2204.
In other examples, two or more non-interdigitated components send partially-loaded vehicles to the same relatively small area (e.g., an area having only one zip-code or zip-code), resulting in inefficient coverage of the relatively small area. Further, routing the goods and/or other materials through the intermediate facility may increase costs and time due to loading, unloading, and possibly additional breakage/damage of the goods and/or other materials at the intermediate facility. To reduce inefficiencies associated with partial loading and intermediate facilities, some or all of the various components in the supply chain may be integrated.
FIG. 23 illustrates a supply chain 2300 in which components 2202, 2204, and 2208 have been substantially consolidated into component 2302, and in which component 2206 has been somewhat consolidated into component 2304. Fig. 23 shows that the merged component 2302 has nine facilities 2212, 2220, 2222, 2226, 2238, 2250, 2252, 2254, 2260, which is less than thirteen of the components 2202, 2204, and 2208. Further, the paths between the facilities have changed the merge component 2302; for example, a path has been added between facility 2238 and each of facilities 2250, 2252, 2254, and 2260.
The increased routing between facilities reduces and/or eliminates the use of intermediate facilities in transporting goods and/or other materials between facility 2238 and each of facilities 2250, 2252, 2254, and 2260. By combining the components 2202, 2204, and 2208, the partial load capacity of the truck may be reduced. For example, if a partially loaded truck PLT2202 is sent from a component 2202 of the supply chain 2200 to the zip code ZC1, and a partially loaded truck PLT2204 is also sent from a component 2204 of the supply chain 2200 to the zip code ZC1, then one truck can be sent to the zip code ZC1, instead of two partially loaded trucks, by consolidating the partial truck payloads through coordinated management of the component 2302. Such coordinated management of the components 2302 may be provided by a warehouse and supply chain coordinator as described herein, such as the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100. The warehouse and supply chain coordinator may identify two partial truck loads destined for the same destination or nearby area (e.g., an area covered by one zip code), determine the facility that is to carry the most, if not all, of the items in the two partial truck loads, and send one truck along with the item from the facility to the destination or nearby area to carry the two partial truck-loaded items. Truck loads may be consolidated based on other reasons and/or additional reasons other than geographic location, such as the type of goods/vehicles to be used (e.g., refrigerated goods, gas/liquid goods, use of refrigerated trucks, tanker trucks, air or sea carriers), the priority of goods/transportation (e.g., may continue to have partial loading for high priority transportation and/or high value goods).
Fig. 24 is a block diagram of a supply chain 2400 according to an example embodiment. The supply chain 2400 shows the effect of further consolidation on the supply chain 2300. The components 2302 of the supply chain 2300 have been merged into the components 2402 of the supply chain 2400. The component 2402 has one less facility and two more paths, where one facility, facility 2226, is directly connected to all of the other seven facilities 2212, 2220, 2222, 2238, 2250, 2254, 2260 of the component 2402, and the component 2302 has no facility directly connected to all of the other facilities of the component. Fewer facilities and more pathways are used, fewer facilities are maintained, and fewer intermediate facilities may be used in the assembly 2402 as compared to the assembly 2302, thus making the assembly 2402 more time efficient and cost effective than the assembly 2302.
In addition, component 2404 has been consolidated into three facilities, facilities 2230, 2232, and 2410, that use only all direct interconnections. In contrast, component 2304 of supply chain 2300 uses five facilities, only one of which is fully connected. Fewer facilities and more paths are used, fewer facilities are maintained, and fewer intermediate facilities may be used in component 2404 than in component 2304, making component 2404 more time-efficient and cost-effective than component 2304.
In some examples, components 2402, 2404, and/or supply chain 2400 are configured, for example, by a warehouse and supply chain coordinator as described herein, to provide on-demand logistics and/or supply chain services; that is, logistics is provided as a service in a manner similar to the way cloud computing devices provide various computing services on demand. That is, the warehouse and supply chain coordinator enables the receipt of orders from customers regarding warehousing, shipping, goods manufacturing, supply, and/or other various logistics/supply chain related services that the component 2402, component 2404, and/or supply chain 2400 provides to the customers without the customers having to manage detailed information of goods storage, obtain goods from suppliers and manufacturers through the transportation of goods through the supply chain, and oversee the warehouse.
Example methods of operation
Fig. 25 is a flow diagram of a method 2500 according to an example embodiment. Method 2500 may be performed by a computing device. In some examples, the computing device includes computer readable instructions/software that, when executed by one or more processors of the computing device, cause the computing device to perform some or all of the functions of the warehouse and supply chain coordinator; such as the warehouse and supply chain coordinator 100.
The method 2500 may begin at block 2510, where at block 2510 the computing device may determine a first estimated time of arrival of a first vehicle at a loading station of a warehouse, such as discussed above at least in the context of fig. 2-21.
In some embodiments, determining the first estimated time of arrival may include reserving a first time slot of a loading station for the first vehicle, where the first time slot includes the first estimated time of arrival, such as discussed above in the context of at least fig. 9, 14, and 21.
In other embodiments, the warehouse includes a first parking location; then, determining a first estimated time of arrival of the first vehicle at the loading dock may comprise: granting access to the warehouse by the first vehicle at the first estimated time of arrival; determining whether the first vehicle has accessed the dock at the first estimated arrival time; after determining that the first vehicle has not visited the dock at the first estimated arrival time, a first parking location is reserved for the first vehicle from the first estimated arrival time, such as discussed above in the context of at least fig. 8, 9, 14, 15, and 18-20.
At block 2520, the computing device may determine a second estimated time of arrival of the second vehicle at a loading dock of the warehouse, wherein the first estimated time of arrival is prior to the second estimated time of arrival, such as discussed above at least in the context of fig. 8-21.
At block 2530, the computing device may determine a tray arrangement of a loading station of the warehouse, wherein the tray arrangement includes a first tray associated with the first vehicle and a second tray associated with the second vehicle, and wherein the first tray is closer to the loading station than the second tray, such as discussed at least in the context of fig. 13-21. In some embodiments, the tray arrangement may include at least a first queue entry and a second queue entry, each of the first queue entry and the second queue entry for housing one or more trays, wherein the first queue entry is located closer to the loading station than the second queue entry is located, and the queue entry houses the first tray and the second queue entry houses the second tray, such as discussed above at least in the context of fig. 13-21.
At block 2540, the computing device may determine that the first estimated time of arrival has changed to be after the second estimated time of arrival after determining the tray arrangement, such as discussed above at least in the context of fig. 13-21.
At block 2550, the computing device may, in response to determining that the first estimated time of arrival has changed to be after the second estimated time of arrival, instruct the robot to modify the tray arrangement such that the second tray is closer to the loading station than the first tray before the second estimated time of arrival, such as discussed above at least in the context of fig. 13-21.
In some embodiments, in response to determining that the first estimated arrival time has changed to be after the second estimated arrival time, instructing the robot to modify the tray arrangement such that the second tray is closer to the loading station than the first tray before the second estimated arrival time may include: determining a second arrival time indicative of an amount of time until a second vehicle arrives at the warehouse; determining an amount of time to swap trays between the first queue entry and the second queue entry; determining whether the second arrival time is greater than an amount of time to exchange trays; and after determining that the second arrival time is greater than the time to exchange trays, instructing the robot to: moving the second tray from the second queue entry to the first queue entry, and moving the first tray from the first queue entry to the second queue entry, such as discussed above at least in the context of fig. 17-21.
In particular embodiments, determining an amount of time to exchange trays between the first queue entry and the second queue entry may include determining an amount of time to exchange trays between the first queue entry and the second queue entry based on a number of robots available to exchange trays, such as discussed above at least in the context of fig. 17-21. In other particular embodiments, the method 2500 may also include: after moving the first tray from the first queue entry to the second queue entry: associating the first queue entry with the second vehicle; and associating a second queue entry with the first vehicle, such as discussed above at least in the context of fig. 17-21.
