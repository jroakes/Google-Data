Definitions
- the present invention relates to the field of data processing, and particularly to a software system and associated method for use with a search engine, to search indexed and raw data obtained from systems that are linked together over an associated network such as the Internet.
- This invention more particularly pertains to a computer software product for retrieving resources in XML documents through the extensive use of schema (Document Type Definition) for query processing and optimization.
- the World Wide Web is comprised of an expansive network of interconnected computers upon which businesses, governments, groups, and individuals throughout the world maintain inter-linked computer files known as web pages.
- WWW World Wide Web
- a crawler crawls the web and extracts metadata, or information about the data on the web, and stores the metadata in a data repository or data store.
- the vastness of the unstructured WWW causes users to rely primarily on Internet search engines to retrieve or locate information.
- HTML is a computer language primarily used for browsing or viewing documents on the web.
- An HTML document is typically treated as a single block of text, which is easily indexed and searched.
- XML XML
- HTML XML
- the hierarchical nature of XML makes it suitable for describing meta (index) information.
- the XML standard specification requires that XML documents be well formed, i.e. always have a proper nested structure.
- XML documents need not be valid to meet the XML specification, i.e. the document may not have a schema or may not be validated against an associated schema. In such cases, it is possible to infer the schema from the document. But the multiplicity of non-uniform schemas is difficult, time consuming, and inefficient for a search engine to search or query. To optimize the query process, the number of schemas queried must be minimized.
- DTD Document Type Definition
- Exclusivity which for an element is the set of ancestors that must be present for that particular element.
- Entrance location which describes the elements that should be present in any path between two nodes.
- indexing has typically been studied by persons skilled in the database field, who do not consider that indexing to be a requirement for tree pattern matching, but rather consider path indices, which are insufficient for tree pattern matching.
- the number of schemas queried by the query optimizer must be minimized in order to optimize the query process with respect to the query processing time and the size of the query index.
- An XML document has structure and content that need to be indexed together.
- the structure extracted by the query optimizer must consider all structural relationship sets present in the schema.
- This invention describes a system and method this need, and provide the capability to optimize the XML document query process by:
- This feature will enable the system of the present invention to minimize the time required to process a search request while also minimizing data storage requirements.
- the query system of the present invention provides several features and advantages, related to the following:
- the data model of the query system of the present invention views the XML repository as a set of schema/data pairs where, for every schema, the query system maintains the set of documents that conform to that schema.
- the data in an XML document is viewed by the query system as a graph with the “edges” between the graphs used to represent inter-document links. This data model allows queries on content, structure, plus inter-document links and intra-document links.
- the query language uses XML syntax and supports tree pattern matching. This allows the query system to compute a DTD for the query language and use it to validate the user query during query formulation. Using a tree structure instead of the traditional path expression, makes the query language easier to use, and allows the query language to specify conditions on siblings in the tree structure.
- the query language also:
- the query system of this invention maintains three kinds of indices for an XML document: a value index corresponding to text; a structure index corresponding to tree structure patterns; and a link index corresponding to link relationships. These indices are organized as a trie, ensuring that the index access cost is linear with respect to the size of the query and independent of the number of indices present. For storage and search efficiency, the structure pattern is converted to a string.
- FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary operating environment in which a query system of the present invention can be used
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram that illustrates the two main components of the query system of FIG. 1, the indexing system and the query processor, shown used in the context of an Internet search;
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram that depicts the main components of the query system of FIGS. 1 and 2;
- FIG. 4 depicts the components of a query processor of FIG. 2 that forms part of the query system of FIGS. 1-3;

- FIG. 1 portrays the overall environment in which a query system 10 according to the present invention may be used.
- the query system 10 includes a software or computer program product that is typically embedded within, or installed on a host server 15 .
- the query system 10 can be saved on a suitable storage medium such as a diskette, a CD, a hard drive, or like devices. While the query system 10 will be described in connection with the WWW, the query system 10 can be used with a stand-alone database of terms that may have been derived from the WWW and/or other sources.
- the cloud-like communication network 20 is comprised of communication lines and switches connecting servers such as servers 25 , 27 , to gateways such as gateway 30 .
- the servers 25 , 27 and the gateway 30 provide the communication access to the WWW Internet.
- Users, such as remote Internet users are represented by a variety of computers such as computers 35 , 37 , 39 , and can query the host server 15 for the desired information.
- the host server 15 is connected to the network 20 via a communications link 42 such as a telephone, cable, or satellite link.
- the servers 25 , 27 can be connected via high speed Internet network lines 44 , 46 to other computers and gateways.
- the servers 25 , 27 provide access to stored information such as XML or web documents indicated generally at 50 , 55 , and 60 .
- the XML documents 50 , 55 , 60 most likely include embedded links to other locally stored pages, and links 70 , 72 , 74 , 76 to other web sites or documents 55 , 60 that are stored by various web servers such as the server 27 .
- the XML documents 50 , 55 , 60 can be represented as the WWW 20 in FIG. 2 .
- Searches on the WWW 20 are performed by the query system 10 .
- the query system 10 generally includes a query processor 80 and an indexing system 85 .
- the indexing system 85 extracts data from the XML documents on the WWW 20 and stores that data in the index repository 90 as XML documents.
- the user enters a query through the browser for search engine 95 .
- the search service provider 100 forwards the query to the query system 10 .
- the query processor 80 then generates a Query Execution Plan (QEP) that specifies any indices for use in the search.
- QEP is optimized for the document object model (DOM).
- the DOM is an application program interface (API) used in this case for traversing the XML document tree structure in the index repository 90 .
- the QEP retrieves the index document stored on the index repository 90 by means of a set of index keys. These index keys are stored in the index repository 90 , with each index key storing the set of references within the document.
- the QEP looks up the specified index structures for a key K, and obtains the set of element references. It then looks up the source document and retrieves the elements corresponding to these references.
- FIG. 3 shows the main components of the query system 10 used for processing and indexing XML documents.
- the query system 10 generally includes two main components: a preprocessor 105 and a query processor 80 of FIG. 2 .
- the preprocessor 105 is used to optimize query execution and includes a schema extractor 110 , a relation set generator 115 , and an indexing system 85 . Data generated by the preprocessor 105 are stored in the index repository 90 .
- the schema extractor 110 first extracts the schema for new or unprocessed documents 125 . If the new or unprocessed document 125 does not have a schema, the schema extractor 110 discovers a schema for this document 125 , as described for example in co-pending patent application titled “Method and System for Discovering a Majority Schema in Semi-structured Data”, filed on Jul. 27, 2000, assigned to the same assignee as the same application, and incorporated herein by reference. The results of the schema extractor 110 are stored in the index repository 90 as documents 130 . The DTD and the data in the document 130 are then used by the other components of the preprocessor 105 .
- the relation set generator 115 computes structural relationship sets 135 between elements and attributes from the schema (either defined or discovered by the schema extractor 110 ). These structural relationship sets 135 are later used for query optimization and processing.
- the relation set generator 115 computes eight different structural relationship sets; child, parent, attribute, reachability, ancestor, obligation, exclusivity, and entrance location. Only obligation, exclusivity, and entrance location are examined by existing XML query systems. These eight structural relationship sets are used by the query system 10 to filter documents that will produce an empty result set, for strength reduction of the user query, i.e. to replace complex query constructs with simpler ones and eliminate redundant conditions. A description of these structural relationship sets 135 and how they are determined is given below.
- C ( A ) ⁇ ( C 1 , T 1 ), ( C 2 , T 2 ), . . . ,( C n , T n ) ⁇
- C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C n represent all the child elements which A can have.
- T i associated with a C i denotes the derived parent-child relationship between A and C i . This can be either +, *, ? or ONCE.
- ONCE is used to denote a child that can occur exactly once.
- P ( A ) ⁇ P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P n ⁇
- the attribute relation set for an element A is given by:
- Attr ( A ) ⁇ ( At 1 , Dec 1 , Def 1 ; Val 1 ), ( At 2 , Dec 2 , Def 2 , Val 2 ), . . . , ( At n , Dec n , Def n , Val n ) ⁇
- At 1 At 2 , . . . , At n are the name of all the attributes which A can have.
- Dec i denotes the declared type of At i
- Def i denotes the default type of At i
- Val i denotes the default string value defined for that attribute (if any).
- R(A) The reachability set for an element A, denoted by R(A) is given by:
- R(A) ⁇ (A 1 , L 1 ), (A 2 , L 2 ), . . . , (A n1 L n ) ⁇ where A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A n are possible descendants of A as computed from the DTD graph.
- the L i associated with A i represent the set of levels at which A i can be present as a descendant of A.
- the reachability set for the leaf nodes in the graph is the empty set.
- R′(A) which is obtained from R(A) by omitting the level information:
- R ′( A ) ⁇ A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A n ⁇
- the set R′(A) represents the set of elements which can be present as a descendant of A in a document conforming to the DTD.
- S ⁇ C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C n ⁇
- the recurrence relation used to obtain the set R′(A) is given by:
- R ′( A ) C 1 ⁇ R ′( C 1 ) ⁇ C 2 ⁇ R ′( C 2 ) ⁇ . . . ⁇ C n ⁇ R ′( C n )
- the level information for an element A i ⁇ R′(A) is obtained as follows. Let D 1 , D 2 , . . . , D k ⁇ S be such that A i ⁇ R′(D j )
- L i ( A ) L′ i ( D 1 ) ⁇ L′ i ( D 2 ) ⁇ . . . ⁇ L′ i ( D k )
- G(A) The ancestor structural relationship set for an element A denoted by G(A) is given by:
- G ( A ) ⁇ ( P 1 , L 1 ), ( P 2 , L 2 ), . . . , ( P n , L n ) ⁇
- Pi, 1 ⁇ i ⁇ n represents a possible ancestor element which can be present in the document.
- the level information, L i associated with an ancestor, P i represents the set of levels at which P i can be present as an ancestor with respect to A.
- the ancestor structural relationship sets can be computed from the reachability structural relationship sets as follows. If (E i , L i ) ⁇ R(A), then (A, L i ) ⁇ G(E i ).
- a 1 , A 2 , . . . , A n are descendants of A that must be present in every document conforming to the DTD.
- the L i associated with A i represents the set of levels at which A i can be present as a descendant of A. This is the same as the set of levels present in the reachability set.
- the reachability set we define a set O′(A) which is obtained from O(A) by omitting the level information.
- O′′(N) O′(N).
- Contrib(N) O′′(N) ⁇ N if N is a leaf node, and O′′(N), otherwise.
- a 1 , A 2 , . . . A n are ancestors of A that must be present in every document conforming to the DTD.
- the level set L i associated with an element A i represents the set of levels at which A i can be present as an ancestor of A. (This is the same as the set of levels at which A can be present as a descendant of A i obtained in the reachability sets.)
- P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P n , E′(A) is defined recursively as follows:
- E ′( A ) ( P 1 ⁇ E ′( P 1 )) ⁇ ( P 2 ⁇ E ′( P 2 )) ⁇ . . . ⁇ ( P n ⁇ E ′( P n ))
- EL(A) The entrance location set for an element A, denoted by EL(A) is given by:
- indexing system 85 Various index structures for the new or unprocessed document 125 of FIG. 3 are built by the indexing system 85 .
- the resulting index structures 140 are stored in the index repository 90 .
- the indexing system 85 is shown in more detail in FIG. 4 .
- indices Three types are maintained by the indexing system 85 (FIG. 4 ): a value index 145 corresponding to the text; a structure index 150 corresponding to the tree structure patterns, and a link index.
- the link index can be maintained as simple mappings from ID names to elements.
- the value index 145 includes a text index 155 and an attribute index 160 .
- the indexing system 85 finds the different text values and stores in the text index 155 the element references that have this value.
- the attribute index 160 maintains a list of references for the text values of each element and each attribute within the element.
- Tree indexing represents a novel feature of the present invention.
- a tree index can be a nested index 165 or a path index 170 .
- the nested index 165 maintains the set of references to all the elements that satisfy this pattern.
- the path index 170 maintains references for eiements that satisfy every sub-pattern.
- a tree pattern is converted to a string (e.g. Euler string) by the query system 10 .
- a tree pattern is considered as having multiple sub-patterns, corresponding to each position in the Euler string. For example, in the following Euler string “book.author.book.author.book” there are five sub-patterns:
- All the structure indices are converted into Euler strings and stored as a trie. All four indices of FIG. 4 are stored as an XML document, but in a restricted format.
- the query executor 185 (FIG. 3) uses the available indices as well as the structural relationship sets for optimization.
- the query processor 80 of FIG. 3 performs the queries and returns the result set 180 to the user.
- the query processor 80 includes three parts: the query optimizer 175 , the query executor 185 , and the result consolidator 190 .
- the query optimizer 175 builds an “optimal” QEP for the document.
- the query executor 185 executes the QEP obtained by the query optimizer 175 .
- a schema generator then computes the schema (DTD) for the result set 180 , creating an output document for the result set 180 .
- An important feature of the query system 10 of this invention is the manner in which data is viewed.
- An XML document is viewed by the query system as a graph with the “edges” between the graphs used to represent inter-document links.
- This data model allows queries on content, structure, plus inter-ocument links and intra-document links.
- XML is used to represent both hierarchical structure and data. Structure is represented using nested elements and data is represented using text nodes and attribute values. The example below shows a sample XML document and a DTD for that document. This document represents a small library database consisting of two books and one monograph.
- the query system 10 views the DTD as a directed graph, rooted at an element called the DOCTYPE declaration.
- FIG. 5 shows the directed graph view of the database example, where the DOCTYPE declaration is “library” 195 .
- Elements, attributes, and the regular expression operators are used to represent the content model form nodes in the graph.
- the DTD semantics are not completely captured by relational schemas as DTD “simplification” is important for XML-relational conversion.
- FIG. 6 shows a more detailed description of a method of operation 200 for the query processor 80 of FIG. 3 .
- a source extractor 205 Given a query (Q) 201 , a source extractor 205 first extracts the source documents on which the query will be executed, creating the document list 210 .
- a source specified in the query 201 can be either a document in the repository 90 or the result set of a nested query.
- a document filter 215 then uses the pre-computed structural relationship sets 135 (S) to eliminate documents that do not qualify for the query (Q) 201 . This allows the query system 10 to avoid querying documents that will not contribute to the result set. By eliminating empty results for the query 201 , processing time is dramatically reduced. If (Q+S) generates a non-empty result, the query processor 80 proceeds to the query optimizer 175 . If (Q+S) generates an empty result, the query processor 80 loops back and considers the next document.
- Table 1 lists some sample conditions in the query and the corresponding conditions in the structural relationship set that cause a document to be eliminated.
- Table 1 enumerates conditions for a source document D in the document list for query Q to be filtered out.
- S(D) denotes the relationship sets computed for D.
- the query requires that B be a descendant of A at one of the depths in L, but from the reachability sets, it is known that B is not a descendant of A at any of the depths in L.
- the query in item 5 requires that A have two child elements with tag name B, but from the child relationship sets, it is known that A can have at most one child which is B.
- the query in item 6 requires that A have an attribute At with value V, but from the attribute relationship sets, it is known that A cannot have an attribute At.
- the query optimizer 175 of FIGS. 3 and 6 performs two tasks: strength reduction of expensive query constructs and choice of an optimal QEP.
- Strength reduction involves eliminating redundant query constructs and replacing expensive constructs with simpler constructs.
- an expensive construct would be a query for all descendents of books that are authors; a simpler construct to obtain the same result would be a query for children of books that are authors.
- the expensive construct asks the query system to select all books from the document at any depth from the document root level that satisfy the remaining conditions. However, from the reachability sets, the query system knows that book elements can only be present at a height of 1 from the document root level, so the query system need only check the child elements for books.
- Table 2 shows strength reduction of the user query as implemented by the query optimizer 175 , wherein C represents the condition specified in the original query, S(D) represents the relationship sets for the source document being considered and C′ represents the reduced condition corresponding to C. Items 1, 2, 3, and 4 remove redundant conditions. Item 5 also removes redundant conditions, but from a query with negation. Items 6 and 7 show how complex constructs (which typically require traversal to an arbitrary depth or height) are simplified.
- the query optimizer 175 enumerates candidate QEPs for the “reduced” query.
- the “optimal” QEP is chosen by estimating the “cost” to perform the QEP.
- a cost model is used to estimate index access cost, the I/O cost for accessing elements, and the number of elements to be accessed. From (Q+S+I) the OQEP is selected and passed on to the query executor 185 for execution.
- the query executor 185 executes the OQEP obtained from the query optimizer 175 and obtains the result set 180 for the document being considered.
- the query executor 185 uses the actual XML document in the document list 210 being reviewed, the structural relationship set (S) 135 and the indices (I) 140 .
- the QEP is optimized for the document object model (DOM).
- the DOM is an application program interface (API) used by the query executor 185 for traversing the XML document tree structure.
- the query executor 185 is defined in terms of operators that are in turn defined by the DOM API. The operators used by the query system in the QEP are unique to this invention and are described below:
- Root Operator returns the document root element. It is represented by Root(D), where D is the document under consideration.
- Tree Traversal Operators are used to traverse the source document tree and perform pattern matches.
- V the subtree rooted at V (say T) specifies a pattern match condition.
- the candidate elements for V are checked for the pattern match.
- V returns true if and only if the candidate elements for V matched the pattern specified in T.
- the query system uses five different tree traversal operators, which are described below. Let A be the candidate element being considered for pattern match at the parent node of V. (Note that a tree traversal operator is never present as the root node of a QEP and therefore A is always defined.)
- Descendant Operators identify descendant elements of A that satisfy the pattern match. These operators are denoted by Des(E, N, L, P), where E is a set of element names (the tag name for a candidate element for V should be specified in E) and L is the set of depths at which a candidate element for V can be present as a descendant of A. N is a count used to indicate how many of the candidate elements for this operator should satisfy the pattern match for V to return true. P specifies the path for reaching a candidate element for V from A. The specification of P is optional, and when no regular path expression is specified, P takes the value ⁇ .
- Ancestor Operators identify the ancestor elements of A that qualify.
- An ancestor operator is denoted by Anc(E, N, L, P), where E and N are as explained before.
- L is the set of heights at which a candidate element can be present as an ancestor of A.
- the optional P specifies the regular path expression for reaching A from a candidate element for V.
- Sibling Operators identify the siblings of A that qualify. They are denoted by Sib(E, L), where E is a set of element names and L is the set of levels at which a candidate element can be present as a sibling of A. Right sibling levels are represented using positive numbers, and left sibling levels using negative numbers.
- Text Operators perform match on the value contained in a text node of A. Three different text operators are defined by the query system 10 .
- Text1(Op, S) denotes the text operator used to check the value contained in any individual text node of A. Op is an operator, and S is a string or variable reference. This operator returns true if and only if A has a text node with value Val, such that Val(Op)S is true.
- Text2(I, Op, S) denotes the text operator used to check the text value obtained by concatenating all the text node descendants of A at a height specified by “I”.
- Text3(Op, S) is used to check the text value obtained by concatenating all the text node descendants of A in a depth first order.
- Attribute Operators perform matches on the attribute values of A. These operators are denoted by Attr(At, Op, S). This operator returns true if and only if A has an attribute named At with value Val which satisfies Val(Op)S. (It also uses type coercion.)
- Logical Operators are AND, CR and NOT operators.
- a logical operator combines the boolean pattern match results of its children.
- the Count operator is specified as Count(E 1 , E 2 , V), and it returns the number of children of E 1 that have tag E 2 and sets V to this value.
- the Group Operator is specified as Group(E 1 , S), and it groups all the children of E 1 based on the values for the attributes in S, and returns this grouped element.
- Index Scan Operator is used to retrieve elements from a specified index structure. It is denoted by Index(F, S, K), where F is the index file name, S is the kind of index (this can be structure, text, or attribute) and K is the key used to obtain the set of element references. This operator looks up the specified index structures for the key K and obtains the set of element references. It then looks up the source document and retrieves the elements corresponding to these references.
- Join Operator combines the results obtained from its child operators. This operator is denoted by Join(C), where C is a condition on which the join is performed. (This operator cannot be a leaf in the QEP).
- a result set 180 obtained from the execution of the QEP is then passed to the schema generator 220 (FIG. 6 ).
- the schema generator 220 then generates the DTD for the result set 180 .
- This output DTD is obtained as a function of the user query and the DTD for the source document in the document list 210 that is being queried.
- the process described for FIG. 6 is repeated for each document extracted by the source extractor 205 .
- the query processor 80 has processed all the documents extracted by the source extractor 205 , the results are combined into one XML document by the result consolidator 190 .
- the output DTDs computed by the schema generator 220 are merged and a DTD for the result document is obtained. This result document along with the output DTD is sent back to the user.
