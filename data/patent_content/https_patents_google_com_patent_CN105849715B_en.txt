With reference to Figure 1A -1B, in some implementations, the resource host 110 of distributed system 100 including loose couplings,
110a-n (for example, computer or server), each resource host has to be deposited with can be used for being cached data
Store up resource 114 (for example, memory, flash memory, dynamic RAM (DRAM), phase transition storage (PCM) and/or disk) into
The computing resource 112 (for example, one or more processors or central processing unit (CPU)) of row communication.It is covered on storage resource
Storage on 114 abstract (for example, key/value storage or file system) allows by one or more clients 120,120a-n to depositing
Store up the expansible use of resource 114.Client 120 can be carried out by network 130 (for example, via RPC) and resource host 110
Communication.
Distributed system 100 may include multilayer redundancy, and wherein data 312 are replicated and are stored in multiple data centers
In.Data center's (not shown) accommodates computer system and their associated components, such as telecommunications and distributed system 100.
Data center generally includes backup power source, redundancy communication connection, environmental Kuznets Curves (maintain steady temperature) and safety equipment.Data
Center can be to be operated using the large scale industry grade of a large amount of electric power (such as many with small town).Data 312 can be positioned in
In diverse geographic location (for example, different cities, country variant and different continents).In some instances, data center or part thereof
It is required that maintenance (for example, due to interruption in power, or by the part of system disconnect with renewal part perhaps the system failure or
A combination thereof).The data 312 being stored in these data centers and especially distributed system 100 may be in maintenance time section
Period is unavailable to users/customers end 120, so as to cause the operation for damaging or stopping user.Accordingly, it is desired to provide can be

120 remote procedure call (RPC) is responded to store or fetch the data 312 on their corresponding resource host 110
Any server operation needs, and processing remote request 122 can be carried out by specialized hardware on the contrary." unilateral " refers to logical
Cross its can within hardware rather than software on the CPU 112 by operating in resource host 110 is completed in resource host 110
On most of requests processing method.It is not that the processor 112 of resource host 110 (for example, server) is made to run and will correspond to
The access of storage resource 114 (for example, non-transient memory) export to the client process 128 operated in client 120
Server processes 118, on the contrary, client 120 can be direct by the network interface controller (NIC) 116 of resource host 110
Accessing storage resources 114.In other words, operate in client process 128 in client 120 can directly with one or more
Storage resource 114 is docked, the operation without the routine to any server processes 118 operated in computing resource 112.It should
Unilateral distributed structure/architecture provides relatively high handling capacity and low latency, this is because client 120 is able to access that storage resource
114, it is docked without the computing resource 112 with resource host 110.This has typical bilateral 100 bring pair of distributed system
For the influence of storage 114 and the requirement uncoupling of cpu cycle.Unilateral distributed system 100 can utilize remote storage resource
114, regardless of with the presence or absence of idle cpu cycle on the resource host 110；In addition, since service is not fought in unilateral operation
112 resource of device CPU, so unilateral system can carry out service cache requests 122 with very predictable low latency, even
When resource host is run with high cpu utilization.Therefore, unilateral distributed system 100 allows system more bilateral than tradition higher
The utilization rate of both 112 resources of cluster-based storage 114 and CPU, while delivering predictable low latency.
In some implementations, distributed system 100 include storage logical gate 102, data control section 104 and
Data storage section 106.Storing logical gate 102 may include transactional applications programming interface (API) 350 (for example, unilateral affairs
System client library), it is responsible for for example via RPC or unilateral operational access bottom data.Data control section 104 can manage
Appointment and access about task to storage resource 114, such as storage resource 114 is assigned, to corresponding network interface controller
116 registration storage resources 114, establish the connection between (one or more) client 120 and resource host 110, and disposition exists
Mistake in the case where mechanical disorder, etc..Data storage section 106 may include loose couplings resource host 110,
110a-n。
Data 312 can be stored in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) 114 and via tool by distributed system 100
There is the network interface controller 116 of Remote Direct Memory access (RDMA) ability to supply data 312 from distance host 110.Net
Network interface controller 116 (being also known as network interface card, network adapter or lan adapter) can be computer hardware portion
Computing resource 112 is connected to network 130 by part.Both resource host 110a-n and client 120 can all have for net
The network interface controller 116 of network communication.Host processes 118 on the computation processor 112 of resource host 110 are operated in net
The Remote Direct Memory that network interface controller 116 registers memory 114 may have access to the set of area 115a-n.Host processes 118
The Remote Direct Memory of memory 114 can be may have access into area 115a-n and be registered as that there is read-only or read/write authority.Resource master
The creation of network interface controller 116 of machine 110 is directed to the client key 302 of each registered memory areas 115a-n.
Simple reading and writing can be limited to by the unilateral operation that network interface controller 116 executes and compare and exchange behaviour
Make, none of which operation can be complicated for use as by for executing cache request and managing cache enough
The simple substitution for the software logic that the traditional cache server operation of strategy is realized.Affairs API 350 will such as search or
The order of insertion data command is converted to the sequence of primitive network interface controller operation.Affairs API 350 and distributed system
100 data control and data storage section 104,106 are docked.
Distributed system 100 may include the memory for remote access for registering to network interface controller 116
114 software positioned jointly and the connection of foundation and client process 128.Once establishing connection, client process 128 is just
Registered memory 114 can be accessed via the engine in the hardware of network interface controller 116, it is self-corresponding without coming
Any participation of software on the local cpu 112 of resource host 110.
With reference to Figure 1B, in some implementations, distributed system 100 includes that (each unit 200 wraps multiple units 200
Include resource host 110), the manager 210 communicated with resource host 110 and the work communicated with resource host 110
Industry management system 220.Manager 210 (for example, process) may operate in be connected to network 130 computation processor 202 (such as
Server with non-transient memory 204) on and manage data storage (for example, the text that is stored on resource host 110 of management
Part system), control data are placed and/or are initiated data and restore.In addition, manager 210 can track the number on resource host 110
According to 312 presence and storage location.Redundancy Management person 210 is possible.In some implementations, (one or more) manages
Person 210 tracks the slitting of the data 312 across multiple resource hosts 110 and for the multiple of redundancy and/or the given band of execution
The presence of copy and/or position.In computer data storage, date classification (striping) is so as to different physical stores
Equipment 114 (for example, unit (cell) 200 and/or resource host 110) makes the mode logic Ground Split of the access of sequential segment
The technology of alphabetic data 312 (such as file 310 (Fig. 2)).It requests to be capable of providing access more than storage equipment 114 in processing equipment
When accessing data fastly, slitting is useful.By executing the segmentation access in multiple equipment, can concomitantly access multiple
Segmentation.This provides more data access handling capacities, avoids that processor is made idly to wait data access.Job management system
220 across 110 schedule job of resource host (for example, processing operation or task memory).
In some implementations, affairs API 350 is in (for example, having client process 128) client 120 and pipe
It is docked between reason person 210.In some instances, client 120 passes through one or more remote procedure calls (RPC) and pipe
Reason person 210 is communicated.In response to client request 122, affairs API 350 can be found in (one or more) resource host
The storage location of specific data 312 on 110 and acquisition allow to access the key 302 of data 312.Affairs API 350 is (via net
Network interface controller 116) directly communicated with resource host 110 appropriate (for example, being visited using Remote Direct Memory
Ask) read or write data 312.It is that non-operational or data 312 are moved to different resource host 110 in resource host 110
In the case where, client request 122 breaks down, to prompt the searching and managing person 210 again of client 120.
With reference to Fig. 2, in some implementations, manager 210 stores and manages file system metadata 212.Metadata
212 may include by file 3101-nIt is mapped to filec descriptor 3001-nFile Mapping 214.Manager 210 can check simultaneously
Modify the expression of its persistent metadata 212.Three kinds of different access modules for metadata 212 can be used in manager 210:
It is read-only；File transaction；And band affairs.
With reference to Fig. 3 A and 3B, data 312 can be one or more files 310, specify again wherein each file 310 has
Rank 311 and/or error-correcting code 313 processed.Each file 310 can be divided into the set of band 320a-n by manager 210,
Wherein each band 320a-n and residue band 320a-n is independently replicated or is encoded.For the replicated (figure of file 310
3A), each band 320a-n is single logical block, and manager 210 is copied as a tape copy 330n and stored it in more
In a storage resource 114.In this case, a tape copy 330n is also known as block 330n.For encoded file 310
(Fig. 3 B), each band 320a-n include multiple data block 330nDkWith non-data block 330nC (for example, encoding block), manager
210 place it in multiple storage resources 114, and wherein the set of data block 330nD and non-data block 330nC form single volume
Code word.Generally, each band 320a-n can be placed in storage resource 114 by manager 210, with its in file 310
It is unrelated in storage resource 114 how his band 320a-n is placed on.Error-correcting code 313 is by redundant data or even-odd check number
According to file 310 is added to, file 310 is enabled not to be received person's recovery later, or even (up to made when introducing many mistakes
The ability of coding) when.Error-correcting code 313 is used to maintain 312 integrality of data in storage equipment, for reconstructing data
312 to be used to execute (delay), or for quickly exhausting machine.
Fig. 2 is referred back to, in some implementations, the filec descriptor 300 stored by manager 2101-nInclude metadata
212, such as File Mapping 214, band 320a-n is mapped to a tape copy 330n or in appropriate circumstances by File Mapping 214
It is mapped to the data block 330nD and encoding block 330nC being stored on resource host 110.In order to open file 310, client 120
Manager 210 is sent by request 122, returns to filec descriptor 300.Client 120 is using filec descriptor 300 come will be literary
The offset of part block is transformed into remote memory location 115a-n.Filec descriptor 300 may include client key 302 (for example, 32
Position key), it is unique to the block 330n on resource host 110 and reads block 330n for RDMA.Add in client 120
After carrying filec descriptor 300, client 120 can access the number of file 310 via RDMA or another data retrieval method
According to 312.
Manager 210 can maintain the status information of all resource hosts 110 for the part for unit 200.State
Information may include capacity, free space, the load on resource host 110, prolonging from the resource host 110 at the visual angle of client
Slow and current state.Manager 210 by the resource host 110 in directly query unit 200 and/or can pass through inquiry
Client 120 obtains the information to collect delay statistics from the visual angle of client.In some instances, manager 210
Rebalancing is made using resource host status information, is exhausted, is restored decision and assign decision.
(one or more) manager 210 can with assignment blocks 330 so as to dispose be directed to file 310 in more memory spaces
And be used for rebalancing and recovery client request 122.In some instances, processor 202 is between storage equipment 114
Copy block 330n, this is different from for data block 330nD and encoding block 330nC being distributed between storage resource 114.Manager 210
It can maintain the load diagram 216 of resource host load and vigor.In some implementations, manager 210 is candidate by generating
The list of resource host 110 carrys out assignment blocks 330 and sends each of candidate resource host 110 for assignment blocks request.If
The overload of resource host 110 does not have available space, then resource host 110 can refuse the request.In this case, it manages
Person 210 selects different resource hosts 110.Each manager 210 can constantly scan its specifying part in file name space
Point, primary all metadata 212 are about checked per minute.File scan can be used to check metadata 212 in manager 210
Integrality determines the work for needing to be performed, and/or generates statistics.File scan can be concomitantly with manager's 210
Other are operated.Scanning itself can not modify metadata 212, will be by the completion of the other component of system but dispatch
It works and counting statistics is digital.
With reference to Fig. 4 A-4B, job management system 220 can determine or receive the systemic hierarchial 400 of distributed system 100
The rank (for example, rank 1-4) of maintenance or failure may occur at which for mark, without influence to the data 312 that are stored and/
Or user's access of processor 112, to allow to access stored data 312.Maintenance or failure (stringent level 400a (figure
4A), non-critical level 400b (Fig. 4 B)) it may include power maintenance/failure, cooling system maintenance failure, networking maintenance/event
Barrier, update or renewal part or other maintenances or the power failure for influencing distributed system 100.Maintenance can be scheduled, and
In some instances, it may occur however that the unscheduled system failure.
Systemic hierarchial 400 includes system level (for example, rank 1-5), wherein 402 span of maintenance unit/system domain one
Or multiple system level 1-5.Each system domain 402 has active state or inactive state.Distribution center's module 410 includes one
A or multiple units 420,420a-n, and each unit 420 includes one or more racks 430 of resource host 110.Each
Unit 420 further includes unit cooling 422, cell power 424 (for example, bus duct) and the networking 426 of unit rank (for example, (one
It is a or multiple more) network switch).Similarly, each rack 430 includes rack cooling 432, rack power 434 (for example, female
Wire casing) and rack rank networking 436 (for example, maintenance fault network interchanger).
System level may include the first system rank, second system rank, third system level and the 4th system level
1-4.The first system rank 1 correspond to data processing equipment 112, non-transient memory devices 114 or the network equipment 116 (such as
NIC resource host or host machine 110,110a-n).Each host machine/resource host 110 has system domain 402.Second
System level 2 corresponds to cooling delivery device 432, the power of rack 430,430a-n and the host machine 110 at chassis level
Delivery device 434 (for example, bus duct) or communication delivery device 436 (for example, the network switch and cable).Each rack 430 or machine
Frame grade-cooling delivery device 432 ,-power delivery device 434 or-communication delivery device 436 have system domain 402.Third system level 3
Corresponding to any unit 420 of distribution center's module 410,420a-n and it is supplied to the unit of associated rack 430 cooling
422, cell power 424 or unit rank networking 426.Each unit 420 or unit cooling 422, cell power 424 or cell level
Not Lian Wang 426 have system domain 402.4th system level 4 corresponds to distribution center's module 410.Each distribution center's module 410
With system domain 402.
Fig. 4 A shows critical system level 400a, and wherein each level component of systemic hierarchial 400 is (for example, resource master
Machine 110, rack 430, unit 420 or distribution center's module 410) depend on other level component 110,410,420,430.
Although Fig. 4 B shows non-critical system level 400b, a level component 110,410,420,430 has more than one
Input feeding.In some instances, system level 400 is stored in the non-transient of its processor 202 and deposited by job management system 220
On reservoir 204.For example, job management system 220 by first resource host 110 (and its corresponding processor resource 112a and
Storage resource 114a) it is mapped to the first rack 430a, the first rack 430a is mapped to the first bus duct 420a, and by first
Bus duct 420a is mapped to the first distribution center module 410a.
Job management system 220 determined based on the mapping of level component 110,410,420,430 when level component 110,
410,420,430 which resource host 110 when being undergoing maintenance are inactive.Once job management system 220 is by system
When domain 402 is mapped to resource host 110 (and being therefore mapped to its corresponding processor resource 112a and storage resource 114a),
Job management system 220 is determined to execute the highest level (for example, rank 1-4) of maintenance at which, while maintaining processor
Or availability of data.
System domain 402 includes the level component 110,410,420,430 of experience maintenance and any level portion dependent on it
Part 110,410,420,430.Therefore, when an experience maintenance of level component 110,410,420,430, the level component 110,
410,420,430 be inactive, and any other level in the system domain 402 of level component 110,410,420,430
Component 110,410,420,430 is also inactive.For example, when resource host 110 undergoes and safeguards, including storage equipment 114,
The 1 system domain 402a of rank of data processor 112 and NIC 116 are inactive.When rack 430, which is undergone, to be safeguarded, packet
The 2 system domain 402b of rank of including rack 430 and any resource host 110 for being subordinated to rack 430 is inactive.Work as list
Component 420 is (for example, into the unit cooling-part 422, bus duct 424 and/or the network switch 426 of assembly of elements 420a
Any one) experience maintenance when, including unit 420 and any level portion for being subordinated in the rank 3 and 4 of assembly of elements 420
The 3 system domain 402c of rank of part 110,410,420,430 is inactive.Finally, when the experience dimension of distribution center's module 410
When shield, including distribution center module 410a and any level component being subordinated in the rank 2 to 4 of distribution center's module 410
110,410,420,430 4 system domain 402 of rank, 402d are inactive.
In some instances, as shown in Figure 4 B, non-critical level component 410,420,430,114 can have dual feedback
It send, i.e., level component 110,410,420,430 depends on two or more other level components 110,410,420,430.Example
Such as, assembly of elements 420 can have the feeding from Liang Ge distribution center module 410；And/or rack 430 can have and come from
The dual feeding of two assembly of elements 420.As shown, 2 system domain 402b of rank may include two rack 430a,
430n, wherein the second rack 430n includes two feedings from two assembly of elements 420a, 420n.Therefore, the second rack
430n is a part of two systems domain 402bb and 402cc.Therefore, the lower rank of system level 400 is maintained, without drawing
Play the loss of the higher levels of system level 400.This causes the redundancy in distributed system 100, allows data accessibility.
Specifically, distribution center's module 410 can be maintained, and be subordinated to without loss any in its assembly of elements 420.Some
In example, rack 430 includes dual power supply rack, and the maintenance of bus duct 424 is allowed to be subordinated to its dual power supply without being lost to
The power of rack 430.In some instances, it can be maintained without causing the system domain 402 of failure quilt when being distributed block 330n
Ignore to allow to safeguard；However, ignored system domain 402 can be when being distributed block 330n by comprising this is because outside the plan
Failure can still cause the loss of block 330n.
In some instances, cooling equipment, such as unit cooling 422 and rack cooling 432 are respectively used to cooling unit portion
Part 420 and rack 430.Unit cooling-part 422 can cool down one or more assembly of elements 420.Similarly, rack cooling end
Part 432 can cool down one or more racks 430.210 storage resource host 110 of manager and cooling equipment (such as unit is cold
But 422 and the cooling association 432) of rack.In some implementations, job management system 220 storage resource host 110 with
The association of unit cooling 422 and rack cooling 432 considers all possible combinations for the maintenance that may occur in system 100 before
To determine systemic hierarchial 400 or safeguard the combination of level 400.For example, what one or more cooling equipment 422,432 broke down
Event occurs for systemic hierarchial 400 or the power distribution 424,434 that systemic hierarchial 400 or the network equipment 116,426,436 break down
The systemic hierarchial 400 of barrier.
Therefore, when the experience of level component 110,410,420,430 in system 100 is safeguarded or broken down, the level
Component 110,410,420,430 and any level component for being mapped to or being subordinated to the level component 110,410,420,430
110,410,420,430 is inactive.Inactive level component 110,410,420,430 can not by with
Family 120 accesses, and the level component 110,410,420,430 being in active state can be accessed by user 120, to allow user
120 processing/access is by the level component 110,410,420,430 storages/support/maintenance data 312.As previously mentioned
, during inactive state, user 120 can not access resource host associated with the system domain 402 of maintenance is undergone
110；And therefore, user 120 can not access file 310 (that is, block 330 comprising tape copy 330n, data block 330nD
With non-data block 330nC).
In some implementations, manager 210 is for example limited based on the mapping of level component 110,410,420,430
Multiple pieces 330 be distributed to the storage equipment 114 of any one system domain 402.Therefore, if 1 system domain 402 of rank is not living
Dynamic, then manager 210 maintains the accessibility to file 310 (or item 320), although some pieces 330 can be inaccessible by
's.In some instances, for each file 310 (or band 320), 210 determination of manager can be placed on individual system
The maximum quantity of the block 330 in any storage equipment 114 in domain 402, so that if being directed to the block 330 of file 310 with storage
The associated system domain 402 of storage equipment 114 be undergoing maintenance, then manager 210 can still fetch file 310.Block
330 maximum quantity ensures that manager 210 can reconstruct file 310, although some pieces 330 may be disabled.Some
In example, the maximum quantity of block 330 is arranged to lower threshold to adapt to any system failure, while still being able to according to block
330 reconstruct file 310.When block 330 is placed in storage equipment 114 by manager 210, manager 210 ensures in band
In 320, the block 330 when individual system domain 402, which is undergone, safeguards no more than maximum quantity is inactive.In addition, manager 210
The resource host 110 that can also be for example limited in system domain 402 based on the mapping of level component 110,410,420,430
The quantity of processing operation on data processor 112.Therefore, if 1 system domain 402 of rank be it is inactive, manager 210
It maintains to the accessibility of operation, although some in the processor 112 of resource host 110 are inactive.
With reference to Fig. 5, in some implementations, system 100 follows operation 500, is shown for when generation maintenance thing
Storage resource 114 and data processor 112 are efficiently used when part.System 100 identifies resource type at step 502: 1) non-
Storage resource (such as the calculating of data processor 112 uses, networking, and power delivery is cooling, etc.)；2) storage capacity resources
(for example, byte use/memory capacity of storage equipment 114)；Or 3) memory bandwidth resource (for example, per second allow to hard disk
The quantity of the input/output operations of storage or the shaft utilization/access amount allowed for this storage).
System 100 also identifies two class operations/request 122.First kind operation 122 includes high availability operation 122a, and
Second class includes standard or low availability operation 122b (Figure 1B).System 100 is transported on the processor 112 of resource host 110
Row processing operation 122, and in the storage equipment 114 of resource host 110 operation for accessing/the storage of storing data 312
Operation 122.When two kinds of operation 122a, 122b are all in (discussed below) quota, high availability operation 122a
It is the operation 122 with priority more higher than low availability operation 122b.
In some implementations, when system 100 specifies the resources loss of which type that can be tolerated, system 100
Use is determined based on whether the loss includes the loss of data processor 112 or memory devices 114 or both at step 504
In the strategy for tolerating the loss.Non-memory resource is used, job management system 220 from what is broken down using non-depositing
The operation 122 of storage resource (for example, data processor 112), which migrates and/or restarts other, can be used the first plan of non-memory resource
Slightly 506a.Storage resource is used, job management system 220 gives up the storage money that access is broken down using in certain place
Second strategy 506b of the operation 122 (at least continue special time period) in source 114 and/or data reconstruction can be used to fetch not
Data available 312.In some instances, the first strategy processing resource relevant to computing resource 112 (for example, calculate or network)
110；And the second strategy processing storage resource 114 (for example, storage equipment, such as hard disk and flash memory).When breaking down/lose
When, job management system 220 can determine whether the loss is data processor 112 or the loss for storing equipment 114.If should
Loss is the loss of storage equipment 114, then job management system 220 is using the strategy 2 at step 506b；Otherwise, working pipe
Reason system 220 is using the strategy 1 at step 506a.
When job management system 220 using the first strategy relevant to data processor 112 (that is, calculate and networking) (
At step 506a) when, job management system 220 will distribute to the height for the data processor 112 lost due to being tolerated event
Availability calculations operation 122 migrates or reruns remaining data available processor 112.For example, if certain power or net
Network maintenance event causes 10% data processor 112 unavailable, then operation 122 is moved to operation by job management system 220
On the data processor 112 of residue 90%.
When job management system 220 is using second tactful (at the step 506b) for being used for storage resource 114, working pipe
Reason system 220 is given up be stored in maintenance or event of failure during data 312 in inactive storage equipment 114,
And allow system 100 using (being discussed with reference to Fig. 3 A and 3B) duplication and/or coding to reconstruct unavailable data 312.?
In some examples, system 100 is simultaneously using the first strategy and the second strategy.
Once system 100 has determined that, using which strategy, system 100 just calculates during normal use at step 508
(that is, when system 100 is not undergoing maintenance) available to operation 122 each resource 110 is (that is, 114 sum number of storage resource
According to processor resource 112) amount (that is, quota Q).
Job management system 220 determines the first quota Q of available resources 1101With the second quota Q2.The of available resources 110
One quota Q1Including to the available resource 110 of low availability operation 122b and in the normal operation period (that is, working as system 100
When not being undergoing maintenance or failure) amount of available resource 110.Second quota Q of available resources 1102Including can to height
It with the available resource 110 of property operation 122b and is the amount of available resource 110 in the normal operation period.When occurring infrequently
When maintenance or event of failure, low availability operation 122b meets with insufficient resource 110, leads to property degrading or being not present
Energy.Always following equation can be used with quota or operation capacity Q to calculate:
Q=Q1+Q2 (1)
Wherein, Q is total available quota by the resource 110 of operation 122 (high availability and low availability) demand, Q1It is
One quota, and Q2For the second quota.Since total available demand quota/capacity Q can be more than that can be used in the normal operation period
Resource amount RN, so job management system 220 will be by both high availability operation 122a and low availability operation 122b
Being constrained to total use of resource 110 in the normal operation period (that is, when system 100 is not undergoing maintenance or failure) can
The amount R of resource 110NThe actually available of the resource 110 is less than to ensure to be assigned to the quantity of the operation 122 of resource 110
Capacity is (for example, RN).System 100 can be used equation 1 and match to determine for storage resource 114 and the available of process resource 112
Volume Q.It can be the capacity of resource, volume percent, bandwidth or size measurement with quota Q.
In some instances, system 100 reduce before the event that is tolerated (i.e. maintenance event or the system failure) to it is low can
With the first quota Q of the available resource 110 of sexual behavior part 122b1Certain time section, and increase before being tolerated event
To the second quota Q of the available resource 110 of high availability event 122a2The persistently period.Additionally or alternately, system
100, which can stop or terminate the low availability operation of at least some of low availability operation 122b before being tolerated event, continues
Certain period of time.High availability operation 122a is moved to available resources 110 by this permission system 100.
In some implementations, system 100 can be based on operation 122 to the system layer with distributed memory system 100
The distribution of 400 (Fig. 4 A and 4B) associated specific resources 110 of grade is to determine the resource 110 lost due to being tolerated event
Amount.In some implementations, when the maintenance or failure planned, job management system 220 is by certain types of host
Resource 110 is determined as " being tolerated ".The available quota Q of these operations 122 is reduced by the maximum for the loss being tolerated,
Data accessibility and data processing availability are safeguarded simultaneously.Systemic hierarchial 400a, 400b, distribution center's module 410, unit portion
Part 420, rack 430 or resource host 110 can be designated as being tolerated.
In some instances, during the normal operating of system 100,100% resource 110 can be used for depositing data 312
Store up the data 312 on the data processor 112 in storage equipment 114 or for process resource host 110." maximum " is held
Bear event (i.e. maintenance event or the system failure) can the distribution based on systemic hierarchial 400 and resource 110 to system domain 402 come
To the loss of 20% available resources 110.80% resource 110 can be used always in this, in spite of the maximum of 20% resource 110
Loss.Therefore, the resource 110 of maximum 80% is distributed to high availability operation 122a by job management system 220, to allow
When scheduled maintenance or the system failure occurs, system 100 has enough resources 110.If job management system 220 will
Operation 122 relevant to data processor 212 is reassigned to 80% available processors 212, then system 100 will have enough
Processor 212 run high availability operation 122a.In addition, if system 100 must be reconstructed due to including storing data 312
Storage equipment 114 system domain 402 inactive state and not available data 312, then system 100 have enough storages
Equipment 114, enough storage equipment 114 have enough piece 330 (for example, data block 330nD and non-data block 330nC) and secondary
This 330n carrys out the data 312 of reconstruction of lost.
At step 508a, non-memory capacity is used (i.e. under strategy 1), is determined to high availability operation 122a
Second quota Q of available resource 1102, the second quota Q of available resources 1102For available resource 110 in the normal operation period
Amount subtract the amount of the resource 110 lost due to being tolerated event.Therefore, the second quota Q2It can be in the resource 110 of loss
Equation based on following calculates when for data processor 112:
Q2=RN-RL (2)
Wherein, RNIt is the amount of available resource in the normal operation period, and RLIt is the money lost due to being tolerated event
The maximum in source.
In some implementations, system 100 determines the second quota Q when the resource 110 of loss is storage equipment 1142。
At step 508b, memory capacity is used (i.e. under strategy 2), is determined to the available resource of high availability operation 122a
110 the second quota Q2, the second quota Q of storage equipment 114 available to high availability operation 122a2It can be equal to and normally may be used
The full amount of resource 110 is (although the use of the resource 110 can need replicated block 330n or encoded pieces
The redundancy of 330nC, 330nD), such as used equation 3 calculated.
Q2=RN (3)
This can be with byte use/capacity of application memory equipment 114.For example, the word of up to 100% storage equipment 114
Section use/capacity can be assigned to high availability operation 122a.
At step 508c, (that is, under strategy 2) is used for memory bandwidth, is determined to high availability operation 122a
Second quota Q of available resource 1102, the second quota Q of the storage resource 1142(that is, bandwidth or use) is (for example, per second permit
Perhaps the quantity to the input/output operations of hard-disc storage or the shaft utilization/access amount allowed for this storage) it can be by
It is calculated as the amount R of resource 110 good for useNSubtract the maximum loss R due to the resource 110 for being tolerated eventLSubtract due to
It is tolerated the increased amount R of the maximum loss that event is lost and the resource usedI, as shown in following equation:
Q2=RN-RL-RI (4)
In some instances, system 100 can be when calculating the resource 110 lost be storage equipment 114 (such as hard disk)
The second quota Q is determined using following equation2:
Wherein, x corresponds to the resource multiplier for being tolerated event.
For example, if up to 10% hard disk shaft can lose in being tolerated event, and if number to loss
Averagely as many as 4 times (needs of data 312 are reconstructed due to using coding) that shaft uses are required according to 312 each access,
Then equation 5A is used:
Therefore, 69% shaft resource can available to high availability operation (calculating be based on the fact that only 90%
Shaft be available, and support the normal load from high availability operation 130%).
Once system 100 calculates the second quota Q of resource 1102, system 100 allows for low availability operation and Gao Ke
In the data center with property job run, two constraints being limited by step 510.First constraint is to be made by high availability
Total amount (the Q for each resource 110 that industry 122a and low availability operation 122b are used1+Q2) it can not be more than resource good for use
Amount RN, as shown in following equation:
Q1+Q2≤RN (6)
Second constraint is by the amount Q of the high availability operation 122a each resource usedUIt can not be more than the second quota
Q2, as shown in following equation:
QU≤Q2 (7)
In some implementations, job management system 220 monitors the use by high availability operation 122a to resource 110
To ensure that they do not consume too many resource 110.When high availability operation 122a is more than threshold value in use, job management system 220
High availability operation 122a is downgraded to low availability operation 122b.When high availability operation 122a is downgraded, job management
System 220 can terminate degraded operation 122b, and to the available active volume of high availability operation 122a, (second matches for increase
Volume).
The quota Q that can be used is determined in job management system 2202Later, job management system 220 is realized for adapting to
The process of maintenance and event of failure.When maintenance and event of failure reduce the amount of available resource 110, job management system 220
It can stop, killing, evicting from or otherwise preventing sufficient amount of low availability operation 122b using resource 110, so that
Resource 110 can use high availability operation 122a.In addition, being sent to it if live flow is being supplied in these operations 122
The amount of flow can be reduced or be divided to other data centers.
In addition, job management system 220 can stop before maintenance, kills, evict from the case where unscheduled maintenance
Or otherwise prevent some or all of low availability operation 122b using 110 same time amount of specific resources, to allow
High availability operation 122a is moved to so that resource 110.
It, can be in the resource host 110 of data center although foregoing description concentrates on the resource 110 in data center
(machine), rack 430, unit 420, network, cluster, building, website, region or entire worldwide collection level at apply phase
Same principle.
Fig. 6 provides the resource 110 (for example, processor 112 and/or resource host 114) being efficiently used in data center
Method 600 operation exemplary arrangement.Method 600 includes making for the resource 110 of 602 demand distributed systems 100 of mark
High availability operation 122a and low availability operation 122b, and will be to the low available resource 110 of availability operation 122b
The first quota Q1Determine that 604 be the amount R of available resource 110 in the normal operation periodN.Method 600 further includes will be to High Availabitity
Second quota Q of the property available resource 110 of operation 122a2Determine that 606 subtract for the amount of available resource 110 in the normal operation period
Remove the amount R for the resource 110 lost due to being tolerated eventL.Method 600 include distributed system 100 resource 122,
608 operations are run on 122a, 122b, and will be by both high availability operation 122a and low availability operation 122b to resource
110 total use is constrained to the amount R of available resource 110 in the normal operation periodN。
In some implementations, resource 110,112,116,422,424,426,432,434,436 includes data processing
Equipment 112, networked system 116,426,436, power system 424,434 or cooling system 422,432.For the money of these types
Source 110,112,116,422,424,426,432,434,436, method 600 may include that will lose to due to being tolerated event
