Figure 1A illustrates for using PLDA+ technology to extract the block diagram of the example processor of theme from document.In PLDA+, utilize a plurality of processors from document, to extract theme.Processor 102 is the processors that represent in a plurality of processors.
At theme, extract in operation, theme is represented as one or more word-theme matrix.When utilizing a plurality of processors to extract theme from document, traditional PLDA technology has two features conventionally.Each processor is preserved whole word-theme matrix.Each processor sends whole word-theme matrix and receives whole word-theme matrix from other processors to other processors.By contrast, in PLDA+, document and word-theme matrix distribution are at a plurality of processors place.In matrix switch operation, the matrix distributing is synchronous between processor.Theme in PLDA+ extracts operation and matrix switch operation executed in parallel, thereby the conventional PLDA technology of carrying out than these operation serials has improved calculating and communication efficiency.
Processor 102 is configured to extract theme from D document, and wherein D represents Any Digit.D document distributes between P processor.Processor 102 as one of P processor is preserved about D/P document.D document is corresponding to the vocabulary of the word in document.Vocabulary comprises W word.Processor 102 storage matrix 104, the corresponding relation that matrix 104 represents between D/P document and W word.Matrix 104 is (D/P) * W matrixes.
Processor 102 is stored word-theme matrix 106 also.Word-theme matrix 106 means the matrix of the corresponding relation between K theme and the vocabulary of W word.Word-theme matrix 106 is K * W matrixes, and wherein theme is as a dimension, and word is as another dimension.Each element in word-theme matrix 106 can represent the counting of the word in corresponding theme.Can construct word-theme matrix 106 by the repeatedly iteration of the gibbs sampler for D/P document.
After each iteration of gibbs sampler, local word-theme matrix is by global synchronization.Local word-theme matrix is included in word-theme matrix 106 of processor 102 places storage.When word-theme matrix 106 be stored in matrix on other processors while synchronizeing, word-theme matrix 106 is by global synchronization.
Figure 1B is the block diagram that example PLDA+ system 110 is shown.In PLDA+ system 110, utilize data placement and process pipelining than traditional PLDA, to have strengthened the performance of distributed treatment.
From high-grade, a plurality of matrixes that are distributed to each processor are preserved on PLDA+ system 110 portions ground, for extract theme from document.A plurality of matrixes comprise word-theme matrix and document-theme matrix.Word-theme matrix (also referred to as word-theme count matrix) is represented as C
word.Word-theme matrix is the data structure with following a plurality of elements: wherein, and each Elements C
wkthe quantity that is assigned to the word w of theme k.Document-theme matrix (also referred to as document-theme count matrix) is represented as C
doc.Document-theme matrix is the data structure as follows with a plurality of elements: wherein, and each Elements C
kjto be assigned to document d

PLDA+ system 110 comprises the processor of two types: document processor (Pd processor) and matrix processor (Pw processor).Document processor is the processor that can execute the task, and this task comprises preserves document, the operation of execution gibbs sampler and traffic operation.D document exists | between Pd| document processor, distribute.Document processor 112 is | one of Pd| processor.Document processor 112 is preserved about D/|Pd| document.Document processor 112 is preserved word-document matrix 116.Word-document matrix 116 means the matrix of the corresponding relation between D/|Pd| document of document processor 112 and the vocabulary of W word of D document.Word-document matrix 116 is (D/|Pd|) * W matrixes.
Matrix processor is following processor: wherein each processor can be executed the task, and this task comprises a part of preserving W * K word-theme matrix.W * K word-theme matrix exists | between Pw| matrix processor, distributes.Each matrix processor is assigned with the subset of the vocabulary of W word.Matrix processor 114 storage part participle-theme matrixes 118.Part word-theme matrix 118 comprises a part for the W * K word-theme matrix corresponding with the subset of vocabulary that is assigned to matrix processor 114.The word dimension of part word-theme matrix 118 is corresponding to the subset of vocabulary.The size of word dimension by W and | the value of Pw| and the quantity of matrix processor are determined.The theme dimension of part word-theme matrix 118 is corresponding to K theme.Thereby part word-theme matrix 118 is (W/|Pw|) * K matrixes.
Document processor 112 is carried out gibbs sampler iteratively.During each iteration of gibbs sampler, document processor 112 distributes new theme to word in theme search operation, and theme search operation comprises three phases: the theme that (1) document processor 112 obtains word from matrix processor 114 distributes; (2) document processor 112 is carried out gibbs sampler and is distributed new theme to this word; And 112 pairs of matrix processors (matrix processor 114 or other matrix processors) of preserving this word of (3) document processor upgrade.
Fig. 2 is the block diagram that the example theme distribution pattern of data placement technology is shown.Document processor 202(Pd0) distribute one or more theme to each word in one or more word.Document processor 202 is communicated by letter to synchronize part word-theme matrix of being preserved by matrix processor 204 with matrix processor 204.Matrix processor 204 is used the theme of the word in the subset (subset of this word is assigned to matrix processor 204) of distributing to word by document processor 202 to upgrade part word-theme matrix of being preserved by matrix processor 204.
Document processor 206,208 is communicated by letter with matrix processor 204 by obtaining operation with 210.Each in document processor 206,208 and 210 obtained the part word-theme matrix in matrix processor 204 places storage, but not whole K * W word-theme matrix.Thereby the part word-theme matrix after renewal is transmitted to document processor 206,208 and 210.
Fig. 3 A and Fig. 3 B are the figure that the example sequence of events of processing pipelining is shown.As shown, in PLDA+ system, a plurality of operation executed in parallel, have strengthened overall performance than conventional PLDA system thus.Each in Fig. 3 A and Fig. 3 B represents the sequence of events of the gibbs sampler of four word w1, w2, w3 and w4.In Fig. 3 A and Fig. 3 B, operation is obtained in the box indicating that is marked with letter " F "; Operation is upgraded in the box indicating that is marked with letter " U "; Be marked with the box indicating gibbs sampler operation of letter " S ".
Fig. 3 A shows the sample situation that sampling time Ts is more than or equal to acquisition time Tf and Tu sum update time (Ts >=Tf+Tu).Sampling time Ts is that processor is carried out the time that the gibbs sampler task as bind calculation task spends.Acquisition time Tf is that processor obtains the time that theme distributes and spends.Update time, Tu was the time that update processor theme distributes and spends.Obtaining theme distribution and upgrading theme distribution is communication bindings task.
In the example illustrating, PLDA+ system is obtained and is operated 302 since first, first, obtains in operation 302, and the theme that document processor obtains word w1 from matrix processor distributes.Subsequently, document processor is carried out the first gibbs sampler operation 304 to word w1.Operate 304 concurrently with the first gibbs sampler, document processor is carried out second and is obtained operation 306, second, obtains in operation 306, and the theme that document processor obtains word w2 distributes.
After the first gibbs sampler operation 304 of the complete twin words w1 of document processor, document processor is carried out first and is upgraded operation 308, and in the first renewal operation 308, the theme that document processor upgrades the w1 on matrix processor distributes.Upgrading theme distribution w1 comprises to matrix processor transmission update request.Update request can comprise the result of the first gibbs sampler operation 304.
After document processor completes the first gibbs sampler operation 304, document processor is carried out the second gibbs sampler operation 310 to word w2; The second operation 310 is carried out with the theme distributed parallel that upgrades w1.If the time of carrying out an operation to a certain extent with the time-interleaving of carrying out another operation, two operations will be described to parallel generation.After document processor completes the first renewal operation 308, document processor is carried out the 3rd and is obtained operation 312 to obtain the theme distribution of word w3.Document processor and the second gibbs sampler operation 314 are carried out concurrently the 3rd and are obtained operation 312.Document processor is carried out the 3rd gibbs sampler operation 316 to the 3rd word w3 in a similar fashion, and execution the 4th is obtained operation the 318, the 3rd and upgraded operation the 320, the 4th gibbs sampler operation the 322 and the 4th renewal operation 324.When Ts >=Tf+Tu, the T.T. that PLDA+ system is processed W word is W*Ts+Tf+Tu.
Fig. 3 B shows the sample situation that sampling time Ts is less than acquisition time Tf and Tu sum update time (Ts < Tf+Tu).In the example illustrating, PLDA+ system is obtained and is operated 332 since first, first, obtains in operation 332, and the theme that document processor obtains word w1 distributes.Subsequently, document processor is carried out the first gibbs sampler operation 334 to word w1.Operate 334 concurrently with the first gibbs sampler, document processor is carried out second and is obtained operation 336, second, obtains in operation 336, and the theme that document processor obtains word w2 distributes.
After the first gibbs sampler operation 334 of the complete twin words w1 of document processor, document processor is carried out first and is upgraded operation 338, and in the first renewal operation 338, the theme that document processor upgrades w1 distributes.Concurrently, immediately, after document processor completes the first gibbs sampler operation 334, document processor is carried out the second gibbs sampler operation 340 to word w2.
When Ts < Tf+Tu, document processor is carried out the second renewal operation 342 after completing the second gibbs sampler operation 340.Subsequently, document processor is carried out the 3rd and is obtained operation 346, the 3rd, obtains in operation 346, and the theme that document processor obtains word w3 distributes.Then, document processor is carried out the 3rd gibbs sampler operation 348, and carries out concurrently the 4th and obtain operation 350, the 4th, obtains in operation 350, and the theme that document processor obtains word w4 distributes.After completing the 3rd gibbs sampler operation 348, document processor is carried out the 3rd and is upgraded operation the 352 and the 4th gibbs sampler operation 354.Finally, document processor is carried out the 4th renewal operation 356.When Ts < Tf+Tu, what PLDA+ system was processed W word is greater than W*Ts+Tf+Tu T.T..
In some implementations, gibbs sampler operates, obtains operation and upgrade operation and is scheduled to make as much as possible Ts >=Tf+Tu.This scheduling utilizes word binding technology and low delay communication scheduling technology to guarantee as much as possible Ts >=Tf+Tu.By word is bundled, the group of word is carried out to gibbs sampler and operate to guarantee that Ts is fully long.Under low delay communication scheduling, communication bindings task is scheduled as follows, and which is minimally postponed bind calculation task by communication bindings task.Descriptor bundlees technology and low delay communication scheduling in further detail below.
Fig. 4 is the figure that the example word binding technology in PLDA+ system is shown.For convenient, with reference to four document processor Pd0 to Pd3 descriptor binding technology.
Document processor Pd0 to Pd3 can carry out gibbs sampler according to word order 402a to 402d.Cyclically process the word that occurs several times in the document of document processor.And, the word frequently not occurring and the frequent word occurring are bundled to guarantee that Ts is fully long.When the value of Tf+Tu is known, can determine the counting that the intrafascicular pending word of each gibbs sampler occurs.The tied Tf+Tu of making of word is shorter than Ts so that obtain the maximum probability being done when completing last gibbs sampler task, thereby avoids increasing the stand-by period.
Each in document processor Pd0 to Pd3 is that the document that is distributed to document processor is set up glossarial index.Word in index is organized into round-robin queue 410.Document processor Pd0 to Pd3 operates by the touring gibbs sampler of carrying out in round-robin queue 410.For fear of the time access to same word of a plurality of document processors, each in document processor is scheduled and starts with the reference position being different from the reference position of other document processors.For example, in comprising the round-robin queue 410 of word w0 to w7, document processor Pd0 can start the first word from word w0; Document processor Pd1 can start the first word from word w2; Document processor Pd2 can start the first word from word w4; And document processor Pd3 can start the first word from word w6.
Except dispatching diverse location place in different document processor Yi round-robin queues 410 starts, part word-theme matrix is distributed on matrix processor in the mode of circulation.The loop distribution of part word-theme matrix has been guaranteed: when in document processor place executive communication task, communication task can be by corresponding matrix processor but not a plurality of matrix processor serve.
Fig. 5 A and Fig. 5 B are the block diagrams that the data placement at each processor place in PLDA+ system is shown.The word that Fig. 5 A shows on matrix processor is arranged.Matrix processor 506 is configured to the request of obtaining and update request from document processor to make response.W * K word-theme matrix 502 is distributed to a plurality of matrix processors according to word.After distribution, each matrix processor is preserved about W/|Pw| word of the theme distribution with word.W/|Pw| the word that matrix processor 506 can distribute the theme with word is stored as (W/|Pw|) * K matrix 504.
Can utilize word to distribute implementation space load balancing.Matrix processor 506 and other matrix processors separately can be for processing the request of equal number in the iteration of gibbs sampler.
For W * K word-theme matrix 502 is distributed to a plurality of matrix processors, PLDA+ system is preserved two kinds of data structures: word weight data structure and working load (workload) data structure.Word weight data structure is the data structure of stored word weight.The quantity of the resident document processor thereon of word Wi (it is also the weight of word) is represented as m
i.For W word, PLDA+ system is preserved vector
matrix processor 506 and on each other matrix processor.The working load of matrix processor 506 is defined as the weight sum of all words on matrix processor 506.Matrix processor Pw
iworking load be represented as l
i.Working load data structure comprises and being expressed as
vector.
In some implementations, word is independent and be as one man randomly dispersed on matrix processor.In some implementations, can use Weighted Round Robin word to arrange.In Weighted Round Robin word is arranged, the weight by word sorts to word with increasing or decreasing order.When matrix processor 506 has minimum workload in a plurality of matrix processors, the word with weight limit in the vocabulary of W word (for example, word Wi) is disposed on matrix processor 506.Then, upgrade the working load of matrix processor 506.Repeat to select operation, placement operations and renewal operation, until arranged all words.
After PLDA+ system is arranged on matrix processor 506 by the word with the distribution of word theme, matrix processor 506 counts to set up its responsible word-theme count matrix by receiving initial word-theme from document processor
matrix processor 506 starts to process the request from document processor.Request from document processor can have three types:
-obtaining (wi, pw, pd): the theme that request is obtained word w by document processor pd distributes.For this request, matrix processor pw will return to the theme distribution C of w
w|pw, this is used as the formula for gibbs sampler (2)
-upgrade (w,
-to obtain (pw, pd): the general subject matter that request is obtained on matrix processor pw by pd is counted.Matrix processor pw can distribute the theme of the upper all words of pw to be added as vector
In table 1 below, illustrated for being called pw at matrix processor 506(at this algorithm) manage the exemplary algorithm from the request of document processor everywhere.
Table 1. is managed the request from document processor everywhere at matrix processor
In some implementations, for obtain the largest interval inter of total theme counting from all matrix processors during the gibbs sampler of document processor
maxvalue be configured to equal the quantity of the word in vocabulary.
The document that Fig. 5 B shows on document processor is arranged.Word-document matrix 510 is for representing the mapping between word and document.Word-document matrix 510 is can be for identify the reverse indexing of one or more document according to a word.
Word-document matrix 510 can be distributed to portions between a plurality of document processors.A part 512 for word-document matrix 510 can comprise W/|Pd| document and W word.Document processor 516 can storage area document-word matrix 514, and partial document-word matrix 514 is corresponding to part 512.Partial document-word matrix 514 is (W/|Pd|) * W matrixes.
Fig. 6 is the process flow diagram that example PLDA+ process 600 is shown.PLDA+ system is distributed (602) D document between one or more document processor.PLDA+ system is distributed to document processor in balanced mode by document.This is by adopting random document to distribute to realize.Each document processor is assigned with about W/|Pd| document.The time complexity of this allocated phase is O (D).
PLDA+ system is document structuring (603) reverse indexing of each document processor.Reverse indexing is the index based on word.The index structure of each word w is:
w→{(d
1，z
1)，(d
1，z
2)，(d
2，z
1)...} (4)
When word w is at document d
1in while occurring n time, there is n entry.In some implementations, PLDA+ system is by d
1the institute of middle word w occurs and is recorded as an entry (d
1, { z
1, z
2).
PLDA+ system becomes word bundle for gibbs sampler the word grouping (604) in vocabulary.Word is grouped into word bundle and can guarantees that duration of gibbs sampler operation fully longly operates with shielded communication.When communication task can complete within the duration of gibbs sampler operation, the duration of gibbs sampler operation is fully grown and operates with shielded communication.If word only occurs once on document processor, compare with obtaining with the theme that upgrades this word needed time that distributes, this word is carried out to shorter time of gibbs sampler cost, thereby do not have shielding.
In order to ensure shielding, PLDA+ system is by a plurality of phrase compound word bundles, and the gibbs sampler time that call duration time can more be grown shields.The intrafascicular all words of word are disposed on same matrix processor, and the theme that makes a request can obtain the intrafascicular all words of word distributes.
For document processor, PLDA+ system bundlees word according to the matrix processor of word.The number of times that PLDA+ system occurs based on word sorts to the word being arranged on same matrix processor with the order of successively decreasing.Then, PLDA+ system made is through the word list of sequence.Then, PLDA+ system iterative ground is selected high frequency words and selects one or more low-frequency word from the afterbody of word list from the head of word list.PLDA+ system is grouped into word bundle by selected high frequency words and selected one or more low-frequency word.Thereby structure word bundle, matrix processor will return to the intrafascicular all words of word in response to the request of obtaining theme distribution.
PLDA+ system call (606) word bundle so that communication performance bottleneck minimize.In some implementations, PLDA+ system is dispatched word bundle according to random schedule scheme.In random schedule scheme, the word in vocabulary is stored as to round-robin queue.During gibbs sampler, sequentially to select word from this queue clockwise or counterclockwise.The difference skew of each document processor from round-robin queue starts, to avoid accessing same matrix processor simultaneously.When a plurality of requests arrive simultaneously, at some matrix processor places, may form bottleneck.Thereby, some document processors can be before gibbs sampler can start wait-for-response.In order to reduce wait, as described with reference to Fig. 4 A, PLDA+ system is registered the time limit in each request.Matrix processor is processed request according to the time limit of request.If missed the time limit of request, matrix processor can be abandoned this request so.Due to the random nature of gibbs sampler, lose once in a while and take turns gibbs sampler and do not affect overall performance.
(608) gibbs sampler based on streamline is carried out until meet end condition in PLDA+ system iterative ground.The reverse indexing of setting up in operational phase 603, whenever document processor has obtained the theme distribution of word w from matrix processor after, document processor is carried out the gibbs sampler of all examples of w on the document processor.After gibbs sampler, document processor sends it back corresponding matrix processor by the information through upgrading.
Repeatedly appearance for word on document processor, carries out two communication tasks: one is to obtain, and one is to upgrade.As shown in formula (2), in order to give document d
jin given word x
ij=w calculates and distributes new theme, PLDA+ system to obtain word-theme distribution of word w
Document processor can have different processing speeds.In PLDA+ system, quick file processor can be in the situation that needn't wait for that slow document processor starts the gibbs sampler based on streamline of a new round.The further details of the gibbs sampler based on streamline is described below with reference to Fig. 7.
Fig. 7 illustrates for carrying out the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure of the gibbs sampler based on streamline.Document processor pd obtains (702) for the general subject matter counting of gibbs sampler.Document processor pd obtains general subject matter distribution C
topic.In the stage 702, document processor pd submits to one or more to obtain request fetch (pw, pd) to each matrix processor.Document processor pd receives from comprising of matrix processor of whole theme counting
Document processor pd selects (704) F word bundle and F word bundle is put into thread pool to distribute to obtain the theme of word.Document processor submits to one or more to obtain request to matrix processor.Intrafascicular each of F word is corresponding to the request of obtaining.Document processor pd receives the response to this request from matrix processor.Response comprises that theme distributes.Theme in response distributes and is stored in waiting list.Thread pool can send request and process the response of returning concurrently.Can send a plurality of requests simultaneously.The request simultaneously sending can be assigned with the identical time limit.
Document processor pd selects the theme of (706) word to distribute to carry out gibbs sampler from waiting list.Once return to the response to the request of obtaining from matrix processor, document processor pd can start gibbs sampler immediately.In some implementations, the quantity of obtaining in advance request equals F.The value of F is configured to make waiting list Q
pdalways returned to the maximum probability of the theme distribution of the word of waiting for gibbs sampler.In some implementations, F is configured to be greater than the quantity of thread pool thread.
Document processor pd puts into the Document distribution after upgrading the thread pool of (708) document processor pd.The thread pool of document processor pd sends one or more update request to matrix processor.Document processor pd selects (710) neologisms bundle and neologisms bundle is put into thread pool.Document processor determines whether (712) meet update condition.When not meeting update condition, document processor pd enters the stage 706 to start the gibbs sampler of another word.If meet update condition, document processor obtains (714) new general subject matter counting.
