- the method can further include: using the respective second score to generate a respective ranking score for each of the search result resources; and providing search results to the user device, each search result identifying a respective search result resource, for presentation in an order according to the respective ranking scores.
- the method can further include: making further adjustments to the respective ranking scores before providing the search results to the user device.
- Identifying the group of resources to which each of the search result resources belongs can include: identifying the group of resources based on an Internet address of each of the search result resources.
- Adjusting the initial score for each of the search result resources based at least in part on the group-specific modification factor for the group of resources to which the search result resource belongs can include: generating a respective resource-specific modification factor for each of the search result resources based on the group-based modification factors.
- Adjusting the initial score for each of the search result resources based at least in part on the group-specific modification factor for the group of resources to which the search result resource belongs can further include: multiplying the initial score for the search result resource by the resource-specific modification factor for the search result resource.
- Generating a respective resource-specific modification factor for a first search result resource can include: determining that the search query is navigational to the first search result resource; and generating the resource-specific modification factor for the first search result resource so that the resource-specific modification factor does not modify the initial score for the first search result resource when applied to the initial score.
- Generating a respective resource-specific modification factor for a first search result resource can include: determining that the search query is not navigational to the first search result resource. Generating a respective resource-specific modification factor for the first search result resource can further include: determining that the initial score for the search result resource does not exceed a first threshold value; and generating the resource-specific modification factor for the first search result resource so that the resource-specific modification factor does not modify the initial score for the first search result resource when applied to the initial score.
- Generating a respective resource-specific modification factor for a third search result resource can further include: determining that the initial score for the third search result resource exceeds the second threshold value; and generating the resource-specific modification factor for the third search result resource, wherein the resource-specific modification factor (f 2 ) for the third search result resource is equal to:
- f 2 f 3 /log T 2 (IS) ⁇ g(f 3 ), wherein T 2 is the second threshold value, f 3 is an initial resource-specific modification factor for the third search result resource and g(f 3 ) is a smoothing function that reduces the effect of the resource-specific modification factor for the third search result resource on the initial score for the third search result resource for particular ranges of values of the initial resource-specific modification factor.
- An independent link for a particular group of resources can be a link from a source resource to a target resource, wherein the target resource is included in the particular group of resources, and wherein the source resource and the target resource have been determined to be independent.
- Determining that the source resource and the target resource are independent can include: determining that the source resource and the target resource are included in different groups of resources.

- Determining a respective group-specific modification factor for a particular group of resources can include: determining an initial modification factor for the particular group of resources, wherein the initial modification factor is a ratio of a number of independent links counted for the particular group to the number of reference queries counted for the particular group.
- Determining a respective group-specific modification factor for the particular group of resources can further include: partitioning the plurality of groups of resources into a plurality of partitions based on the respective counts of reference queries; and determining a normalized modification factor for the particular group by normalizing the initial modification factor for the particular group based on the respective initial modification factors for the groups of resources included in the same partition as the particular group.
- Search results identifying low-quality resources can be demoted in a presentation order of search results returned in response to a user's query.

- a user 102 can interact with the search system 114 through a user device 104 .
- the user device 104 will generally include a memory, e.g., a random access memory (RAM) 106 , for storing instructions and data and a processor 108 for executing stored instructions.
- the memory can include both read only and writable memory.
- the user device 104 can be a computer coupled to the search system 114 through a data communication network 112 , e.g., local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet, or a combination of networks, any of which may include wireless links.
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the search system 114 can be implemented on the user device 104 , for example, if a user installs an application that performs searches on the user device 104 .

- a search engine 130 within the search system 114 performs a search to identify resources matching the query.
- the query 110 may be transmitted through the network 112 to the search system 114 .
- the search system 114 includes an index database 122 and the search engine 130 .
- the search system 114 responds to the query 110 by generating search results 128 , which are transmitted through the network to the user device 104 for presentation to the user 102 , e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed by a web browser running on the user device 104 .
- the term “database” will be used broadly to refer to any collection of data: the data does not need to be structured in any particular way, or structured at all, and it can be stored on storage devices in one or more locations.
- the index database 122 can include multiple collections of data, each of which may be organized and accessed differently.
- the term “engine” will be used broadly to refer to a software based system or subsystem that can perform one or more specific functions. Generally, an engine will be implemented as one or more software modules or components, installed on one or more computers in one or more locations. In some cases, one or more computers will be dedicated to a particular engine; in other cases, multiple engines can be installed and running on the same computer or computers.
- the search engine 130 identifies resources that satisfy the query 110 .
- the search engine 130 will generally include an indexing engine 120 that indexes resources, an index database 122 that stores the index information, and a ranking engine 152 or other software that generates scores for the resources that satisfy the query 110 and that ranks the resources according to their respective scores.
- the search system 114 also includes or can communicate with a score modification engine 140 that generates modification factors that are applied by the search system 114 to initial scores generated by the search engine 130 for resources that match the query 110 .
- the score modification engine 140 can generate the modification factors based at least in part on modification data that associates a respective modification factor with each of a number of multiple groups of resources.
- the modification data is stored in a repository accessible to the system, e.g., a modification factor database 150 .
- a group of resources is a portion of the resources on the Internet.
- a group can be defined in any of a variety of ways.
- An address-based group of resources is a group of resources that is defined by the Internet addresses, e.g., Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), of the resources in the group.
- Resources are grouped so that a resource cannot be included in more than one group of resources.
- a group of resources can include each resource that can be accessed using a particular domain name. That is, the group could include http://www.domain.com/resource1, http://wwww.domain.com/resource2, http://www.domain.com/resourceN, and so on, without regard to when the resources first become available to the search engine 130 for indexing.
- a group of resources can include each resource that can be accessed using a particular host name, e.g., http://host.example.com/resource1, http://host.example.com/resource2, http://host.example.com/resourceN, and so on.
- Other address-based groupings are possible.
- a particular group can include only a portion of the resources that can be accessed using a particular host name or a particular domain name.
- a particular group may include all the resources that can be accessed using a particular host name or a particular domain name and resources that can be accessed using another host name or domain name.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for adjusting an initial score for a resource identified by search results for a received search query.
- the process 200 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., the search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 200 .
- the system receives data identifying a resource, e.g., a resource identifier of some kind, and an initial score for the resource (step 202 ).
- the initial score is generated for the resource as a response to a received search query.
- the initial score can be, e.g., a measure of the relevance of the resource to the search query, a measure of the quality of the resource, or both.
- the system identifies an address-based group of resources to which the resource belongs (step 204 ).
- the system can identify the group of resources to which the resource belongs based on the URL by which the resource is accessed.
- the group can be the resources that share the same domain name or the resources that share the same host name.
- the system accesses modification data to obtain a group-based modification factor for the group of resources to which the resource belongs (step 206 ).
- the modification data is stored in a repository of modification data, e.g., the modification factor database 150 of FIG. 1 .
- the modification data can include data that associates a respective modification factor with each of a number of groups.
- the system generates a resource-specific modification factor for the resource based on the group-based modification factor (step 208 ).
- the system can adjust the group-based modification factor based one or more query-specific parameters to generate the resource-specific modification factor for the resource. Generating a resource-specific modification factor based on a group-based modification factor will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 5 .
- the system applies the resource-specific modification factor to the initial score for the resource (step 210 ).
- the resource-specific modification factor can be a multiplicative factor applied to the initial score to generate a modified score for the resource.
- the search results generated in response to the search query can then be ranked according to modified scores for the respective resources identified by the search results.
- the modified scores can be further adjusted before the search results are ranked and transmitted to a client device for presentation.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for determining a modification factor for a group of resources.
- the process 300 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., the search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 300 .
- the process 300 is performed for each group of a number of groups of resources.
- a link for a group of resources is an incoming link to a resource in the group, i.e., a link having a resource in the group as its target.
- Links for the group can include express links, implied links, or both.
- An express link e.g., a hyperlink, is a link that is included in a source resource that a user can follow to navigate to a target resource.
- An implied link is a reference to a target resource, e.g., a citation to the target resource, which is included in a source resource but is not an express link to the target resource.
- a resource in the group can be the target of an implied link without a user being able to navigate to the resource by following the implied link.
- the determination of whether a link is, i.e., is counted as, an independent link is made based on the source resource and the target resource of the link. In particular, the system determines whether the source resource and the target resource are independent of each other. If the resources are independent, the system determines that the link is an independent link.
- the system can consider any of a variety of factors in determining whether two resources are independent. For example, the system may determine whether the two resources are included in the same group of resources. If the two resources are included in the same group, the system can determine that the two resources are not independent.
- the system may have access to data that indicates whether groups of resources are likely to be related.
- Related groups of resources are groups that include resources that are, e.g., owned by the same entity, hosted by the same entity, or that were created by the same entity. If the data indicates that the two resources are included in respective groups that are likely to be related, the system can determine that the two resources are not independent.
- the system may have access to data that indicates how similar two resources are in one or more aspects, e.g., based on whether the two resources have identical or similar content, identical or similar images, identical or similar formatting, e.g., identical or similar Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and so on. If the data indicates that the two resources are sufficiently similar, the system can determine that the two resources are not independent.
- data indicates how similar two resources are in one or more aspects, e.g., based on whether the two resources have identical or similar content, identical or similar images, identical or similar formatting, e.g., identical or similar Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and so on. If the data indicates that the two resources are sufficiently similar, the system can determine that the two resources are not independent.
- CSS Cascading Style Sheets
- each factor considered by the system in order for two resources to be determined to be independent, each factor considered by the system must indicate that the two resources are independent.
- the system calculates an independence score from the values of the attributes considered by the system for a pair of resources, and classifies the two resources as being independent if the independence score satisfies an independence criterion.
- the system counts the link as an independent link for the group. In some implementations, the system counts at most one link from resources in any one source group as an independent link for a target group. Alternatively, if more than one independent link is identified from resources in a source group to resources in the target group, the number of independent links counted for the target group by the system may be a function of the total number of independent links.
- the counted number of independent links may be the total number of independent links from resources in the source group to resources in the target group, a logarithm of the total number of independent links from resources in the source group to resources in the target group, or other non-decreasing function of the actual number.
- a reference query for a group of resources is a search query that has been submitted to a search engine and has been classified as referring to a resource in the group.
- a query can be classified as referring to a particular resource if the query includes a term that is recognized by the system as referring to the particular resource.
- a term that refers to a resource may be all of or a portion of a resource identifier, e.g., the URL, for the resource.
- the term “example.com” may be a term that is recognized as referring to the home page of that domain, e.g., the resource whose URL is “http://www.example.com”.
- search queries including the term “example.com” can be classified as referring to that home page.
- queries that contain the terms “example sf” or “esf”, e.g., the queries “example sf news” and “esf restaurant reviews,” can be counted as reference queries for the group that includes the resource whose URL is “http://www.sf.example.com.”
- a query can be categorized as referring to a particular resource when the query has been determined to be a navigational query to the particular resource.
- a navigational query is a query that is submitted in order to get to a single, particular web site or web page of a particular entity.
- the system can determine whether a query is navigational to a resource by accessing data that identifies queries that are classified as navigational to each of a number of resources.
- the system counts only queries submitted by unique users as reference queries for the group. That is, a query that includes a term that has been categorized as referring to a resource in the group is counted as a reference query only if the user submitting the query has not previously submitted a query that has been categorized as referring to any resource in the group.
- the system can determine whether a user is unique, i.e., whether the user has previously submitted a query that has been categorized as referring to any resource in the group, using conventional techniques, e.g., based on an identifier of a cookie or a login identifier. That is, for example, only one reference query for each cookie identifier can be counted as a unique query for the group of resources.
- the count of reference queries can be determined over a specified time period or, alternatively, each reference query recorded in data available to the system can be included in the count of reference queries.
- the system generates a modification factor for the group of resources from the count of independent links and the count of reference queries (step 306 ).
- the system instead of storing the modification factor for a group of resources for use in adjusting initial scores for resources in the group, the system normalizes the modification factors and stores the normalized modification factors for use in adjusting the initial scores.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for determining normalized modification factors for groups of resources.
- the process 400 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., the search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 400 .
- the system partitions the groups of resources (step 402 ).
- the system can partition the groups of resources based on the count of reference queries for each of the groups, e.g., so that each partition includes groups of resources whose counts of reference queries are within a respective range of counts of reference queries. By doing so, the system can compare modification factors only between groups of resources that have similar counts of reference queries, e.g., because the modification factors may not scale well as the counts of reference queries increase.
- the system generates a normalized modification factor for each group ( 404 ). For each group in a given partition, the system normalizes the modification factor for the group based on the modification factors for the other groups in the partition. For example, the system may compute a statistical measure (m) of the modification factors of the groups in the partition.
- the statistical measure can be a measure of central tendency, e.g., the arithmetic, geometric, or harmonic mean of the modification factors, the median of the modification factors, the mode of the modification factors, and so on.
- the statistical measure may be a maximum or minimum of the modification factors.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an example process for generating a resource-specific modification factor for a resource.
- the process 500 will be described as being performed by a system of one or more computers located in one or more locations.
- a search system e.g., the search system 114 of FIG. 1 , can be used to perform the process 500 .
- the process 500 can be performed for each of a number of resources in response to a search query received from a user.
- the system determines whether the received query is navigational to the resource (step 502 ). For example, the system can determine whether the received query is navigational to the resource by accessing data that identifies queries that are classified as navigational to the resource.
- the system sets the modification factor to a value that does not alter the value of the initial score (step 508 ), e.g., if the modification factor is multiplicative, the system sets the value of the modification factor to one.
- the system determines whether the initial score for the resource is below a first threshold value (step 504 ). If the initial score for the resource is below the first threshold value, the system sets the modification factor to a value that does not alter the value of the initial score (step 508 ).
- the system If the initial score is not below the second threshold value, the system generates a second modification factor to be applied to the initial score (step 512 ).
- the smoothing function can be defined so that, if the first modification factor exceeds a threshold value, the second modification factor, when applied to the initial score, has a muted effect or no effect on the value of the initial score.
- the system can set f 2 equal to f 1 to avoid the value of f 2 being greater than f 1 or the value of f 2 being undefined.
- Embodiments of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, in tangibly-embodied computer software or firmware, in computer hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a tangible non-transitory program carrier for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus.
- the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus.

- a computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system.
- a program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data, e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document, in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files, e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code.
- a computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

Abstract
Description
M=IL/RQ,
where IL is the number of independent links counted for the group of resources and RQ is the number of reference queries counted for the group of resources.
NM=M−m/m
where M is the modification factor for the group and m is the statistical measure of the modifications factors of the groups in the partitions.
f 1 =T 1+(IS−T 1)·M/IS,
where T1 is the first threshold value, IS is the initial score, and M is the group-based modification factor for the group of resources to which the resource belongs. Thus, if the initial score for the resource is between the first and second threshold values, the system applies a modification factor that decreases as the initial score increases.
f 2 =f 1/logT
where T2 is the second threshold value and g(f1) is a smoothing function that reduces the effect of the second modification factor on the initial score for particular ranges of values of the first modification factor. For example, the smoothing function can be defined so that, if the first modification factor exceeds a threshold value, the second modification factor, when applied to the initial score, has a muted effect or no effect on the value of the initial score. In some implementations, the smoothing function is defined as a piecewise function, so that:
g(f 1)=1, if f 1 ≦Q and
g(f 1)=(1−f 1)/1−P, if f 1 >Q,
where Q is a predetermined threshold value. In these implementations, if the value of logT
