As running through the term that used all the time herein, user interactions comprises any content displaying to user, and user for example, in response to show content (chosen content after showing content to this user, or any certainty action or non-action (being referred to as unless otherwise, " action ") subsequently of chosen content not after showing content) taking.Therefore, user interactions not necessarily need to be by this user in selecting content (or any other certainty action).
User interactions assessment can comprise one or more time intervals appraisals (estimating from the user interactions of one or more appointments to the time transforming), path appraisal (quantity of the user interactions occurring conversion), user interactions path (sequence of the user interactions occurring before conversion), assist mutual appraisal (the mutual quantity of specific user occurring before conversion) and auxiliary conversion to estimate (quantity of the conversion of being assisted by given content).
Fig. 1 is according to the block diagram of the example context of an exemplary embodiment, wherein Advertising Management System managing advertisement service.Example context 100 comprises network 102, for example Local Area Network, wide area network (WAN), internet or above-mentioned combination.Network 102 connects website 104, user's set 106, advertiser 108 and Advertising Management System 110.Example context 100 can comprise thousands of or more websites 104, user's set 106 and advertiser 108.
Resource 105 is any data that can provide by network 102.By the resource address associated with resource 105, carry out identifying resource 105, for example URL(uniform resource locator) (URL).For instance, resource 105 can comprise webpage, word processing document, Portable Document format (PDF) document, image, video, compile element, interaction content and input source.Resource 105 can comprise content, for example word, phrase, image and sound, and described content can comprise embedding information (for example metamessage in hyperlink) and/or embed instruction.Embed instruction and can be included in the code that user device (for example, in web browser) is carried out.Can adopt such as
or
User's set 106 is electronic installations of being controlled by user, and can ask and receive resource 105 by network 102.The example of user's set 106 comprises personal computer, mobile communications device and other devices that can transmit and receive data by network 102.User's set 106 generally includes the user of being convenient to transmit and receive data by network 102 and applies, for example web browser.
User's set 106 can be asked the resource 105 from website 104.Conversely, the data that represent resource 105 can be offered to user's set 106, for being shown by user's set 106.The data that represent resource 105 can comprise the data of the part of the resource that appointment wherein can display advertisement or the part that user shows (for example, pop-up window or the display location in the position of webpage).These specified portions that resource 105 or user show are called location advertising.
For ease of search, by the addressable ample resources 105 of network 102, environment 100 can comprise search system 112, and it carrys out recognition resource 105 by the resource 105 capturing and index provides on website 104.Data about resource 105 can the resource 105 based on this data correlation be carried out index.Alternatively, the index copy of resource 105 and (optionally) cached copy are stored in search index (not shown).
User's set 106 can be submitted search inquiry to search system 112 by network 102.As response, search system 112 access search index, to identify the resource relevant to search inquiry 105.In one exemplary embodiment, search inquiry comprises one or more keywords.Search system 112 identification is to the resource 105 of this inquiry response, provide the information about this resource 105 with the form of Search Results, and towards user's set 106, returns to Search Results with search results pages.Search Results can comprise the data that generated by search system 112, and its identification response is in the resource 105 of particular search query, and Search Results can be included in the link of resource 105.The example of Search Results can comprise the presenting of part, resource 105 of web page title, the text fragments that extract from webpage 104 or image, and the URL of webpage 104.Result of page searching can also comprise one or more location advertisings that can display advertisement.
Result of page searching can be arranged to HTTP(HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) with the web browser for user's set 106 from search system 112) send together with the request of cookie.For example, cookie can represent particular user device 106 and particular webpage browser.For example, search system 112 comprises server, and this server is answered in the face of inquiring about by send search results pages in http response.This http response comprises and makes website that browser storage posts year about server or for example, about the instruction (, cookie instruction being set) of the cookie in the territory of server.If browser supports cookie and enable cookie, to each page request subsequently of the server in same server or server domain, will comprise this cookie.Cookie can store various kinds of data, comprises unique or part unique identifier.It doesn't matter can to conceal this unique or part unique identifier and this unique or part unique identifier and user's name.Because HTTP is stateless protocol, use cookie to allow external service (for example search system 112 or other system) in a plurality of sessions, to follow the tracks of user's specific action and state.For example, user can, by the middle forbidding of arranging of browser cookie, select to exit tracking user action.
When user's set 106 request resource 105 or Search Results, or when resource 105 or Search Results are offered to user's set 106, the requests that Advertising Management System 110 receives the advertisement that will provide together with resource 105 or Search Results.To the request of advertisement, can be included as the feature of the location advertising of requested resource 105 or result of page searching restriction, and can be provided for Advertising Management System 110.For example, can provide to Advertising Management System 110: quote (for example URL) to resource 105, wherein limits location advertising for this resource 105; The size of location advertising; And/or be used in the medium type of showing in this location advertising.Similarly, the search inquiry of the keyword associated with the resource 105 of asking one or more words of relevance (with) (" resource keyword ") or request Search Results can also be provided to Advertising Management System 110, to help the advertisement that identification is relevant to resource 105 or search inquiry.
Data based on the request of advertisement is comprised, Advertising Management System 110 can be provided by the qualified advertisement (" suitable advertisement ") that will ask to provide in response to this.For example, suitable advertisement can comprise having the advertisement of the feature matching to the feature of location advertising and be identified as and the resource keyword of appointment or the relevant advertisement of search inquiry.In certain embodiments, by Advertising Management System 110, elect the advertisement with the target keyword of the part of mating resource keyword, search inquiry or search inquiry as suitable advertisement.
Similarly, when user selects the advertisement of (clicking) displaying, can select the data of advertisement store in journal file 116, cookie or history data repository 119 by representing.In certain embodiments, in response to the request of the webpage to by advertisement link, store data.For example, user selects advertisement can initiate to show the request of the webpage being provided by (or being) advertiser.This request can comprise that sign is about the data of the specific cookie of user's set, and these data can be stored in advertisement data store.
User interactive data can be associated with unique identifier, and this unique identifier represents to carry out the corresponding user's set of user interactions.For example, in certain embodiments, user interactive data can be associated with one or more cookie.Each cookie can comprise the content of specifying initialization time, and this initialization time indication arranges at first the time of this cookie in particular user device 106.
As described above, the report that offers certain content supplier can be specified the user of appraisal generation before transforming and the mutual Performance Evaluation of content.When user carries out required movement, transform, and conversion pathway comprises the one group of user interactions that transforms and occurred before carrying out this conversion by user.Forming the factor transforming may be different because of thing, and can in all sorts of ways to determine to be that what formation transforms.For example, when user clicks advertisement, forward webpage or website to, then complete while buying leaving before this webpage or website at that, can transform.Again for example, when user during the more more time, can transform than preset time in specific website cost.Data from a plurality of user interactions can be used for determining the time quantum at specific website.
Can specify the action that forms conversion by each advertiser.For example, each advertiser can select one or more measurable/observable user actions as conversion, for example download white paper, at least navigate to the given depth of website, at least check the webpage of some, at least on website or webpage, spend time of scheduled volume, buy product, or register on website.Also can use and form other actions that transform.
Follow the tracks of conversion (and mutual with other of advertiser's website), advertiser can comprise embedding instruction in this advertiser's webpage, wherein this embeds mutual (for example the page is selected, content item is selected and other mutual) of instruction supervisory user and advertiser's website, and can detect the user interactions (or a series of user interactions) that forms conversion.In certain embodiments, when user is during from webpage referenced (or other resources) accessed web page or another resource, for example, can be by carrying out the code snippet be quoted by just accessed webpage and/or based on identifying about this mutual webpage referenced (or other resources) for accessing the URL of this webpage.
For example, user can visit advertiser's website by being chosen in the link of showing on webpage, for example, select the link of the popularization activity part of the affiliate (affiliate) as advertiser.This link can be associated with the URL that comprises the data (being text) of unique identification resource, and wherein user navigates from this resource.For example, link http://www.example.com/homepage/%affiliate_identifier%promotion _ 1 is specified user is navigate to example.com webpage from the associated affiliate webpage of the affiliate identifier with appointment this URL, and based on being chosen in linking of comprising in the popularization activity associated with promotion_1, user is directed to example.com webpage.Can deposit the user interactive data about this mutual (selecting link) in database, and as mentioned below, use this user interactive data to help performance report.
When detecting conversion for advertiser, the conversion data that represents this conversion can be transferred to the data processing equipment (" analytical equipment ") that receives this conversion data, and then this conversion data is kept in data-carrier store.Can by this conversion data with for carrying out together with one or more cookie of user's set of user interactions, store, make the user interactive data associated with cookie can be associated with this conversion, and can be used for generating the performance report about this conversion.
Conventionally, when the advertisement of using target keyword to be decided to be target is, while transforming the front last advertisement of clicking, to think that this conversion is owing to this target keyword.For example, advertiser X can be associated keyword " tennis ", " footwear " and " brand X " with advertisement.In this example, suppose that user submits the first search inquiry to " tennis " to, to this user, show the result of page searching of the advertisement that comprises advertiser X, and this user selects this advertisement, but this user does not take to form the action transforming.Further this user of hypothesis submits the second search inquiry to " brand X " subsequently to, and to the advertisement of this user's display advertisement client X, user selects the advertisement of advertiser X, and user takes to form the action (for example, user buys brand X tennis shoes) transforming.In this example, this is the advertisement of showing because last advertisement of selecting before transforming (" advertisement of finally selecting ") is in response to coupling " brand X " conversion to be given the credit to keyword " brand X, ".
To the keyword that causes showing the advertisement of last selection before conversion, provide that to transform contribution volume (" finally selecting contribution volume ") be a kind of effective methods of evaluation to advertisement performance, yet be singly that this methods of evaluation can not be offered help and analyze the data of transformation period to advertiser, this transformation period is included in the advertisement of last selection before to advertisement user contact and/or selection.For example, independent last selection contribution volume methods of evaluation do not specify may be by increased the keyword of brand or product popularity to presenting to user's and/or the advertisement selected by user displaying before selecting this last advertisement of selecting.Yet these advertisements may be to taking the user who forms the action transforming to have major contribution subsequently.
In the above example, even if the advertisement of showing in response to the search inquiry of matching keywords " tennis " may for example, have contribution to the user of the action (buying brand X tennis shoes) of taking form to transform, but does not also provide any contribution volume about transforming to keyword " tennis ".For example, when user selects the advertisement of the displaying in response to matching keywords " tennis ", user may check the brand X tennis shoes that can obtain from advertiser X.Contact based on user to brand X tennis shoes, user may submit to search inquiry " brand X, " to find the tennis shoes from brand X subsequently.Similarly, the selection regardless of user to advertisement, user to the contact of advertisement of using keyword " tennis " and being decided to be target also for example, to taking subsequently the user who forms the action (buying the product from advertiser X) transforming to contribute to some extent.Analysis the user who selects to occur before the last advertisement of selecting and advertiser's advertisement (or other guide) alternately, can improve the ability that advertiser understands this advertiser's transformation period.
Transformation period is during to user's display advertisement, and when user takes to form the action transforming, finish during.Can estimate and/or retrain the transformation period by time or action, and this transformation period can cross over a plurality of user conversations.User conversation is the set condensing together for the user interactions analyzed.Each user conversation comprises expression data that carried out by specific user and the user interactions in session window (being designated duration).For example, session window can be the time period (for example 1 hour, 1 day or 1 month) of appointment, or can delimit this session window with required movement.For example, user search session user search queries that occur in can being included in during 1 hour and/or that for example, occur before in conversation end event (, closing search browser) and action subsequently.
Analyze the transformation period can improve advertiser understand within the transformation period its client how with the mutual ability of advertisement.For example, if advertiser determines that contacting for the first time advertisement from user is 20 days to the averaging time transforming, advertiser can infer that user is transforming (taking to form the action transforming) the front time spending for studying alternate source by these data.Similarly, if determining, advertiser showing that using particular keywords to be decided to be a lot of users that transform after the advertisement of target does like this, advertiser may wish to increase the amount of funds that it spends in the advertisement of using this keyword to distribute, and/or improves the quality of using this particular keywords to be decided to be the advertisement of target.
Help the user interactions appraisal of analyzing the transformation period can be called conversion pathway Performance Evaluation.Conversion pathway is by specific user, transformed front and comprising one group of user interactions of this specific user of this conversion.As be described in more detail below, conversion pathway Performance Evaluation is specified the duration of transformation period, the amount of user interaction occurring within the duration of transformation period, transforms the path of front user interactions, is transformed the front mutual quantity of specific user occurring, and other appraisals to the user interactions occurring within the duration of transformation period.
Can provide config option to reduce the deviation in performance report.There is no config option, some performance report may have deviation, for example, be partial to short conversion pathway.For example,, if comprise that by the basic data of giving a report performance report may be partial to short conversion pathway higher than the number percent in the Partial Conversion path of threshold percentage.Partial Conversion path be wherein about some user interactive datas of user rather than all user interactive datas all with transform associated conversion pathway.For example, if be less than request report advertiser typical transformation period length generate during the reporting period this report, can in this report, add Partial Conversion path.
Determine during the reporting period the maximum length (Yi Tianlaiwei unit) of the transformation period of report, this is because outer excessive data during operation report not generates this report.Performance report can (be looked back window) based on during the reporting period, makes when generating report not the user interactions before during the reporting period regard as the part of transformation period.Being called during the reporting period like this " looked back window." for example, when generating report according to the review window of 30 days, be illustrated in the available subscribers interaction data of the user action occurring between July 1 in given time and July 31, will be available to the conversion occurring this year July 31.
For example, when using acquiescence to look back window (30 days), if being greater than this acquiescence, the typical transformation period length of the product associated with report looks back window, performance report can be partial to short conversion pathway.For example, in example above, the typical transformation period of " brand X " tennis shoes (for example 30 days) is with for example, compare compared with the transformation period of your make (, new car) may be relatively short.New car can have the longer transformation period (for example, 90 days).
Different advertisers or advertiser's different product can have different associated transformation period length.For example, sell (being for example less than 100 dollars) advertiser of product at a low price and can specify the review window of 30 days, and the advertiser who sells more expensive product (for example at least 1000 dollars) can specify the review window of 90 days.
In certain embodiments, advertiser 108 can when request performance report, for example, specify the review window that will use by input number of days or for example, by selecting to look back window (30 days, 60 days, 90 days) the review window list from appointment.Allow advertiser to configure the review window of their performance report, make advertiser can select the review window corresponding with their transformation period of product.Allow to look back window configuration and also make advertiser to test by enough different review windows, its possibility of result causes finding to improve the method for conversion rate.
Other factors can have contribution to report section conversion pathway.For example, as described above, with giving a report, basic user interactive data can be associated with the unique identifier that represents to have carried out the user's set of user interactions.As described above, unique identifier can be stored as to cookie.For example, can by delete cookie user, delete the browser (for example, when exiting browser, setting based on browser parameters) of cookie, or some other softwares (for example Rogue Anti-Spyware) of deleting cookie are deleted cookie from user's set.
If deleted cookie from user's set, for example, when user's accessed web page (search system 112), new cookie can be set on user's set.This new cookie can be used for storing new part unique identifier, and the user interactive data subsequently therefore occurring on this user's set can be associated from different identifiers.Therefore,, because each user identifier is considered to represent different users, so being identified as the user different with the user interactive data of associated new cookie, the user interactive data associated from deleted cookie be associated.
For example, in example above, suppose that user deletes cookie after carrying out first search inquiry of " tennis ", and in the deleted rear generation of cookie the second search inquiry to " brand X ".In this example, may there is deviation in the Performance Evaluation that the user interactive data based on about user calculates.For example, because the advertisement selection the first search inquiry not being caused is regarded the part of the transformation period that the advertisement selection that causes with the second search inquiry is identical as, so estimating, path may be calculated as one, rather than two, this is because two user interactions seem not to be to be carried out by identical user.
Check the report that reduces the deviation being caused by Partial Conversion path, advertiser can be this report and specifies review window.As described above, looking back window appointment is the user interactive data associated with unique identifier for generating the user interactive data of report, wherein, this unique identifier has designated duration (for example 30 days, 60 days, 90 days) before conversion initialization time before.Therefore, for the conversion that wherein user interactive data is associated with the unique identifier with the initialization time after this designated duration, be not included the basis that is used as this report.Have on the user's set that the unique identifier indication of nearest initialization time may represent at this unique identifier recently and reinitialized this unique identifier.Therefore, the user interactive data associated with relatively new unique identifier can only represent part conversion pathway.Or, for user interactive data wherein, be comprised in this report with the conversion that the unique identifier with the initialization time after this designated duration is associated.For reducing deviation, before adding report, from conversion pathway, remove any user interactions comprising in this conversion pathway, occur after designated duration.
Fig. 2 is according to the process flow diagram of the process for integrated user interactions daily record data of an exemplary embodiment.This process 200 is to upgrade conversion pathway and the definite process transforming of the user's conversion pathway based on upgrading.
Can on Advertising Management System 110, performance evaluation equipment 120 or another calculation element, realize this process 200.In one embodiment, this process 200 of encoding on computer-readable medium, this computer-readable medium comprises when being carried out by calculation element and makes this calculation element carry out the instruction of the operation of this process 200.
As described above, journal file 116 can comprise user interactive data.Journal file 116 can be before processing combines with the user interactive data of other daily records from other servers, comprises those user interactive datas of realizing search system 112.Processing starts from realizing the calculation element of this process 200 and determines that new daily record can be used for processing (210).For example, can send the notice that the new daily record of indication has been ready for processing to calculation element, or the existence of new daily record can indicate this new daily record to be ready for processing.
Next, retrieving novel daily record (220).Can retrieving novel daily record on network 102.User action based on being indicated by new daily record upgrades each user's state history.New daily record can comprise the information relevant to a plurality of users' user interactions.History data repository 119 comprises the user interactive data from previously processed journal file.Owing to can by user identifier, user interactive data being divided into groups and by the time, it be sorted, so the user interactive data comprising in history data repository 119 can have state.Fig. 3 is described in the block diagram of the user interactive data upgrading in the duration of user interactions daily record data integrating process 200 according to an exemplary embodiment.Fig. 3 shows four example user's identifiers, yet history data repository 119 can comprise the data associated with thousands of or millions of different user identifiers with journal file 116.In one embodiment, previously stored user interactive data 310 is stored in history data repository 119.As shown in the figure, previously also without any the user interactive data associated with user identifier 3, be stored in history data repository 119.
New daily record can comprise the user interactive data about one or more user identifiers.Can to user interactive data, divide into groups according to user identifier and then by time sort (230).Row 320 illustrate the user interactive data that divides into groups and sort.As shown in the figure, user identifier 2 does not comprise any new user interactive data, and user identifier 1,3 and 4 has upgraded user interactive data.For example, new journal file comprises the mutual a of associated user with user identifier 1
13and a
14associated user interactive data.Then, divided into groups can merge mutually (240) with the user interactive data of storage in history data repository 119 with the user interactive data of sequence.If preexist user identifier in history data repository 119, adds new user interactive data to previous user interactive data.Otherwise, add new user interactive data and new user identifier.
Row 330 illustrate the user interactive data about the renewal of each user identifier.User interactive data based on upgrading, can determine any conversion (250) occurring in the more new route of each user interactions.User interactions path is restricted to those user interactions relevant to particular advertisers 108.The conversion of particular advertisers 108 transforms for determining whether alternately.For example, suppose user interactions a
13and a
32represent to transform mutual.Correspondingly, find conversion pathway 340 and 350.Once find, conversion pathway can be write to another part or another data-carrier store of history data repository 119, for further analysis.
Each user interactions comprises associated with this user interactions one group of data or dimension.Can sparsely fill this dimension, make any user interactions can there are the data that subset is relevant to dimension.Can generate a large amount of conversion pathway by the user interactive data based on receiving.About how, the various report of executed activity or advertiser's arrangement can comprise the various information about conversion pathway.Consider a large amount of potential conversion pathway, each conversion pathway can be aggregated to together to reduce the quantity of the different conversion pathway of report.In one exemplary embodiment, the conversion pathway that polymerizable has the user interactions of equal number and has corresponding data.
In one embodiment, user can create different groups independent user interactions is classified.Group comprises group definition, and group definition comprises determines whether specific user interactions belongs to one or more groups of rules of particular group.Organize the mutual dimension data of regular user and determine the group of user interactions.Various groups of rules can using the Boolean operator such as " with, " " non-, " "or" etc. to be connected in group definition.Each group also comprises that group name claims.In certain embodiments, group can comprise demonstration information, such as but not limited to, for showing textcolor and/or the background color of group name.Default set also can be used user.When default set is available, user can copy default set (comprising associated group rule), then revises one or more groups of rules and/or group name and claims.The group that user can be created is stored in storer, for example Local or Remote database.Then can these groups be conducted interviews, be revised or delete in the time after a while.
In the sequence or ordered list of grouping definition, one or more groups can be interrelated.Group in this ordered list is for determining the group of each user interactions.The priority of particular group is determined in the sequence of this list.User can be assigned in the coupling group with limit priority.The coupling group of lower priority will be left in the basket.
Use the orderly classification of grouping definition, each conversion pathway can be changed to path in groups.Group path comprises the group element corresponding with the user interactions of conversion pathway.Group element can comprise or quote from the mutual data of respective user.In addition, group element comprises or the group name of quoting this coupling group claims and demonstration information.

Fig. 4 is the block diagram that the data associated with user interactions are shown according to an exemplary embodiment.The framework of user interactions 400 or form show four kinds of possible dimensions that can be associated with any user interactions.As shown in the figure, each user interactions can be by the source 402 to user interactions, medium 404, movable 406 dimensions relevant with keyword 408.Source dimension 402 sources of indication to the recommendation of website (referral).Medium dimension 404 provides the further information about source dimension 402.For example, source dimension 402 can be indicated the particular search engine in conduct recommendation source, and medium dimension 404 can also be " every click charging " (when user has clicked sponsored link) or " naturally (organic) " (when user has clicked free Search Results connection) by this origin classification.Other non-limiting examples of medium value comprise Email, RSS feed (feed) etc.Activity dimension 406 allows advertiser to distinguish between various advertising campaigns.For example, advertiser may have two advertising campaigns of simultaneously carrying out, and these two movable guide users check one or more common pages.Activity dimension 406 allows can be separated from each other to movable relevant various user interactions.This gives the ability that advertiser analyzes independently of one another to activity, even if these two activity-driven users are to the identical public page.Keyword dimension 408 comprises user and in search, uses any word or phrase.Available dimension is not limited to these examples.For example, can include but not limited to the date of advertising network type, user interactions with user-dependent dimension, the time of user interactions, country /region, log in page title, browser title, browser version, content etc.For example, user interactions can comprise content dimension, and it allows the version of the advertisement of advertiser's indicating user click.
Conversion pathway 410 shows three user interactions 420,430 and 440.User interactions 420 has the dimension data associated with source dimension 422, medium dimension 424 and keyword dimension 428.And activity dimension 426 does not have related data.In the exemplary embodiment, the user-association that user interactions 420 can be searched for use keyword " reward voucher " in search engine.Free Search Results covers the link of advertisers, and user clicks thereon.User interactions 430 provides its dimension by the example of the user interactions of sparse filling.The related data of the dimension of only originating 432 tool.All the other dimensions 434,436 and 438 do not have any associated dimension data.User interactions 430 can be, but not limited to by by advertiser's web page address or URL directly typewriting to be input to the user of the webpage of accessing this advertiser in the address instrument of web browser corresponding.All dimensions that illustrate 442,444,446 and 448 of the third party mutual 440 in conversion pathway 410 have all been filled dimension data.User interactions 440 can be, but not limited to be associated with the user who clicks in the advertisement link of webpage that user is directed to advertiser.Advertisement link is carried out keyword search in search engine as keyword Search Results with use " reward voucher " is associated.Finally, the advertisement link that activity dimension 446 indications are clicked is corresponding to " sales promotion in spring (spring_sale) " activity.
Fig. 5 be according to an exemplary embodiment for creating the example user interface of group.User interface 500 allows one or more groups to be defined as grouping definition ordered list.Grouping definition ordered list can have title, can input this title with text box 502.This ordered list can be privately owned to specific user, or can share with other users.For example, all users of specific company or tissue can share grouping definition ordered list.In one embodiment, can determine with radio button 504 privacy of this grouping definition ordered list.User interface 500 shows a plurality of groups 506.Each group has the title that can be edited by user.User can edit this group name and claim to describe group rule, for example " U.S.'s search ".Can for example, by using text box (text box 508) to complete the editor that group name is claimed by user interface 500.
Except title, each group is also associated with one or more groups of rules.For each group, can hide or demonstration group rule.For example, can in user interface 500, hide the group rule about " search naturally ", " demonstration impression ", " recommendation ", " Email " and " social networks " group.And be visible about the group rule of " U.S.'s search " group.Can hide or show regular by the user interface component of the one or more icons 510 such as clicking.Each group rule is applied to the dimension data of user interactions.Combination about all groups of rules of particular group determines whether user interactions can be comprised in this particular group.According to the result of various groups of rules, single rule can comprise or get rid of specific user interactions.Can use and comprise/get rid of selector switch, for example combobox 512.For identical dimension, operation or value, the rule of getting rid of user interactions will have the output contrary with comprising rule.Can each regular result be combined and determine whether user interactions belongs to specific group with Boolean operator.
Except comprise/Exclusions Options, independent group rule also has a plurality of configurable options.Each rule is associated with one or more dimensions of user interactions.Can select one or more dimensions with combobox 514, for example medium dimension.Then, the dimension data based on selected one or more dimensions is applied to the data that user provides.For example, can in text box, input the data that user provides.Text box 516 shows wherein the source of user interactions and example that spring, " search engine " compared.Between the data that provide dimension data and user, can carry out various operations.For example, operation can include but not limited to mate, not mate, completely coupling, Incomplete matching, from ... start, not from ... start, with ... finish, not with ... be to finish, etc.Can use combobox 518 to select operation.Can by various user's interface units, be edited by user the various configurable options of group rule.
For each user interactions that has adopted ad hoc rules, the data that selected dimension data and user provided based on selected operation compare.For each rule, generate "true" or "false" value.Then can calculate the various values about all groups of rules of particular group based on selected Boolean operator.Net result is that this user interactions is comprised in this particular group or is not comprised in this particular group.Button 522 and 524 can be used to add new regulation, together with these new regulations correspondingly connect to come with existing rule by boolean " OR (or) " or " AND (with) " statement.
Can remove independent group rule by user's interface.For example, can remove a group rule with button 516.Similarly, can remove two group rules that connect by boolean " OR " with label 520.In addition, can delete icon (not shown) or remove whole group by selection deletion group button (not shown) by group name is claimed to drag to.Can add new regulation button (not shown) by selection and add other group.
If user interactions mates specific group, can to this user interactions, carry out visual based on organizing associated demonstration information with this so.Demonstration information can include but not limited to font color and background color.Can select with button 526 will be for font color and/or the background that shows that group name claims.Can in text area 528, claim how to show by this group name of preview.
The order of group is determined the priority of group and the order that group is applied to user interactions.First coupling group is by determining the group of user interactions, even if group subsequently also can be mated this user interactions.Can be by group being dragged and dropped into the order that another position changes group from a position in user interface.If without any a specific user interactions of rule match, provide the rule of acquiescence.This default rule can show the dimension data from this user interactions, or can show that the user-defined group name of this default rule claims.Once suitably be provided with group rule, these rules can be saved in to Local or Remote data-carrier store for using subsequently.
In the exemplary embodiment, according to the grouping of the user interactions in one group of conversion pathway, by group rule, generate report.For each conversion pathway that will be comprised in this report, conversion pathway can be changed to path in groups.Fig. 6 be according to an exemplary embodiment for conversion pathway being changed to the process flow diagram of the process in path in groups.Can on Advertising Management System 110, performance evaluation equipment 120 or another calculation element, realize this process 600.In one embodiment, this process 600 of encoding on the computer-readable medium of include instruction makes this calculation element carry out the operation of this process 500 when carrying out described instruction by calculation element.
For example, from data-carrier store (, history data repository 119), retrieve the selection of conversion pathway (610).To the selection of conversion pathway, can comprise and filter undesired conversion pathway, for example those look like conversion pathway invalid or that do not meet a certain initial ranging standard, and for example retrieval has all conversion pathway of conversion in 30 days in the past.Equally, receive grouping definition ordered list (620).Owing to may there being a plurality of grouping definition ordered lists, the grouping therefore receiving definition ordered list can the user based on to a plurality of ordered lists be selected.Next, conversion pathway is changed to path (630) in groups.For each conversion pathway establishment group path receiving.Each group path comprises the one or more group elements corresponding with each user interactions of corresponding conversion pathway.Can in user interactions, come to create group element for this user interactions by organizing rule application.Group element is to create according to first matched packet in grouping definition ordered list.First matched packet is first group of the mutual dimension data of its this respective user of group rule match.Group element can comprise the title of this group and can be used for showing any demonstration information that this group name claims.Then, can be by group path condense together (640).In one embodiment, can claim to come aggregation group path based on the group length in path and the group name of group element.Then the group path of polymerization is offered and for example asks user, or the group path of institute's polymerization is included in report.
Fig. 7 A is the block diagram that non-grouping conversion pathway is shown according to an exemplary embodiment.Fig. 7 A shows the conversion pathway 700 and 720 to conversion pathway 410 and 450 correspondences respectively. Conversion pathway 700 and 720 only illustrates source and medium dimension, and can be involved in report.When the non-grouping conversion pathway of polymerization, the conversion pathway that user can logically can be grouped in is together reported as two independently conversion pathway.Due to minute relevant data of line item, non-grouping conversion pathway can increase the difficulty of analyzing conversion pathway data.
Fig. 7 B is the block diagram that group path is shown according to an exemplary embodiment.Conversion pathway 740 and 760 corresponds respectively to conversion pathway 410 and 450, and can the process 600 based on as described above generate conversion pathway 740 and 760.Grouping definition ordered list can comprise nature search groups, paid search group, recommendation group, social networks group, Email group and directly input (Direct) group.Nature search groups can comprise the group rule that comprises the first rule and Second Rule, the first rule matches the source of user interactions the character string that comprises search engine title, for example " search engine 1 ", and Second Rule matches character string " naturally " by the medium of user interactions.Paid search rule can comprise the group rule that comprises the first rule and Second Rule, the first rule matches the source of user interactions the character string that comprises search engine title, for example " search engine 2 ", and Second Rule matches character string " the every click charging of cpc() " or " the every pay-per-click of ppc() " by the medium of user interactions.Group rule can be used asterisk wildcard and can have a plurality of character strings for the mutual data of match user.For example, social networks group can comprise the group rule that comprises the first rule, and the first rule matches the source of user interactions any one in " * social networks 1* ", " * social networks 2* " or " * social networks 3* ".Such rule can be mated a plurality of different source datas of coming, such as, but not limited to, " www. social networks 1.com ", " social networks 2.com " or " social networks 3.org ".Recommendation, directly input and Email group can comprise that respectively that source dimension is matched to " recommendation ", " directly input " and the group of " Email " is regular.Rule can operate and be not limited to use source dimension in arbitrary dimension of user interactions.For example, the country /region of each user interactions can be used to further paid search be divided into U.S.'s paid search, Britain's paid search etc.If user interactions not matched packet defines any non-default set in ordered list, can use default rule or default dimensions.For example, if without any coupling group, can combine source dimension and medium dimension.In yet another embodiment, each unmatched user interactions can mate the default set that is called " not grouping ".Once conversion pathway is changed to path in groups, can aggregation group path and use it for the report generating about group path.
Fig. 8 A shows the part of the conversion pathway report 800 based on as the non-grouping conversion pathway of the polymerization of being discussed with reference to figure 7A.The part of this report 800 comprises three row corresponding with the quantity 804 of conversion of non-grouping conversion pathway 802, this specific conversion pathway and the value 806 of those conversions.The partially polymerized conversion pathway about 55106 different conversions (it can use turn over number 804 column counts to obtain) of shown report 800.By other similar path polymerizations in conversion pathway 700 and row 808.Together with length conversion pathway identical and that have identical source and a medium dimension data can be grouped together in.Row 808 informs that the total value of 16889 conversions of user is $ 27058.57.Each of these conversions consists of three user interactions, and the source/media data of these three user interactions is respectively " search engine/natural ", " directly input/nothing " and " search engine/cpc ".By other similar path polymerizations in conversion pathway 720 and row 810.The quantity of conversion and the total value of these conversions in row 810, have also been shown.
Fig. 8 B shows the part of the group path report 850 in conversion pathway group path conversion, polymerization based on from as discussed with reference to figure 7B.As discussed above, the group path shown in Fig. 7 B is to use the grouping definition ordered list that comprises nature search, paid search, engine, social networks, Email and directly input to generate from conversion pathway.Similar with the part of this report 800, the part of this report 850 comprises with group path 852, this specifically organizes the quantity 854 of conversion in path and three row corresponding to the value 856 of those conversions.Data shown in Fig. 8 B comprise all data shown in Fig. 8 A.
As shown in Fig. 8 B, the difference of Fig. 8 A and 8B is that also aggregation group path is caused due to user interactions is divided into groups.For example, the row 808 and 812 in Fig. 8 A is combined into the row 858 in Fig. 8 B.Its source is that the user interactions that " search engine " and its medium are " cpc " or " ppc " is grouped in " paid search " group.The mutual grouping of associated user and aggregation group path are allowed to report data more compactly.In one embodiment, rule is that user generates, and therefore, user can draft the rule that provides data with scope suitable or that expect or granularity.The granularity of the different stage of same conversion path data can be provided with different grouping definition ordered lists.Another example in aggregation group path has been shown in the row 860 of Fig. 8 B, and it is the row 810 of Fig. 8 A and 814 combination.Row 860 shows the second user interactions that 20100 conversions have comprised any one place in two websites shown in the row 810 and 814 of Fig. 8 A (being socailnet_url and socialnet2_url).Social networks group allows the user interactions with different dimensions data to be grouped in together.
Group element can comprise about how showing the demonstration information of group element.For example, demonstration information can comprise and can be used for the font color and/or the background color that show that group name claims.Group element 872 comprises and will show the demonstration information that group name claims with gray background black font.Can use shades of colour.Group element 870 shows with white font in black background and shows the demonstration information that group name claims.Demonstration information also can include but not limited to for showing font that group name claims, the frame of drawing for group name being claimed to be shown in shape wherein and this shape around.In one embodiment, can will show that information coding suitably presents each group name and claims in embedded instruction or Cascading Style Sheet (css).In this embodiment, can name css rule based on hash algorithm.Hash algorithm can be referred to as group name the css grammer of inputting and can be suitable output is formatd.Can come dynamically this css to be inserted in output data with embedded instruction.Dynamic insertion like this allows background process to avoid having to process the demonstration information of each group.
In one embodiment, advertiser can create various groups of rules and for generating the order of group in group path.For example, advertiser can use interface based on web to create and/or editor organizes rule.Can preserve grouping definition ordered list for use in the future.In addition, advertiser can preserve a plurality of different groupings definition ordered lists.Can be to each grouping definition ordered list additional label to distinguish these lists.User interface also can allow advertiser to revise or delete existing grouping definition ordered list.For example, in one embodiment, can lead to and drag specific group and this group is put into the order that reposition in this ordered list changes group.In addition, advertiser can select grouping definition ordered list to generate report, and this report comprises the group path from advertiser's conversion pathway generation according to selected grouping definition ordered list.
When the data of request and group path coherence, can be by path in groups in 120 next life of performance analytical equipment.Or, can any point place in the transmission of the conversion pathway data along for example, for example, from data source (, history data repository 119) to user (, user's browser place) conversion pathway be changed to path in groups.In yet another embodiment, by web server request conversion pathway data and the request based on from user, conversion pathway data are returned to web server.This web server can be changed conversion pathway path in groups, then by comprising, organizes the report in path or data transmission to user.In yet another embodiment, conversion pathway data can be sent to user.Also grouping definition ordered list (comprising all group rules) can be sent to user.Can send conversion pathway is changed to the instruction in path in groups and with this instruction, conversion pathway changed to path in groups to user.For example, can and conversion pathway be changed to the browser that the embedded instruction in path in groups sends to user by conversion pathway data, group rule, this browser can be carried out embedded instruction code conversion pathway is changed to path in groups.These instructions can also comprise instruction or the code in format and demonstration group path.
In yet another embodiment, with group path, create class Venn figure.In one embodiment, the mode with class Venn figure illustrates different channel groups.Use described above group, can be according to channel group ordered list definition channel.Channel group comprises rule of classification, user interactions is divided into groups according to source and medium dimension.Channel group can comprise paid advertisement, directly input, natural search, recommendation, Email, social networks, feed (feed) and other.Group such as recommendation, feed and Email can comprise the group rule based on medium dimension.For example, if the medium dimension of user interactions is set to " Email ", this user interactions will be grouped into Email.Can realize paid advertisement, directly input and search naturally by the group rule that depends on source and medium dimension.The user interactions that social networks group can be defined as mating with its source the list of known social networks website mates.As described above, this list can comprise the asterisk wildcard for mating with reference to source dimension data.Rule " other " can be defined as default set, and it mates with any user interactions that does not mate any other group.
Advertiser often crosses over multiple support channels and carries out advertisement.Impact across channel advertisement may be difficult to distinguish.Can conversion pathway relatively overlapping that cross over different channels be described with class Venn figure.From only limit to show exactly three or still less traditional Venn figure of a circle is different, class Venn figure can illustrate four or the more circle associated from different channel groups.In one embodiment, class Venn figure can comprise eight different circles, circle of each channel group.When surpassing three bowlders shown in single class Venn figure, this overlapping region is entirely accurate in all cases in theory.For example, can not some possible overlapping region is visual.Yet even if can not accurately show possiblely when overlapping, in class Venn figure, the accuracy of overlapping region also can reach maximization.
Even if having these theoretic restrictions, class Venn figure still can provide information use and relatively accurate.For example, the size of each circle can be proportional with the number percent that comprises the conversion that is grouped at least one user interactions in corresponding channel.In addition, can apply hill-climbing algorithm and create the overlapping relatively accurate expression to visual channel.
Fig. 9 shows the class Venn figure according to four of exemplary embodiment selected channels.Show the channel 902 being comprised at least one conversion pathway, and the percent of total 904 that comprises the conversion pathway that is grouped at least one user interactions in corresponding channel.Can select each channel to be included in class Venn Figure 93 0.For example, can select check box 920 to add Email channel to class Venn Figure 93 0.Similarly, can from class Venn Figure 93 0, remove channel with check box.If do not select any channel, if or selected channel not overlapping, do not show any class Venn figure.On the contrary, can show between nonoptional channel or selected channel and there is no overlapping indication.In alternate embodiment, if selected channel is not overlapping, generate the circle of disjoint proportional size.Can total quantity and the number percent comprising from the conversion pathway of the user interactions of each selected channel be shown with text filed 918.In class Venn Figure 93 0, circle 908 is corresponding with " paid advertisement " channel, and circle 916 is corresponding with " directly input " channel, and circle 912 is corresponding with " other " channel, and circle 914 is corresponding with " search naturally " channel.Size and the data in row 904 of each in these circles are proportional.Region 910 shows the always overlapping of all four selected channels, and the size in region 910 is proportional with 395 number percents that transform associated conversion that comprised from the user interactions of each selected channel.
In yet another embodiment, data stuffing row 904 be comprise the mutual conversion pathway of highest priority user be basis.For example, if paid advertisement channel is compared recommendation channel, priority ratio is higher, not only comprises paid advertisement user interactions but also comprise the mutual conversion pathway of recommendation by the part that is paid advertisement number percent.Therefore, be the data in calculated column 904, each conversion pathway is comprised in the channel of the highest rank.Such calculating will cause the data in row 904 and reach 100%.Yet class Venn Figure 93 0 will continue to illustrate the various overlapping of channel as described above.
In one embodiment, class Venn Figure 93 0 can be interactively.When cursor movement is on arbitrary circle of class Venn Figure 93 0 or overlapping region time, can show the additional information with channel data correlation.For example, if cursor movement, to region 910, can be shown to pop-up window or stack window provide the information of the quantity of the conversion representing in the channel that represents in the conversion total quantity, region 910 of each channel about representing in region 910 and region 910.In one embodiment, channel information and conversion data can be sent to customer set up.When the cursor of customer set up is positioned on arbitrary region of class Venn Figure 93 0, can be cited and be displayed to user with channel information and the conversion data of this zone association.In yet another embodiment, channel information and conversion data be can remotely store, and channel information and conversion data when cursor is positioned on associated region, accessed.
When the quantity of selected channel increases, the quantity comprising from the conversion pathway of the user interactions of each selected channel likely becomes still less.Very possible this quantity becomes enough little so that innermost overlapping region (region 910 in Fig. 9) scope becomes very difficult visual.If the area in innermost region lower than predetermined threshold value, provides the scaling option to allow, with enough details, innermost region is shown.In one embodiment, if the area in innermost region is less than specific amount of pixels or is less than the particular percentile of the area of pictural surface, enable this scaling option.For example, if innermost region comprises, be less than the pixel of 100 or be less than 3% of this area of pictural surface, can enable the scaling option.Can use button or check box (for example check box 906) to select the scaling option.When having selected the scaling option, in this innermost region, the region of class Venn figure is around exaggerated, and makes the size and shape in this innermost region high-visible.In one embodiment, when having selected the scaling option, use animation effect by convergent-divergent process visualization.User, cancel when selection the scaling option is watched whole class Venn figure or watches class Venn figure with unprocessed form and also can use corresponding animation.
Figure 10 be according to exemplary embodiment for generating the process flow diagram of the process of class Venn figure.Such Venn figure is by the circle comprising about each selected channel.According to the quantity that comprises the conversion pathway that is grouped at least one user interactions in corresponding channel, determine the size (1010) of each circle.For example, in one embodiment, the size of circle is the factor of the number percent that comprises the conversion that is grouped in the one or more user interactions in corresponding channel.For generating class Venn figure, minimum circle is placed on to initial position (1020).In one embodiment, determine the center of circle that this initial position makes minimum circle vertical center in the figure.In addition the circle of, placing this minimum makes the selected limit of itself and this figure tangent.In can arrangement, between the selected limit of this figure and minimum circle, add buffer zone, to be offset the position of minimum circle with respect to the selected limit of this figure.Then the next smallest circle in residue circle is placed to (1030) in the figure.In one embodiment, placing randomly the circle adding makes the circle of added circle and each previously placement overlapping.
Once add circle, the position of the circle of this interpolation be optimized to (1040).In one embodiment, by hill-climbing algorithm, come to determine and optimize position for the last circle adding.In one embodiment, after the circle that circle is added before being initially placed to each is overlapping, calculate the area of each overlapping region.Then these overlapping areas are input in objective function.Then this last circle adding is moved to the reposition that approaches last position randomly.This after the circle that adds before still with each of the position circle that makes this interpolation overlapping.Again calculate each overlapping area and be entered in objective function.If this objective function produces more excellent result in this new position, upgrade the position of this circle.According to used objective function, smaller or greater value determines whether this reposition is more excellent.Repeat recalculating of mobile and objective function, until find optimal location.
In one embodiment, this objective function is:
This function carrys out calculated value according to the actual overlapping area of all circles and desirable overlapping ratio.Can be according to calculate desirable overlapping value from the data of conversion pathway.Along with the circle of last interpolation is moved to new position, this objective function is minimized to find round optimal location.This minimum value represents in this overlapping region the least error for desirable overlapping region.Can use other objective function.Some objective functions can be to specific region than the more weight in other regions, and this weight is also the factor of arbitrary specific region of how explaining in precise term like this.For example, in one embodiment, the weight of other overlapping regions of weight ratio of the overlapping region of all circles is larger.Such objective function can cause illustrating more accurately the overlapping class Venn figure of all circles.This has improved accuracy, but take for other overlapping regions, may lower accuracy be cost.
In yet another embodiment, this objective function can be:
In this objective function, area
saccording to the area of the overlapping region of placed circle calculating, and t arg etarea
sit is the desirable area calculating from conversion pathway data.As implied above, for each region of each circle of placing, ask area
swith t arg etarea
sthe summation of ratio.Hill-climbing algorithm minimizes this functional value to find the optimal location of circle.
Figure 11 illustrates according to the round polygon of exemplary embodiment and the variable that can be used for calculating the polygonal area of this circle.Circle polygon 1100 is similar to the crossing area of three circles.The coordinate of circle polygon 1100 is relevant to the point of crossing of added circle, can calculate by known method of geometry.Below the part that is circle polygon 1100 to which point of crossing of definite circle adding is in more detail described.Can be two-part summation by the area definition of circle polygon 1100.First is the area of the basic polygon 1110 that consists of dashed line segment.Can use formula below to obtain the area of this polygon 1110:
The area of this polygonal area and circular segment 1120,1130 and 1140 is added.Can use the area of formula calculating circular segment 1140 below:
Can calculate in a similar manner the area of circular segment 1120 and 1130.The polygonal area of circle is the area that the area of this polygon 1100 adds each circular segment 1120,1130 and 1140.
Once find optimal location, if also do not add any circle to this figure, add next smallest circle and determine its optimal location (1050).Continue to do like this, until each circle is added to this figure and determined its optimal location.After the position of each circle is optimized, can be according to the optimal location synthetic image (1060) of circle.
Each circle can have the associated color of filling this circle in class Venn figure when showing.Each circle can be transparent to a certain extent, makes overlapping region darker than independent round color.The darkest region of color is the overlapping regions of all circles.In one embodiment, further deepen the color in the overlapping region of all circles, or add other visions and indicate and give prominence to this region.For this field color is deepened, must determine this region.In one embodiment, can determine this region with circle polygon.
