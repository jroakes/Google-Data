- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be used to implement the methods, systems and processes described in this disclosure.
- content can be provided to a first device that is related to or selected based on an event associated with content selected or presented at a second device. Selection of content in this way can allow for content to be presented, for example, at a user device having a large screen (or other enhanced presentation characteristics) and that may be likely to be experienced by multiple users.
- a first device can be identified that is associated with a first user.
- a second different device associated with a second different user, can be determined that is in proximity to the first device.
- a first group can be defined that includes both devices. Other devices in proximity to the first device can also be identified and added to the first group.
- An occurrence of an event can be determined in association with the second different device.
- the event can be determined, for example, from an indication of a user interaction with the second different device, such as a search request, a request for specific content, a selection of content, navigation to a resource, an action in a social network, or some other user interaction.
- the event can be evaluated to determine when the event is indicative of a follow-on opportunity for presentation of content to the first user on the first device.
- the follow-on opportunity can be an opportunity to present further content to a user, the selection of the content being related to, or in association with, the event.
- Information related to the event can be stored, e.g., as a record in a log, in association with an identifier for the first group.
- a first opportunity can be identified to provide content to the first device, such as in response to a request for content or for other reasons.
- the first opportunity can be evaluated, including locating the record associated with the event, and information from the record can be used when selecting content for delivery in response to the first opportunity.
- the content that is selected can be an advertisement that is selected for presentation on the first device based on the event that occurred in association with the second different device.
- content identified for presentation to a co-located device can be selected, at least in part, based on aggregated use data associated with users of co-located devices.
- a set of co-located devices can be identified, including at least a first device and a second device that are associated with different users and are currently in proximity to each other.
- a determination can be made that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people.
- Use data can be gathered that is associated with current sessions associated with the different users related to their use of their respective devices. Gathering the use data can include gathering first data related to the use of the first device by a first user and second data related to the use of the second device by a second different user for their current sessions.
- the first and second data can be aggregated to create aggregate data related to use of both the first and second devices by their respective users.
- the aggregate data can be evaluated, including using the aggregate data to identify content (e.g., advertisements) to present on the first one of the co-located devices for presentation to both the first and the second user. Other ways are possible for selecting content to present to one or more co-located devices.
- determining co-located devices can be limited to user devices that are associated with the same user.
- the user's smartphone can be determined to be in proximity to the user's networked television, e.g., that may be in the viewable and/or audible range of other users in addition to the user.
- other users' devices can be included in determining co-located devices.
- content e.g., advertisements, videos, etc.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- users can specify whether or not to allow their devices to be used for determining co-located devices. For example, users can specify that their devices are not authorized to determine co-located devices or provide data for a determination of co-location.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for delivering content.
- the example environment 100 includes a content management system 110 for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 (e.g., advertisers), publishers 109 , and the content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 and publishers 109 .
- the environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by the content management system 110 , stored somewhere else and accessible using the network 102 , generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination of these.
- a data store of device identification criteria 131 can include criteria used to identify devices and to determine whether devices are co-located and or should qualify for follow up content.
- the criteria can include device characteristics, e.g., that identify a minimum screen size for which devices should be identified for receipt of content in follow-on opportunities.

- An event log 133 can include information for events that have occurred at particular user devices, e.g., in a time-annotated queue of events that can be used to select content for follow-on opportunities.
- the content management system 110 can include plural engines, some or all of which may be separate or combined, and may be co-located or distributed (e.g., connected over the network 102 ).
- a device identification engine 121 can identify user devices that are co-located and to which content is to be provided. For example, user devices 106 that are in the same area (e.g., the same room) can be identified as being co-located because they share the same, or essentially the same, GPS coordinates. Other ways of identifying co-located user devices can be used, e.g., near-field communication (NFC), a shared WiFi network or location, or other device co-location determination techniques.
- the device identification engine 121 can also form a group that includes devices that are determined to be co-located (e.g., in proximity).
- An event determination engine 122 can determine an occurrence of an event in association with a device.
- the event can be an occurrence of a presentation of content to a user associated with one of the group of co-located devices.
- An event evaluation engine 123 can evaluate an event to determine when the event is indicative of a follow-on opportunity for presentation of content to a user.
- the follow-on opportunity for example, can be an opportunity to present further content to a user related to, or in association with, the event.
- the event evaluation engine 123 can store information related to the event in the event log 133 , e.g., in association with an identifier for the group.
- a content identification engine 124 can identify content items (e.g., advertisements) that are responsive to received requests for content. Identifying the content items can include, for example, the use of keywords to identify eligible content items, as described above. Content items can also be selected based on their likely performance in situations in which content is selected for co-located devices, e.g., for providing content items for follow-on opportunities.
- content items e.g., advertisements
- Identifying the content items can include, for example, the use of keywords to identify eligible content items, as described above.
- Content items can also be selected based on their likely performance in situations in which content is selected for co-located devices, e.g., for providing content items for follow-on opportunities.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScriptTM scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- User devices 106 can submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- the search system 112 can, for example, access the indexed cache 114 to identify resources that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 can be data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource that is provided in response to a particular search query, and includes a link to the resource.
- Search results pages can also include one or more slots in which other content items (e.g., advertisements) can be presented.
- the content management system 110 receives a request for content.
- the request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot e.g., a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot
- keywords associated with a requested resource e.g., source keywords”
- a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116 .
- the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”).
- eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile.
- the content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page.
- an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item.
- the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors.
- a conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage.
- a content item e.g., an ad
- a conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item.
- a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used
- FIG. 2 shows an example system 200 for providing content.
- the content that is provided can be selected based, at least in part, on events (e.g., associated with users) that occur at one or more co-located devices.
- the content management system 110 can use information associated with an event occurring at a second different device 106 b to identify an opportunity to provide content 201 to a co-located first device 106 a .
- the opportunity can be identified, for example, at a time that the content management system 110 receives a request for content 203 from the first device 106 a .
- the content management system 110 can determine, for example, if an opportunity presents itself to reach a larger audience by providing content to a nearby device that is enabled to present information to more people (e.g., based on screen size).
- the second co-located device 106 b (e.g., a smartphone, a wearable, etc.) may be likely to be used by a single user 202 b
- the first device 106 a may be a device (e.g., having a large screen) that is likely to be experienced by one or more first users 202 a.
- the content management system 110 can determine if speakers on the first device 106 a are enabled (e.g., non-muted). In some implementations, determining the speaker status of the first device 106 a can be accomplished by having the first device 106 a emit detectable sound 204 , e.g., including a token 206 provided by the content management system 110 . In some implementations, the sound can be of the form of a token or other snippet of sound that may be inaudible to humans.
- the token for example, can be included in an audio stream that includes both conventional sound (i.e., sound that is associated with a given program presented on the first device 106 a ) and the token.
- multiple speaker tests can occur initially and/or periodically to determine the status of speakers of multiple devices 106 within a co-location area 208 that includes the second different device 106 b and one or more first devices 106 a .
- Example first devices 106 a and second different devices 106 b include a mobile telephone, a mobile electronic device with a microphone, a desktop computer, or another electronic device with a microphone.
- the following example sequence of stages can be used to provide content based on co-located devices.
- the device identification engine 121 can identify ( 210 ) the first device 106 a that is associated with the first user 202 a .
- the identification can be made, for example, because the first device 106 a is currently receiving (or has recently received) content (e.g., resources, videos, advertisements, etc.) from the content management system 110 .
- Identification of a particular device can include, for example, identification of characteristics of the device, such as a screen size or other characteristics that can be indicative of the quality of a content presentation opportunity to multiple users.
- the first device 106 a can be a large-screen television that is networked to the Internet and under control the first user 202 a.
- the device identification engine 121 can determine ( 212 ) that the second different device 106 b is in proximity to the first device 106 a .
- the device identification engine 121 can form a first group that includes the first device 106 a and the second different device 106 b , e.g., that is associated with the second different user 202 b .
- the group can also include other user devices 106 in proximity to the first device 106 a , such as a third device 106 c .
- the first device 106 a can be a presentation device being controlled by the third device 106 c that can also be associated with the first user 202 a .
- Identification of the second different device 106 b can be made based, at least in part, on determining that the second different device 106 b is in proximity to the first device 106 a , e.g., within the co-location area 208 .
- the co-location area 208 can include devices, for example, that are identified (e.g., using GPS) as being within an audible range of the second co-located device 106 b .
- information that identifies co-located devices and their associated groups can be stored in the data store of co-located device 132 .

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium, including a method for providing content. A set of co-located devices is identified, including at least first and second devices that are associated with different users and are currently in proximity to each other. A determination is made that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people. Use data is gathered that is associated with current sessions associated with the different users related to their use of their respective devices including gathering first data related to the use of the first device by a first user and second data related to the use of the second device by a second different user. The first and second data are aggregated and evaluated to identify content to present on the first one of the co-located devices for presentation to both users.
Description
This specification relates to information presentation.
The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as webpages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a webpage can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the webpage or defined for presentation with a webpage, for example, along with search results. Content in these examples can be of various formats, while the devices that consume (e.g., present) the content can be equally varied in terms of their type and capabilities.
Content slots can be allocated to content sponsors as part of a reservation system, or in an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, an auction can be run, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or a likelihood that the user will interact with the content presented.
In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a computer-implemented method for providing content. The method includes identifying a set of co-located devices including at least a first device and a second device that are associated with different users and are currently in proximity to each other. The method further includes determining that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people. The method further includes gathering use data associated with current sessions associated with the different users related to their use of their respective devices including gathering first data related to the use of the first device by a first user and second data related to the use of the second device by a second different user for their current sessions. The method further includes aggregating, using one or more processors, the first and second data to create aggregate data related to use of both the first and second devices by their respective users. The method further includes evaluating the aggregate data including using the aggregate data to identify content to present on the first one of the co-located devices for presentation to both the first and the second user.
These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Identifying a set of co-located devices can include receiving location information for both the first and second device, evaluating the received location information to determine a relative distance between the first and second devices, and comparing the relative distance to a threshold. The method can further include receiving login information for both the first and second users from their respective devices, and evaluating the aggregate can data further include evaluating respective profiles associated with the first and second user to identify the content. Determining that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people can include determining a screen size associated with the first one of the co-located devices and determining that the screen size is above a threshold size. Gathering use data can include gathering data for only as long as the first and second devices are co-located. The method can further include identifying filters to be associated with the aggregate data based on one or more characteristics associated with the first and second different users, and filtering content selections based on the identified filters prior to presentation on the first one of the co-located devices. The method can further include receiving, from the first one of the co-located devices, a request for content, and providing a selection for presentation on the first one of the co-located devices based on the evaluating. The method can further include storing the aggregate data for use in selecting content only as long are the first and second device are co-located. The method can further include using the aggregate data to select content for presentation on other ones of the co-located devices. The method can further include selecting a first content item based on the aggregate data for display on the first one of the co-located devices, and selecting second different content items for display on other ones of the co-located devices based at least in part on the first content item.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products that include a computer program product tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprising instructions. The instructions, when executed by one or more processors, cause the processor to: identify a set of co-located devices including at least a first device and a second device that are associated with different users and are currently in proximity to each other; determine that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people; gather use data associated with current sessions associated with the different users related to their use of their respective devices including gathering first data related to the use of the first device by a first user and second data related to the use of the second device by a second different user for their current sessions; aggregate, using one or more processors, the first and second data to create aggregate data related to use of both the first and second devices by their respective users; and evaluate the aggregate data including using the aggregate data to identify content to present on the first one of the co-located devices for presentation to both the first and the second user.
These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Identifying a set of co-located devices can include receiving location information for both the first and second device, evaluating the received location information to determine a relative distance between the first and second devices, and comparing the relative distance to a threshold. The instructions can further include instructions for receiving login information for both the first and second users from their respective devices, and evaluating the aggregate data can further include evaluating respective profiles associated with the first and second user to identify the content. Determining that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people can include determining a screen size associated with the first one of the co-located devices and determining that the screen size is above a threshold size. Gathering use data can include gathering data for only as long as the first and second devices are co-located.
In general, another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems, including a system comprising one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: identify a set of co-located devices including at least a first device and a second device that are associated with different users and are currently in proximity to each other; determine that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people; gather use data associated with current sessions associated with the different users related to their use of their respective devices including gathering first data related to the use of the first device by a first user and second data related to the use of the second device by a second different user for their current sessions; aggregate, using one or more processors, the first and second data to create aggregate data related to use of both the first and second devices by their respective users; and evaluate the aggregate data including using the aggregate data to identify content to present on the first one of the co-located devices for presentation to both the first and the second user.

The instructions can further include instructions for receiving login information for both the first and second users from their respective devices, and evaluating the aggregate data can further include evaluating respective profiles associated with the first and second user to identify the content. Determining that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people can include determining a screen size associated with the first one of the co-located devices and determining that the screen size is above a threshold size. Gathering use data can include gathering data for only as long as the first and second devices are co-located.
Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. A content item can be presented to a co-located user device (e.g., a networked television) having enhanced presentation characteristics rather than, or in addition to, presenting the content item on a user device having limited display capabilities, for example, having a small screen (e.g., smartphone).
The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.
Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.
Systems, methods, computer program products and mechanisms are described for providing content to co-located devices. For example, content can be provided to a first device that is related to or selected based on an event associated with content selected or presented at a second device. Selection of content in this way can allow for content to be presented, for example, at a user device having a large screen (or other enhanced presentation characteristics) and that may be likely to be experienced by multiple users.
For example, a first device can be identified that is associated with a first user. A second different device, associated with a second different user, can be determined that is in proximity to the first device. A first group can be defined that includes both devices. Other devices in proximity to the first device can also be identified and added to the first group. An occurrence of an event can be determined in association with the second different device. The event can be determined, for example, from an indication of a user interaction with the second different device, such as a search request, a request for specific content, a selection of content, navigation to a resource, an action in a social network, or some other user interaction. The event can be evaluated to determine when the event is indicative of a follow-on opportunity for presentation of content to the first user on the first device. For example, the follow-on opportunity can be an opportunity to present further content to a user, the selection of the content being related to, or in association with, the event. Information related to the event can be stored, e.g., as a record in a log, in association with an identifier for the first group. Subsequent to storing the event information, a first opportunity can be identified to provide content to the first device, such as in response to a request for content or for other reasons. The first opportunity can be evaluated, including locating the record associated with the event, and information from the record can be used when selecting content for delivery in response to the first opportunity. For example, the content that is selected can be an advertisement that is selected for presentation on the first device based on the event that occurred in association with the second different device.
In some implementations, content identified for presentation to a co-located device can be selected, at least in part, based on aggregated use data associated with users of co-located devices. For example, a set of co-located devices can be identified, including at least a first device and a second device that are associated with different users and are currently in proximity to each other. A determination can be made that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people. Use data can be gathered that is associated with current sessions associated with the different users related to their use of their respective devices. Gathering the use data can include gathering first data related to the use of the first device by a first user and second data related to the use of the second device by a second different user for their current sessions. The first and second data can be aggregated to create aggregate data related to use of both the first and second devices by their respective users. The aggregate data can be evaluated, including using the aggregate data to identify content (e.g., advertisements) to present on the first one of the co-located devices for presentation to both the first and the second user. Other ways are possible for selecting content to present to one or more co-located devices.
In some implementations, determining co-located devices can be limited to user devices that are associated with the same user. For example, the user's smartphone can be determined to be in proximity to the user's networked television, e.g., that may be in the viewable and/or audible range of other users in addition to the user. In some implementations, other users' devices can be included in determining co-located devices. In some implementations, content (e.g., advertisements, videos, etc.) can be selected or recommended based on a collective watch history of a group of users, and can be further based on content being currently provided.
For situations in which the systems discussed here collect and/or use information including personal information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to enable/disable or control programs or features that may collect and/or use personal information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information associated with the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that the no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
In some implementations, users can specify whether or not to allow their devices to be used for determining co-located devices. For example, users can specify that their devices are not authorized to determine co-located devices or provide data for a determination of co-location.
The environment 100 can include plural data stores, which can be stored locally by the content management system 110, stored somewhere else and accessible using the network 102, generated as needed from various data sources, or some combination of these. A data store of device identification criteria 131, for example, can include criteria used to identify devices and to determine whether devices are co-located and or should qualify for follow up content. For example, the criteria can include device characteristics, e.g., that identify a minimum screen size for which devices should be identified for receipt of content in follow-on opportunities. A data store of co-located devices 132, for example, can include information that identifies user devices that are co-located, e.g., in proximity to each other, to be used to present content to other devices in the group when a follow-on opportunity is determined. An event log 133, for example, can include information for events that have occurred at particular user devices, e.g., in a time-annotated queue of events that can be used to select content for follow-on opportunities.
The content management system 110 can include plural engines, some or all of which may be separate or combined, and may be co-located or distributed (e.g., connected over the network 102). A device identification engine 121, for example, can identify user devices that are co-located and to which content is to be provided. For example, user devices 106 that are in the same area (e.g., the same room) can be identified as being co-located because they share the same, or essentially the same, GPS coordinates. Other ways of identifying co-located user devices can be used, e.g., near-field communication (NFC), a shared WiFi network or location, or other device co-location determination techniques. The device identification engine 121 can also form a group that includes devices that are determined to be co-located (e.g., in proximity).
An event determination engine 122, for example, can determine an occurrence of an event in association with a device. For example, the event can be an occurrence of a presentation of content to a user associated with one of the group of co-located devices.
An event evaluation engine 123, for example, can evaluate an event to determine when the event is indicative of a follow-on opportunity for presentation of content to a user. The follow-on opportunity, for example, can be an opportunity to present further content to a user related to, or in association with, the event. The event evaluation engine 123 can store information related to the event in the event log 133, e.g., in association with an identifier for the group.
A content identification engine 124, for example, can identify content items (e.g., advertisements) that are responsive to received requests for content. Identifying the content items can include, for example, the use of keywords to identify eligible content items, as described above. Content items can also be selected based on their likely performance in situations in which content is selected for co-located devices, e.g., for providing content items for follow-on opportunities.
A website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of webpages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104.
A resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102. A resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. The resources can include content, such as words, phrases, images, video and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript™ scripts).
A user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 102. Example user devices 106 include personal computers (PCs), televisions with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto, set-top boxes, gaming consoles, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), tablet computers and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102. A user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102.
A user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104. In turn, data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106. The data representing the resource 105 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display, such as a presentation location of a pop-up window or a slot of a third-party content site or webpage, in which content can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots (e.g., ad slots).
To facilitate searching of these resources, the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources by crawling and indexing the resources provided by the content publishers on the websites 104. Data about the resources can be indexed based on the resource to which the data corresponds. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources can be stored in an indexed cache 114.
When a resource 105, search results 118 and/or other content (e.g., a video) are requested by a user device 106, the content management system 110 receives a request for content. The request for content can include characteristics of the slots that are defined for the requested resource or search results page, and can be provided to the content management system 110.
For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the content management system 110 in association with a given request. Similarly, keywords associated with a requested resource (“resource keywords”) or a search query 116 for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource or search query 116.
Based at least in part on data included in the request, the content management system 110 can select content that is eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible content items”). For example, eligible content items can include eligible ads having characteristics matching the characteristics of ad slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116. In some implementations, the selection of the eligible content items can further depend on user signals, such as demographic signals, behavioral signals or other signals derived from a user profile.
The content management system 110 can select from the eligible content items that are to be provided for presentation in slots of a resource or search results page based at least in part on results of an auction (or by some other selection process). For example, for the eligible content items, the content management system 110 can receive offers from content sponsors 108 and allocate the slots, based at least in part on the received offers (e.g., based on the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction or based on other criteria, such as those related to satisfying open reservations and a value of learning). The offers represent the amounts that the content sponsors are willing to pay for presentation of (or selection of or other interaction with) their content with a resource or search results page. For example, an offer can specify an amount that a content sponsor is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the content item, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the offer can specify an amount that the content sponsor is willing to pay (e.g., a cost per engagement) for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the content item or a conversion following selection of the content item. For example, the selected content item can be determined based on the offers alone, or based on the offers of each content sponsor being multiplied by one or more factors, such as quality scores derived from content performance, landing page scores, a value of learning, and/or other factors.
A conversion can be said to occur when a user performs a particular transaction or action related to a content item provided with a resource or search results page. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case-to-case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on a content item (e.g., an ad), is referred to a webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage. A conversion can also be defined by a content provider to be any measurable or observable user action, such as downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a web site or webpage, registering on a website, experiencing media, or performing a social action regarding a content item (e.g., an ad), such as endorsing, republishing or sharing the content item. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
In some implementations, before making a decision to provide content 201 on the first device 106 a, the content management system 110 can determine if speakers on the first device 106 a are enabled (e.g., non-muted). In some implementations, determining the speaker status of the first device 106 a can be accomplished by having the first device 106 a emit detectable sound 204, e.g., including a token 206 provided by the content management system 110. In some implementations, the sound can be of the form of a token or other snippet of sound that may be inaudible to humans. The token, for example, can be included in an audio stream that includes both conventional sound (i.e., sound that is associated with a given program presented on the first device 106 a) and the token. In some implementations, multiple speaker tests can occur initially and/or periodically to determine the status of speakers of multiple devices 106 within a co-location area 208 that includes the second different device 106 b and one or more first devices 106 a. Example first devices 106 a and second different devices 106 b include a mobile telephone, a mobile electronic device with a microphone, a desktop computer, or another electronic device with a microphone. In some implementations, the following example sequence of stages can be used to provide content based on co-located devices.
At stage 1, for example, the device identification engine 121 can identify (210) the first device 106 a that is associated with the first user 202 a. The identification can be made, for example, because the first device 106 a is currently receiving (or has recently received) content (e.g., resources, videos, advertisements, etc.) from the content management system 110. Identification of a particular device can include, for example, identification of characteristics of the device, such as a screen size or other characteristics that can be indicative of the quality of a content presentation opportunity to multiple users. For example, the first device 106 a can be a large-screen television that is networked to the Internet and under control the first user 202 a.
At stage 2, for example, the device identification engine 121 can determine (212) that the second different device 106 b is in proximity to the first device 106 a. The device identification engine 121 can form a first group that includes the first device 106 a and the second different device 106 b, e.g., that is associated with the second different user 202 b. The group can also include other user devices 106 in proximity to the first device 106 a, such as a third device 106 c. In some implementations, the first device 106 a can be a presentation device being controlled by the third device 106 c that can also be associated with the first user 202 a. Identification of the second different device 106 b can be made based, at least in part, on determining that the second different device 106 b is in proximity to the first device 106 a, e.g., within the co-location area 208. The co-location area 208 can include devices, for example, that are identified (e.g., using GPS) as being within an audible range of the second co-located device 106 b. In some implementations, information that identifies co-located devices and their associated groups can be stored in the data store of co-located device 132.
In some implementations, determining co-located devices can be based on speaker ranges of one or more first device(s) 106 a and microphone capabilities of the second co-located device 106 b, e.g., relative to hearing detectable sounds. The content management system 110, for example, can identify and provide a token 206 that is to be played on the first device 106 a. The content management system 110 can also provide a notification 209 to the second different device 106 b that instructs the device to listen for the token 206 emitted by the first device 106 a. The notification 209 can be provided, for example, at a time just before the token 206 is provided to the first device 106 a, or slightly thereafter. The token 206 can be, for example, a small snippet of inaudible (e.g., inaudible to humans) sound that can be inserted into audio content that is to be played on the first device 106 a. For example, the token 206 can be inserted into the audio of a video that is being provided to the first device 106 a for presentation. Other ways of presenting the token 206 are possible. Using the received token 206, the first device 106 a can emit the detectable sound 204, e.g., that includes the token 206. The second different device 106 b, for example, can listen for and/or record the detectable sound 204, including listening for and identifying the token 206. In some implementations, other devices 106 in addition to the second different device 106 b and in proximity to the first device 106 a can also listen for the detectable sound 204.
In some implementations, plural first devices 106 a may be in proximity to the second co-located device 106 b, affording an opportunity to listen for and identify each of the respective first devices. In some implementations, plural second co-located devices 106 b may be in proximity to a first device 106 a, enabling each of the plurality of devices to confirm the existence or absence of a presented token.
At stage 3, for example, the event determination engine 122 can determine an occurrence of an event 218 (or multiple events 218) in association with the second different device 106 b. For example, the event can be an occurrence of a presentation of content to the second different user 202 b. Other example events can include entering a search query by the user 202 b, receiving indication of, or providing content to, the user 202 b such as a video or an advertisement, receiving an indication of the user 202 b visiting a specific web site, receiving an indication of a calendar item for the user 202 b firing that is related to particular content, or some other event.
At stage 4, for example, the event evaluation engine 123 can evaluate the event 218 to determine when the event 218 is indicative (220) of a follow-on opportunity for presentation of content to the first user 202 a on the first device 106 a. For example, not all events identified at stage 3 are events for which a follow-on opportunity may be indicated. The follow-on opportunity, for example, can be an opportunity to present, to the user, further content that is related to, or in association with, the event. For example, if the event is the presentation of a particular video to the user, then the follow-on opportunity to present content can be an opportunity to present a content item (e.g., an advertisement) that is related to the video. In some implementations, factors that can be used to determine when a follow-on opportunity exists include, for example, whether the follow-on opportunity would complement or be related to the event 218 in some way, whether group presentation can provide a likely benefit from social conversation, whether a brand-related presentation is possible and likely to provide a significant effect (e.g., user interaction), whether presentation of follow-on content can serve as an organic endorsement of content, whether the number of potential viewers of the follow-on content is worth presentation of the content, and whether a delayed or immediate presentation is likely to provide the greatest benefit.
At stage 5, for example, the event evaluation engine 123 can store, as a record in the event log 133, the information related to the event 218 in association with an identifier for the group. For example, the event log 133 can include, for any given second different device 106 b, information that identifies the type of event and when the event occurred.
At stage 6, for example, subsequent to storing information related to the event, the event evaluation engine 123 can identify a follow-on opportunity 222 to provide content to the first device 106 a. For example, the follow-on opportunity 222 can be identified from a request for content 203 that is received from the first device 106 a (or some other device in the same group).
At stage 7, for example, the event evaluation engine 123 can evaluate the follow-on opportunity 222. The evaluation can include, for example, locating one or more records in the event log 133, e.g., to find queued-up events associated with the group to which the first device 106 a belongs. In some implementations, evaluating the follow-on opportunity 222 can include evaluating multiple event records in the event log 133. In some implementations, queued-up events can be located to identify follow-on opportunities for presentation of content to individual users, even if the individual users are no longer part of the group.
At stage 8, for example, the content identification engine 124 can use information in the one or more event records in the event log 133 to select content for delivery in response to the first opportunity. As an example, the content identification engine 124 can identify one or more eligible content items (e.g., video advertisements associated with product X) for the first device 106 a using associated event information for events that occurred relative to the second different device 106 b.
A first device is identified that is associated with a first user (302). As an example, the device identification engine 121 can identify (210) the first device 106 a for presenting content to the one or more users 202 a. In some implementations, the identification can be made because the first device 106 a is currently receiving (or has recently received) content (e.g., resources, videos, advertisements, etc.) from the content management system 110.
A determination is made that a second different device is in proximity to the first device, forming a first group, the second different device being associated with a second different user (304). The device identification engine 121, for example, can determine (212) the second co-located device 106 b, e.g., based on a determination that the second co-located device 106 b is in proximity to the first device 106 a (e.g., within the co-location area 208). The co-location area 208 can include devices, for example, that are identified (e.g., using GPS) as being within an audible range of the second co-located device 106 b. For example, the range can be based on speaker ranges of one or more first device(s) 106 a and microphone capabilities of the second co-located device 106 b, e.g., relative to hearing inaudible sounds. Determining that the second co-located device 106 b is in proximity to the first device 106 a, for example, can include the use of GPS, near-field communication (NFC), a shared WiFi network or location, or other techniques that indicate that devices are in the same area (e.g., in the same room or within audible and/or viewable range).
In some implementations, determining that a second different device is in proximity to the first device can further include detecting, by one of the first device or the second different device, a presence of another device based on sub, super or audible tones generated by the other device. For example, the second different device 106 b can listen for the detectable sound 204 after receiving a notification 209 from the content management system 110. Further, any of the devices in the group can listen for sounds emitted from other devices in the group.
In some implementations, the process 300 can further include determining plural second different devices that are in proximity to the first device, each associated with a different user, and including the plural second different devices in the group. For example, the device identification engine 121, for example, can identify the third device 106 c associated with a user 202 c, as well as other devices associated with other users.
A determination is made of an occurrence of an event in association with the second different device (306). As an example, the event determination engine 122 can determine an occurrence of an event 218 (or multiple events 218) in association with the second different device 106 b, e.g., an occurrence of a presentation of content to the second different user 202 b. Other example events 218 can include a search query entered by the user 202 b, an advertisement provided to the second different device 106 b, a presentation of a particular video to the user 202 b, the user 202 b visiting a specific web site, the user 202 b being provided a particular content item, a calendar item firing that can be related to particular content, or some other event.
In some implementations, the event can be an occurrence of a presentation of content to the second different user. For example, the event 218 identified by the event determination engine 122 can be based on information that a particular advertisement or a particular video has been presented (e.g., to the user 202 b) on the second different device 106 b.
In some implementations, the process 300 can further include determining an occurrence of an event on one or more of the plural second different devices and evaluating and storing information related to each determined event. For example, the event determination engine 122 can determine that one or more events 218 have occurred in association with one or more other devices in addition to or other than the second different device 106 b.
In some implementations, determining an occurrence of an event can include receiving an indication of a user interaction with the second different device. For example, the event 218 determined by the event determination engine 122 can be a user interaction, by the user 202 b, such as a search request, a request for specific content, a selection of content, navigation to a resource, an action in a social network, or some other user interaction on which to base an opportunity to provide content to a user device in proximity to other user devices in the group.
The event is evaluated to determine when the event is indicative of a follow-on opportunity for presentation of content to the first user on the first device, the follow-on opportunity being an opportunity to present further content to a user related to, or in association with, the event (308). As an example, the event evaluation engine 123 can evaluate the event 218 to determine when the event 218 is indicative (220) of a follow-on opportunity for presentation of content to the first user 202 a on the first device 106 a, as described above.
In some implementations, evaluating can include determining a type of event and determining, based on the type of event, a likelihood that a follow-on opportunity is appropriate. For example, based on the type of the event 218 (e.g., a search request, a request for specific content, a selection of content, a navigation to a resource, an action in a social network), the event evaluation engine 123 determine whether a follow-on opportunity is warranted, such as to provide a related content item on the co-located device 106 a.
Information related to the event is stored as a record in a log in association with an identifier for the group (310). The event evaluation engine 123, for example, can store a record in the event log 133 that includes information related to the event 218. As an example, the information can be stored in the event log 133 in association with an identifier for the group that includes the first device 106 a and the second different device 106 b.
In some implementations, the log can be a queue, with entries being logged based on a time of occurrence of the event. For example, records in the event log 133 that are associated with a particular group can be a time-annotated and stored as a queue, such as a search request occurring at time X, a request for specific content occurring at time Y, a selection of content occurring at time Z, and/or other queue entries.
In some implementations, the information can include one or more keywords associated with the event. For example, if the event 218 is a selection of content, then information stored for the event 218 in the event log 133 can include the keywords used in selecting the content.
Subsequent to the storing, a first opportunity to provide content to the first device is identified (312). For example, the event evaluation engine 123 can identify the follow-on opportunity 222 to provide content to the first device 106 a, e.g., when the request for content 203 is received from the first device 106 a.
In some implementations, the first opportunity can be substantially immediately after an occurrence of the event. For example, receipt of the request for content 203 can occur after the determined event 218 occurs, e.g., a search request, a request for specific content, a selection of content, navigation to a resource, an action in a social network, or some other user interaction that occurs on the second different device 106 b.
The first opportunity is evaluated including locating the record (314). As an example, the event evaluation engine 123 can evaluate the follow-on opportunity 222, including locating one or more queued-up event records in the event log 133 that are associated with the group to which the first device 106 a belongs.
In some implementations, evaluating the first opportunity can include identifying the record in the log and determining a time for presentation of content to the first user including determining a suitability to present content substantially immediately or after a delay after the occurrence of the event. For example, the event evaluation engine 123 can use information in an event record in the event log 133 to determine that the follow-on opportunity 222 should result in a presentation of related content at a particular time that is relative to (e.g., ten minutes after) the occurrence of the event.
In some implementations, evaluating the first opportunity can include evaluating one or more criteria associated with the first device to determine suitability of the first device to present specialized content, and wherein using information in the record includes identifying specialized content for presentation of the first device when the first device satisfies the one or more criteria. For example, the event evaluation engine 123 can base a decision to provide content to the first device 106 a on whether the first device 106 a has a suitable screen size for receiving particular content (e.g., a video advertisement).
The information in the record is used when selecting content for delivery in response to the first opportunity (316). The content identification engine 124, for example, can select content 201 to be provided in response to the request for content 203 that is received from the first device 106 a.
In some implementations, using the information can include using the information to select candidate items from inventory for further evaluation responsive to the first opportunity. For example, the content identification engine 124 can select content 201 using information in the event record(s) to provide content to a co-located device (e.g., the first device 106 a).
In some implementations, using the information can include using the information to select a content item from the candidate content items for presentation to the first user based. For example, the content identification engine 124 can select content 201 using information in the event records, e.g., keywords or other information identified from the determined event 218.
In some implementations, using the information can include using the information to adjust bids in an auction to select, from among candidate content items, a content item to present to the first device in response to the first opportunity. As an example, the content identification engine 124 can use information in the event record(s) to determine an adjustment to a quality score used in an auction for selecting content. For example, the content management system 110 can increase the quality score for a content item (e.g., advertisement) that will likely be experienced on a device (e.g., the first device 106 a) that may be viewed by multiple users 202 a. In some implementations, an increased quality score for a content item can increase a bid, in an auction, for presentation of the content item.
A set of co-located devices is identified including at least a first device and a second different device that are associated with different users and are currently in proximity to each other (322). For example, the device identification engine 121 can identify the first device 106 a that is associated with the first user 202 a and the second different device 106 b that is associated with the second different user 202 b. In some implementations, determining that devices are co-located can include the use of GPS, near-field communication (NFC), a shared WiFi network or location, or other technique(s) that indicate that devices are in the same area.
In some implementations, identifying a set of co-located devices can include receiving location information for both the first and second device, evaluating the received location information to determine a relative distance between the first and second devices, and comparing the relative distance to a threshold. For example, the device identification engine 121 can use GPS coordinates or other geographic location information for the devices, e.g., to determine that the devices are co-located if they are within 20 feet of each other.
A determination is made that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people (324). The device identification engine 121, for example, can identify, for either of the first device 106 a or the second different device 106 b, characteristics of the device. The characteristics can include, for example, a screen size or other characteristics that can indicate that the device is configured for content presentation opportunity to multiple users. For example, the first device 106 a can be a large-screen television that is networked to the Internet and under control the first user 202 a.
In some implementations, determining that a first one of the co-located devices is configured to be viewed by multiple people can include determining a screen size associated with the first one of the co-located devices and determining that the screen size is above a threshold size. For example, the device identification engine 121 can determine that one of the devices 106 a or 106 b has a screen size that exceeds a threshold (e.g., N inches), e.g., as identified in the data store of device identification criteria 131. For example, the criteria can include device characteristics, e.g., that identify a minimum screen size for which co-located devices are be identified for receipt of content. Other ways for determining that a device is viewable by multiple people are possible. For example, instead of analyzing screen sizes of devices, the resolution of a display area on a device can be used.
Use data is gathered that is associated with current sessions associated with the different users related to their use of their respective devices, including gathering first data related to the use of the first device by a first user and second data related to the use of the second different device by a second different user for their current sessions (326). For example, the content management system 110 can identify, gather and store use data such as a user's video watching history, web site visitation history, and other use data on a per-user basis. Histories that are used for use data, for example, can be limited to substantially recent histories.
In some implementations, gathering use data can include gathering data for only as long as the first and second devices are co-located. For example, the use data gathered by the content management system 110 can be limited to a time period that includes only the time that the first device 106 a and the second different device 106 b are co-located.
The first and second data are aggregated to create aggregate data related to use of both the first and second different devices by their respective users (328). For example, the content management system 110 can combine the use data for the first user 202 a and the second user 202 b, e.g., to group common uses, such as specific video watching histories or other uses. In some implementations, the aggregated data can be weighted, e.g., based on a level of intersection between users, and ranked, e.g., based on weights.
In some implementations, the process 320 can further include storing the aggregate data for use in selecting content only as long are the first and second device are co-located. For example, the content management system 110 can store the aggregated data only as long as needed, or as long as the first device 106 a and second different device 106 b are co-located.
The aggregate data is evaluated including using the aggregate data to identify content to present on the first one of the co-located devices for presentation to one or both the first and the second user (330). For example, the content identification engine 124 can analyze the aggregated data, including, for example, using any existing ranking for use in selecting content.
In some implementations, the process 320 can further include using the aggregate data to select content for presentation on other ones of the co-located devices. For example, the content identification engine 124 can select content (e.g., advertisements), make suggestions (e.g., video suggestions) or perform other content-related actions by evaluating the aggregated data (e.g., and using the ranking) for content to present to either or both of the devices 106 a and 106 b or other devices in the group.
In some implementations, the process 320 can further include receiving login information for both the first and second users from their respective devices, and evaluating the aggregate data can further include evaluating respective profiles (based on the received login data) associated with the first and second user to identify the content. As an example, the content identification engine 124 can access and analyze profile information for the users 202 a and 202 b for use in selecting content. In some implementations, the profile information can be obtained from profiles available for the users 202 a and 202 b as a result of user logins through a login service or in other ways.
In some implementations, the process 320 can further include identifying filters to be associated with the aggregate data based on one or more characteristics associated with the first and second different users, and filtering content selections based on the identified filters prior to presentation on the first one of the co-located devices. For example, the content that is selected by the content identification engine 134 can be limited to content that is filtered based on the appropriateness of the content (e.g., not to racy), the number of users likely to see the content, the number of users having use data associated in some way with the content, and or in other ways.
In some implementations, the process 320 can further include receiving, from the first one of the co-located devices, a request for content, and providing a selection for presentation on the first one of the co-located devices based on the evaluating. For example, the content identification engine 124 can provide the content, or suggestions related to the content, to the first device 106 a.
In some implementations, the process 320 can further include selecting a first content item based on the aggregate data for display on the first one of the co-located devices, and selecting second different content items for display on other ones of the co-located devices based at least in part on the first content item. The content identification engine 124 can provide one of the selected content items to the first device 106 a, and the same or another one of the content items to the second different device 106 b.
In some implementations, the process 320 can be used to detect multiple devices and thus multiple (e.g., 2 or greater) user profiles to restrict suggested content (e.g., advertisements or related content) based on the intersection of the different profiles, while taking into account each users' account history. For example, the process 320 can be used to provide or suggest content in the following scenario. User A's profile has the following suggested content after watching video X based on their entire account history: A, B, C, D, H, Q and V. User B's profile has the following suggested content after watching video X based on their entire account history: A, C, H, Q, Y and W. User C's profile has the following suggested content after watching video X based on their entire account history: A, G, Q, R, Y and Z. The process 320 can be used, for example, to detect that all three users are in the same room. Once video X is over, for example, an intersection for suggested content for all 3 users can be {A, Q}. Either A or Q can be presented or suggested next, for example, depending on how they rank.

The high-speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 400, while the low-speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is an example only. In one implementation, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled to memory 404, display 416 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to high-speed expansion ports 410, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In the implementation, low-speed controller 412 is coupled to storage device 406 and low-speed bus 414. The low-speed bus 414 (e.g., a low-speed expansion port), which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, Bluetooth®, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet), may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a networking device such as a switch or router, e.g., through a network adapter.

In addition, it may be implemented in a personal computer such as a laptop computer 422. Alternatively, components from computing device 400 may be combined with other components in a mobile device (not shown), such as computing device 450. Each of such devices may contain one or more of computing devices 400, 450, and an entire system may be made up of multiple computing devices 400, 450 communicating with each other.

Specifically, expansion memory 474 may include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and may include secure information also. Thus, for example, expansion memory 474 may be provide as a security module for computing device 450, and may be programmed with instructions that permit secure use of computing device 450. In addition, secure applications may be provided via the SIM cards, along with additional information, such as placing identifying information on the SIM card in a non-hackable manner.
