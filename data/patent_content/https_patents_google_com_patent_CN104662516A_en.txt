web application and browser extension
Web browser performed by client device can from remote server (such as, the server of trustship website) receive code (such as, HTML code) and received code can be performed on a client device in order to the interests of the user of client device.Run through herein, term web browser and browser application can use to represent identical content interchangeably.In various embodiments, web browser comprise one or more web apply or associated.Web application can be configured for the individual event task of user or the multi-task.Thus, web application can be configured to performed by web browser or explain.As a comparison, the machine application comprises machine executable code and is configured to directly to be performed by processor or operating system via client device performs, web is applied in and then cannot perform over the display by means of when web browser.Here, web application can utilize dedicated user interface to run in web browser, and usually provides the function promoted to some extent compared with independent Web.The example of web application includes but are not limited to: game, photo editor and video player.
Web application, browser application or institute install apply can refer to polytype application that can be arranged among browser application.Web application can be " hosts applications " or " package application ".Hosts applications can comprise self comprise webpage website at least partially, add that some metadata that may be relevant especially to the user that this web applies or web applies perform some specific functions to allow this web to apply for this user.Package application can be considered to the tied web application of its code, thus user can download the full content of this web application to be performed by browser.Encapsulation web application can without the need to having network access to perform its function for user, but on the contrary can when not accesses network by the browser on computing equipment in local successful execution.Encapsulation web application can expand API by choice for use, this mode allowing package application to change browser performance or present.
In various embodiments, web browser can comprise one or more browser extension or be configured to carry out alternately with them.In this context, " browser extension " can comprise packed or poly-group of together overall as definable and one or more webpages be configured to for web browser expanded function.Therefore, expansion also provides extra function to browser, but is generally different from application, and the user interface components for expanding provided function is little or do not have.On the contrary, web expansion is expanded browser and wherein seen website.
In another example, web application can be associated with backstage key element, and this backstage key element is the key element cannot seen in browser application, and it comprises the instruction relevant to the one or more visible key element that the web in browser application applies.(such as, receive new message) when the event triggers, this backstage key element performs this instruction to perform the function relevant to the one or more visible key element that installed web applies on the page be associated.
In some embodiments, backstage key element be used to comprise relate to apply with web or expanded application or be arranged on other type in browser application application state the additional function associated.Such as, backstage key element can be used to provide notice, from the server downloading data backstage, to server uploading data, or prepares user interface.
the event page
" the event page " is invisible web key element in browser application or webpage, and it is loaded in browser application when needed, and it is not loaded when idle.The event page does not continue to run and all run time version all the time.Therefore, the event page can save more multiple resource compared with background page.The event page can also comprise the browser extension applying with installed web or be associated with browser application or with the user account of browser application state and associate.
Therefore, do not have to continue during its visibility window to run and the background page of run time version in web application, browser extension and/or browser application even if be different from, the event page does not have can not continue during its visibility window to run or run time version in web application, browser extension or browser application yet.By this way, the event page is applied at the web be associated with background page, browser extension and/or browser application do not exist when being closed lastingly.Therefore, the event page can save storer.
But, in some embodiments, even if (such as when the background process be associated with browser application is still run) also lastingly when the label that browser is not opened or window for the event page.In such embodiment, if the label do not opened at browser or window but the background process be associated with browser application still run during event occurs, this event page still can be loaded to process this event.
sending out notice
Push technology is a kind of mode of internet communication of wherein being initiated by publisher or central server for the request of given affairs.This and pull technology define contrast, and in pull technology, the request for information transmission initiated by take over party or client.HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) (HTTP) server push (being also referred to as HTTP flow transmission) is a kind of mode sending data from web server to web browser.Http server is pushed and can be realized by several technology.In some cases, web server is not stopping connecting after client provides response data.Make to receive event if web server keeps connection to open, it can send to one or more client immediately.Otherwise data must be ranked until receive the request next time of client.Sending out notice can use the IP of continuous openness to connect with from server to client computing device (such as, the smart phone that the user having installed web application or browser extension uses) notice (such as, to the notice that third party web applies or browser extension is relevant) is provided.This notice such as can comprise sound, image or the warning of customization text.Run through herein, term sending out notice, push technology and sending out notice pass through mechanism can use interchangeably and represent identical content.
Proactive notification can comprise the feature warning user immediately, such as sound warning, desktop warning, pop-up window or animation.By comparison, passive informing such as can operate on the backstage of web browser.The designator that passive informing can comprise in the web browser (such as web application icon near) in a browser illustrates or information.Exemplarily, represent that the graphic icons of chess game application can comprise user good friend on its side is using the message of this application now, this can impel this user open Chinese chess application and join among the game with its friend.As another example, game developer can be associated with and represent that the icon of this game provides notice, and wherein the instruction of this notice has new game level to use, or the activity in game waits for user operation, and this can impel many users to open game.As another example again, purchase by group application and can be associated with the icon that represents this application and provide notice to have new providing to present to user with instruction.Passive informing can impel user again to contact with application foundation.
authentication and authorization
Many web application have the Mobile solution of pairing, such as the machine application.The machine application requires that the certificate of user is to carry out certification to them usually.Verification process uses the agreement (such as, OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID, OpenID Connect, SAML) based on web usually.In order to make Mobile solution can use agreement based on web, the user of mobile device will use the embedded type web browser on mobile device usually.Verification process provides application to perform the disposable registration with provider usually, and specifies Redirect URL as a part for registration.This application is subsequently by being redirected to the URL of provider and the identifying procedure that starts for provider by the application (such as, web browser) of user.Thus, embedded type web view will point to the URL applying the webpage (such as, login page) be associated with the machine usually.
Provider carries out certification to user and this application access of request user authorization data of asking.When user agrees to, provider redirects and gets back to URL specified when being applied in registration.Thus, after user is successfully logged onto website, this website redirects the user to the page generating token usually, and this token is sent to the machine application subsequently to carry out certification.This token can be transmitted back the machine application as cookie or window title.Generated token in website and after being included in response via cookie or window title by this token, the application of this machine extracts this token and web view embedded by closing usually.When receiving this token, this token can be used for the calling of server side API of certification to application by the machine.
At application period of registration, client identifier, one or more Redirect URL and client key can be designated.Request for certification generally include client identifier and Redirect URL and application type instruction (such as, web server, JavaScript, equipment, application is installed).Upon receiving the request, if user logs in, then certificate server can select the active session that is associated with the application carrying out asking, accepts and authentication of users certificate, obtains user's agreement that institute ask license, and returns response to this application.The content of this response can depend on the type of application.For web application, this response can be authentication code, and it can be exchanged for access token and/or refresh token.For client side application (or install application), this response can be access token.After acquisition access token, this application can use this access token to make web services request for API end points, this API end points and then provide and user-dependent profile information.In some instances, access token is sent to API end points in HTTP authorisation header, or operates in http header and send as query string parameter in disabled situation.
In one aspect, authorization server supports web server application (such as, PHP, Java, Phthon, Ruby, ASP.NET) and Mobile solution (such as, Mobile operating system).With the sequence of authorization server to utilize query argument set by the application that embeds (such as, embedded type web browser) redirect to URL as beginning, the type that the terminal A PI required by application that this query argument set instruction is carried out asking accesses.Authorization server can be configured to agree to process to user authentication, session selection and user, but the result of this sequence is authorization code.After receiving this authorization code, this code can be exchanged for access token and refresh token by application.
In yet another aspect, authorization server supports JavaScript application (JavaScript such as, run in the web browser).In response to request, authorization server sends access token, and it provides the type (that is, JavaScript) of application.Client can verify received token, and is included in by access token subsequently in terminal A PI request.
user account
User account allows user carry out certification for system service (such as, web application) and receive the mandate conducted interviews to them.In order to sign in user account, user such as can utilize password or other certificate to carry out certification to himself for the object of account, safety and resource management.Once user logs in (such as, signing in web browser, computing equipment etc.), operating system just can use the identifier of such as integer and so on instead of user name to refer to this user.Such as, user name can be associated with user identifier.System can regulate and the correct right of attribution of authentication of users account, and by distributing unique identifier to the Account Logon identifier (such as, username and password, secure identifier etc.) through checking, the right of attribution of those user accounts for good and all can be connected to unique individual.Such as, according to the business strategy organized, access control policy and various application requirement, this system can be verified the individual that those only have the Account Logon identifier of suitable system and application.
Unique identifier under Identity Association background can be guaranteed to be unique any identifier in all identifiers for individual colony or special-purpose.Unique identifier can be increase progressively distribution sequence number, from being obviously greater than the random number selected the digital space of maximum (or expection) quantity of the object that will identify, assigning by selecting institute and being still verified as unique title, code.Unique identifier can be used to carry out synchronously web application, browser extension and response between each computing equipment that can access user.
Fig. 1 illustrates the example flow diagram for carrying out the transmission of web message between applications.In some exemplary aspect, the message between application sends facilitated by network environment 100, and this network environment 100 comprises publisher 102, server application 104, client application 106 and orders use side 108.Publisher 102 can be the application carrying out on an electronic device operating or be provided by network and/or content distributed server.Server application 104 can be the server being configured to carry out communicating between publisher 102 and client application 106.Server application 104 is configured to push small-sized message to its client component (such as, client application 106).The application that client application 106 can be web application (that is, having the application based on web of web browser), JavaScript application or install.Ordering with side 108 can be the application run on client-side device, and this client-side device and client application 106 carry out the interface communicating or at least have to client application 106.Ordering with side 108 can be the one or more application be associated with specific user.
Client application 106 is ordered with request from ordering to receive with side 108, and its request is ordered in order to receive the event selected by being associated with publisher 102.This request trigger clients application 106 its counterpart application of contact (such as, server application 104) is with the event ordered by monitoring on web.Client application 106 obtains the login ID identifying and order use side 108.This login ID is provided to server application 104 to determine which application is intended to the event selected by reception by client application 106 subsequently.Application server 104 can be monitored from the event selected by publisher 102 at API end points (not shown) place.Upon this detection, server application 104 receives event notice from publisher 102.This event notice can comprise event ID, and it makes server apply 104 can to perform between login ID and event ID and compare to determine to mate.Upon determining a match, server application 104 transmits event notice to client application 106.Client application 106 can determine whether one or more application is selected to receive event notice.That is, event notice can be forwarded to single application or multiple application based on it with associating of prospective users.Event notice can be provided to via the event page to be ordered with side (or ordering with application), and this event page provides the warning pop-up window with event notice.
Client application 106 performs register flow path, and it comprises the login ID or Channel Identifier that obtain and order and be associated with side 108, and they will be sent to server and apply 104 to store with corresponding user record.Client application 106 is called and is supported that the API of JavaScript obtains the login ID (or Channel Identifier) ordering the user of use side 108 being currently logged into client application 106.In some instances, user can be required to authorize client application 106 and/or server application 104 to the license ordering use side 108 sending out notice.In one aspect, user can be required 108 to sign in client application 106 when client-side is installed first with side ordering.Channel Identifier in fact can when without the need to asking user to can be used for when follow-up time logs in ordering use side 108.In yet another aspect, user can be required to be called at API to sign in client application 106 to provide during login ID.
The message of carrying out communicating between server application 104 and client application 106 can have useful load, which reduces necessary amount of bandwidth between two interfaces.This message can comprise two fields with identification channel identifier and useful load.Such as, this message payload is maximum can be 1KB.
Server application 104 can be configured to invoking server to server A PI (not shown) to send message.This API carries out certification to the application of calling (that is, server application 104) and determines which application is registered (or ordering use) to receive this message.When applying 104 receipt message from server, this API performs checking to determine to expect take over party in sending out notice system.In some respects, no matter suitably whether user logs in, and this message payload all will be delivered to each client application.If have multiple message to rank for each application and new client application is reached the standard grade with suitable user, then this new client application can not receive the message of all queuings, but at least can receive the latest news for this client application.
Server application 104 can define one or more client types and one or more object source, and wherein this client type can be ordered with corresponding object source.In one aspect, apply 104 push-mechanism be associated can be integrated in oracle listener code with server, this oracle listener code makes the one or more computing equipments on network monitor ordering of being associated with publisher 102 and uses event.Server application 104 can receive for by the notice of all application of the event ordered by ordering to receive.For this reason, client type is associated with one or more object identifiers of each application.
Server application 104 receives event notice from publisher 102.Server application 104 is configured to monitor the event be associated with publisher 102.In some embodiments, this event is identified as event ID in event notice.This event ID be associated with order with side 108 login ID compare during can apply the expection take over party that 104 are used for determining this event notice by serviced device.When one or more event being detected, server applies 104 for client application 106 generating messages to inform this event notice to client application 106.In some respects, server application 104 can be configured to issue the event that detects for client application to receive and one or more application via client-side show.This event notice comprise readjustment (callback) function with allow to order with side 108 special time or time of being ranked carry out following up to retrieve to be associated with publisher 102 in perhaps content update.Server application 104 determines whether client application 106 has the one or more application be associated with the user being identified to receive event notice.When determine client application 106 have ordered in order to receive the application of notice be associated with publisher 102 time, server application 104 transmission comprise the message of event notice to be distributed at client-side by client application 106.
Determine client application 106 whether have one or more be registered the application receiving the content update that publisher 102 generates time, server application 104 compares at least partially by the identifier be associated with client application 106 and the event notice that receives.This event notice comprises the event ID for identifying one or more selected event.This identifier is and orders with the relevant login ID of just 108 registrations carried out.In other exemplary aspect, this identifier is in the relevant Channel Identifier of the channel of the second communication of applying to bearing association.Like this, login ID (or Channel Identifier) and event ID compare to determine to mate by server application 104.This login ID and event ID are stored in data structure by server application 104 and make server application 104 can search each identifier between the comparable period.
