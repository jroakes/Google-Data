- Electrical devices are generally rated for a maximum current draw, and in some instances these ratings can be somewhat conservative. In addition, the electrical devices may only occasionally, if ever, draw their rated currents. In some instances, power distribution systems can be conservatively built to supply the devices' rated currents. The collective power of the devices connected to branches of the power distribution system may remain conservatively below the breaker limit for their respective branch, and the attached devices may not be drawing their maximum amount of power simultaneously. Overall, a power distribution system may leave some portion of the available power unused, and the amount of unused power may increase as the number of power branches increases.
- the power draw of a computer can be estimated from the utilization of the computer.
- the algorithm that computes power draw from utilization may not be accurate.
- summation of the power draw of multiple computers may not accurately represent power drawn from a branch line, e.g., due to the presence of other devices on the branch line such as routers, lighting, and cooling systems.
- a load's estimated power draw can be compared to a measured power draw, and that feedback can be used to improve the accuracy of subsequent power draw estimates.

- the PMMs 107 , 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , and 118 b can communicate in a peer-to-peer network.
- the PMM 110 a may send a message to the PMM 107 to request that the PMM 110 b reduce the amount of power being consumed by its child nodes. If the request is granted, the PMM 110 a may then raise the amount of power available to its own child nodes by a substantially like amount.

- the server computer 115 may host email services
- the server computers 121 a and 121 b may host video sharing services.
- Demand for these two different services can vary as the amount of traffic from the computers 126 varies. For example, demand for email services may increase in the daytime as users of the computers 126 access their email for work, but in the evening the demand for email services may decrease while the demand for video sharing services increases as people browse videos during their free time.
- electrical current needs of the electrical loads 114 , 120 a , and 120 b can vary as well.
- the computing load placed upon the server computers 115 may cause the electrical load 114 to draw 60 A of electrical power in order to operate, while the electrical loads 120 a and 120 b draw 20 A.
- the server computers 115 may experience lower computing load, and therefore the electrical load 114 may draw 40 A while the server computers 121 a and 121 b may experience increased computing loads such that the electrical loads 120 a and 120 b experience a 70 A draw.
- the branch conductors 108 a and 108 b share a supply, illustrated as “Z” amperes.

- the value of “X” can vary as well.
- Z may be 100 A
- the load connected to the PMM 110 a may draw approximately 75 A, leaving approximately 25 A of capacity available for use by the loads connected to PMM 110 b without exceeding the 100 A supply.
- the PMM 110 a may limit the amount of power it passes by estimating the amount of power the electrical load 114 consumes at a given utilization of the server computers 115 .
- the PMM 110 a may determine that the electrical load 114 will consume approximately “X” amperes when the server computers 115 are utilizing N % of their computing capacity.
- the PMM may request the server computers 115 in the electrical load 114 to limit their combined computing load to N % of capacity, thereby limiting the combined power consumption of the electrical load 114 to approximately “X” amperes.
- the electrical load 114 may actually draw 0.8*X amperes when the server computers 115 are at N % of computing capacity, thus underutilizing the amount of power available to the electrical load 114 (e.g., the server computers 115 could operate at more than N % utilization when the electrical load 114 is using “X” amperes), or the electrical load 114 may actually draw 1.3*X amperes when the server computers 115 are operating at N % utilization, thus consuming more than the “X” amperes allotted to the PMM 110 a (e.g., and trip an “X” ampere circuit breaker, and over-stress the branch conductor 108 a or the substation 106 ).
- the PMMs 107 , 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , and 118 b estimate the amounts of power their respective child nodes will draw for their respective utilizations, and compare those estimates to respective measured amounts of power that are drawn by their respective child nodes as they operate at those configured utilizations.
- the PMMs 107 , 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , and 118 b compare the estimated and measured power amounts to determine correlations between utilization levels and actual power consumption.
- the PMMs 107 , 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , and 118 b may then use the determined correlations when performing subsequent estimations of the power draws for various corresponding utilizations.
- PMMs 107 , 110 a and 110 b can be initially allocated 50 A each while the electrical load 114 is drawing 20 A, the electrical loads 120 a and 120 b are drawing 20 A each, and the PMMs 118 a and 118 b may be allocated 25 A apiece.
- the electrical load 120 a may need to be reconfigured to draw an estimated 40 A, exceeding the allocation given to the PMM 118 a .
- the PMM 118 a can request the PMM 118 b to limit its consumption by 5 A. If granted, the PMM 118 b can reduce its estimated power consumption to 20 A and the PMM 118 a can increase its own estimated power consumption to 30 A.
- the PMMs 118 a and 118 b have substantially maximized their use of the 50 A allocated to the PMM 110 b .
- the PMM 110 a can request an additional power allocation from the upstream PMM 110 b .
- the PMM 118 a can request an additional 10 A allocation from the PMM 110 b .
- the PMM 110 b is already configured to consume its allocated 50 A.
- the PMM 110 b can send a message to the PMM 110 a to determine if the PMM 110 a has any unused capacity that could be re-allocated to the PMM 110 b.
- the PMM 110 b may request a 10 A allocation from the PMM 110 a . Since the PMM 110 a has 30 A of excess capacity, the PMM 110 a may lower its own estimated power usage by 10 A and grant the freed capacity to the PMM 110 b . The PMM 110 b can then raise its estimated power use by 10 A to a total of 60 A, thereby satisfying the power needs of the electrical loads 120 a and 120 b , and increase the utilization of the 100 A available from the substation 106 . Additional examples of intelligent power estimation are discussed in further detail in relation to FIGS. 2-8 .
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram that shows an example of a system 200 for estimating the power draw of an electrical load 202 .
- the system 200 includes a power monitoring module (PMM) 204 .
- the PMM 204 can be the PMM 107 , 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , or 118 b of FIG. 1 .
- the PMM 204 includes a quota allocation module 206 .
- the quota allocation module 206 is communicatively connected to a parent control system 208 .
- the quota allocation module 206 communicates with the parent control system 208 to receive power allocation quotas.
- the parent control system 208 may determine that the PMM 204 is to be granted a 50 A allocation of power and communicate information about that allocation to the quota allocation module 206 .
- the PMM 118 a may receive a power allocation of “Y” amperes from its parent PMM 110 b.
- the quota allocation module 206 is communicatively connected to a measurement estimation correlation module 210 .
- the measurement estimate correlation module 210 is also communicatively connected to a current measurement module 220 .
- the current measurement module 220 measures the amount of power flowing from a power source 222 to the electrical load 202 through a circuit protection module 224 (e.g., a circuit breaker).
- the measurement estimate correlation module 210 communicates with the current measurement module 220 to receive information descriptive of the amount of power being consumed by the electrical load 202 .
- the measurement estimate correlation module 210 receives a nominal limit value 230 from the quota allocation module 206 , and determines an adjusted limit value 232 that is provided back to the quota allocation module 206 .
- the quota allocation module 206 then provides the adjusted limit value to a child control system 240 associated with the electrical load 202 .
- the adjusted limit value may also be provided to the parent control system 208 .
- the parent control system 208 may use the adjusted limit value to improve the accuracy of power allotments.
- the adjusted limit value is a value that the measurement estimate correlation module 210 estimates the child control system 240 will consume when operating in accordance with the adjusted limit value 232 .
- the child control system 240 may be an electrical load, such as a computer or collection of computers, e.g., the server computers 115 .
- the adjusted limit value 232 may be a utilization value that may limit or otherwise control the computing throughput of the server computers 121 a to control the amount of power consumed by the electrical load 120 a .
- the PMM 118 a may transmit the adjusted limit value 232 to the server computers 121 a to cause the electrical load 120 a to consume an estimated “Y” amperes.
- the child control system 240 may be another PMM.
- the adjusted limit value 232 may be an amperage limit that the downstream PMM is being requested to honor.
- the current measurement module 220 measures the actual amount of power being consumed by the electrical load 202 .
- the measurement estimate correlation module 210 compares the nominal limit value 230 , the adjusted limit value 232 , and the actual power consumption measurement provided by the current measurement module 220 to modify the estimated correlation between the nominal limit value 230 and adjusted limits to determine a new value for the adjusted limit value 232 .
- the new value for the adjusted limit value 232 is then provided by the quota allocation module 206 to the child control system 240 .
- the PMM 204 may determine improved adjusted limits that cause the electrical load 202 to consume power at levels that better adhere to respective nominal limits.
- FIG. 3 depicts an example peer-to-peer interaction 300 among a hierarchy of power monitoring modules (PMMs) 302 a - 302 f for the dynamic estimation of power draw of power nodes.
- the PMMs 302 a - 302 f can be the PMM 204 of FIG. 2 , or the PMMs 107 , 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , or 118 b o FIG. 1 .
- the function f can be different for different computers, e.g., the function f can depend on the components in the computer.
- function f can be described in a lookup table, or by a collection of mathematical formulae in which each formula estimates power consumption for a corresponding utilization subrange.
- the function f(P) may not be accurate due to limited measurement samples and workload varieties.
- the quota P given to a computer may not accurately represent the real available capacity due to the presence of other devices on the branch line such as routers, lighting, and cooling systems.
- the function f(P) may not accurately represent power drawn from a branch line, e.g., due to the presence of other devices on the branch line such as routers, lighting, and cooling systems.
- actual capacity often defined by the circuit breaker's hard limit (HL0) of the branch, can be converted to an adjusted capacity (HL1) which is distributable to computers.
- HL1 adjusted capacity
- a dynamic conversion of actual capacity to adjusted capacity can be performed in a three step process. An estimated power draw is calculated from utilization values. A functional relationship between the estimated power draw and the measured power draw is determined. The adjusted capacity is calculated based on the determined function using the actual capacity as the input.
- Parameter “a” generally compensates for proportional error between measured power draw and respective utilization-derived estimated power draw.
- Parameter “b” generally represents the constant power consumed by equipment but not included in a given aggregation path (e.g. networking equipment, lighting).
- the parameters “a” and “b” can be periodically updated to adjust for variations in the electrical loads 114 , 120 a , 120 b.
- parameters “a” and “b” can be determined from aggregated power estimates from the server computers and power drawn by the loads.
- the power drawn by the load is measured by the PMM at various different times, to create a plurality of measured power values “M′”.
- the estimated power drawn by the server computers is collected at various different times to create a plurality of measured utilization values “E′”.
- Each of these computers can report their estimated power draw Q to the PMM, and the PMM aggregates, e.g., sums, the estimated power Q from the individual server computers to generate an estimated power draw E′ for the server computers in the load.
- At least one estimated power value “E′” is associated with each of at least some of the plurality of measured power values “M′”, thereby generating a sequence of pairs of measured power values “M′” and estimated power values “E′”.
- a collection of servers may each estimate their own individual power values on a substantially periodic interval (e.g., every 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 30, 60 seconds) and provide those estimated power values V to the PMM from which the servers draw their power.
- the PMM may then combine those individual estimated values to determine the estimated power value “E′”, and compare that estimate to power values M′ that are measured by the PMM relatively less frequently (e.g., every 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 10 minutes). Due to potential higher sampling rate of the estimated power values E′, multiple values of E′ can be combined, e.g., averaged, to provide a single estimated power value E′ for a given measured power value M′.
- the values “a” and “b” can be calculated by fitting a function, e.g., a linear function, to the pairs of measured power values “M′” and estimated power values “E′”. In essence, the pairs of values (M′, E′) provide a scatter plot to which the function is fit.
- a function e.g., a linear function
- parameter “a” compensates for proportional error
- parameter “b” represents the constant power consumed by equipment plugged into the power hierarchy but not included in a given aggregation path, such as networking equipment, lighting, and/or other appropriate electrical loads that are substantially constant contributors to a measured aggregate electrical load.
- a collection of aggregated model-based estimates (E′) 322 is compared with a collection of actual readings (M′) 324 to determine values for the correlation value “b” and the proportional error value “a”.
- the PMM 302 c has gathered a collection of samples 320 during a recent time window by both aggregating updates from its child nodes (e.g., PMMs 302 d - 302 f ), and by communicating with the current measurement module 310 .
- the PMM 302 c determines the adjusted actual through which the 1.2 actual limit is converted to a 1.0 actual hard limit because the equation 330 projects that an estimated usage of 1.0 can lead to 1.2 actual measured power consumption.
- the current measurement module 310 may not be able to provide readings as fine-grained or time-synchronized as the model-based estimates.
- multiple estimates may be aggregated to correlate one or more measurement readings.
- the fitting may be determined such that the model substantially compensates for any time offset between the 2 time series.
- a graphical example of a linear model of estimated values fitted to a collection of measured values is discussed in the description of FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 4 is a graph 400 of example estimated power consumption and example measured power consumption.
- the graph 400 includes a line 410 which represents the ideal case, where measured values “M′” are equal to estimated values “E′”.
- the graph 400 also includes a collection of measured values 420 .
- the collection of measured values 420 a - 420 f are measured values “M′” for power consumption at selected estimated values “E′” for power consumption. For example, for a predetermined level of utilization of the server computers 115 , the estimated value “E′” of the electrical load's 114 power consumption may be “1.0”, however, the actual measured value “M′” 420 c may be “1.195”.
- a function e.g., a linear function, represented by a line 430
- a line 430 is fit to the collection of measured values 420 a - 420 c .
- a higher-order polynomial function can be used if a linear function does not fit sufficiently well.
- the determined solution represented by the line 430 may be used by the PMMs 110 b and 302 c to estimate the allocatable power capacity for the given actual limit.
- the determined solution represented by the line 430 may be used by the PMMs 107 , 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , 118 b , 204 , and 302 a - 302 f to estimate the actual power consumption of various electrical loads for given estimated power values.
- PMMs 107 , 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , 118 b , 204 , and 302 a - 302 f may use the determined solution as part of a process to determine utilization and/or other appropriate settings that may cause various electrical loads to consume a predetermined amount of electrical power.
- FIG. 5 is another graph 500 of example estimated power consumption and example measured power consumption over time.
- the graph 500 includes a sequence of measured power consumption values 510 a - 510 d .
- the graph 500 also includes a sequence including a collection of estimated power values 520 a , a collection of estimated power values 520 b , a collection of estimated power values 520 c , and a collection of estimated power values 520 d .
- the measured values 510 a - 510 d , and the values in the collections of estimated values 520 a - 520 d may include timestamps of when the different estimations and measurements were taken.
- Each of the collections of estimated values 520 a - 520 d represents multiple estimated power consumption values taken at various times for a corresponding one of the measured power consumption values 510 a - 510 d .
- estimated power consumption values may be taken multiple times because the estimates may often have higher frequency than then measurements.
- a single measured value may be determined for each of the collections of measured values 520 a - 520 d .
- an average value may be determined for each of the collections 520 a - 520 d.
- each of the collections of estimated values 520 a - 520 d may be associated with one of a collection of different times.
- each of the collections of estimated values 520 a - 520 d is associated with corresponding measured values 510 a - 510 d , taken at different times.
- a weighting process may be applied to determine a value to represent each of the collections of estimated values 520 a - 520 d .
- current consumption values that have been estimated at points in time close to when a measured midpoint value has been assigned may be given relatively greater mathematical weight than are values estimated at relatively more distant periods of time away from the measured value.
- a statistical normal curve 530 has been superimposed on the graph 500 and centered on a midpoint 532 when the measured value 510 b was assigned to an electrical load.
- the curve 530 represents one example type of weighting that may be used to determine the relative influences of the various values included in the collection 520 b (e.g., vertically higher points on the curve 530 represent relatively higher weightings for estimated values than points vertically lower on the curve 530 ).
- an estimated value 540 a is given a statistically greater weight than an estimated value 540 b because the value 540 a is time-wise closer to the measured value 510 b than the value 540 b.
- solutions for estimated power consumption values may be fitted to substantially only the measured power consumption values measured within a predetermined time period. For example, by limiting the fitting process to only consider values measured within a recent window of time, changes in the offset value “b” may be better accommodated (e.g., a cooling fan or light was turned on or off, a network switch was added to or removed from the measured electrical load).
- a time period 550 includes the estimated values 510 b and 510 c and the collections of measured values 520 b and 520 c , and as such, a model may be determined those values while ignoring values from beyond the time period 550 (e.g., values 510 a and 510 d , collections 520 a and 520 d ).

- An example fitting process is discussed in the description of FIG. 7 .
- a time “Ti” and the corresponding values of “a” and “b” that produce substantially the least error at time “Ti” are found.
- the region “R” is designated as extending from one time period prior to the time “Ti” to one time period after the time “Ti”.
- step 670 if the size of the region “R” is determined not to be less than a predetermined size “Delta”, then step 630 is repeated. If, however, at step 670 the size of the region “R” is determined to be less than a predetermined size “Delta”, then at step 680 the values for “a”, “b”, and “Ti” are returned.
- the process 700 may be performed by the PMMs 107 , 110 a , 110 b , 118 a , 118 b , 204 , and 302 a - 302 f of FIGS. 1-3 .
- the process 700 may be the fitting process performed as part of step 640 of FIG. 6 .
- the process 700 starts with a given collection of measured power consumption values “Mi”, a collection of estimated power consumption values “Ei”, and a time boundary value “Tj”.
- step 710 for each measured value “Mi” and corresponding time “Ti”, all corresponding pairs of “Ej” and “Tj” are found for when “Pj”, which equals the absolute value of “(Tj+D ⁇ Ti),” is less than a predetermined threshold value. “Ej” and “Tj” are aggregated to “Ei”, weighted by the mathematical function “1/(Pj+r)”.

- a function is fitted to pairs of actual power draw values and estimated power draw values (step 860 ).
- the actual power draw values and estimated power draw values are paired time-wise.
- the measured value 510 b may be paired with the estimated value 540 a because the estimated value 540 a is the estimated value that is the closest, time-wise of the collection of estimated values 520 b to the measured value 510 b .
- the measured power draw values may be paired with aggregate values that represents collections of time-wise close estimated values.

- the process 800 can also include steps for calculating an adjusted estimated current total power draw value from the estimated current total power draw value and the function, and comparing the adjusted estimated total power draw value to the maximum power draw value.
- the process 800 can also include a step for adjusting operation of at least one computer in the plurality of computers based on the comparison.
- the PMM 110 a may receive an allocation of “X” amperes that can be drawn from the substation 106 . To substantially maximize the usage of the allocated power, the PMM 110 a may determine a utilization level for the electrical load 114 that may cause the electrical load 114 to draw an estimated “X” amperes of current.
