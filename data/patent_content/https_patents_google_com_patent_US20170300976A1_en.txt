Definitions
- the disclosed subject matter relates to methods, systems, and media for language identification of a media content item based on comments.
- Video content from services having large collections of video content items. Frequently, these collections include video content that has been uploaded by users from various countries and that contains audio content and/or text content in a variety of languages. As such, video content may be served to users that are unlikely to comprehend the content. For some video content, it may be important for these services to present users with video content that contain audio and/or text content in a language that the user can comprehend.
- a method for language identification of media content comprising: obtaining a plurality of comments associated with a media content item; selecting a subset of the plurality of comments based on one or more criteria; assigning, for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, a vector of language probabilities, wherein each component of the vector is assigned a language probability that indicates the likelihood that the comment includes content in a language from a plurality of languages; combining the vector of language probabilities for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments to generate a combined language vector; identifying a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector; and performing an action based on the identified language.
- selecting the subset of the plurality of comments based on one or more criteria includes removing comments that do not meet a predetermined number of words or a predetermined number of characters.
- the method further comprises determining a length of each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, wherein the combined language vector is a weighted average of the language probabilities for each of the plurality of languages and across the subset of the plurality of comments that is weighted based on the determined length of each comment.
- the method further comprises determining a voting indication associated with each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, wherein the combined language vector is a weighted average of the language probabilities for each of the plurality of languages and across the subset of the plurality of comments that is weighted based on the determined voting indication.
- determining a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector further comprises augmenting the combined language vector with an additional vector of language probabilities corresponding to metadata associated with the media content item.
- determining a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector further comprises augmenting the combined language vector with media content item information.
- the media content item information includes a category of the media content item.
- performing the action further comprises presenting one or more related media content items in the identified language in response to presenting the media content item.
- performing the action further comprises: transmitting information corresponding to the identified language to an advertisement server; receiving, from the advertisement server, an advertisement that corresponds to the identified language; and causing the advertisement to be presented.
- performing the action further comprises: determining that a second media content item to be presented has a language identifier that is different than the identified language; and presenting subtitle information during the presentation of the second media content item, wherein the subtitle information is in the identified language.
- a system for language identification of media content comprising a hardware processor that is configured to: obtain a plurality of comments associated with a media content item; select a subset of the plurality of comments based on one or more criteria; assign, for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, a vector of language probabilities, wherein each component of the vector is assigned a language probability that indicates the likelihood that the comment includes content in a language from a plurality of languages; combine the vector of language probabilities for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments to generate a combined language vector; identify a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector; and perform an action based on the identified language.
- a non-transitory computer-readable medium containing computer executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method for language identification of media content
- the method comprising: obtaining a plurality of comments associated with a media content item; selecting a subset of the plurality of comments based on one or more criteria; assigning, for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, a vector of language probabilities, wherein each component of the vector is assigned a language probability that indicates the likelihood that the comment includes content in a language from a plurality of languages; combining the vector of language probabilities for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments to generate a combined language vector; identifying a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector; and performing an action based on the identified language.

- FIG. 1 shows an illustrative example of a user interface for presenting video content and comments associated with the presented video content in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram of an illustrative system suitable for implementation of the mechanisms described herein for language identification of a media content item based on comments in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 3 shows a detailed example of hardware that can be used in a server and/or a user device of FIG. 2 in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
- FIG. 4 shows an illustrative example of a process for determining the language of a media content item based on comments in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
- mechanisms (which can include methods, systems, and media) for language identification of a media content item based on comments are provided.
- the mechanisms described herein can retrieve comments that are associated with a media content item. These comments can be ranked and/or filtered in any suitable manner (e.g., by length, by popularity, by user engagement, by any other suitable manner, or any suitable combination thereof). For example, this can include filtering out comments that are less than five words or less than twenty characters in length (e.g., to remove short non-meaningful comments), filtering out automatically-generated comments (e.g., a “Shared on this Service” comment), filtering out comments that are longer than ten thousand characters in length (e.g., to remove machine-generated comments), and/or filtering out comments that include URLs and no text content.
- any suitable manner e.g., by length, by popularity, by user engagement, by any other suitable manner, or any suitable combination thereof. For example, this can include filtering out comments that are less than five words or less than twenty characters in length (e.g., to remove short non-meaningful comments), filtering out automatically-generated comments (e.g., a “Share
- the retrieved comments can include comments that are publicly accessible. It should also be noted that a comment can, in some instances, be deleted such that the comment is no longer associated with the media content item.
- the language identification mechanisms described herein can retrieve an updated set of comments (e.g., from a comments database associated with a media service) such that deleted comments are excluded from consideration.
- the mechanisms can generate a vector of probabilities for each of multiple languages for each comments. For each comment in the subset of selected comments, the mechanisms can, for example, generate a vector of probabilities, where each component of the vector is a probability that a given comment is in a particular language (e.g., one component of the vector can include a 0.5 probability score that the comment is in the Spanish language).
- the vectors for each of the comments in the subset of comments can be combined to generate a single vector of probabilities for each of multiple language in the subset of comments.
- Combining the vectors of language probabilities can include, for example, averaging the language probability scores for a particular language across the vectors for each comment to obtain a language score for a particular language that is placed in the single vector of language scores for the media content item across the subset of comments.
- one or more weights can be applied to the language probability scores in each vector. For example, when combining the vectors of probabilities for each of the comments, a weight can be applied that takes into account the length of the comment.
- the weight of the scores for each comment can be proportional to the length of the comment. As such, weights can be used to emphasize that longer comments can bear more weight on determining the language of the media content item.
- the mechanisms can determine a language to associate with the media content item. This can, for example, include selecting the language associated with the maximum score in the combined vector language probabilities after averaging across all of the comments in the subset of comments.
- a music video can be uploaded to a social media platform, a video provision service, or any other suitable service by a user that speaks English, and consequently has a title and/or other inputted metadata that is also in English, but contains audio content and text content that is in Spanish.
- these mechanisms can set a language identifier of the music video to the Spanish language.
- the language information derived from the comments associated with the media content item can be augmented or supplemented with additional information (e.g., description metadata, title metadata, upvotes associated with the media content item, user information, etc.) to determine the language associated with the media content item.
- additional information e.g., description metadata, title metadata, upvotes associated with the media content item, user information, etc.
- the mechanisms can perform additional actions using the determined language identifier. For example, the mechanisms can present recommendation interfaces that include additional media content items that also have the same language identifier (e.g., other music videos having the Spanish language identifier). In another example, the mechanisms can present search results that are responsive to a search query, where the search results have the same language identifier (e.g., video content having the Spanish language identifier). In yet another example, the mechanisms can transmit the language identifier to other sources to obtain additional content, such as advertising content (e.g., advertisements that are in Spanish). In a further example, the mechanisms can be used to provide subtitle information or other supplemental information in the determined language (e.g., Spanish subtitles for video content that is not in Spanish).
- the mechanisms can perform additional actions using the determined language identifier. For example, the mechanisms can present recommendation interfaces that include additional media content items that also have the same language identifier (e.g., other music videos having the Spanish language identifier). In another example, the mechanisms can present search results that are responsive to
- the mechanisms can use the language identifier associated with each of the media content items along with information relating to the user to present media content recommendations to the user associated with the user account. For example, in response to receiving an indication that the user of a media application prefers media content in a particular language (e.g., from a language preference indicator), the mechanisms can use the language identifier associated with each of the media content items to recommend and/or promote media content having a language identifier that matches the language preference indicator of the user. In another example, the mechanisms can determine information about the user (e.g., that the user speaks Spanish).
- Such information about the user can be determined by, for example, detecting that a user has accessed a media service using a user account and, in response to receiving affirmative consent to review user account information, access user account information (e.g., user language preferences).
- the mechanisms can recommend particular media content items to the user. For example, in response to determining that the user has entered search terms into a media searching interface, the mechanisms can obtain the search results that are responsive to the search terms and re-rank the search results using the associated language identifiers.
- search results having language identifiers that correspond to the information about the user e.g., videos with Spanish language identifiers for a user that speaks Spanish
- the mechanisms described herein generally relate to language identification of a video content item based on comments that have been provided in relation to that video content item
- the mechanisms can be used to identify a language of the content in any suitable type of media content, such as audio content (e.g., music, radio programs, audiobooks, and/or any other suitable type of audio content), television programs, movies, live streaming media content, electronic books, and/or any other suitable type of media content.

For example, process 400 can filter out comments from the retrieved set of comments that are less than a particular threshold length—e.g., less than a particular number of words (e.g., five words) or less than a particular number of characters (e.g., twenty characters).
- a particular threshold length e.g., less than a particular number of words (e.g., five words) or less than a particular number of characters (e.g., twenty characters).
- comments like “OK” or “MERCI” can be removed as unlikely to provide a language indicator for the associated media content item, where the comment like “OK” is generally used in many languages and the comment “MERCI” does not necessarily indicate that the commentator is capable of speaking Spanish.
- process 400 can determine that comment 122 contains twenty-four characters, comment 124 contains thirty-two characters, and comment 126 contains seven characters, and, upon applying a threshold value of at least twenty characters, process 400 can filter the comments by removing comment 126 and placing comments 122 and 124 into a subset of selected comments for analysis.
- process 400 can obtain user-generated comments by filtering out comments from the retrieved set of comments that are greater than a particular threshold length—e.g., greater than ten thousand characters in length. This type of filtering criterion can, for example, remove machine-generated comments that tend to be lengthy. In another example, process 400 can filter out comments that have been deemed abusive or moderated. In yet another example, process 400 can obtain user-generated comments by filtering out automatically-generated comments (e.g., a “Shared on this Service” comment or “Sent by my device” comment). In a further example, process 400 can filter out comments that substantially include or only include URLs and little to no text content.

- process 400 can select comments for placement in the subset of comments based at least in part on popularity information associated with each comment. For example, process 400 can select comments based on the number of upvotes (e.g., thumbs up), likes, and/or any other received indication of approval (e.g., the top ten comments based on number of upvotes). As another example, process 400 can select comments based on the total number of views of each comment (e.g., the top ten comments based on number of views). As yet another example, process 400 can select comments based on the number of sub-comments posted in connection with each comment.

- process 400 can select comments based
- process 400 can continue at 406 by assigning a vector of language probabilities for each comment in the subset of comments.
- Each vector of language probabilities for each comment can include multiple vector components, where each component includes a probability score that indicates the likelihood that the comment includes content that is in a particular language selected from multiple languages. It should be noted that the number of components can be based at least in part on the number of languages (e.g., five language components, one hundred language components, etc.).
- the vector of language probabilities for a comment C 1 can be represented as (L 1 , L 2 , . . . , L i ), where each L i is a probability score that comment C 1 includes content that is in language i.
- Such a vector can be generated for each comment in the subset of selected comments.

- process 400 can analyze each comment and return a probability score for each language that the machine language classifier is trained to detect (e.g., five languages, one hundred languages, etc.).
- process 400 can, for a subset of ranked comments (e.g., the top N ranked comments based on length and popularity), use a machine learning language classifier to determine a language probability score for each of a set of known languages. For example, process 400 can determine, for comment 122 , that the Spanish language probability score is 0.8, that the English language probability score is 0.1, and that the French language probability score is 0.05, and that the Japanese language probability score is 0.05. In such an example, process 500 can generate a language probability vector L of [0.8, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05].
- process 400 can further filter the subset of comments by removing that comment for language identification and/or use in training dataset. This can, for example, filter out comments that include content in a rare language and/or comments that include non-text content (such as emoticons).
- process 400 can continue at 408 by combining the vectors of language probabilities to generate a single vector for the media content item (e.g., the video shown in FIG. 1 ).
- Combining the vectors of language probabilities can include, for example, averaging the language probability scores for a particular language across the vectors for each comment to obtain a language score for a particular language that is placed in the single vector of language scores for the media content item across the subset of comments.
- this combination of vectors can be based on any suitable weight applied to the vector of language probabilities for each comment. For example, if comment C 1 is represented as (L 11 , L 12 , . . . , L 1n ) and comment C 2 is represented as (L 21 , L 22 , . . . , L 2n ), where n is the number of languages, a weight w can be used to combine the vector for comment C 1 and comment C 2 .
- This weighted average can be represented as (w 1 /(w 1 +w 2 ))*L 11 +(w 2 /(w 1 +w 2 ))*L 21 , (w 1 /(w 1 +w 2 ))*L 12 +(w 2 /(w 1 +w 2 ))*L 22 , and so on, where w 1 is the weight for comment C 1 and w 2 is the weight for comment C 2 .
- the weight can be any suitable weight, such as the length of each comment, the number of upvotes associated with each comment, etc.
- the weight can be based on the length of each comment, such as the number of words in a comment or the number of characters in a comment.
- the language probability scores in a vector for longer comments having a greater number of words or a greater number of characters can be weighted higher than the language probability scores in a vector for shorter comments.
- the length m for each comment can be determined and used to combine the vectors of language probabilities, which can be represented as (m 1 /(m 1 +m 2 ))*L 11 +(m 2 /(m 1 +m 2 ))*L 21 , (m 1 /(m 1 +m 2 ))*L 12 +(m 2 /(m 1 +m 2 ))*L 22 , and so on, where m 1 is the length of comment C 1 and m 2 is the length of comment C 2 .
- m 1 is the length of comment C 1
- m 2 is the length of comment C 2 .
- the language probability scores in the vector representing comment 124 can be weighted more heavily than the language probability scores in the vector representing comment 122 , which can be weighted more heavily than the language probability scores in the vector representing comment 126 .
- process 400 can generate a vector of weighted average language scores across the subset of selected comments for the media content item. That is, when averaging language probability scores, the weight of the language probability scores for each comment is proportional to the length of that comment. This can, for example, generate a vector of sparse continuous features that represent the weighted average scores across the subset of selected comments of the media content item.
- the weight can be based on other information relating to each comment, such as popularity information associated with each comment.
- Popularity information can include, for example, the number of upvotes (e.g., thumbs up), likes, and/or any other received indication of approval.
- the language probability scores in a vector for comments that received a greater number of upvotes can be weighted higher than the language probability scores in a vector for shorter comments.
- the number of upvotes v for each comment can be determined and used to combine the vectors of language probabilities, which can be represented as (v 1 /(v 1 +v 2 ))*L 11 +(v 2 /(v 1 +v 2 ))*L 21 , (v 1 /(v 1 +v 2 ))*L 12 +(v 2 /(v 1 +v 2 ))*L 22 , and so on, where v 1 is the number of upvotes received for comment C 1 and v 2 is the number of upvotes received for comment C 2 .
- additional information relating to each comment can be used to weight the language probability scores in the vector associated with each comment.
- the language probability scores in the vector for each comment can be weighted based on the total number of views of each comment.
- the language probability scores in the vector for each comment can be weighted based on the number of sub-comments posted in connection with each comment.
- Process 400 can continue at 410 by determining a language associated with the media content item based at least in part on the combined vector of language probability scores.

- process 400 can determine which language in the combined vector received the maximum language score when averaged across the selected subset of comments associated with the media content item.
- process 400 can associate the media content item with a language identifier that identifies the language having the maximum language score in the combined vector of language probability scores.
- process 400 can use the maximum language score, the full language probabilities vector, and/or additional features from the combined vector of language probability scores across the subset of selected comments associated with the media content item along with additional indicators to determine the language of the media content item.
- these additional indicators can include analyzing the metadata associated with the media content item.
- process 400 can generate a vector for information associated with the media content item, such as the title metadata associated with the media content item and the description metadata associated with the media content item.
- text content in the title metadata and the description metadata associated with the media content item can be filtered to remove particular words (e.g., words deemed to be machine-generated, auto-generated, or otherwise non-meaningful) or particular characters (e.g., unidentifiable characters).
- the selected portions of the title metadata and/or description metadata can be classified by one of the machine language classifiers described above to return a vector of language probabilities for the title metadata and/or a vector of language probabilities for the description metadata.
- These additional vectors can be combined or otherwise used in connection with the vectors of language probabilities for the subset of selected comments to determine the language associated with the media content item.
- these additional indicators can also include a category associated with the media content item.
- process 400 can determine that the media content item is associated with a particular category, such as a NEWS category, a SPORTS category, a MOVIE category, a GAMING category, etc.
- process 400 can use the category information as an indicator of whether the media content item is likely to include content that is in one language or is likely to include content that is in multiple languages. In this example, this can allow process 400 to predict that a video content item in the MOVIE category is likely to have only one language associated with the video content item, while a video content item in the GAMING category is likely to include audio content that is in multiple languages.
- This category indicator along with the vectors described above can be used to determine the language associated with the media content item.

- these additional information can include statistical information relating to the media content item.
- the mean and standard deviation of the number of upvotes for the comments associated with the media content item can be used as an additional feature that is augmented with the combined vector of language probability scores for the subset of comments described above.
- a high standard deviation of the number of upvotes for the comments associated with the media content item can indicate a lesser confidence in the comments-based language identification in that there are a number of noisy comments that have received little to no upvotes, while a small standard deviation and a high mean of the number of upvotes for the comments associated with the media content item can be used as a confidence indicator for the combined vector of language probability scores.
- the mean and standard deviation of the length of the comments associated with the media content item can be used as an additional feature that is augmented with the combined vector of language probability scores for the subset of comments described above.
- the mean length of the comments associated with the media content item is relatively small (thus, encountering only short comments having less than a particular number of words or characters), this can be used as a confidence indicator for the combined vector of language probability scores in that it may be difficult to assign a language to the media content item.
- any suitable combination of language-related features and media content-related features can be used to determine the language of a media content item.
- process 400 can continue at 412 by performing any suitable action based on the language that has been determined for the media content item, such as recommending a related video or an additional media content item having the same language identifier as the media content item, presenting an advertisement having the same language identifier as the media content item, determining search results responsive to a search query where the search results have the same language identifier as the media content item, any other suitable action, and/or any suitable combination thereof.

Abstract
Description
- This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/322,685, filed Apr. 14, 2016, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- The disclosed subject matter relates to methods, systems, and media for language identification of a media content item based on comments.
- Many users access video content from services having large collections of video content items. Frequently, these collections include video content that has been uploaded by users from various countries and that contains audio content and/or text content in a variety of languages. As such, video content may be served to users that are unlikely to comprehend the content. For some video content, it may be important for these services to present users with video content that contain audio and/or text content in a language that the user can comprehend.
- These services, however, often rely on information that may or may not correctly identify a language used in the video content, such as information in metadata or information provided by a user that uploaded the video content. Moreover, in many instances, the language associated with the video content has not been indicated by the user that uploaded the video content. Techniques, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), may sometimes be used to determine a language of the video content. Such recognition techniques, however, are not supported for all languages and have problems with background music, noise and multi-party conversations, etc. in the video content. Thus, it is difficult to identify the language of video content.
- Accordingly, it is desirable to provide new methods, systems, and media for language identification of a media content item based on comments.
- In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, mechanisms for language identification of a media content item based on comments are provided.
- In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a method for language identification of media content is provided, the method comprising: obtaining a plurality of comments associated with a media content item; selecting a subset of the plurality of comments based on one or more criteria; assigning, for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, a vector of language probabilities, wherein each component of the vector is assigned a language probability that indicates the likelihood that the comment includes content in a language from a plurality of languages; combining the vector of language probabilities for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments to generate a combined language vector; identifying a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector; and performing an action based on the identified language.
- In some embodiments, selecting the subset of the plurality of comments based on one or more criteria includes removing comments that do not meet a predetermined number of words or a predetermined number of characters.
- In some embodiments, the method further comprises determining a length of each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, wherein the combined language vector is a weighted average of the language probabilities for each of the plurality of languages and across the subset of the plurality of comments that is weighted based on the determined length of each comment.
- In some embodiments, the method further comprises determining a voting indication associated with each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, wherein the combined language vector is a weighted average of the language probabilities for each of the plurality of languages and across the subset of the plurality of comments that is weighted based on the determined voting indication.
- In some embodiments, determining a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector further comprises augmenting the combined language vector with an additional vector of language probabilities corresponding to metadata associated with the media content item.
- In some embodiments, determining a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector further comprises augmenting the combined language vector with media content item information. In some embodiments, the media content item information includes a category of the media content item.
- In some embodiments, performing the action further comprises presenting one or more related media content items in the identified language in response to presenting the media content item.
- In some embodiments, performing the action further comprises: transmitting information corresponding to the identified language to an advertisement server; receiving, from the advertisement server, an advertisement that corresponds to the identified language; and causing the advertisement to be presented.
- In some embodiments, performing the action further comprises: determining that a second media content item to be presented has a language identifier that is different than the identified language; and presenting subtitle information during the presentation of the second media content item, wherein the subtitle information is in the identified language.
- In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a system for language identification of media content is provided, the system comprising a hardware processor that is configured to: obtain a plurality of comments associated with a media content item; select a subset of the plurality of comments based on one or more criteria; assign, for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, a vector of language probabilities, wherein each component of the vector is assigned a language probability that indicates the likelihood that the comment includes content in a language from a plurality of languages; combine the vector of language probabilities for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments to generate a combined language vector; identify a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector; and perform an action based on the identified language.
- In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a non-transitory computer-readable medium containing computer executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method for language identification of media content is provided, the method comprising: obtaining a plurality of comments associated with a media content item; selecting a subset of the plurality of comments based on one or more criteria; assigning, for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, a vector of language probabilities, wherein each component of the vector is assigned a language probability that indicates the likelihood that the comment includes content in a language from a plurality of languages; combining the vector of language probabilities for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments to generate a combined language vector; identifying a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector; and performing an action based on the identified language.
- In accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter, a system for language identification of media content is provided, the system comprising: means for obtaining a plurality of comments associated with a media content item; means for selecting a subset of the plurality of comments based on one or more criteria; means for assigning, for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments, a vector of language probabilities, wherein each component of the vector is assigned a language probability that indicates the likelihood that the comment includes content in a language from a plurality of languages; means for combining the vector of language probabilities for each comment in the subset of the plurality of comments to generate a combined language vector; means for identifying a language associated with the media content item based on the combined language vector; and means for performing an action based on the identified language.
- Various objects, features, and advantages of the disclosed subject matter can be more fully appreciated with reference to the following detailed description of the disclosed subject matter when considered in connection with the following drawings, in which like reference numerals identify like elements.
-
FIG. 1 shows an illustrative example of a user interface for presenting video content and comments associated with the presented video content in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. -
FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram of an illustrative system suitable for implementation of the mechanisms described herein for language identification of a media content item based on comments in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. -
FIG. 3 shows a detailed example of hardware that can be used in a server and/or a user device ofFIG. 2 in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. -
FIG. 4 shows an illustrative example of a process for determining the language of a media content item based on comments in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. - In accordance with various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, mechanisms (which can include methods, systems, and media) for language identification of a media content item based on comments are provided.
- In some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, the mechanisms described herein can retrieve comments that are associated with a media content item. These comments can be ranked and/or filtered in any suitable manner (e.g., by length, by popularity, by user engagement, by any other suitable manner, or any suitable combination thereof). For example, this can include filtering out comments that are less than five words or less than twenty characters in length (e.g., to remove short non-meaningful comments), filtering out automatically-generated comments (e.g., a “Shared on this Service” comment), filtering out comments that are longer than ten thousand characters in length (e.g., to remove machine-generated comments), and/or filtering out comments that include URLs and no text content.
- It should be noted that the retrieved comments can include comments that are publicly accessible. It should also be noted that a comment can, in some instances, be deleted such that the comment is no longer associated with the media content item. The language identification mechanisms described herein can retrieve an updated set of comments (e.g., from a comments database associated with a media service) such that deleted comments are excluded from consideration.
- Upon selecting a subset of comments, the mechanisms can generate a vector of probabilities for each of multiple languages for each comments. For each comment in the subset of selected comments, the mechanisms can, for example, generate a vector of probabilities, where each component of the vector is a probability that a given comment is in a particular language (e.g., one component of the vector can include a 0.5 probability score that the comment is in the Spanish language).
- In some embodiments, the vectors for each of the comments in the subset of comments can be combined to generate a single vector of probabilities for each of multiple language in the subset of comments. Combining the vectors of language probabilities can include, for example, averaging the language probability scores for a particular language across the vectors for each comment to obtain a language score for a particular language that is placed in the single vector of language scores for the media content item across the subset of comments. It should be noted that, in some embodiments, when combining the vectors of language probabilities, one or more weights can be applied to the language probability scores in each vector. For example, when combining the vectors of probabilities for each of the comments, a weight can be applied that takes into account the length of the comment. In a more particular example, when determining a weighted average language score for the set of comments, the weight of the scores for each comment can be proportional to the length of the comment. As such, weights can be used to emphasize that longer comments can bear more weight on determining the language of the media content item.
- In response to generating a combined vector of language probabilities for the subset of comments associated with a media content item, the mechanisms can determine a language to associate with the media content item. This can, for example, include selecting the language associated with the maximum score in the combined vector language probabilities after averaging across all of the comments in the subset of comments.
- For example, a music video can be uploaded to a social media platform, a video provision service, or any other suitable service by a user that speaks English, and consequently has a title and/or other inputted metadata that is also in English, but contains audio content and text content that is in Spanish. In response to generating a vector of language probabilities for each comment associated with the music video, combining the vectors for each of the comments to generate a single vector across the comments, and determining which component of the single vector has the highest score (e.g., the component that corresponds to the Spanish language), these mechanisms can set a language identifier of the music video to the Spanish language.
- It should be noted that, in some embodiments, the language information derived from the comments associated with the media content item can be augmented or supplemented with additional information (e.g., description metadata, title metadata, upvotes associated with the media content item, user information, etc.) to determine the language associated with the media content item.
- In some embodiments, upon associating a language identifier with the media content item (e.g., that the music video contains content that is in the Spanish language), the mechanisms can perform additional actions using the determined language identifier. For example, the mechanisms can present recommendation interfaces that include additional media content items that also have the same language identifier (e.g., other music videos having the Spanish language identifier). In another example, the mechanisms can present search results that are responsive to a search query, where the search results have the same language identifier (e.g., video content having the Spanish language identifier). In yet another example, the mechanisms can transmit the language identifier to other sources to obtain additional content, such as advertising content (e.g., advertisements that are in Spanish). In a further example, the mechanisms can be used to provide subtitle information or other supplemental information in the determined language (e.g., Spanish subtitles for video content that is not in Spanish).
- In some embodiments, upon performing the comment-based language identification on multiple media content items (e.g., each of the videos in a video database), the mechanisms can use the language identifier associated with each of the media content items along with information relating to the user to present media content recommendations to the user associated with the user account. For example, in response to receiving an indication that the user of a media application prefers media content in a particular language (e.g., from a language preference indicator), the mechanisms can use the language identifier associated with each of the media content items to recommend and/or promote media content having a language identifier that matches the language preference indicator of the user. In another example, the mechanisms can determine information about the user (e.g., that the user speaks Spanish). Such information about the user can be determined by, for example, detecting that a user has accessed a media service using a user account and, in response to receiving affirmative consent to review user account information, access user account information (e.g., user language preferences). In response to determining this information about the user, the mechanisms can recommend particular media content items to the user. For example, in response to determining that the user has entered search terms into a media searching interface, the mechanisms can obtain the search results that are responsive to the search terms and re-rank the search results using the associated language identifiers. In continuing this example, search results having language identifiers that correspond to the information about the user (e.g., videos with Spanish language identifiers for a user that speaks Spanish) can be promoted to the top of a list of recommended media content items.
- It should be noted that, although the mechanisms described herein generally relate to language identification of a video content item based on comments that have been provided in relation to that video content item, the mechanisms can be used to identify a language of the content in any suitable type of media content, such as audio content (e.g., music, radio programs, audiobooks, and/or any other suitable type of audio content), television programs, movies, live streaming media content, electronic books, and/or any other suitable type of media content.
- Turning to
FIG. 1 , an example 100 of a user interface for presenting a media content item and comments is illustrated in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. As illustrated, in some embodiments,user interface 100 can include avideo display element 110, avideo content item 112, asearch element 114, comments 122, 124, and 126 which are associated withuser representation identifiers metadata 128. -
Video display element 110 can be any suitable video display element. In some embodiments, video display element can be configured to display any suitable video format, such as FLASH, AVI, MP4, and/or any other suitable video format. In some embodiments,video display element 110 can presentvideo content item 112 in a video player window which can include any suitable controls, such as a pause control, a volume control, rewind and/or fast-forward controls, and/or any other suitable controls. - Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,
user interface 100 can be configured to include any suitable type of media player. For example,user interface 100 can include a media player suitable for playing audio files, image files, any other suitable media content items, and/or any suitable combination thereof. -
Video content item 112 can be any suitable video content item. In some embodiments,video content item 112 can include verbal content and/or textual content in any suitable language. For example,video content item 112 can be a video that includes verbal content and/or textual content in English. In another example,video content item 112 can be a video that includes content in multiple languages, such as verbal content in Spanish and textual content in English. It should be noted that, in some embodiments,video content item 112 may include no verbal content and/or no textual content (such as silent videos). -
Comments FIG. 1 , each of thecomments media content item 112 or a portion ofmedia content item 112. In another more particular example, the comments can include one or more posts written and submitted by a user associated with a social media platform that is visible by one or more users having an established relationship with the user via the social media platform. In such an example, the post on a social media platform can include commentary that references or includesmedia content item 112. In yet another more particular example, the comments can be aggregated or otherwise obtained from multiple sources, such as comments relating tomedia content item 112 that are received from users via commenting functionality associated with a browsing application installed on a client device, comments relating tomedia content item 112 that are received from users associated with a social media platform or any other suitable sharing service, etc. - In some embodiments, each of
comments FIG. 1 , comments 122, 124, and 126 can be associated with user accounts that are identified byrepresentations representations comments comments - In a more particular example, a record for each of these comments in a comments database can include a comment identifier that identifies the comment itself, an author identifier that identifies a user account associated with a user or a group of users, a representation of the author that created, modified, and/or posted the comment (e.g.,
representations FIG. 1 and are described herein, any suitable number (e.g., one, two, four, ten, and/or any other suitable number) of comments can be included. - It should be noted that, comments, such as
comments FIG. 1 , comments 122 and 124 include textual content that is in Spanish whilecomment 126 includes textual content that is in English. In another example, comments can include textual content that is in multiple languages (e.g., a text post that is written in both English and Spanish). In yet another example, comments can include textual content that is in one language and image data that includes content in another language. - In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can determine language probability scores of the comments associated with a media content item and associate the media content item with a language identifier based on the language probability scores of the comments. For example, as illustrated in
FIG. 1 , the mechanisms can generate a vector of language probabilities forcomments comments comment 126 and the English language component of the vector forcomment 126 has a greater score than the English language components of the vectors forcomments comments media content item 112 with a language identifier that identifies the language of the media content item as the Spanish language. It should be noted that the language information derived from the single vector can also be used with additional indicators (e.g., title metadata, description metadata, user account information, etc.) to determine a language associated withmedia content item 112. - In continuing with this example, upon associating the media content item with a language identifier that identifies the language of the media content item as the Spanish language, the mechanisms can perform any suitable action, such as present other media content items having the same language identifier (e.g., in response to requesting a recommendation for additional media content items, in response to entering a search query into
search element 114 ofFIG. 1 , etc.), present an advertisement in the same language as the language identifier associated with the media content item (e.g., a video advertisement presented invideo display element 110 before, during, or after the presentation of media content item 112), etc. - Turning to
FIG. 2 , an example 200 of hardware that can be used in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter for language identification of a media content item based on comments is shown.

Communication network 210 can be any suitable combination of one or more wired and/or wireless networks in some embodiments. For example,communication network 210 can include any one or more of the Internet, an intranet, a wide-area network (WAN), a local-area network (LAN), a wireless network, a digital subscriber line (DSL) network, a frame relay network, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, a virtual private network (VPN), and/or any other suitable communication network.User devices 212 can be connected by one ormore communications links 218 tocommunication network 210 which can be linked via one or more communications links (e.g.,communications links 220 and/or 222) tocontent server 202, application anddata server 204, advertisement server 206, and payment server 208.Communications links user devices 212 andservers 202 and/or 204 such as network links, dial-up links, wireless links, hard-wired links, any other suitable communications links, or any suitable combination of such links. -
User devices 212 can include any one or more user devices suitable for requesting media content, searching for media content, presenting media content, presenting advertisements, receiving input for playing media content and/or any other suitable functions. For example, in some embodiments, auser device 212 can be implemented as a mobile device, such as a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a vehicle (e.g., a car, a boat, an airplane, or any other suitable vehicle) entertainment system, a portable media player, and/or any other suitable mobile device. As another example, in some embodiments, auser device 212 can be implemented as a non-mobile device such as a desktop computer, a set-top box, a television, a streaming media player, a game console, and/or any other suitable non-mobile device. - Although

FIG. 4 , an example 400 of a process for language identification of a media content item based on comments is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. In some embodiments,process 400 can be executed by any device or combination of devices. For example, with reference toFIG. 2 ,process 400 can be executed bycontent server 202,data server 204, and/oruser device 212. - In some embodiments,
process 400 can begin at 402 by retrieving comments associated with a media content item using any suitable techniques or combination of techniques. For example, comments that are associated with a media content item (e.g.,video 112 inFIG. 1 ) can be received at a server device (e.g.,server device 202, as described above in connection withFIG. 2 ) when submitted by a user of a user device (e.g.,user device 204 as described above in connection withFIG. 2 ). In such an example,process 400 can access, request, and/or retrieve the comments from the server device. In a more particular example, in response to transmitting a request that includes a media content identifier that identifies the media content item or a portion of the media content item, the server device can access comment and associated comment information from a comments database. The comment information from the comments database can include a comment identifier that identifies the comment, an author identifier that identifies a user account associated with a user or a group of users, a representation of the author that created, modified, and/or posted the comment (e.g.,representations process 400 can access, request, and/or retrieve the comments associated with the media content item concurrently with the metadata associated with the media content item (e.g., the title of the media content item, a description of the media content item, the content creator of the media content item, etc.). - It should be noted that the retrieved comments can include user-generated comments that are publicly accessible. For example, a privacy indicator can indicate that a comment was posted publicly such that the comment is accessible by users not having a particular relationship with the user that provided the comment. It should also be noted that a comment can, in some instances, be deleted such that the comment is no longer associated with the media content item. The language identification mechanisms described herein can transmit a request that retrieves an updated set of comments (e.g., from the comments database) such that deleted comments are excluded from consideration.
- It should be noted that the media content item can be a publicly accessible media content item. For example, a privacy indicator can indicate that a video content item was uploaded to a video sharing service in which the video content item is accessible by users not having a particular relationship with the user that uploaded the video content item. In another example,
process 400 can determine that the video content item uploaded by the user was not associated with particular access controls (e.g., only viewable by users in a particular social circle, only viewable by a particular user, etc.). - In some embodiments,
process 400 can select a subset of comments from the retrieved comments at 404 using any suitable technique or combination of techniques, and using any suitable information or combination of information. - In some embodiments,
process 400 can select a subset of comments by filtering out comments based on particular criterion. For example,process 400 can filter out comments from the retrieved set of comments that are less than a particular threshold length—e.g., less than a particular number of words (e.g., five words) or less than a particular number of characters (e.g., twenty characters). In this example, comments like “OK” or “MERCI” can be removed as unlikely to provide a language indicator for the associated media content item, where the comment like “OK” is generally used in many languages and the comment “MERCI” does not necessarily indicate that the commentator is capable of speaking Spanish. As such, filtering by the length of the comment can, for example, remove short and, in some instances, non-meaningful comments from consideration. In a more particular example, referring back toFIG. 1 ,process 400 can determine thatcomment 122 contains twenty-four characters, comment 124 contains thirty-two characters, and comment 126 contains seven characters, and, upon applying a threshold value of at least twenty characters,process 400 can filter the comments by removingcomment 126 and placingcomments - Similarly,
process 400 can obtain user-generated comments by filtering out comments from the retrieved set of comments that are greater than a particular threshold length—e.g., greater than ten thousand characters in length. This type of filtering criterion can, for example, remove machine-generated comments that tend to be lengthy. In another example,process 400 can filter out comments that have been deemed abusive or moderated. In yet another example,process 400 can obtain user-generated comments by filtering out automatically-generated comments (e.g., a “Shared on this Service” comment or “Sent by my device” comment). In a further example,process 400 can filter out comments that substantially include or only include URLs and little to no text content. - It should be noted that any suitable filtering criterion or filtering rules for removing comments from consideration can be used.
- Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,
process 400 can select comments for placement in the subset of comments based at least in part on user information associated with each comment. For example,process 400 can select comments based on information contained in a user profile or a user account associated with each comment. In a more particular example,process 400 can select comments from the set of retrieved comments based on the number of other comments made by or associated with the user account, a number of followers associated with the user account that made the comment, whether the user account is verified, whether the user account is a member of a group of users associated with the media content item (e.g., if a media content item has been posted or uploaded by a member of a group and the user account corresponding to the comment is also a member of the group), whether the user account is associated with the source of video (e.g., if a media content item has been posted or uploaded by a user account that is a follower or subscriber of the user account associated with the comment), any other information associated with a user account, and/or any suitable combination thereof. - It should be noted that, prior to retrieving comments associated with a media content item and prior to accessing user account information, these mechanisms can provide a user with an opportunity to provide affirmative consent and/or authorization to access and analyze comment information and user account information, such as receiving user historical information (e.g., browsing history, commenting history, etc.) and/or user preferences. For example, upon loading an application for playing media content on a computing device, such as a mobile device, such an application can prompt the user to provide the consent and/or authorization. In a more particular example, in response to downloading the application for playing media content and loading the application on the computing device, the user can be prompted with a message that requests (or requires) that the user provide consent and/or authorization for the mechanisms to access and/or analyze user account information.
- Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,
process 400 can select comments for placement in the subset of comments based at least in part on popularity information associated with each comment. For example,process 400 can select comments based on the number of upvotes (e.g., thumbs up), likes, and/or any other received indication of approval (e.g., the top ten comments based on number of upvotes). As another example,process 400 can select comments based on the total number of views of each comment (e.g., the top ten comments based on number of views). As yet another example,process 400 can select comments based on the number of sub-comments posted in connection with each comment. - Referring back to
FIG. 4 ,process 400 can continue at 406 by assigning a vector of language probabilities for each comment in the subset of comments. Each vector of language probabilities for each comment can include multiple vector components, where each component includes a probability score that indicates the likelihood that the comment includes content that is in a particular language selected from multiple languages. It should be noted that the number of components can be based at least in part on the number of languages (e.g., five language components, one hundred language components, etc.). - For example, the vector of language probabilities for a comment C1 can be represented as (L1, L2, . . . , Li), where each Li is a probability score that comment C1 includes content that is in language i. Such a vector can be generated for each comment in the subset of selected comments.
- In a more particular example,
process 400 can classify each comment in the subset of comments using a machine language classifier, such as a naïve Bayes classifier, a maximum entropy classifier, a random forest classifier, any other language identification technique, and/or any suitable combination thereof. Using such a machine language classifier,process 400 can analyze each comment and return a probability score for each language that the machine language classifier is trained to detect (e.g., five languages, one hundred languages, etc.). - In connection with
FIG. 1 ,process 400 can, for a subset of ranked comments (e.g., the top N ranked comments based on length and popularity), use a machine learning language classifier to determine a language probability score for each of a set of known languages. For example,process 400 can determine, forcomment 122, that the Spanish language probability score is 0.8, that the English language probability score is 0.1, and that the French language probability score is 0.05, and that the Japanese language probability score is 0.05. In such an example, process 500 can generate a language probability vector L of [0.8, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05]. - It should be noted that, in response to the machine language classifier failing to identify a language of a comment,
process 400 can further filter the subset of comments by removing that comment for language identification and/or use in training dataset. This can, for example, filter out comments that include content in a rare language and/or comments that include non-text content (such as emoticons). - Referring back to
FIG. 4 , upon obtaining vectors of language probabilities for each of the subset of comments,process 400 can continue at 408 by combining the vectors of language probabilities to generate a single vector for the media content item (e.g., the video shown inFIG. 1 ). Combining the vectors of language probabilities can include, for example, averaging the language probability scores for a particular language across the vectors for each comment to obtain a language score for a particular language that is placed in the single vector of language scores for the media content item across the subset of comments. - In some embodiments, this combination of vectors can be based on any suitable weight applied to the vector of language probabilities for each comment. For example, if comment C1 is represented as (L11, L12, . . . , L1n) and comment C2 is represented as (L21, L22, . . . , L2n), where n is the number of languages, a weight w can be used to combine the vector for comment C1 and comment C2. This weighted average can be represented as (w1/(w1+w2))*L11+(w2/(w1+w2))*L21, (w1/(w1+w2))*L12+(w2/(w1+w2))*L22, and so on, where w1 is the weight for comment C1 and w2 is the weight for comment C2. As described herein, the weight can be any suitable weight, such as the length of each comment, the number of upvotes associated with each comment, etc.
- In some embodiments, the weight can be based on the length of each comment, such as the number of words in a comment or the number of characters in a comment. In this example, the language probability scores in a vector for longer comments having a greater number of words or a greater number of characters can be weighted higher than the language probability scores in a vector for shorter comments. For example, the length m for each comment can be determined and used to combine the vectors of language probabilities, which can be represented as (m1/(m1+m2))*L11+(m2/(m1+m2))*L21, (m1/(m1+m2))*L12+(m2/(m1+m2))*L22, and so on, where m1 is the length of comment C1 and m2 is the length of comment C2. In a more particular example, referring back to
FIG. 1 , in response to determining thatcomment 122 has a length of five words, comment 124 has a length of six words, and comment 126 has a length of one word in the subset of selected comments associated withmedia content item 112, the language probability scores in thevector representing comment 124 can be weighted more heavily than the language probability scores in thevector representing comment 122, which can be weighted more heavily than the language probability scores in thevector representing comment 126. - Accordingly, upon weighing the language probability scores for each comment by the length of that comment,
process 400 can generate a vector of weighted average language scores across the subset of selected comments for the media content item. That is, when averaging language probability scores, the weight of the language probability scores for each comment is proportional to the length of that comment. This can, for example, generate a vector of sparse continuous features that represent the weighted average scores across the subset of selected comments of the media content item. - In some embodiments, the weight can be based on other information relating to each comment, such as popularity information associated with each comment. Popularity information can include, for example, the number of upvotes (e.g., thumbs up), likes, and/or any other received indication of approval. In this example, the language probability scores in a vector for comments that received a greater number of upvotes can be weighted higher than the language probability scores in a vector for shorter comments. For example, the number of upvotes v for each comment can be determined and used to combine the vectors of language probabilities, which can be represented as (v1/(v1+v2))*L11+(v2/(v1+v2))*L21, (v1/(v1+v2))*L12+(v2/(v1+v2))*L22, and so on, where v1 is the number of upvotes received for comment C1 and v2 is the number of upvotes received for comment C2.
- In some embodiments, additional information relating to each comment can be used to weight the language probability scores in the vector associated with each comment. For example, the language probability scores in the vector for each comment can be weighted based on the total number of views of each comment. In another example, the language probability scores in the vector for each comment can be weighted based on the number of sub-comments posted in connection with each comment.
-
Process 400 can continue at 410 by determining a language associated with the media content item based at least in part on the combined vector of language probability scores. In some embodiments,process 400 can determine the language associated with the media content item by determining the language in the combined vector of language probability scores has the maximum or highest language probability score. In continuing the example described above in which the language probability scores for each comment are weighted by the length of that comment,process 400 can determine which language in the combined vector received the maximum language score when averaged across the selected subset of comments associated with the media content item. - In a more particular example,
process 400 can associate the media content item with a language identifier that identifies the language having the maximum language score in the combined vector of language probability scores. - In some embodiments, prior to determining a language associated with the media content item,
process 400 can use the maximum language score, the full language probabilities vector, and/or additional features from the combined vector of language probability scores across the subset of selected comments associated with the media content item along with additional indicators to determine the language of the media content item. - In some embodiments, these additional indicators can include analyzing the metadata associated with the media content item. For example,
process 400 can generate a vector for information associated with the media content item, such as the title metadata associated with the media content item and the description metadata associated with the media content item. In a more particular example, text content in the title metadata and the description metadata associated with the media content item can be filtered to remove particular words (e.g., words deemed to be machine-generated, auto-generated, or otherwise non-meaningful) or particular characters (e.g., unidentifiable characters). In turn, the selected portions of the title metadata and/or description metadata can be classified by one of the machine language classifiers described above to return a vector of language probabilities for the title metadata and/or a vector of language probabilities for the description metadata. These additional vectors can be combined or otherwise used in connection with the vectors of language probabilities for the subset of selected comments to determine the language associated with the media content item. - In some embodiments, these additional indicators can also include a category associated with the media content item. For example,
process 400 can determine that the media content item is associated with a particular category, such as a NEWS category, a SPORTS category, a MOVIE category, a GAMING category, etc. In response,process 400 can use the category information as an indicator of whether the media content item is likely to include content that is in one language or is likely to include content that is in multiple languages. In this example, this can allowprocess 400 to predict that a video content item in the MOVIE category is likely to have only one language associated with the video content item, while a video content item in the GAMING category is likely to include audio content that is in multiple languages. This category indicator along with the vectors described above can be used to determine the language associated with the media content item. - In some embodiments, these additional indicators can include information, such as popularity information, relating to the media content item. For example, the total number of comments associated with the media content item (e.g., retrieved from a comments database in response to transmitting a media content identifier) can be used as an additional feature that is augmented with the combined vector of language probability scores for the subset of comments described above. In another example, popularity information, such as the total number of views for the media content item can be used as an additional feature that is augmented with the combined vector of language probability scores for the subset of comments described above.
- In some embodiments, these additional information can include statistical information relating to the media content item. For example, the mean and standard deviation of the number of upvotes for the comments associated with the media content item can be used as an additional feature that is augmented with the combined vector of language probability scores for the subset of comments described above. In this example, a high standard deviation of the number of upvotes for the comments associated with the media content item can indicate a lesser confidence in the comments-based language identification in that there are a number of noisy comments that have received little to no upvotes, while a small standard deviation and a high mean of the number of upvotes for the comments associated with the media content item can be used as a confidence indicator for the combined vector of language probability scores. In another example, the mean and standard deviation of the length of the comments associated with the media content item can be used as an additional feature that is augmented with the combined vector of language probability scores for the subset of comments described above. In this example, if the mean length of the comments associated with the media content item is relatively small (thus, encountering only short comments having less than a particular number of words or characters), this can be used as a confidence indicator for the combined vector of language probability scores in that it may be difficult to assign a language to the media content item.
- Accordingly, any suitable combination of language-related features and media content-related features can be used to determine the language of a media content item.
- Referring back to
FIG. 4 ,process 400 can continue at 412 by performing any suitable action based on the language that has been determined for the media content item, such as recommending a related video or an additional media content item having the same language identifier as the media content item, presenting an advertisement having the same language identifier as the media content item, determining search results responsive to a search query where the search results have the same language identifier as the media content item, any other suitable action, and/or any suitable combination thereof. For example, with reference toFIG. 1 , in response to process 400 associatingmedia content item 112 with a Spanish language identifier and in response to determining that a user entered a search query intosearch element 114,process 400 can present search results that include media content items that are also in Spanish (e.g., media content items associated with a Spanish language identifier). In another example,process 400 can recommend other media content items having the same Spanish language identifier in a user interface (e.g., prior to presentingmedia content item 112, whilemedia content item 112 is being presented, upon the completion ofmedia content item 112, etc.). - In a more particular example,
process 400 can transmit a request to a recommendation engine for additional media content item based on the language identifier associated with the media content item. In response to the request,process 400 can provide the user that is consuming the media content item with related media content items or additional media content items having the same language identifier as the media content item, search results responsive to a search query where the search results have the same language identifier as the media content item, etc. - In another more particular example,
process 400 can transmit a request to an advertisement server or any other suitable source for advertising content based on the language identifier associated with the media content item. In response to the request,process 400 can present the user that is consuming the media content item or other media content items with an advertisement that is associated with the same language as the media content item. Such an advertisement can be present before, during, or after the presentation of the media content item. In connection withFIG. 1 , in response to process 400 associatingmedia content item 112 with a Spanish language identifier,process 400 can retrieve and present an advertisement that is also in Spanish or has a Spanish language identifier invideo display element 110 upon the completion of playing backmedia content item 112. - In yet another more particular example,
process 400 can use the language identifier to set the language of the media player to correspond to the determined language. In response, the media player can determine that a media content item is not in the determined language (e.g., has a language identifier corresponding to a different language) and can present subtitle information corresponding to the determined language while the media content item is being played back. - In some embodiments,
process 400 can perform the comment-based language identification described above on multiple media content items, such as each video in a video database. As a result, some or all of the videos in a database can each be associated with a language identifier or an indication of the language of the content in the media content item. - In some embodiments, the language identifier associated with each of the media content items can be used along with information relating to the user to present media content recommendations to the user. For example, in response to receiving an indication that the user of a media application prefers media content in a particular language (e.g., from a language preference indicator), the language identifier associated with each of the media content items can be used to recommend and/or promote media content having a language identifier that matches the language preference indicator of the user. In another example, information about the user can be determined (e.g., that the user speaks Spanish). Such information about the user can be determined by, for example, detecting that a user has accessed a media service using a user account and, in response to receiving affirmative consent to review user account information, access user account information (e.g., user language preferences). In yet another example, information about the user can be predicted from user behavior information (e.g., media content items that the user has accessed, search terms that the user has inputted, etc.). In response to receiving and/or determining this information about the user, particular media content items can be recommended to the user. For example, in response to determining that the user has entered search terms into a media searching interface, search results including media content items that are responsive to the search terms can be obtained and re-ranked using the associated language identifiers. In continuing this example, search results having language identifiers that correspond to the information about the user (e.g., videos with Spanish language identifiers for a user that speaks Spanish) can be promoted to the top of a list of recommended media content items.
- It should be noted that, prior to accessing user account information or any other information relating to the user,
process 400 can provide the user with an opportunity to provide affirmative consent or authorization to perform actions, such as accessing a user profile or obtaining user language preferences. For example, upon loading a media playback application on a user device, the media playback application can prompt the user to provide authorization for accessing language preference information associated with a user account authenticated on the user device. In a more particular example, in response to downloading the media playback application and/or loading the media playback application on the user device, the user can be prompted with a message that requests (or requires) that the user provide consent prior to performing these actions. Additionally or alternatively, in response to installing the media playback application, the user can be prompted with a permission message that requests (or requires) that the user provide consent prior to performing these actions. - In some embodiments, at least some of the above described blocks of the processes of
FIG. 4 can be executed or performed in any order or sequence not limited to the order and sequence shown in and described in connection with the figures. Also, some of the above blocks ofFIG. 4 can be executed or performed substantially simultaneously where appropriate or in parallel to reduce latency and processing times. Additionally or alternatively, some of the above described blocks of the processes ofFIG. 4 can be omitted. - Although the embodiments disclosed herein have concerned the presentation of video content, it should be understood that the mechanisms described herein can be applied to video-only content, audio-only content, content with a combination of video and audio elements, three-dimensional content, and/or any other suitable media content.
- In some embodiments, any suitable computer readable media can be used for storing instructions for performing the functions and/or processes herein. For example, in some embodiments, computer readable media can be transitory or non-transitory. For example, non-transitory computer readable media can include media such as magnetic media (e.g., hard disks, floppy disks, and/or any other suitable magnetic media), optical media (e.g., compact discs, digital video discs, Blu-ray discs, and/or any other suitable optical media), semiconductor media (e.g., flash memory, electrically programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and/or any other suitable semiconductor media), any suitable media that is not fleeting or devoid of any semblance of permanence during transmission, and/or any suitable tangible media. As another example, transitory computer readable media can include signals on networks, in wires, conductors, optical fibers, circuits, any suitable media that is fleeting and devoid of any semblance of permanence during transmission, and/or any suitable intangible media.
- Accordingly, methods, systems, and media for language identification of a media content item based on comments are provided.
- Although the invention has been described and illustrated in the foregoing illustrative embodiments, it is understood that the present disclosure has been made only by way of example, and that numerous changes in the details of implementation of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which is limited only by the claims that follow. Features of the disclosed embodiments can be combined and rearranged in various ways.
