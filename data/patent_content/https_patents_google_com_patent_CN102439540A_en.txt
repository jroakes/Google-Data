Embodiment
Figure 1A-1F is included in sample text input and the output of the example in second writing system text candidates in first writing system.Figure 1A-1F comprises the sample text input in first writing system, for example, and phonetic.Fig. 1 C, Fig. 1 D and Fig. 1 F also comprise the example output text candidates in second writing system, for example, and Chinese character.The sample text input and the example output text candidates that are included among Figure 1A-1F comprise the separator (for example, space) between some roman characters and the Chinese character.Comprise that these separators make example be more readily understood, but in fact separator possibly do not comprised that for example, during the input roman character, the user possibly not use the space to separate roman character.
As an example, the user possibly want to import Chinese statement " we go to the U.S. " (for example, English " We are going to America ") in the Input Method Editor (IME) through roman character is input to.Can be used for showing phonetic, i.e. first writing system by the input roman character of user's typing.The user possibly hope that IME provides Chinese character output, i.e. second writing system.The spelling sound performance of Chinese statement " we go to the U.S. " will be " w ǒ men q ù m ě i gu ó ".The performance of user's typing spelling sound is very inconvenient, for example, and particularly on mobile device (for example, mobile phone).
Therefore, the user possibly want to import the character (for example, abbreviation) than spelling sound performance smaller amounts.Figure 1A illustrates the example input text, comprises roman character " w ", " m ", " q ", " m " and " g ".In order to discern the potential Chinese character corresponding to the example input text among Figure 1A, Input Method Editor can be mapped to potential spelling sound performance with the example input text.Ideally, Input Method Editor is mapped to spelling sound performance " wo men qu mei guo " with example input text " w m q m g ".
The task of identification spelling sound performance proposes two initial problems.Suppose that it is known that roman character is divided into pinyin syllable, shown in Figure 1A-1D and Fig. 1 F, problem is the pinyin syllable that the user of the roman character group performance confirming to cut apart wants.This problem can illustrate with reference to figure 1B-1D.Example input text shown in Figure 1B comprises roman character " w ", " o ", " m ", " q ", " u ", " m ", " e ", " i ", " g ", " u ", " o ".Though the example input text among Figure 1B " wo m qu mei guo " comprises the character (in order) than more coupling spelling sound performance " wo men qu mei guo " among Figure 1A; " wo m qu mei guo " still can show two or more spelling sound performances, shown in Fig. 1 C and Fig. 1 D.
Fig. 1 C illustrates the spelling sound performance of Chinese statement " we go to the U.S. ", and Fig. 1 D illustrates the spelling sound performance (for example, English " I ' ve never went to America ") of Chinese statement " I do not go to the U.S. ".In Fig. 1 C and Fig. 1 D, " wo " corresponding to " I ", " qu " corresponding to " going ", " mei " is corresponding to " U.S.A ", and " guo " is corresponding to " state ".Fig. 1 C and Fig. 1 D can be provided to show and occur the user possibly hope character " m " pinyin syllable " men " that (at character " wo " afterwards) performance can corresponding " " or the pinyin syllable " mei " of corresponding " not having " for the first time.
Another problem is to confirm whether each roman character input shows different pinyin syllable (or Chinese character).As discussed previously, the corresponding Chinese character of each pinyin syllable (for example, spelling sound syllable).This problem can use Fig. 1 D-1F to illustrate.Once more, Fig. 1 D hypothetical examples input text is cut apart like this, thus " wo ", " mei ", " qu ", " mei ", " guo " each all show pinyin syllable.Fig. 1 E illustrates the sequence of the example input text identical with Fig. 1 D, but divides.
Example input text among Fig. 1 E " w o m e i q u m e i g u o " can show the pinyin syllable sequence among the pinyin syllable sequence shown in Fig. 1 D or Fig. 1 F.Specifically, character string " g ", " u " and " o " can show the single pinyin syllable " guo " shown in Fig. 1 D, or two pinyin syllable " gu " and " o " shown in Fig. 1 F.In second example, " gu " shows first pinyin syllable, and second pinyin syllable of " o " performance.Fig. 1 F illustrates the user possibly want read statement " my younger sister removes Mei Gu " (for example, English " My younger sister will go to Plum Valley ").In addition, Fig. 1 F illustrate " mei " can be corresponding other Chinese character, such as " younger sister " and " plum ".
Fig. 2 is the block diagram that the sequence of observed text input and the potential syllable sequence that is showed by the sequence that observed text is imported (for example, the hiding sequence in hiding the Markov model) are shown.Specifically, Fig. 2 is illustrated in the potential sequence of the syllable shown in Fig. 1 C and Fig. 1 D.The sequence " w m q m g " of observed text input can show " wo men qu mei guo " or " wo mei qu mei guo ".The potential sequence of other of syllable also is possible (not shown).For example, as with reference to shown in the figure 1F, the sequence " w m q m g " of observed text input can also show " wo mei qu mei gu o ".
When text when input that receives in first writing system (for example, phonetic), above-mentioned two initial problems can solve in the following manner: (i) import based on the text in first writing system; The n-gram that discerns in first writing system (for example shows; Pinyin syllable), and (ii) based on the n-gram that discerned performance, discern in second writing system morpheme (for example; Chinese character) and entry (for example, Chinese-character words).Ideally, identify the most probable morpheme of the input hoped of performance user.
Example font figure
Font figure (grapheme graph) can be used for discerning by the n-gram performance performance of the input text in first writing system, in first writing system.
N-gram is the sequence of n continued labelling of character or word for example.N-gram has length (order), i.e. the quantity of mark among the n-gram.For example, 1-gram (or single gram) comprises a mark; 2-gram (two gram) comprises two marks.As an example, " wo " can be that 2-gram in first writing system (for example, pinyin syllable) of the morpheme (for example, " I " of pronunciation " w ǒ ", " crouching " of pronunciation " w ò ") in second writing system shows.As another example, " m " can be the 1-gram performance in first writing system of the morpheme (for example, " " of pronunciation " men ", " not having " of pronunciation " m é i ") in second writing system.In these examples, first writing system is a phonetic, and second writing system is a Chinese character.
Temporarily return the example of Fig. 1 C, Chinese statement " we go to the U.S. " can be split into single gram, for example, and word " we " (for example, English " we "), " going " (for example, English " went ") and " U.S. " (for example, English " America ").Two gram of example are " we go " and " going to the U.S. ".In this example, the mark among two gram separates through comma.
Fig. 3 shows example font Figure 30 0.Specifically, font Figure 30 0 (for example, phonetic input figure) is a key tree (trie), comprises one or more nodes (for example, the pinyin syllable node), for example, and root node 302 and one or more child nodes.Except root node, each node shows the font (for example, roman character) in first writing system (for example, phonetic).Node can be classified into each rank.For example, the root rank can comprise root node 302.First rank can comprise the direct child node of root node 302, for example, and node 310,312 and 314.Node 310,312 in first rank and each of 314 show the font of first consonant joint (for example, prefix).For example, first roman character of node 310,312 and 314 performance beginning pinyin syllable.Can be from root node 302 to its child node traversal font Figure 30 0 to discern n-gram performance morpheme in second writing system (for example, Chinese character), in first writing system (for example, pinyin syllable).
The also corresponding n-gram performance of each node among font Figure 30 0, this n-gram performance comprises the font of its corresponding node and the font of the node that said corresponding node is derived from.For example, node 310 corresponding n-gram performances " a ".Node 324 corresponding n-gram performances " be ", and node 330 corresponding n-gram performances " ang ".
In addition, the suitable subclass of the node in font Figure 30 0 is corresponding to full syllable (for example, pinyin syllable), and this full syllable is corresponding to the morpheme in second writing system.Specifically, node 310 (" a "), 320 (" ai "), 321 (" an "), 322 (" ao "), 323 (" ba "), 325 (" zu ") and the corresponding full syllable of 330 (" ang ").This suitable subclass is illustrated in the visual performance of font Figure 30 0 through shaded nodes.Perhaps, the shadeless node part of corresponding syllable only.For example, node 312 (" b "), 314 (" z ") and 324 (" the be ") part of corresponding pinyin syllable (for example, consonant joint) only.Because shadeless node is the part of corresponding pinyin syllable only, the morpheme in their not corresponding second writing systems.
Each node in the suitable subclass of node (that is shaded nodes) also is associated with identifier.For example; Node 310 is associated with identifier " 1 ", and node 320 is associated with identifier " 2 ", and node 321 is associated with identifier " 3 "; Node 322 is associated with identifier " 5 "; Node 323 is associated with identifier " 6 ", and node 325 is associated with identifier " 418 ", and node 330 is associated with identifier " 4 ".Identifier can be any other combination (for example, alpha-numeric string) of numeral or character.
Each identifier can be used for locating the node among the morpheme figure, and this will describe following in more detail.Temporarily with reference to figure 4, as simple general view, morpheme Figure 40 0 comprises node, the one or more morphemes (for example, Chinese character) in corresponding second writing system of each node.Entry (for example, Chinese-character words) among morpheme Figure 40 0 in corresponding second writing system of the suitable subclass of one or more nodes.The identifier of selecting from font Figure 30 0 can be used for traveling through morpheme Figure 40 0, for example, and through in morpheme Figure 40 0, locating the node that is associated with identifier.For example, node 410 also is associated with identifier " 1 ", and node 412 also is associated with identifier " 2 ", and node 414 also is associated with identifier " 3 ", and node 416 also is associated with identifier " 418 ".In Fig. 4, only the node in first rank is illustrated identifier, but in fact, identifier is associated with each shaded nodes.
Return Fig. 3, when being received each font (for example, roman character) by Input Method Editor, font Figure 30 0 can be used to discern the possible n-gram performance in first writing system.For example, if receive logical character " b ", then define location node 312.As another example, can receive roman character " a " afterwards at " b ".In other words, list entries can be " ba ".Therefore, can location node 323 for " ba ", and for can location node 310,320,321,322 and 330 with the residue pinyin syllable of " a " beginning.Specifically, list entries " ba " can show pinyin syllable " ba ", with " ba " beginning pinyin syllable or with " b " beginning pinyin syllable and with " a " beginning pinyin syllable.
In some embodiments, after discern possible n-gram performance by the shaded nodes of list entries performance, can return the identifier that is associated with the shaded nodes of having located through the location.Like previous description, these identifiers can be used for locating node among the morpheme figure with the identification entry.
Other embodiment also is possible.For example, font Figure 30 0 is a Patricia key tree, but font Figure 30 0 can realize (for example, Hash table, balance key tree) with the data structure of other type.In addition, in some embodiments, the n-gram performance can be returned with alternate identifier or and identifier combination.And font Figure 30 0 can be implemented to show the combination of different writing systems.For example, first writing system can be Bopomofo, and second writing system can be a Chinese character.As another example, first writing system can be Romaji (for example, the romanization literal of Japanese), and second writing system can be Kanji-Japanese (japanese character).
Example morpheme figure
Fig. 4 illustrates example morpheme Figure 40 0.Specifically, morpheme Figure 40 0 (for example, pinyin syllable figure) is the key tree that comprises one or more nodes (for example, the Chinese character node), for example, and root node 402 and one or more child nodes.Node can be classified into each rank.For example, the root rank can comprise root node 402.First rank can comprise the direct child node of root node 402, for example, and node 410,412,414 and 416.The prefix of node 410,412,414 in first rank and 416 performance entries.For example, first Chinese character of node in first rank 410,412,414 and 416 performance beginning Chinese-character words (for example, word or phrase).Can travel through morpheme Figure 40 0 from root node 402 to child node, so that show the entry of discerning in second writing system based on the n-gram that uses font Figure 30 0 identification.
Each node among morpheme Figure 40 0 shows the one or more morphemes in second writing system.For example, node 410 performance morphemes " Ah ", " breathing out " and " ", each in them can pronounce in a variety of forms (for example, " a ", " ā ", " à ").As another example, node 421 can show " room " (not shown).In addition, the corresponding entry (for example, Chinese-character words) of the suitable subclass of the node among morpheme Figure 40 0.For example, node 410,412,414,416,420,422,423,424,425 and 440 is corresponding to entry.This suitable subclass is passed through shaded nodes shown in the visual performance of morpheme Figure 40 0.Perhaps, shadeless node a part corresponding to entry.For example, node 421 and 430 parts corresponding to entry.Specifically, node 421 can be corresponding to " love room ", and it is the part (part of for example, " loving for a person extends even to the crows on his roof " corresponding to the Chinese Chinese idiom of node 440) of entry.
Each corresponding entry comprises the morpheme of its corresponding node and the morpheme of the node that said corresponding node is derived from.For example, drop to node 420 from node 410.Node 420 corresponding entries " auntie " and " Ah with "." one's mother's sister " and " with " be the morpheme of corresponding pinyin syllable " yi ", and " Ah "'s corresponding node 410.
Though the node that utilizes n-gram in first writing system to show to mark among morpheme Figure 40 0 (for example; Utilize " a " mark node 410, and utilize " ji " mark node 430), in fact; Node and identifier (for example, from font Figure 30 0 identical identifier) are associated.For example, as discussed previously, node 410 is associated with identifier " 1 ", and utilizes identifier " 418 " mark node 416.In addition, the node of morpheme figure also is associated (for example, " 32778 " are used for node 425 " foot ") with the entry identifier of the corresponding entry of identification.
In some embodiments, entry (for example, Chinese-character words) is stored in the data structure of separating with morpheme Figure 40 0.In these and other embodiment, each node of morpheme figure only is associated with identifier and entry identifier from font figure.For example, entry can be stored in the dictionary by the entry identifier index.The node of locating among the morpheme figure (for example, shaded nodes) provides and can be used for the entry identifier of the entry in the recognition dictionary.
The arrangement (permutation) of the n-gram performance of the list entries in first writing system of use font Figure 30 0 identification is used to travel through morpheme figure, to discern possible entry, shown in the example among Fig. 5.
Fig. 5 illustrates the step of the example use of font figure and morpheme figure.In step 0, do not receive input, and do not locate the child node among font figure and the morpheme figure.
In step 1, roman character " w " is received by Input Method Editor.As response, Input Method Editor is positioned at the node of performance " w " in first rank of font figure.Input Method Editor is also located from the node of performance " w " and is descended and all nodes (for example, corresponding to the morpheme in second writing system) the suitable subclass of the node of the font figure of corresponding full syllable.The identifier that is associated with the node of location can be used for locating the node among the morpheme figure that shows Chinese character.For example, " w " is first consonant joint of pinyin syllable " wu ", " wo " and " wei ".With reference to the step 1 among the figure 5, " nothing " correspondence " w ú ", " I " corresponding " w ǒ ", and " being " correspondence " wei ".In step 1, have only three pinyin character to be illustrated in the example, for example, wherein " nothing ", " I " and " being " they can be the most probable candidate of " w ".Similarly, step 2 illustrates in response to some possible candidates that receive roman character " w " and " o " processing.Fig. 5 does not illustrate all possible candidate of actual treatment.
In step 2, receiving roman character " w " afterwards, receive roman character " o " by Input Method Editor.Except the node of location performance " w " in first rank of font figure, Input Method Editor is the node of location performance " o " in first rank of font figure also.As discussed previously, " w " can be first consonant joint of spelling sound syllable, " o " can be first consonant joint of spelling sound syllable, perhaps " wo " can be spelling sound syllable.Input Method Editor is also located all nodes that drop to from the node corresponding to performance " w " and " o " in the suitable subclass of the node the font figure of spelling sound syllable.The identifier that is associated with the node of being located can be used for locating the node among the morpheme figure that shows Chinese character, this Chinese character performance full syllable.For example, " w " is first consonant joint of pinyin syllable " wo ".With reference to the step 2 among the figure 5, " I " corresponding " w ǒ ", and " crouching " correspondence " w ò ".As another example, " o " is spelling sound syllable, " " correspondence " ō ".
Marking
As stated, possibly arranging of the entry that uses font figure and morpheme figure to discern to show by input text.For example, return Fig. 5, step 1 illustrates can be by first entry " nothing ", " I " and " being " of roman character " w " performance.Receiving only first font (for example, " w ") afterwards, based on first entry in each score that is associated, can select in first entry, for example, " nothing ", " I " and " being ".For example, can select the most possible entry that occurs (and demonstration).
As discussed previously; When (for example receiving as the other font of importing; Second font) time, first font and second font can show in one or more first entries, and perhaps first font can show different entries respectively with second font; For example, second font can show from the entry in the group of one or more second entries.In order to solve these situation, can generate the arrangement and the marking of the 3rd entry and the 4th entry.The 3rd entry can be selected from one or more first entries, and the 4th entry can be selected from one or more second entries.The score of first entry and the score of arrangement can compare, so that most probable entry to be provided.
For example, in Fig. 5, can discern or calculate score for first entry " nothing " (" w ú "), " I " (" w ǒ ") and " being " (" wei).In addition, can discern for the score of arranging " nothing " (" w ú ō "), " I " (" w ǒ ō ") and " being " (" wei ō ").Once more, this example does not illustrate all possible first entry and the arrangement that in fact will handle.For example, can compare the score of being discerned is used for showing so that entry or arrangement with top score to be provided.
In certain embodiments, possible arrangement is sent to the n-gram language model, with the probability of calculated permutations generation, and can be based on the one or more arrangements of one or more Standard Selection.For example, the arrangement that can select most probable to occur.
Can use chain rule to confirm the probability that occurs according to the string n-gram language model, specific (for example, the arrangement of entry).Chain rule is confirmed as the probability of string the product of each probability.Therefore, for given string " e
1, e
2..., e
k", for the probability of string, p (e
1, e
2..., e
k) equal:
The n-gram language model can be restricted to specific maximum sized n-gram, for example, is restricted to 1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram etc.For example; For given string " NASA officials say they hope "; Wherein maximum n-gram length (order) is limited to 3-grams, is confirmed as the product of following conditional probability: p (NASA officials say they hope)=p (NASA) p (offcials|NASA) p (say|NASA officials) p (they|officials say) p (hope|saythey) for the probability of said string.This can be summarized as:
Wherein n is the length of the maximum n-gram that allows in the speech model.
According to the correlated frequency of the document of training data, conditional probability rule of thumb comes to confirm usually.For example, in above example, if given context " NASA officials ", then the probability of word " say " is provided by following formula:
Wherein f (NASA officials say) is the frequency or the counting of the appearance of the string " NASA officials say " in the document of training data.For the conditional probability of the string in the maximum n-gram length in the n-gram language model corresponding to being stored in for the probability in the language model of n-gram; For example, p (say|NASAofficials) is the conditional probability that is stored in for " NASA officials say " in the language model of 3-gram clauses and subclauses.
Similarly, can be for other writing system design conditions probability.Temporarily return the example among Fig. 1 C, p (go | we) be the conditional probability that is stored in in the language model of 2-gram clauses and subclauses " we go "; And p (U.S. | we; Go) be the conditional probability that is stored in in the language model of 3-gram clauses and subclauses " we go, the U.S. ".In said example, the mark among the n-gram (for example, word) is cut apart with comma.
In some embodiments, compare the score of each arrangement, and the arrangement that will most possibly occur shows user's (for example, on subscriber equipment).In some embodiments, if show user's offset true, then the user can from the arrangement showed begin the correct morpheme of identification (for example, selecting), and Input Method Editor can generate another arrangement and is used for showing.For example, return Figure 1B-1D, the user can provide " wo m qu mei guo " as input.Input Method Editor can show that " we go to the U.S. " is as most possible arrangement.But the user possibly want input " I do not go to the U.S. ".The user can only select " I ".As response, Input Method Editor can be confirmed " wo " identification " I " from font figure and morpheme figure, and shows the other candidate who before uses font figure and morpheme figure identification based on part string " m qu mei guo ".For example, Input Method Editor can show " not going to the U.S. " (for example, English " never went to America ") and " mother goes to the U.S. " (for example, English " mother is going to America ")." mother " corresponding pinyin syllable " m ā ma ".Other embodiment also is possible.For example, the user can be identified as any morpheme in the arrangement of being showed correct.
Example system
Fig. 6 is the block diagram that is used for generating based on the text input of first writing system example system 600 of the output text candidates in second writing system.System 600 comprises off-line generation model 610.Off-line generation model 610 can generate dictionary 612 from the training data (not shown).The example of training data comprises webpage, example message daily record, news and other text source.Dictionary 612 can comprise Chinese character, the pinyin syllable that is associated and the score that is associated (for example, Chinese character in training data, occur frequency).Dictionary 612 can be resolved, and to produce pinyin table 614, pinyin table 614 comprises pinyin syllable and the score that is associated.Dictionary 612 can make up device 616 and resolves through the pinyin table 614 that phonetic key tree makes up device 618 through dictionary, comprises pinyin syllable, the Chinese character that is associated and for each the dictionary model 620 of identifier with generation.
Dictionary model 620 can be used by IME 630, to generate dictionary key tree 632 (for example, morpheme Figure 40 0) and phonetic key tree 634 (for example, font Figure 30 0).When receiving input 640 (for example, user input), spelling analyzing device 636 can use dictionary trie 632 and phonetic trie 634 to handle input with dictionary resolver 638, as top with reference to figure 1-5 description.Then, IME 630 can use the most possible arrangement of language model 639 identification entries, and provides most possible arrangement as output 650, is used to be presented at subscriber equipment.
The assembly of system 600 can be couple to each other one or more communicatedly.That though the assembly of above identification is described to separate or difference, one or more can being incorporated in single process or the routine in the assembly.Here the functional description that provides is as an example, and this description comprises for the responsibility of distinctive function and separating.Other combination of function responsibility or other division can be carried out as required, perhaps carry out according to deviser's preference.For example, single resolver can be carried out the function of spelling analyzing device 636 and dictionary resolver 638.As another example, dictionary key tree 632, phonetic key tree 634 and language model 639 can differentiate (for example, as shown in Figure 9) with IME.
Instantiation procedure
Fig. 7 A illustrates the process flow diagram that is used for generating based on the text input of first writing system instantiation procedure 700a of the output text candidates in second writing system.Process 700a comprises first font (705) that receives in first writing system.For example, IME 630 can receive first font (for example, input 640).
Process 700a also comprises the font figure that uses font in first writing system, discerns n-gram performance (710) first morpheme in second writing system, in first writing system.The one n-gram performance comprises first font.For example, spelling analyzing device 636 can use font figure (for example, phonetic key tree 634), discerns n-gram performance first morpheme in second writing system (for example, Chinese character), in first writing system (for example, pinyin syllable).Process 700a also comprises the one or more first nodes (715) that use among the n-gram performance location morpheme figure.The first node of each location among the morpheme figure shows one or more first entries in second writing system, and in one or more first entry each is showed by a n-gram and representes.For example, dictionary resolver 638 can use a n-gram to show and locate the one or more first nodes (for example, dictionary key tree 632) among the morpheme figure.
Process 700a also comprise based on one or more first entries in each first score that is associated, from one or more first entries, select first entry (720).For example, dictionary resolver 638 can based on one or more first entries in each first score that is associated (for example, use language model 639 identifications), select first entry.
Process 700a also comprises provides first entry to be used to be presented at subscriber equipment (725).For example, IME630 can provide first entry to be used to be presented on the subscriber equipment (for example, mobile phone).
Fig. 7 B illustrates the process flow diagram that is used for generating based on the text input of first writing system another instantiation procedure 700b of the output text candidates in second writing system.In some embodiments, process 700b carries out after process 700a.
Process 700b comprises second font (730) that receives in first writing system.For example, IME 630 can receive second font (for example, input 640).Process 700b also comprises the font figure that uses the font in first writing system, discerns the 2nd n-gram performance (735) second morpheme in second writing system, in first writing system.The 2nd n-gram performance comprises second font.For example, spelling analyzing device 636 can use the 2nd n-gram performance in font figure (for example, phonetic key tree 634) identification first writing system.
Process 700b comprises that also use the 2nd n-gram shows one or more Section Points (740) of locating among the morpheme figure.The Section Point of each location among the morpheme figure shows one or more second entries in second writing system, and in one or more second entry each is showed by the 2nd n-gram and representes.For example, dictionary resolver 638 can use the 2nd n-gram to show and locate the one or more Section Points (for example, dictionary key tree 632) among the morpheme figure.
Process 700b also comprises from one or more first entries and generates one or more arrangements of the 3rd entry and generate the 4th entry (745) from one or more second entries.For example, dictionary resolver 638 can generate one or more arrangements (for example, the arrangement of Chinese-character words).
Process 700b also comprise based on one or more arrangements of the 3rd entry and the 4th entry in each second score that is associated, from one or more arrangements of the 3rd entry and the 4th entry, select to arrange (750).After comprising, selected arrangement connects the 3rd entry of the 4th entry.
Process 700b also comprises first score of more selected first entry and second score (755) of selected arrangement, and based on this selected first entry or selected arrangement is provided relatively, is used to be presented at subscriber equipment (760).For example, dictionary resolver 638 can be arranged, and compare first score and second score based on second score (for example, using language model 639 to discern) selection.In addition, IME 630 can be used to be presented at equipment based on selected first entry or selected arrangement relatively are provided.
