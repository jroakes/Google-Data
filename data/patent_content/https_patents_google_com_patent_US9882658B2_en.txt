- This application describes techniques for transferring data between devices using audible signals made up of musically-related tones.
- One example method selecting one or more ordered sequences of audio attribute values based on a musical relationship between the audio attribute values. Each sequence is associated with a particular data value, such that the ordered sequence may be played by a first device (e.g., using a speaker) to encode the data value. The sequence may be received by a second device (e.g., using a microphone), and decoded to produce the data value. Therefore, the techniques described herein may enable such devices to exchange data using sound-based communications that are melodic and pleasant to nearby listeners.
- the communication protocols described herein support sound-based communications in a wide variety of musical styles, which may provide for enhanced user customization and experience.
- the present techniques may offer several advantages over previous techniques. For example, the present techniques allow for localized data transfers between devices without the use of a local or wide area network, such as a Wifi or cellular network. Because such networks often charge fees for data transfers, users may perform data transfers to other users proximate to them without having to pay these charges. Further, because the frequencies of the tones used to represent various data values are chosen according to a musical relationship, the resulting audible signal may be pleasing to a user and others within earshot, as opposed to previous techniques where the audible signals may be perceived simply as noise or an unpleasant collection of unrelated tones. The techniques may also allow for variation of the musical relationship between the tones during a message, which may make the audible signal more pleasing and musical. Further, the dynamic nature of the communication structure provided by these techniques may allow users to create a “signature” sound by defining various signal attributes of messages.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a system 100 for communicating data between devices using audible harmonies.
- the system 100 includes a first client device 102 and a second client device 104 .
- the first and second client devices 102 and 104 may include mobile computing devices (e.g., cellular phones, tablets, etc.), laptop computers, desktop computers, and other computing devices.
- the first client device 102 transmits a data set to the second client device 104 by playing an audio signal 110 that is encoded with the data set through a speaker included in the first client device 102 .
- the second client device 104 captures the audio signal 110 using a microphone included in the second client device 104 , and decodes the data set from the captured signal.
- the audio signal 110 includes multiple symbols each made up of one or more musical tones. Each symbol represents a particular data value, allowing a data set to be represented by a series of one or more musical notes or chords containing multiple notes.
- the pitches of the notes used in the symbols may be chosen according to a musical or harmonic relationship to one another, so that the resulting audio signal may be perceived by a user as musical.
- a user of the first client device 102 may want to share a website with a user of the second client device 104 .
- the user of the first client device 102 may interact with an application running on the first client device 102 to send the URL for the website to the user of the second client device 104 as an auditory message in the musical style of a basic rock song (e.g., a I, IV, V 7 , I chord progression).
- the first client device 102 may transmit the URL to the second client device 104 by playing audio signal 110 that is encoded with a data set that indicates the URL for the website.
- the second client device 104 captures the audio signal 110 , extracts the URL, and provides the user of the second client device 104 with access to the corresponding website.
- Audio signal 110 may include a melody 120 in a particular musical key (e.g., C major).
- the melody 120 may resemble a popular song, such as by following a chord progression used by the song.
- One or more concurrent tones or series of single tones included in the melody may be used as symbols to represent data values in the data set to be transferred.
- the attributes of melody 120 e.g., the particular pitch, duration, and order of the sequence of symbols, may be representative of data set 130 .
- the first client device 102 may map each possible data value of the data set 130 to a set of attributes to be played in melody 120 .
- the first client device 102 may map a different symbol to each of the first 256 integer values (e.g., 0-255), such that each symbol represents one byte of information. If a different number of symbols are mapped, the amount of information represented by each symbol may be different. For example, if two distinct symbols are mapped, each symbol represents 1 bit of information (e.g., 0 or 1).
- the first client device 102 may reference a symbol map in order to convert data set 130 to melody 120 .
- the second client device 104 may map the attributes of melody 120 to data values in order to decode the data set 130 . That is, the second client device 104 may reference the symbol map in order to convert melody 120 to data set 130 .
- the symbol map may be known to the first and second client devices 102 and 104 in advance, e.g., prior to the first client device 102 playing audio signal 110 .
- the audio signal 110 may be utilized by the first client device 102 to indicate the symbol map to the second client device 104 .
- the first client device 102 may include data that indicates the symbol map in a header portion of the audio signal 110 , e.g., a portion of audio signal 110 that precedes melody 120 . This data may include an identifier of a pre-defined symbol map known to both client devices, or may include a representation of a new symbol map chosen by the first client device 102 .
- Melody 120 may be made up of measures 122 , 124 , 126 , and 128 a , which represent different segments of time and correspond to a specific number of beats. A series of musical chord changes may occur throughout measures 122 , 124 , 126 , and 128 a such that melody 120 may follow a particular chord progression.
- melody 120 may follow a chord progression as dictated by the symbol map.
- the particular chord progression exhibited by melody 120 in the example of FIG. 1 is in the key of C major.
- measures 122 , 124 , 126 , and 128 a may correspond to chords I, IV, V 7 , and I, in the key of C major, respectively. Since melody 120 is in the key of C major in this example, chord I corresponds to the musical notes of C-E-G, chord IV corresponds to the musical notes of F-A-C, and chord V 7 corresponds to the musical notes of F-G-B-D.
- the symbol map may define the structure of melody 120 .
- the symbol map may require that, for measure 122 , data values be encoded as an ordered sequence of musical notes or chords that are selected from chord I, e.g., C, E, and G.
- the particular pitch, duration, and order of the sequence of notes included in measure 122 may, for example, be representative of the data value 132 .
- the second client device 104 may identify the portion of audio signal 110 corresponding to measure 122 as the data value 132 , which is the hexadecimal value “0xB6” in this example.
- the symbol map may enable the second client device 104 to perform this type of melody to data value conversion.
- the first client device 102 may use the symbol map to determine the particular sequence of notes that are to be played in measure 122 so as to indicate data value 132 .
- data value 134 may be encoded in the portion of audio signal 110 corresponding to measure 124 as a particular sequence of the musical notes F, A, and C; data value 136 may be encoded in the portion of audio signal 110 corresponding to measure 126 as a particular sequence of the musical notes F, G, B, and D; and data value 138 may be encoded in the portion of audio signal 110 corresponding to measure 128 a as a particular sequence of the musical notes C, E, and G.
- each measure of melody 120 and the chord in which data is encoded in is conveyed in the symbol map associated with the audio signal 110 .
- the second client device 104 may, for example, expect to receive a sequence of the musical notes F, A, and C from first client device 102 for measure 124 .
- the sequence of musical notes played by the first client device 102 in the chord progression of measures 122 - 128 a may represent the sequence of data values 132 - 138 .
- the structure of melody 120 may provide an audio attribute to data value mapping that varies as a function of time.
- the symbol map may also specify one or additional characteristics of the transmitted audio signal. For example, one or more Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release (“ADSR”) parameters for the envelope of the transmitted audio signal may vary according the symbol map.
- ADSR Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release
- envelope characteristics may dynamically change throughout melody 120 as indicated by the symbol map. This may, for instance, allow for melody 120 to emulate a song that is played using multiple instruments.
- the symbol map may also specify the key and tempo in which melody 120 is played.
- the symbol map may specify the time signature of melody 120 , which is 4/4 in the example of system 100 .
- i is a symbol within melody 120
- K is the chord from which notes may be selected to represent symbol i
- D is the duration of symbol i
- T is the number of tones included in symbol i.
- chord K may correspond to the chord progression of melody 120 .
- each “f i ” corresponds to the frequency of a note included in the chord for symbol i and “n” is the total number of notes in the chord. For example, if the chord K is a major chord or minor chord, which are both triads (e.g., chords made up of three notes), then n would be equal to 3.
- chord K is a major seventh chord or a minor seventh chord, which are both tetrads (e.g., chords made up of four notes)
- n would be equal to 4.
- F 4 is a 4 th octave F-note that has a 349.2 Hz pitch
- G 4 is a 4 th octave G-note that has a 392 Hz pitch
- B 4 is a 4 th octave B-note that has a 493.9 Hz pitch
- D 5 is a 5 th octave D-note that has a 587.3 Hz pitch.
- the duration D of each symbol most simply corresponds to amount of time of which the tone(s) of the symbol are to be played.
- the symbol map specifies that melody 120 is to be played at a tempo of 120 beats per minute (“BPM”).
- BPM beats per minute
- an exemplary symbol 144 which is a half note, may have a duration of 1 second.
- the number of tones T indicates how many concurrent tones are to be played for each symbol. This parameter allows for symbols to be transmitted in the form of single notes, as well as full or partial chords. As described more fully below, these tones will also serve as a means by which various data encoding schemes may be implemented.
- the techniques described herein provide for sound-based communications that nearby persons may find pleasant. Further, these techniques may allow for a great degree of customization.
- the symbol map may be determined based on one or more user-defined parameters.
- a user may able to select a chord progression for the symbol map.
- the user of first client device 102 may have interacted with an application running on the first client device 102 to specify that the website URL be transmitted using the chord progression of his favorite classic rock song. Such a selection would be reflected in the structure S of melody 120 .
- the Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release (“ADSR”) envelope parameters may be user-defined. This may allow for the audio signal to be synthesized in a multitude of ways. In some implementations, envelope characteristics may dynamically change throughout the melody as indicated by the symbol map.
- the musical relationships between the notes and chords included in the symbols may also vary.
- the symbol map may specify that tones from a particular scale in a particular key will be used to make up the various symbols.
- a symbol map may specify that the C pentatonic major scale is to be used, meaning that symbols will be formed by selecting notes and chords from the notes of that scale (e.g., [C, D, E, G, A]).
- the symbol map may specify other scales in a particular key, such as, for example, a major scale, a natural minor scale, a harmonic minor scale, a melodic minor scale, a pentatonic minor scale, a blues scale, a particular mode of a base scale (e.g., the Phrygian mode of the C major scale), or other scales.
- a major scale e.g., a natural minor scale, a harmonic minor scale, a melodic minor scale, a pentatonic minor scale, a blues scale, a particular mode of a base scale (e.g., the Phrygian mode of the C major scale), or other scales.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a conceptual diagram of an exemplary framework for providing a symbol map for use in communicating data between devices with audible harmonies in a system 200 .
- the system 200 includes a symbol map 210 , which may function in a manner similar to that of symbol maps described above in association with FIG. 1 .
- the symbol map 210 may provide structures S 1 -S N which each correspond to a different symbol in a sequence of N symbols that are to be included in a melody produced in accordance with symbol map 210 .
- Each symbol structure of the symbol map may specify various attributes (e.g., chord K, duration D, tones T, ADSR parameters, etc.) of its corresponding symbol.
- the symbol map 210 provides the particular order in which the symbols are to occur in the melody.
- a melody produced by the first client device 102 may conform to symbol map 210 and the second client device 104 may decode a captured melody according to symbol map 210 . That is, the first client device 102 may reference a symbol map, such as symbol map 210 , in order to convert a data set to a melody. Similarly, the second client device 104 may reference the same symbol map 210 in order to convert the melody of the captured audio signal to a data set.
- the symbol map 210 may be known to the first and second client devices 102 and 104 in advance, e.g., prior to the first client device 102 playing an audio signal.
- the audio signal produced by the first client device 102 may be utilized to indicate the symbol map to the second client device 104 .
- the first client device 102 may include data that indicates the symbol map 210 in a header portion of the audio signal, e.g., a portion of audio signal 110 that precedes melody 120 .
- This data may include an identifier of for symbol map 210 , which may be known to both client devices, or may include a representation of symbol map 210 chosen by the first client device 102 .
- the symbol map 210 may provide the structure for its melody at a symbol-level. For instance, the symbol map 210 may specify the chord K, duration D, and tone T, as described above, for each symbol of the melody. The symbol map 210 may also specify ADSR envelope parameters for each symbol. In this particular example, the symbol map 210 provides a structure for a melody in the key of C major at a tempo of 240 BPM. The chord progression exhibited by the melody specified by symbol map 210 , which extends from symbol S 1 to symbol S N , may be viewed as a chord progression.
- the symbol map 210 may specify that the third symbol of the melody be played for 0.5 seconds and include one or more of the tones C 4 , E 4 , and G 4 . Since all of the symbols specified by symbol map 210 are in the key of C major, a symbol having structure 212 (e.g., the third symbol in the melody) may be viewed as including one or more tones selected from a I chord. Similarly, a symbol having structure 212 may be viewed as a half note, as it has a duration of 0.5 seconds where the tempo of the melody provided by the symbol map 210 is 240 BPM.
- tones C 4 , E 4 , and G 4 that are played as a symbol having structure 212 will, as described in more detail in the discussion of FIGS. 3 a -4 b below, depend on the particular one or more data values that are to be conveyed with that symbol.
- the symbol map 210 may specify that the eleventh symbol of the melody be played for 0.125 seconds and include one or more of the tones F 4 , G 4 , B 4 , and D 4 . Since all of the symbols specified by symbol map 210 are in the key of C major, a symbol having structure 214 (e.g., the eleventh symbol in the melody) may be viewed as including one or more tones selected from a V 7 chord. Similarly, a symbol having structure 214 may be viewed as an eighth note, as it has a duration of 0.125 seconds where the tempo of the melody provided by the symbol map 210 is 240 BPM.
- tones F 4 , G 4 , B 4 , and D 4 that are played as a symbol having structure 214 will, as described in more detail in the discussion of FIGS. 3 a -4 b below, depend on the particular one or more data values that are to be conveyed with that symbol.
- the symbol map 210 may include at least one free portion 216 a - b within the melody structure.
- a free portion 216 within the melody as provided by the symbol map 210 may be a portion of the melody for which a symbol representing a data value is not specified. Rather than being representative of data values, such free portion 216 may be implemented within the melody for purposes of musical aesthetics.
- the second client device 104 may determine, from symbol map 210 , that a portion of the melody played by the first client device 102 corresponding to free portion 216 does not encode a data value. Accordingly, the second client device 104 may simply not perform decoding processes for free portion 216 .
- audio may be played during the free portion 216 of the melody.
- the audio played may not explicitly represent data values, but rather just be provided for musical aesthetics.
- Free portion 216 could, for instance, include drum or vocal tracks.
- the free portion 216 may include tones similar to those included in symbols specified by symbol map 210 .
- the symbol map 210 may include at least one free portion 216 as a rest so as to create rhythm within the melody.
- the speaker of first client device 102 may, in these examples, be silent for the duration of free portion 216 .
- the symbol map 210 may specify duration information for each of one or more free portions 216 .
- FIG. 3 a illustrates an example of a system 300 a for communicating data between devices with audible harmonies.
- the system 300 a may function in a manner similar to that of system 100 which has been described above in association with FIG. 1 . Accordingly, system 300 a includes first and second client devices 102 and 104 .
- the first client device 102 may transmit a data set 330 a to the second client device 104 by, for example, playing an audio signal 310 a having a melody 320 a through a speaker that is included in the first client device 102 .
- the second client device 104 may record the audio signal 310 a using a microphone that is included in the second client device 104 and decode the data set 330 a from the recording.
- the melody 320 a produced by the first client device 102 may conform to symbol map 312 a and the second client device 104 may decode captured melody 320 a according to symbol map 312 a .
