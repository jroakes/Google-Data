Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to a computer-based method for business management and, more particularly, to a computer implemented method for modeling intrafirm interactions between divisions within a firm operating in a centralized mode.
- causal model is the model of consumer choice, based largely on household panel data, which has enabled researchers to study choice behavior, brand preferences, and purchase habits. Consumer choice models have a bearing on market share models, which have also been studied extensively. Market share models are viewed as useful for evaluating the competitive effects of price and promotions on market shares of each brand and involve using aggregate data at store, regional, or market level.
- micro-level analysis which is based on direct survey-type consumer choice data
- macro-level analysis which is based on aggregate data-based market share information.
- Garg market model Another example of a market model which uses micro and macro level scanner data is termed herein as the "Garg market model", and is described in related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/032,527, Integrated Marketing and Operations Decision-making Under Multi-brand Competition, filed Feb. 27, 1998.
- the Garg market model is more comprehensive than those discussed above in that it addresses the issue of integrated decision-making under multi-brand competition when the firm consists of two divisions: marketing and operations, operating in a decentralized mode.
- the Garg model allows the marketing mix variables to be selected as either Multi-nominal Logit (MNL) or Multiplicative Competitive Interaction (MCI) variables.
- MNL Multi-nominal Logit
- MCI Multiplicative Competitive Interaction
- the cited Garg model does not consider a firm comprising: Marketing Management, Operations Management, and Finance Management.
- An embodiment of the computer-implemented method of this invention first initializes a plurality of marketing mix variables, representing a plurality of feasible marketing strategies, and a corresponding plurality of marketing cost values, representing costs associated with each of the marketing mix variables. The method then selects a sub-plurality of marketing mix variables and, based on the integrated marketing model, estimates, for a plurality of time periods covering a planning horizon, a corresponding demand for each of a plurality of brands. A further embodiment performs the estimation of demand by forming an integrated marketing model for estimating, more accurately than does the prior art, the effects on consumer demand resulting from different marketing strategies.
- the method then, based on the prior step's estimated demands and on a plurality of sale price values, calculates an estimated total revenue value corresponding to the selected sub-plurality of marketing mix variables, for each of the plurality of time periods.
- the method also calculates an estimated total inventory maintenance cost for the aggregate of goods, based on the calculated demands, for each of the plurality of time periods.
- the method calculates an estimated period profit/loss value for the selected sub-plurality of marketing mix variables, for each of the time periods.
- the computer method calculates a total estimated profit/loss value, based on a sum of the estimated profit/loss values over all of the time periods.
- the method selects another sub-plurality of marketing mix variables, representing another marketing strategy, and calculates another estimated total profit/loss value for that selected sub-plurality of marketing mix variables.
- the method repeats the step of selecting another sub-plurality of marketing mix variables until a predetermined portion of the marketing mix variables have been selected, and thereby generates a corresponding plurality of estimated total profit/loss values. Then, based on which of the estimated total profit/loss values is the largest, the method determines an optimal profit yielding marketing strategy, as represented by the sub-plurality of marketing mix variables corresponding to the largest profit/loss value.
- a further embodiment of the invention initializes, for each selection of a sub-plurality of marketing mix variables, an allocated cash value, representing an initial cash available from the Finance division for use by the Marketing and Operations divisions in carrying out the marketing strategy corresponding to the selected sub-plurality of marketing mix variables.
- This embodiment updates the allocated cash value for each of the plurality of time periods, based on the accumulated sum of the period of the estimated period profit/loss values for all of the previous time periods.
- the embodiment sets a viability value for each selected sub-plurality of marketing mix variables, based on the updating of the allocated cash value over the plurality of time periods.
- the viability value represents the economic feasibility of the corresponding sub-plurality of marketing mix variables.
- An example sequence of events, as modeled by the method of the present invention, is as follows: An outstanding order due for a particular time period is received.
- the Finance division reviews the firm's inventory position for each brand and its cash on-hand.
- the Finance division allocates a portion of the cash on-hand to the Marketing and the Operations divisions.
- the Marketing division uses its allocated funds to develop and implement a marketing strategy to maximize its profits, based on the present method for estimating the total revenue and total inventory maintenance cost for the aggregate of brands it sells, as a function of each feasible marketing strategy, together with the direct cost for implementing the strategy.
- the Operations division uses its allocated funds to determine base stock levels, as a function of the marketing strategy, that minimize inventory holding and purchasing costs over all brands it manufactures.
- the customer demands are then observed over the period and finally, at the end of the period, the inventory holding costs are assessed.
- the inventory holding costs are based in part on how much the customer demand, which is driven in part by the selecting marketing strategy, falls short of the base stock level.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of the information and control flow according to the present invention between the computer model's Finance, Marketing, and Operation divisions of a firm;
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of the market strategy optimization method of the invention.
- the objective of the present invention is to select a marketing strategy that maximizes a firm's profits over a planning horizon.
- the present invention assumes that the firm starts with a given amount of cash on hand, which bounds its costs throughout the planning horizon.
- the optimal marketing strategy therefore must, in addition to maximizing the firm's profits, maintain all expenditures on the marketing strategy within a predetermined budget.
- the present invention models a firm as being in a competitive market comprising several firms selling products within a category.
- a firm in this market sells one or more brands of products within this category.
- Each customer in this market belongs to one of the several segments based on his/her purchasing behavior.
- Firms employ different promotional and pricing strategies for the brands they sell.
- the invention assumes each firm knows the total size of the market for this category and is responsible for its promotion and pricing strategies.
- a firm's pricing and promotion strategy will affect its relative market share (and profit) but will not affect total category sales.
- the present method models intra-firm interactions.
- the present method assumes that the firm consists of three divisions, Marketing, Operations, and Finance. The method further assumes that the firm operates in a centralized mode, with the Marketing, Operations, and Finance divisions making coordinated decisions.
- the present invention recognizes a need for coordinated decision-making, in that the Finance division must allocate working capital, i.e., cash, efficiently to the Marketing and Operations divisions in order to maximize the firm's profits.
- the Marketing division uses the allocated cash for its marketing campaigns, such as promotions and advertising.
- both the Finance division and the Marketing division operate as a profit center. The objective of a profit center is to maximize profits given a finite resource of working capital, or cash.
- the Operations division is a cost center of the firm.
- the Operations division uses the cash allocated to it from the Finance division to purchase raw materials, to manufacture the items, and to pay for holding safety stocks of its brands.
- the objective is to minimize its costs.
- the marketing strategy must, therefore, be determined jointly by the three divisions of the firm.
- the Finance division 10 allocates cash to the Marketing division 12 for advertising and promotion campaigns for each brand sold by the firm, and to the Operations division 14 to purchase inventory and carry safety stock levels of each brand.
- the Marketing division 12 communicates the functional relationship between the marketing mix variables for each brand and their demands to the Finance and the Operations divisions 10 and 14. This functional relationship is based, according to the method of the present invention, on the integrated consumer choice and market share model, hereafter called the Garg Integrated Consumer Choice and Market Share Model, described by the co-pending application Ser. No. 09/032,527, Integrated Marketing and Operations Decision-making Under Multi-brand Competition, filed Feb. 27, 1998, to Amit Garg, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
- the marketing strategy adopted by the firm determines the levels of marketing mix variables for the brands it sells.
- the Operations division 14 uses a causal demand information derived from the Garg Integrated Consumer Choice and Market Share Model to characterize the demand distribution for each brand. As described by the above-identified and incorporated co-pending application Ser. No. 09/032,527, to Amit Garg, this demand distribution is used to set base stock levels, identified herein as S jt , for inventory management by the Operations division.
- the Operations division 14 then communicates its supply capability and base stock levels to the Marketing and Finance divisions 12 and 10, respectively.
- the Marketing division 12 then, utilizing the base stock level and supply capability information from the Operations division 14, that information being based on the functional relationships communicated by the Marketing division 12, and the cash from the Finance division 10, determines a marketing strategy.
- the variable X kjt denotes the level of marketing mix variable k 1 for brand j in period t
- X t denotes the matrix of marketing mix variables for all brands in period t.
- the variable X -jt denotes the vector of levels of marketing mix variables for brand j in period t.
- X -jt represents the marketing strategy of brand j in period t
- X t represents the marketing strategies for all brands in period t.
- the model assumes that marketing strategies X t are drawn from X, a finite K ⁇ B-dimensional space for feasible values of X kjt .
- Z jt (X t ) is the random variable denoting the sales of brand j in period t and is a function of marketing strategies for all brands in that period.
- z jt (X) is assumed to be quasi-concave in X and z jt (X) ⁇ j,t and X ⁇ X.
- G t is the on-hand cash at the beginning of period t before any decisions are made.
- C kj (.) is the cost of maintaining marketing mix variable k for brand j at level x.
- C kj (.) is assumed to be non-decreasing.
- S jt is the base stock level for brand j in period t.
- I jt (S jt ) is the average on-hand inventory for brand j in period t, and is a function of the base stock level.
- h j is the unit inventory holding cost per period for brand j.
- m t is the total category sales in period t.
- ⁇ is the fill-rate requirement for all brands sold by the firm.
- c j is the unit cost of brand j.
- l jt is the number of units of brand j ordered in period t.
- F denotes the set of brands sold by the firm, F.OR right. ⁇ 1, . . . , B ⁇ .
- the Operations division 14 uses the causal demand information derived from the integrated consumer choice model and market share model to characterize the demand distribution for each brand.
- the demand distribution is used to set base stock levels for each brand.
- Operations division 14 communicates its supply capability and safety stock levels to the Marketing 12 and Finance 10 divisions.
- P The firm's optimization problem will be termed "P" and is written, for this example, as ##EQU1## where P is subject to ##EQU2##
- the function (1) is also termed as the "objective function.” The following can be seen regarding the optimization function (1).
- the objective function is the sum over time of the difference between the revenue in a period and the total expenses incurred by the firm in the period.
- the objective function does not explicitly consider the cash on-hand. As a result, it will always be in the firm's interest to utilize its cash to the maximum possible extent because holding excess cash in a period does not yield any benefits.
- the objective function (1) implicitly assumes items to have zero salvage value at the end of the horizon and that all back-ordered demands in period T are lost.
- the components of the objective function, equation (1) are as follows:
- X 1jt z jt (X t ) is the revenue from sales of brand j in period t
- ##EQU3## is the cost of implementing a marketing strategy for brand j in period t
- c j l jt is the cost of purchasing inventory of brand j in period t
- h j I jt (S jt ) is the inventory holding cost for brand j in period t.
- Equation (2) is the cash balance constraint.
- Equation (3) is the fill-rate requirements for all brands sold by the firm, equation (4) is the initial amount of on-hand cash, and equation (5) is the end condition whereby no orders are placed in the last period of the horizon.
- the functional relationships z jt (X t ) and I jt (S jt ) are defined according to an integrated consumer choice and marketing mix model consistent with the Garg Integrated Consumer and Market Segment Model described by the above-identified and incorporated co-pending Application Ser. No. 09/032,526, to Amit Garg.
- the integrated consumer choice and marketing mix model is formed, for purposes of this invention, by the example system shown and described at said co-pending Application.
- This example embodiment of the invention assumes that purchases of a brand by each household follow a Poisson distribution. Let ⁇ jht be the weekly quantity of brand j purchased by households belonging to segment h in period t. Since purchases of each consumer within the segment follow a Poisson distribution, total weekly purchases of brand j by consumers in segment h in period t, X jht , also has a Poisson distribution with mean
- ⁇ ht is a measure of the overall weekly quantities purchased by consumers in segment h in period t
- S jt is the relative market share of brand j in segment h in period t.
- Relative market share of a brand within a segment will, for this example, be expressed as: ##EQU4## where A jht is the attraction of brand j to consumers in segment h in period t.
- X kit is the value of the k th explanatory variable or the marketing mix variable for brand j at time period t(e.g., price for brand j);
- ⁇ kjit .sup.(h) is the parameter to be estimated
- the model defined above is very general. Further, the model allows for asymmetric cross-competitive influences of other brands available in the market.
- the first term on the right-hand side represents the direct competitive effect of brand j's actions on the market share of brand i.
- the second term represents the indirect effect of brand i's actions on the market share of brand i, while the third term q h represents the indirect competitive effect due to all other brands.
- the total market-share elasticities at time period t can be expressed as functions of the segment level market-share elasticities derived above. ##EQU9## where q ht is the expected relative volume of segment h in period t. q ht , for all t, will be expressed as ##EQU10##
- Y jt is the market share of brand j in period t, for all t, i.e., ##EQU11##
- the optimal base stock levels S jt are computed. The computation is based on the objective of each brand manager being to stock the minimum amount of inventory required to satisfy customer service requirements represented by fill rates. It is assumed, for purposes of this description, that the fill rates for all brands are the same. Further, since demands for brands are correlated, one cannot determine base stock levels for each brand independently.
- the resulting problem for determining the base stock levels can, however, be formulated according to the following non-linear program, (PT): ##EQU16## with (PT) subject to the following:
- h it is the unit holding cost per period for items of brand i
- I it (S it ) is the average on-hand inventory of brand i over period t, which is a function of base stock level, S it , of the brand at time t
- ⁇ is the fill-rate requirement for the brands.
- the joint probability function in constraint (19) can be computed using Property 1.
- Optimal base stock levels can be computed using a simple search procedure.
- the procedure for determining the base stock level of brands belonging to the firm is similar to the determination of base stock levels for all brands.
- the results of determining the base stock levels for all brands will apply once the marginal distribution of brands belonging to the firm, i.e., for i ⁇ F, is obtained, where F is the set of brands belonging to the firm.
- F is the set of brands belonging to the firm.
- An inventory model under imperfect information is a generalization of the perfect information case and is more realistic because firms usually do not know the exact strategy their competitors will adopt. Uncertainty in firms' actions can be modeled by associating a probability distribution with each marketing mix variable, X kjt .
- FIG. 2 is an example flow diagram for the present method.
- the method shown FIG. 2 executes equation (1) to find, for a given amount of working cash, which of a finite set marketing strategies yields the highest profit for the firm.
- the process starts at block 100, which initializes the set F, defined above as the set of brands sold by the firm, F.OR right. ⁇ 1, . . . , B ⁇ , the X matrix, defined above as a finite K ⁇ B-dimensional space for feasible values of X kjt
- the start block 100 also initializes C kj (.), defined above as the cost of maintaining marketing mix variable k for brand j at level x; the variable G t , defined above as the on-hand cash at the beginning of period t before any decisions are made; the variables h j , defined above as the unit inventory holding cost per period for brand j; the variables C j , defined above as the unit cost of brand j
- FIG. 2 example proceeds to block 102 which represents the Finance division's function of allocating all available cash at the beginning of time period t to the Marketing division's strategy devising functions of block 104 and to the Operation division's stock replenishment functions of block 106.
- Blocks 104 and 106 then implement the optimization function P defined by equation (1) above, which is: ##EQU21## subject to the conditions defined by equations (2) through (5).
- the estimated ordering cost, c j l jt , and the inventory cost, h j I j (S jt ) are calculated by the Operations division, at block 106, using the example operations and modules shown by FIG. 3 of the above-identified and incorporated co-pending Application Ser. No. 09/032,527, to Amit Garg, and described in further detail below.
- the Marketing division and the Operations division co-operatively carry out the optimization function P.
- G 1 g.
- the expected demand, z jt (X t ), calculated at block 104, is calculated using the Garg Integrated Consumer Choice and Market Share Model of the above-identified and incorporated co-pending application Ser. No. 09/032,527, in accordance with Properties 1.1 through 1.4 defined hereinabove.
- the estimated demand, z jt (X t ), of the j th brand is based on the marketing strategy for all of the B brands, not just the j th brand.
- block 104 calculates the cash income from sales, X 1jt z jt (X t ), for the particular period t, which is a term of equation (1).
- the cost C kj is initialized at block 100.
- Block 104 also passes the calculated demand z jt (X t ) to the Operations division of block 106. Based on that demand, block 106 calculates the base stock level S jt , which the Operations division 14 uses for inventory control operations, including generation of orders, using, for example, the operations and modules shown by FIG. 3 of the above-identified co-pending Application Ser. No. 09/032,527, filed Feb. 27, 1998, to Amit Garg. The Operations division then calculates an estimated average on-hand inventory, I jt (S jt ), as a function of the base stock level S jt .
- the Operations division calculates the estimated inventory cost for the j th brand, which is h j I jt (S jt ) appearing in equation (1), that results from the estimated demand z jt (X t ) which, in turn, results from the Marketing division's selected marketing strategy X jt .
- the operation also uses the estimated demand z jt (X t ) and the base stock level S jt to calculate the estimated cost for placing orders for brand j over time period t, which is the c j l jt cost term of equation (1) defined above.
- FIG. 2 represents that summing as block 108, although it can be incorporated into either of blocks 104 and 106.
- the ordering cost, c j l jt , and the inventory cost h j I jt (S jt ), calculated by the Operation division at block 106 can be passed back to the Marketing division block 104 for summing the cost and profit terms with the [ ] brackets of equation (1), or the Marketing block 104 can pass the marketing mix variable cost C kj (X kjt ) and cash income value X 1jt z jt (X t ) values to the Operations division block 106 to perform the summing.
