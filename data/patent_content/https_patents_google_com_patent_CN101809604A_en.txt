Embodiment
Fig. 1 is the block diagram of the example embodiment of online advertising system 100.In some embodiments, one or more advertisers 102 can in ad system 104, import directly or indirectly, maintenance and track ad (" ad ") information.Advertisement can be with following form: such as advertisement of one or more combinations of the graphical advertisement of banner, plain text advertisement, image ad, audio advertisement, video ads, any such assembly etc.Advertisement also can comprise embedded information, such as the executable instruction of link, metamessage and/or machine.The request that one or more publishers 106 can submit to advertisement to system 104.The publisher 106 (or with send the browser that requesting users is associated) that system 104 sends to advertisement by (for example when the issue that is associated is presented) request of sending responds with the one or more placement/colocated that go up in publisher's the web belongings that is presented (for example content of website and other net distribution).Though mention advertisement, can provide other content item by system 104.
Whether other entities such as user 108 and advertiser 102 can provide use information to system 104, advance to take place such as conversion relevant with advertisement or point.
Point advances can be for example to take place when the user of subscriber equipment selects advertisement or clicks in advertisement.Click-through rate can be the effect measurement that obtains by with the number of times of being sent divided by advertisement at advertisement or the number of users that chains click that is associated with advertisement.For example, if an advertisement has been sent 100 times, and three people click in this advertisement, and the click-through rate that then is used for this advertisement is 3%.
" conversion " takes place when the user for example finishes the transaction relevant with the advertisement of before having distributed.The content that constitutes conversion can be according to circumstances and different, and can determine in many ways.
This use information can comprise the measured or observed user behavior relevant with the advertisement of having distributed.System 104 carries out financial transaction, such as paying and charge to advertiser 102 to publisher 106 based on use information.
Computer network 110 such as Local Area Network, wide area network (WAN), the Internet or its combination connects advertiser 102, system 104, publisher 106 and user 108.
An example of publisher 106 is conventional content server, and it receives the request to content (for example, article, discussion topic, music, video, figure, Search Results, webpage are included, feed information etc.), and the content of being asked in response to the request retrieval.Content server can be with the Advertisement Server of the request of advertisement being submitted in the system 104.Ad-request can comprise the quantity of desired advertisement.Ad-request can also comprise content request message.This information can comprise content itself (for example page or other content document), with the corresponding classification of interior perhaps content requests (for example, art, commerce, computing machine, art-film, art-music etc.), content requests partly or entirely, content age, content type (for example, text, figure, video, audio frequency, mixed-media etc.), geographical location information etc.
What in some embodiments, content server can be with the content of being asked and the advertisement that is provided by system 104 is one or more combined.The content of this combination and advertisement can be sent to the user 108 of request content to show in reader (for example browser or other content display system).Content server can send back Advertisement Server with the information about advertisement, and described information comprises describing how treat, present advertisement (for example with HTML or JavaScript when and/or where
TM) information.
Another example published person 106 is search services.Search service can receive the inquiry to Search Results.In response, search service can be from the index of the document index of webpage (for example from) retrieve relevant search results.S.Brin and L.Page deliver on the SeventhInternational World Wide Web Conference (the 7th international web-seminar) that Brisbane ,Australia is held paper " The Anatomy of a Large-Scale HypertextualSearch Engine (analyzing extensive hypertext search engine) " and U.S. Patent No. 6,285, the examplar search service has been described, at this full content of each that merges both by reference in 999.The extracts of the text that Search Results can comprise the tabulation of web page title for example, extract from those webpages and the hypertext link of pointing to those webpages, and can be grouped in the Search Results of predetermined quantity (for example 10).
Search service can will be submitted to system 104 to the request of advertisement.Request can comprise the quantity of desired advertisement.Size and dimension of the screen that this quantity can depend on Search Results, occupied by Search Results or the page empty area of a room, advertisement etc.In some embodiments, the quantity of desired advertisement will be from 1 to 10 or from 3 to 5.Request to advertisement can also comprise (as being transfused to or resolved) inquiry, based on information inquiring (such as geographical location information, inquiry whether from the member and member's identifier) and/or be associated with Search Results or based on the information of Search Results.The proper vector of the full text of the extracts of the text that such information can comprise for example relevant with Search Results identifier (for example document identifier or " docID "), the score value (for example information retrieval (" IR ") score value) relevant with Search Results, extract from the document of being discerned (for example webpage), the document of being discerned, the document of being discerned etc.In some embodiments, the IR score value can calculate from for example waiting with the combination of dot product, page rank score value and/or the IR score value of inquiry and the corresponding proper vector of document and page rank score value.
Search service can be with Search Results and the advertisement that provides by system 104 one or more combined.This combined information can be forwarded to the user 108 of request content then.Search Results can be maintained as and be different from advertisement, in order to avoid the user is in paid advertisement be speculated as to produce between the neutral Search Results and obscure.
At last, search service can with and advertisement relevant with advertisement when, where and/or the information how to be presented send back system 104.
As understanding from aforementioned, Advertising Management System 104 can be publisher's 106 services such as content server and search service.System 104 allows to be directed to distributing by the advertisement of content server or the content (for example document) distributed in response to customer-furnished search inquiry.For example, network or internet can comprise the Advertisement Server of distributing targeted ads in response to the request of the search service that carries the advertisement position that is used to sell.Suppose that the internet is a WWW.Search service is climbed and is got a large amount of or all contents.Some of this content will comprise available advertisement position (being also referred to as " storage vault ").More specifically, one or more content servers can comprise one or more documents.Document can comprise webpage, Email, content, embedded information (for example embedded media), metamessage and executable instruction of machine and available advertisement position.Be inserted into advertisement in the advertisement position in the document and can when distributing document, change at every turn or can have as an alternative static related with given document.
In one embodiment, ad system 104 can comprise the auction process of selecting advertisement.Can allow the advertiser that the advertiser is willing to select or bid for the amount of money of paying of clicking each time of advertisement, the described amount of money is each capital sum of clicking into of advertisers pay when for example the user clicks in advertisement for example.In one embodiment, click cost at every turn and can comprise maximum each cost of clicking, for example the advertiser is willing to be the maximum dollar amount of clicking payment each time of advertisement.For example, advertiser A, B, C all select separately or maximum each cost of clicking of the $1.00, $.60 Yi Ji $.60 that bids.Maximum dollar amount that advertiser A will click payment for each maximum dollar amount $1.00, maximum dollar amount that advertiser B will click payment for each maximum dollar amount $.60, and the advertiser C maximum dollar amount maximum dollar amount $.60 that will click payment for each.
Such as position or rank in the advertisement of the other display ads where of Search Results can be to click the function that cost multiply by the click-through rate that is associated with advertisement at every turn.
In one embodiment, the rank of advertisement can maximum each clicked the click-through rate that cost multiply by advertisement and determine by what will be used for advertisement.Advertisement can be placed among other advertisement with the order of the rank that increases or reduce then.For example, the click-through rate of supposing advertiser A, B, C is respectively " 10% ", " 8% " and " 3% ".The rank of advertisement A, B and C can be determined according to per thousand costs that flash of maximum estimated (eCPM) of each advertisement.Can calculate per thousand costs that flash of maximum estimated as getting off:
A: the maximum each cost=.10x$1.00.10=.1 that clicks of maximum eCPM=CTR x
B: the maximum each cost=.08x$.60=.048 that clicks of maximum eCPM=CTR x
C: the maximum each cost=.03x$.60=.018 that clicks of maximum eCPM=CTR x
Can come with the descending of per thousand costs that flash of maximum estimated the advertiser is carried out rank, as follows:
1.A
2.B
3.C
In some embodiments, advertisement cannot be promoted unless threshold value is satisfied in advertisement.In some embodiments, promoting advertisement can comprise advertisement is located in the more obvious position.For example can advertisement be placed on the Search Results top in response to search inquiry.In one embodiment, the popularization advertisement comprises to the user shows advertisement, and the advertisement of not promoted can not showed to the user.Can for example promote advertisement according to following formula:
CTR* auctions CPC＞T
In one embodiment, the each cost of clicking of auction is that position with advertisement remains on necessary price on the next advertisement.In order to determine the each cost of clicking of auction, system 104 can determine that the rank that will equate with the advertiser in position 2 gives the advertiser in position 1 its price that must pay.System 104 is added to this amount of money with the predetermined dollar value of Li Ru $.01 then.The auction of advertisement is clicked cost at every turn and can be flashed for per thousand times based on the maximum estimated of the click-through rate of advertisement and below advertisement and determine originally.In order to determine the each cost of clicking of auction, the maximum estimated that system 104 can be used in the advertisement below the current advertisement click-through rate of cost of flashing for per thousand times divided by current advertisement.System 104 is added to this amount of money with the predetermined dollar value of Li Ru $.01 then.The final amount of money is auction CPC.
Last advertiser in ranked list can pay the minimum position that remained on originally in the tabulation of at every turn clicking.For example, suppose that minimum each click cost is $.20.Cost is clicked in the auction that can determine advertiser A, B and C as getting off at every turn:
The click-through rate of the maximum eCPM/A of A:(B)/1000=(.048/.1)=$.48+$.01=$.49
The click-through rate of the maximum eCPM/B of B:(C)/1000=(.018/.08)=$.23+$.01=$.24
C: minimum each cost=$.20 that clicks
Therefore, it is $.49 that cost is clicked in the auction of A at every turn, and it is $.24 that cost is clicked in the auction of B at every turn, and the auction of C to click cost be $.20 at every turn.
If threshold value is .02, then can determine according to above-mentioned formula CTR* auction CPC＞T whether advertisement is promoted, as follows:
A：.1*$.49＝.049＞.02
B:.08*$.24=.0192 is not more than .02
C:.03*$.20=.006 is not more than .02
Therefore, in this example, because advertisement A is the unique advertisement that surpasses threshold value .02, so unique advertisement that advertisement A will be promoted.After this, collect auction to advertiser A and click into capital sum at every turn.
In some embodiments, in order to make maximize revenue, ad system 104 can use different formula to determine whether to satisfy threshold value to be defined as actual each cost of clicking that each advertisement is collected.
Fig. 2 is the block diagram of exemplary contents filtering system 200.Content filtering system 200 can be for example realize in computer equipment or one or more computer equipments of connecting by network, and described network is Local Area Network or such as the wide area network (WAN) of the Internet for example.Content filtering system 200 can for example be realized in the ad system 104 that can realize in computing system.One or more computing equipments can for example comprise the memory device of stores processor instruction and the treatment facility that is used to carry out processing instruction.Illustrate and described an example calculations system with reference to figure 8.Yet, also can use other embodiment.
Except that content item being filtered with the subclass that is limited with the content item that qualification represents in representing environment, content filtering system 200 can be determined and each actual each cost of clicking that is associated of content item.
Content filtering system 200 can be for example filters to select the subclass according to the content item of auction process rank content item.Subclass can be selected based on the parameter that is associated with each advertisement, and described parameter is the each click cost and/or the click-through rate of each advertisement for example.Have only advertisement in representing environment, to show to the user for the part of selected subclass.
Content filtering system 200 can for example comprise filter engine 202 and content item data storage 204.In one embodiment, content item data storage 204 can comprise the single data storage such as hard drive.In another embodiment, content-data storage 204 can comprise Distributed Storage, such as the storage system that distributes by network.Yet, also can use other embodiment.
In one embodiment, content-data storage 204 can be stored one or more advertisements.Each advertisement in content-data storage 204 can be associated with one or more parameters 206,208 and 210.Parameter 206,208 and 210 each can be associated with effect measurement, for example click-through rate, conversion, auction tolerance, click cost etc. at every turn.In one embodiment, content filtering system 200 can monitor and/or assessment and content-data storage 204 in the relevant effect data of content item.For example, each advertising effect in the content-data storage 204 can be assessed described effect measurement such as click-through rate, conversion ratio or some other tolerance based on the effect measurement that is associated with advertisement.In one embodiment, content filtering system 200 can also monitor and/or assessment and content-data storage 204 in the relevant auction data of content item.Each advertisement in the content-data storage 204 can be measured based on the auction that is associated with advertisement and be assessed, and described auction tolerance is such as each click cost.
In one embodiment, the each click cost that is associated with advertisement can be that maximum each click cost, auction are clicked cost at every turn or kept and click cost at every turn.As mentioned above, maximum each click cost is that the advertiser is the maximum dollar amount that the one click in its advertisement will be paid.As mentioned above, the each cost of clicking of auction is that position with advertisement remains on necessary price on the next advertisement.Keeping each cost of clicking is to promote the also required minimum each cost of clicking of display ads to the user.
Also can use such as other effect measurement in residence time at landing page place etc.Effect measurement can be that for example income is relevant or non-income is relevant.In another embodiment, effect measurement can be resolved according to the time, and for example may to be determined to be in weekend very high, medium in evening on ordinary days for the effect of specific content item, and very low in the morning and afternoon on ordinary days.
In one embodiment, filter engine 202 can be identified for the threshold measurement 212 of advertisement.Threshold measurement 212 can be used to determine whether show (or popularization) advertisement to the user.Threshold measurement 212 and the filtration threshold value of selecting 214 can be compared to determine whether advertisement is selected as in the subclass of advertisement.
In one embodiment, threshold measurement 212 can be determined based on the one or more parameters 206,208 that are associated with advertisement and 210.Threshold measurement 212 can be for example separately any one in the operation parameter 206,208,210 or with it with other function of for example exponential function with set of variables is incompatible determines.Threshold measurement 212 for example operation parameter click-through rate was determined with click originally at every turn.
In another embodiment, threshold measurement 212 can be clicked original definite by making the quality score involution index quality score inferior and the involution index is inferior multiply by the inferior maximum of involution index at every turn.For example, if exponential quantity is " x " and " y ", then threshold measurement 212 can be determined according to following formula:
T_advertisement＝QS_advertisement^x*max_CPC_advertisement^y
Wherein T_advertisement is a threshold measurement, and QS_advertisement is the quality score of advertisement, and max_CPC_advertisement is maximum each cost of clicking of advertisement.
Quality score can be to be used to measure the quality and the correlativity of advertisement and to determine minimum each basis of clicking cost.Quality score can for example be determined by the click-through rate of advertisement, the correlativity of advertisement text, whole historical keyword effect and the user experience on the landing page that is associated with advertisement.
In one embodiment, quality score can be calculated according to following formula:
QS_advertisement＝CTR_advertisement^a*GoodClick_advertisement^b
Wherein QS_advertisement is the quality score of advertisement, CTR_advertisement is the click-through rate of advertisement, and if GoodClick_advertisement the user is clicked in advertisement then whether the user can like the prediction of the website that is associated with this advertisement.
GoodClick_advertisement can be as at the common unsettled U. S. application sequence number 10/321 that is entitled as " Using estimated adqualities for ad filtering; ranking and promotion (ad quality of estimating is used for advertisement filter, rank and popularization) ", that describes in 064 calculates, and is merged by reference at this.
In another embodiment, threshold measurement 212 can be determined according to following formula:
T_advertisement＝CTR_advertisement^x*max_CPC_advertisement^y
Wherein T_advertisement is a threshold measurement, and CTR_advertisement is the click-through rate of advertisement, and max_CPC_advertisement is maximum each cost of clicking of advertisement.
In one embodiment, filter engine 202 can determine whether threshold measurement 212 surpasses filtration threshold value 214 and determine to come filtering advertisements according to this.
In one embodiment, filter engine 202 can be for example based on the advertisement historical data associated, and, determine to filter threshold value 214 and exponential quantity x and y by selecting to produce for example expectation or most promising simulated data filtration threshold value 214 and exponential quantity.Historical data can for example comprise the preceding value of the parameter that is associated with advertisement.For example, historical data can comprise the previous click-through rate that is associated with advertisement.Advertisement can be associated with one or more click-through rates based on previous effect.For example, As time goes on the click-through rate of advertisement can change and increase or reduce.Historical data can also comprise the previous quality score that is associated with advertisement.Advertisement can be associated with one or more quality score based on previous effect.
Historical data can also comprise the previous each cost of clicking that for example is associated with advertisement.As time goes on each click cost of advertisement can for example increase or reduce.The advertiser can for example determine whether to reduce or increase this advertiser is the amount of money of the click in advertisement with payment.
Determine that based on the historical data relevant filtration threshold value 214 and exponential quantity can for example comprise that generating simulation filters threshold value and analog function (for example exponential quantity of x and y) with advertisement.By generate filtration threshold value 214 and the exponential quantity that simulated data and selection produce most promising/worth simulated data of expecting based on simulation filtration threshold value and simulation exponential quantity, filter engine 202 can determine to filter threshold value 214 and exponential quantity based on the historical data relevant with advertisement.Filter engine 202 can for example use with the advertisement historical data associated and generate simulated data 216, described and advertisement historical data associated such as previous click-through rate and each cost of clicking, and simulation filtration threshold value and simulation exponential quantity.Simulate the filtration threshold value and can be used to the simulate effect scheme, wherein threshold measurement 212 and simulation filtration threshold value are compared with definite threshold measurement of simulating 212 whether surpass simulation filtration threshold value, and income and quality that generation is expected are estimated.Actual threshold and exponential quantity x and y can select based on maximum return value and/or biggest quality target.
For example, the training set of the historical data relevant with the advertising effect that is not filtered can be utilized to generate modeling scheme based on the filtration threshold value and the exponential quantity of simulation.Advertising effect after the filtration can be modeled estimated income or gain of quality.For example, can be to the variation modeling on the probability of selecteed advertisement under lacking by the situation of the advertisement of actual selection; Can be to the variation modeling on the probability of selecteed advertisement under existing not by the situation of other advertisement of actual selection; Or the like.
In one embodiment, filter engine 202 can compare simulated data and historical data, and relatively makes filtration threshold value 214 and exponential quantity x and y optimization based on this.For example, filter engine 202 can relatively be carried out iterative modeling based on this and make filtration threshold value optimization.Make and filter the threshold value optimization and can comprise for example adjusting and filter threshold value 214, make still less or more advertisement is filtered.Iterative modeling can be utilized to one or more in estimated income gain or the gain of quality.
In one embodiment, can change the value of filtering threshold value 214 at any time.For example, can be weekly, every month, bimonthly etc. ground changes and filters threshold value.In one embodiment, the value of filtration threshold value 214 can make according to advertiser's budget and be used for changing.For example, the advertiser can assigned budget indicates the maximum dollar amount of the money that will spend in amount sometime advertisement or the propaganda activity.For example, first advertiser can be chosen as propaganda activity payment in every month first amount of money; Second advertiser can be chosen as propaganda activity payment in every month second amount of money.
If the advertiser budget relevant with the advertisement that is not filtered according to filtration threshold value 214 is depleted, the qualified number of ads that then is used to show can be depleted equally.Therefore, filter engine 202 can for example be adjusted in this case and filter threshold value 214 and show with the advertisement that allows bigger quantity qualified being used for that become.
In one embodiment, filter threshold value 214 if the threshold measurement of advertisement 212 surpasses, then filter engine 202 can be promoted this advertisement.Promote advertisement and allow filter engine 202 display ads in content item show surroundings 222.Not having the advertisement that surpasses the threshold measurement 212 that filters threshold value 214 cannot be promoted, and will can not be shown in environment 222.
In one embodiment, can be flashed originally for per thousand times according to the maximum estimated of advertisement after promoting in advertisement rank was carried out in advertisement.The maximum estimated cost that flashes for per thousand times can use one or more parameters 206,208 and 210 to determine.The maximum estimated cost that flashes for per thousand times can be for example multiply by the maximum that is associated with advertisement by the click-through rate that will be associated with advertisement as mentioned above and clicked at every turn and determine originally.In one embodiment, this result can be multiply by 1000 then.The cost that for example maximum estimated can be flashed for per thousand times compares with per thousand costs that flash of maximum estimated that have other advertisement that surpasses the threshold measurement 212 that filters threshold value 214 equally, and can carry out rank according to the maximum estimated cost that flashes for per thousand times to advertisement by rank engine 220.Can be in the advertisement of rank shown in the content item show surroundings 222 of for example web browser page.Can carry out rank to advertisement according to the descending order of per thousand costs that flash of maximum estimated of each advertisement.The behavior that the user takes in show surroundings 222 can influence the one or more of parameter 206,208 and 210, and therefore influence rank or displaying subsequently.
In one embodiment, pricing engine 216 can be based on one or more parameters 206,208 and 210 and filter actual each cost of clicking that threshold value is identified for advertisement.If being promoted, advertisement can determine actual each cost of clicking.In case actual each to click cost can for example be advertisement is promoted to the amount of money of collecting with this advertisement associated advertisement master.
In one embodiment, determine that actual each cost of clicking comprises that discern the auction that is associated with advertisement clicks cost at every turn.Auction is each, and to click cost can be that position with advertisement remains on necessary price on the advertisement of next lower grading.In order to determine the each cost of clicking of auction, pricing engine 216 can determine that the rank that will equate with the advertiser in position 2 gives the advertiser in position 1 its price that must pay.Pricing engine is added to this amount of money with the predetermined dollar value of Li Ru $.01 then.The auction of advertisement is clicked cost at every turn and can be was for example flashed for per thousand times based on the maximum estimated of the click-through rate of advertisement and below advertisement and determine originally.In order to determine the each cost of clicking of auction, the maximum estimated that pricing engine 216 can be used in the advertisement below the current advertisement is flashed cost for per thousand times divided by the click-through rate of current advertisement, and predetermined dollar value is added to (for example Jia Shang $.01) this amount of money.The final amount of money is clicked cost for auction is each.
In one embodiment, the maximum estimated of the advertisement below being used in current advertisement is flashed for per thousand times after the click-through rate of cost divided by current advertisement, uses this numeral divided by 1000 then.Pricing engine 216 can be added to $.01 this amount of money then.In one embodiment, if there is not the advertiser to be present under the current advertiser, then to click cost be the minimum each cost of clicking that is provided with by pricing engine 216 at every turn in current advertiser's auction.In another embodiment, no matter whether advertisement is promoted, and can calculate the each cost of clicking of auction for each advertisement.In one embodiment, if the each cost of clicking of auction is lower than the minimum each cost of clicking that is provided with by pricing engine 216, then collect minimum each cost of clicking to the advertiser.
In one embodiment, determine that actual each cost of clicking comprises that discern the reservation that is associated with advertisement clicks cost at every turn.Keeping each cost of clicking is to promote the required minimum dollar amount of advertisement.Pricing engine 216 can be by calculating the each cost of clicking of reservation with filtering threshold value 214 divided by the click-through rate of advertisement.Pricing engine 216 is added to this amount of money with second predetermined dollar value (Li Ru $.01) then.This final amount of money is for keeping each cost of clicking.
In one embodiment, pricing engine 216 can be chosen as the actual cost of click at every turn that is used for advertisement with the each the greater clicked in the cost of reservation with the each cost of clicking of auction.As will be described below, can be when each user clicks in advertiser 106 advertisement to collecting the each click of auction cost and keep each the greater of clicking in the cost with advertisement associated advertisement master 106, for example reality is clicked cost at every turn.
Fig. 3 is that example is filtered and list 300.Table 300 has been described the filtration of advertisement AD1, AD2 and AD3 and price, and, for example click cost at every turn, keep and click cost and the each cost of clicking of reality at every turn as click-through rate indicated in click-through rate row 302, maximum CPC row 304, QS row 306, maximum eCPM row 308, auction CPC row 310, reservation CPC row 312 and actual CPC row 314, maximum each click cost, quality score, per thousand costs that flash of maximum estimated, auction based on one or more parameters.
As shown in Figure 3, advertisement AD1, AD2 and AD3 have the click-through rate of 10%, 8% and 3% correspondence, maximum each quality score of clicking the correspondence of cost rate and .1 .08 and .03 of the correspondence of Ju You $1.00, $.60 and $0.60 respectively respectively.Can determine as listed threshold measurement in threshold measurement row 316 among the advertisement AD1-AD3 each.Threshold measurement can be for example determine based on parameter quality score value and maximum each cost parameter of clicking, for example QS^x*max_CPC^y.In this example, x and y are " 1 ".
Whether the threshold measurement that filter engine 202 can for example be identified for each advertisement surpasses the filtration threshold value of listing in filtering threshold value row 318.Each of threshold measurement that is used for AD1-AD3 can be compared to determine which advertisement has and surpasses the threshold measurement that filters threshold value at filtering threshold value.In this example, advertisement AD1 and AD2 have the threshold measurement that surpasses filtration threshold value .02, for example 0.1 (.10^1*1.00^1) and .048 (.08^1*.60^1), and advertisement AD3 has and does not surpass the threshold measurement that filters threshold value .02, for example .018 (.03^1*.60^1).Therefore, as indicated by promoting row 320, advertisement AD1 and AD2 are promoted.
In some embodiments, filter engine 202 can carry out rank to advertisement based on one or more parameters.For example, rank engine 220 can carry out rank to all advertisements based on maximum eCPM (the maximum CPC of CTR*), and the value of this maximum eCPM is shown in the maximum eCPM row 308.In this example, quality score is identical with the click-through rate of each advertisement.Therefore can carry out rank to advertisement AD1-AD2.The eCPM of AD1 is .1 (.10*1.00).The eCPM of AD2 is .048 (.08*.60).Because the eCPM of AD1 is the .1 eCPM .048 for example that is higher than AD2 for example, therefore AD1 is ranked the first.Yet,, have only advertisement AD1 and AD2 to show by rank and to the user because advertisement AD3 does not have the threshold measurement that surpasses the filtration threshold value and advertisement AD3 is filtered out final displaying process.Yet, as described below, because being used to determine the auction that is used for AD2, the eCPM of AD3 clicks cost, so the eCPM of AD3 can be calculated at every turn.The eCPM of AD3 is .018 (.03*.60).
In some embodiments, after filter engine 202 determined which advertisement has the threshold measurement that surpasses the filtration threshold value and therefore obtains popularization, pricing engine 216 can and filter the each click of the reality cost that threshold value is determined advertisement based on one or more parameters.For example, pricing engine 216 can calculate as auction listed in row 310 and click cost at every turn and click cost as listed reservation in row 312 at every turn, and the higher person among both is chosen as actual each cost of clicking listed in row 314.
Pricing engine 216 can be clicked cost 310 by the auction of for example calculating AD1 with the eCPM of AD2 divided by the click-through rate of AD1 at every turn.Pricing engine can add then predetermined dollar value (Li Ru $.01) calculate the auction CPC.It is $.49 ((.048/.1)+$.01) that cost is clicked in the auction of AD1 at every turn.The auction of AD2 is clicked cost at every turn and can be calculated in the same manner.It is $.24 ((.018/.08)+$.01) that cost is clicked in the auction of AD2 at every turn.
Pricing engine 216 can by with filter threshold value divided by the click-through rate of advertisement and add predetermined dollar value ($.01) determine to keep each cost of clicking.Cost Bei Jisuanwei $.21 ((.02/.1)+$.01) is clicked in the reservation of AD1 at every turn.Cost Bei Jisuanwei $.26 ((.02/.08)+$.01) is clicked in the reservation of AD2 at every turn.
In one embodiment, pricing engine 216 can be clicked auction cost at every turn and be chosen as the each cost of clicking of reality that is used for to advertiser's charge of each advertisement with the greater that keeps in each click cost.In this example, for AD1, the each cost Li Ru $.49 that clicks of auction is higher than the each cost Li Ru $.21 that clicks of reservation.Therefore, the actual each cost of clicking that is used for AD1 is clicked Cheng Ben $.49 for auction is each.For AD2, the each cost Li Ru $.24 that clicks of auction is not higher than the each cost Li Ru $.26 that clicks of reservation.Therefore, actual each cost of clicking of AD2 is for keeping each Cheng Ben $.26 that clicks.
Can adjust the filtration threshold value in filtering threshold value row 318 in response to trigger event.For example, trigger event can be time cycle of every month for example; Trigger event can be to reduce under the proceeds indicatior, for example ad system and weekly the earnings target of being unrealized; Trigger event can be based on the availability of the advertisement of minimum number; Or some other incidents.
