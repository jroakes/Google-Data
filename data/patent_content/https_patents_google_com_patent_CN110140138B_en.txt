Detailed Description
One or more embodiments described herein relate to the determination, transmission, and storage of content data for a local device. In some implementations, upcoming predicted events are determined for a user based on programmatically analyzing user data, e.g., referenced data for people, locations, scheduled activities, and/or topics related to predicted events. For example, the predicted event may be associated with a particular geographic location and/or a particular time period (e.g., date and time, including, for example, a start time, a duration, or an end time). A set of content items, e.g., images, videos, audio clips, documents, etc., is determined, which is accessed upon a predicted event. One or more of the set of content items is determined based on the user data, and the set of content items includes content data related to the predicted event. The set of content items is transferred from the network memory to at least one local device associated with the user over the communication network prior to the time of the predicted event, wherein the set of content items is stored in the local memory of the at least one local device.
Various other features are described. For example, the predicted event may be determined to be associated with a location where access to network memory by the device is restricted, e.g., a location where access to wireless network communications is lacking, intermittent, limited, or reduced. The predicted event may be determined from user data, which may include calendar data of a user calendar, location data indicating one or more geographic locations associated with the user, a message sent by the user and including information related to one or more activities of the user, social data indicating one or more persons having social connections with the user, and one or more content items shared by the user to one or more other users. One or more persons likely to attend the predicted event may be determined based on the user data. In some implementations, known common events that are not based on user data may be determined.
The determined content item transmitted to the local device may be determined in various ways. For example, the content item may have one or more characteristics associated with a person who may be engaged in the predicted event. The content item may not have been previously communicated to those persons. The content item may include one or more images or videos having one or more detected image features related to the predicted event. The content item may include content associated with a time period of the predicted event. In some examples, the ranking of the accessible content items may be based on the relevance of the content items to the predicted event, with the content item having the highest ranking (e.g., a ranking above a threshold) being selected for inclusion in the set of content items to be transmitted to the local device. In some implementations, topics of common interest to the user and others attending the predicted event can be determined, and content items including or associated with the common interest topics can be selected. In some implementations, the content items may be public content items determined based on predicted events, or based on overall popularity of the content items or overall popularity of known associated public events.
In some implementations, the system determines a plurality of local devices (e.g., associated with users) and determines a storage distribution of the content item sets from the network storage to respective local memories of the local devices. For example, a plurality of local devices accessible to the user may be ranked and the highest ranked local device (e.g., the local device ranked above a threshold) may be selected. The ranking of the devices may be based on available local memory, the frequency with which the devices are used by the user, etc. The storage distribution of the content items may be determined based on the type of local device, the type of content item, user preferences, etc. The set of content items may remain in the local memory of the local device for at least the duration of the predicted event, and may be designated for removal from the local memory after the predicted event.
One or more features described herein allow content data items of a user that are relevant to the user's current context to be available for access on a user device from a local store of the device. For example, many users store a large portion of their content items on an online network store accessible via the internet, which provides a large amount of storage capacity, an integrated organization of the content items, and convenient access to the stored content items from any device that has access to the network store. However, network memory may not be available or readily accessible by the device, for example, at specific times or locations remote from the network transmission node, areas with poor wireless signal reception, areas with reduced network performance due to significant traffic or technical problems, etc. Alternatively, access to network memory may be reduced due to high access costs, such as being limited on an aircraft flight, during international travel, after a user has downloaded a monthly quota of data, etc. The described features allow a user's network-stored content items to be accessible on a device regardless of whether the communication network is available to the device or reliable, e.g., unavailable (or otherwise offline), intermittent, unreliable, or expensive access in situations where access to the network is reduced. For example, a portion of a user's content items that are typically stored in network memory may be downloaded to the local memory of the user's local device or devices before a particular event when the network communication is functional and reliable, and the user may access these content items during an event in which the network memory may be offline, intermittent, or unreliable.
The features described herein allow a user to display or otherwise output a content item from a local device memory, where the content item has been predicted to be relevant to the user and/or to a predicted event. For example, content items determined to be relevant to the location or activity of the predicted event or content items relevant to one or more persons meeting the user at the predicted event may be stored in local memory. If the user has agreed, the relevance of the content item may be determined based on various accessible data related to the user and the user's device. Thus, a user may display or otherwise access related content items to others in an event, for example, using a local device, without fear of network availability.
Furthermore, one or more features allow constraints on the content items to be stored on the local device to be alleviated. For example, if a user may use multiple devices in a predicted event, the content items may be stored on multiple devices if there is insufficient storage on one device to store the determined content items and/or if the device capabilities are insufficient to output one or more determined content items. Features allow a user to access content items stored on multiple local devices using one of the local devices.
Thus, the described features may provide for storage of content items on a local device in an efficient, effective, and relevant manner. The content item transferred for the local memory is determined to be relevant to the context of the user. The described techniques allow for reducing or avoiding problems of reduced (e.g., unavailable, intermittent, restricted, expensive, etc.) access to a user's network-stored content items in various contexts. The described features allow for automatic storage of content items to a local device without manual intervention by a user, thereby reducing or avoiding the burdensome task of manually selecting content items and copying them to the local device or removing content items that may no longer be relevant.
Thus, a technical effect of one or more of the described implementations is that a user may access content items on a local device that are relevant to the user's current context and that are typically stored on network memory when network access is unavailable or unreliable. An additional technical effect of one or more of the described implementations is that related content items are automatically stored on a local device, thus enabling local storage of content with less computing time and resources than devices using traditional manual techniques. For example, a user using a system with the described techniques does not have to expend computing resources to manually view, select, and copy content items from a network memory to a local memory. An additional technical effect of the described features is a reduction in consumption of system processing resources for storing content items on a local device, as compared to a system that does not provide one or more of the described features. For example, the described features provide content items that are relevant to the context of the user and thus avoid the waste of computing resources that would otherwise be used in conventional systems where the user had to manually delete content items that are not relevant and have to command additional transmission of manually selected content items. A further technical effect is that the local storage capacity of one or more local devices is allocated to store content items determined to be of possible interest to the user (e.g. more for predicted events), and thus content items may be provided to the user without requiring a large local storage capacity. An additional technical effect of one or more of the described embodiments is that a greater number of content items may be stored in local device memory on multiple devices than in conventional systems that use a single local device for local storage.
Certain embodiments discussed herein may collect or use personal information about a user (e.g., user data, information about a user's social network, a user's place and time at the place, user's biometric information, user's activities and demographic information), provide the user with one or more opportunities to control whether personal information is collected, whether personal information is stored, whether personal information is used, and how information about the user is collected, stored, and used. That is, the systems and methods discussed herein collect, store, and/or use user personal information upon receipt of explicit authorization of the relevant user. For example, a user is provided with control over whether a program or feature gathers user information about that particular user or other users associated with the program or feature. Each user of the collected personal information is presented with one or more options that allow control of the collection of information associated with that user to provide permissions or authorizations as to whether to collect the information and as to which portions of the information are collected. For example, one or more such control options may be provided to the user over a communications network. In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways prior to storage or use to remove personally identifiable information. As one example, the identity of the user may be processed so that personally identifiable information cannot be determined. As another example, the geographic location of a user may be generalized over a larger area such that the user's particular location cannot be determined.
Fig. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example network environment 100 for some embodiments described herein. In some implementations, the network environment 100 includes one or more server systems, such as the server system 102 in the example of fig. 1. For example, server system 102 may be in communication with network 130. The server system 102 may include a server device 104 and a database 106 or other storage device. Network environment 100 may also include one or more client devices, such as client devices 120, 122, 124, and 126, that may communicate with each other and/or server system 102 via network 130. The network 130 may be any type of communication network including one or more of the internet, a Local Area Network (LAN), a wireless network, a switch or hub connection, and the like. In some implementations, the network 130 can include peer-to-peer communication 132 between devices, e.g., using a peer-to-peer wireless protocol.
For ease of illustration, FIG. 1 shows one block for server system 102, server device 104, and database 106, and four blocks for client devices 120, 122, 124, and 126. Server blocks 102, 104, and 106 may represent a plurality of systems, server devices, and network databases, and the blocks may be provided in configurations other than those shown. For example, server system 102 may represent multiple server systems that may communicate with other server systems via network 130. In some examples, database 106 and/or other storage devices may be provided in a server system block separate from server device 104 and may communicate with server device 104 and other server systems via network 130. Further, there may be any number of client devices. Each client device may be any type of electronic device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a portable device (e.g., handheld), a cellular telephone, a smart phone, a tablet, a television set-top box or entertainment device, a wearable device (e.g., display glasses or goggles, a head-mounted display (HMD), a watch, a head-mounted device, an arm-strap, jewelry, etc.), a Virtual Reality (VR) and/or Augmented Reality (AR) device, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a media player, a gaming device, an appliance, etc. The client device may be a mobile device, which may be any handheld or wearable device. The client device may have a local memory. Some client devices may also have a local database similar to database 106 or other storage. In other embodiments, network environment 100 may not have all of the components shown and/or may have other elements including other types of elements in place of or in addition to those described herein.
In various embodiments, end users U1, U2, U3, and U4 may communicate with server system 102 and/or each other using respective client devices 120, 122, 124, and 126. In some example implementations, users U1, U2, U3, and U4 may interact with each other via applications running on respective client devices and/or server systems 102. The client device (and server device) may access database 106 and/or other databases as a network memory storage device via communication network 130. In some implementations, interactions between client devices may occur via a web service, such as a social networking service or other type of web service implemented on server system 102. For example, each client device 120, 122, 124, and 126 may be in data communication with one or more server systems (e.g., server system 102). In some implementations, the server system 102 can provide appropriate data to the client devices such that each client device can receive communication content or share content uploaded to the server system 102 and/or web services. In some examples, the user may interact through an audio or video conference, audio, video, or text chat, or other communication mode or application. In some examples, web services may include any system that allows users to communicate, form links and connections, upload and post shared content such as images, video, audio data, and other types of content, receive various forms of data, and/or perform social related functions. For example, the web service may allow a user to send messages to a particular one or more other users, form social links in connection with other users within the web service, group other users in a list of users, a list of friends, or other group of users, post or send content including text, images, video sequences, audio sequences, or recordings or other types of content for access by a specified group of users of the web service, real-time video, audio, and/or text video conferences or chat, etc. of other users participating in the service. In some implementations, a "user" may include one or more programs or virtual entities, as well as people in contact with a system or network.
The one or more user interfaces can display content data items including images (e.g., digital images with pixels), video data (e.g., describing multiple video images or frames), documents and other content, and output of other content items (e.g., audio from audio data), and/or enable communication data, privacy settings, notifications, and other data on client devices 120, 122, 124, and 126 (or on server system 102). Such interfaces may be displayed using software on the client device, software on the server device, and/or, for example, application software in communication with the server system 102 or a combination of client software and server software executing on the server device 104. The user interface may be displayed by a display device, such as one or more display screens, projectors, etc., of the client device or the server device. In some implementations, an application running on a server system may communicate with a client device to receive user input at the client device and output data such as visual data, audio data, and the like at the client device.
In some implementations, the server system 102 and/or one or more of the client devices 120-126 can provide a display application. The display application may allow the user device to output content items such as display images and video, and output audio based on the audio data. The application may allow the device to output various data, such as display video, images, text, and other data, and output audio received by a client device running the application, where the video, images, and audio may be obtained from local memory and/or remote memory and/or over the network 130. In some implementations, the editing application may provide an associated user interface that is displayed on a display device associated with the server system or the client device. The user interface may provide various display functions (e.g., display modes) for content items as well as editing functions. In some implementations, the user interface can receive user input that allows features to be displayed and edited.
Various implementations of some of the features described herein may use any type of system and/or service. For example, a photo collection service, a communication (e.g., chat) service, or other network service (e.g., connected to the Internet) may be used. Any type of electronic device may utilize the features described herein. Various embodiments may provide the features described herein on a client or server device that is disconnected or intermittently connected to a computer network. In some examples, a client device including or connected to a display device may process and display data stored on a storage device local to the client device (e.g., not connected through a communication network) and may provide one or more features and results visible to a user as described herein.

In some implementations, the method 200 may be implemented, for example, on the server system 102 as shown in fig. 1. For example, in some implementations, some or all of the method 200 may be implemented on a system such as one or more of the client devices 120, 122, 124, or 126 shown in fig. 1 and/or on both a server system and one or more client systems. In some implementations, different components of one or more servers and/or clients may perform different blocks or other portions of method 200. In some implementations, portions of method 200 may be implemented on a server system, and other portions of method 200 may be implemented on one or more client devices. In the depicted example, the implementation system includes one or more hardware processors or processing circuits, and one or more storage devices such as database 106 or other accessible storage.
In block 202, it is checked whether user consent (e.g., user permissions) has been obtained to use the user data in the implementation of method 200. For example, the user data may include user preferences, user biometric information, user characteristics (identity, name, age, gender, occupation, etc.), information about the user's social network and contacts, social and other types of actions and activities, content created or submitted by the user, ratings, and opinions, the user's current location, historical user data, and/or various other types of data as described herein. In some implementations, one or more blocks of the methods described herein may use such user data. If user consent has been obtained from the relevant user that may use the user data in method 200, then at block 204, the block of determining the method herein may be implemented through the rational use of the user data as described for those blocks, and the method continues to block 208. If user consent has not been obtained, then in block 206 it is determined that the block will be implemented without using user data, and the method continues to block 208. In some implementations, if user consent has not been obtained, the method 200 is stopped, or alternatively, the blocks will not be implemented using user data, but using, for example, general or publicly available data.
In block 208, if user consent for obtaining user data has been obtained, the user data is obtained. The user data may include any or all of a variety of different types of data that are accessible. For example, the user data may include calendar data, which may be provided in one or more stored calendars, and/or other formats implemented on the user's user device. In some examples, calendar data specifies or indicates scheduled activities, such as past and/or future activities (including events). In some cases, the user has engaged in or performed an activity or is scheduled to engage in or perform an activity. Such predefined activities may include meetings with other people, business or entertainment events, and so forth. In various implementations, the user may manually input data into a calendar or calendar, and/or some data may be automatically generated by the system, e.g., meetings held at the same time every week. The calendar data may include a to-do list that displays various tasks that the user intends to perform at a specified upcoming date and time. In some examples, calendar data for a predetermined activity may specify a location at which the activity will occur, a time (e.g., time of day, date, etc.), a name of a person engaged in the activity, and/or a description of the activity.
Another example of user data that may be obtained is message data, which may include messages sent and/or received from other persons or web services if consent of the participating users has been obtained. The message data may be data from various forms of messages including emails, instant messages, chat messages, text messages (e.g., SMS), messages transmitted using applications on the user device, and so forth. The message data may include various topics of user communication including upcoming events (their time, topic, location, etc.), persons engaged in the event, etc. Another example of user data that may be obtained is social data stored on a social networking service, e.g., data describing content, reviews of other content, ratings (e.g., ratings within a ratings scale, approval or disapproval of other content available to the social networking service, etc.), content provided by a user on the social networking service (e.g., images, video, audio data, documents, text, etc.). Social data may also include data describing one or more social connections of the user, e.g., a social graph of users and groups of users that indicate that the user is communicating, paying attention to posting and updating, etc.
Another example of user data that may be obtained is historical user data describing previous actions taken by a user in the past using one or more user devices, the historical user data including the time at which the previous actions occurred. In some examples, the previous actions may include sharing content items (e.g., images, videos, web links, etc.) with other users over a communication network such that other users receive or gain access to the content items using their devices, the previous actions may include receiving content items from other users, opening and viewing content items on one or more user devices, creating and deleting content items (e.g., from memory of one or more user devices or memory of a server or memory of a web service), modifying or editing content items, commenting and rating content items, etc.
Another example of user data that may be obtained is location data. For example, the location data may describe a geographic location to which the user will travel, e.g., a geographic location as specified in a map application or other application, a stored travel route, etc. The location data may also describe a geographic location that the user has previously arrived at, including the time the user appeared at that location. In some implementations, the location data can be associated with the content item, for example, as metadata. For example, an image captured with a camera device at a location may specify the location in metadata (e.g., as coordinates, place name, or other data), as well as a timestamp indicating when the image was captured at the location.
Some implementations may obtain other types of user data, or other data that is not relevant to the user (e.g., publicly accessible data provided by an organization for general ratings). The method continues to block 210.
In block 210, one or more predicted events for the user are determined based on the user data obtained in block 208. These may be upcoming events that the system predicts or anticipates. For example, the predicted event may include one or more meetings with the user at an upcoming time and/or other activities of the user. Some embodiments may restrict predicted events to extend from a current time to a particular time range in the future and/or a particular time period in the future (e.g., a particular week or month). For example, in some embodiments or situations, a predicted event may be defined to include a start time, a duration, and/or an end time. The predicted event may be determined by examining a particular type of data in the obtained user data, such as time and date, name of person, location, particular keywords and key phrases, words semantically similar to the particular word, and the like. Some examples of determining a predicted event for a user are described below with reference to FIG. 3. The method continues to block 212.
In block 212, a set of content data items (e.g., "content items") is determined for access by a user in one or more predicted events. In some implementations, a respective set of content items may be determined for each predicted event that has been determined. The content items may be content data that has been determined to be of possible interest to the user in the predicted event, and the content items may be stored on local memory of one or more user devices ("local devices") local to the user such that if online or wireless access is restricted or limited, the content items are still accessible to the user. In some implementations, a server may be used to determine the set of content items, while in other implementations, a client device (e.g., a local device) may be used to determine the set of content items. Some examples of determining a set of content items are described below with reference to fig. 4. The method continues to block 214.
In block 214, the set of content items is transferred from the remote storage to a local storage of one or more local user devices accessible to the user over a communication network. The remote memory may be a network memory that is not in the vicinity of the user, such as memory provided on a server system over the Internet or other Wide Area Network (WAN). The local storage may be memory (e.g., memory or a hardware drive) included in the housing of the local device, external memory (e.g., an external hardware drive) connected to the local device via a bus, or other memory that does not require the local device to be accessed from the internet or a WAN network. In some implementations, the local memory may include memory accessible by the local device over a wireless Local Area Network (LAN), e.g., using 802.11 protocols and not requiring internet network access. For example, a remote network system (e.g., a server system or other client device) may send the set of content items to one or more local devices (e.g., one or more client devices). The transmission of the set of content items may be performed prior to the time of the predicted event, e.g., prior to the start of the predicted event, in the middle of the time of the predicted event, or prior to the end of the predicted event, to allow access to the set of content items by one or more local devices via a local memory for at least a portion of the duration of the predicted event.
The local device may be any device accessible to the user, including a mobile device owned by the user, other devices accessible to the user or other local devices of the user (e.g., wireless access points, storage devices (e.g., external hardware drivers or memory), network devices (routers, hubs, etc.), appliances, display devices, etc.). The set of content items is stored in local memory of one or more local devices that receive the set of content items. For example, the set of content items may be stored in memory (e.g., volatile or non-volatile memory) or other storage devices of one or more local devices. In some implementations, the set of content items may be transmitted to one or more local devices based on various criteria or conditions, some examples of which will be described with reference to fig. 5. The method continues to block 216.
In block 216, the set of content items is maintained in local memory of one or more local devices. For example, over time, the set of content items is not covered by other data. In some implementations, for example, if a content item or other data is received that has a higher priority than the stored content item, the set of content items may be completely and/or partially overwritten with the higher priority data and the set of content items may be retransmitted for storage and/or the set of content items may be re-determined and transmitted in blocks 208-214. When a content item is stored in the local memory, the storage local device may access and display or otherwise output the set of content items.
In some implementations, one or more additional predicted events can be determined in a further iteration of blocks 208-216 such that the additional content item sets are transferred to the local memory of the user device before the previous predicted event of the stored content item set occurs. In some implementations, if no additional storage space is available for additional sets of content items, the already stored sets of content items may have priority such that the additional sets of content items are not stored in local memory and, for example, are not transferred or transferred and discarded in block 214. In some cases, these additional sets of content items may be transmitted to the local device and stored after the occurrence of a previously predicted event. In some implementations, for example, if additional predicted events overlap in time with a previous predicted event, e.g., if additional sets of content items have a higher priority (or, in some implementations, the same priority), the additional sets of content items may partially or fully replace the existing stored sets of content items. For example, in some implementations, if the additional predicted event is the same priority as the predicted event associated with the stored set of content items, 50% of the highest ranked content items from each set of content items may be selected to remain in the local store. Some examples of the priorities of the predicted events are described with reference to fig. 3. The method continues to block 218.
In block 218, it is checked whether any predicted events have occurred. In some examples, if the predicted event has a particular location and/or a particular time associated therewith, then it may be checked in block 218 whether the current time is equal to any particular time and/or whether one or more local devices are located at any particular location. In some embodiments, other conditions of the predicted event may also be checked. For example, if it is determined that particular persons will attend a predicted event of a user (and, for example, the time or location of the predicted event is not determined), then it may be checked whether the user devices associated with those particular persons are within a threshold distance of the user's user device (if consent has been obtained from the user and the person under examination) to determine that the predicted event has occurred. In another example, if it is determined that a particular activity was performed in the predicted event (and, for example, the time or location of the predicted event was not determined), if user consent has been obtained, it may be checked by one or more sensors of the user device, such as by a camera, motion sensor, GPS sensor and map location lookup, temperature sensor, etc., whether the activity occurred. For example, the occurrence of a particular event, such as a birthday party, may be determined based on images captured by a camera, e.g., detecting an object, such as a cake, party cap, etc.
If no predicted event has occurred, the method returns to block 216 to maintain the set of content items in local storage. If one or more predicted events have occurred, the method continues to block 220 where the set of content items may be indicated by output of one or more local devices. For example, in some implementations, information such as a message or hint may be output on one or more local devices, e.g., displayed on a display device of the one or more local devices, the information indicating that the set of content items is available for access (and optionally indicating that one or more content items are related to a predicted event that has occurred). In some implementations, the indication may be output before the predicted event occurs, for example, by a reminder of the predicted event that is imminent. Some implementations may display interface elements, such as menus, icons, etc., on a display device to allow a user to easily view the set of content items. Some implementations may instruct which of a plurality of local user devices to store portions of a content item by displaying on or other output on a plurality of local client devices. Some examples of various embodiments are described below with reference to fig. 6. The method continues to block 222.
In block 222 it is checked whether one or more conditions have occurred indicating that the set of content items to be removed should be removed or specified from the local memory. For example, one condition that may lead to removal of a content item is to determine that a predicted event ends. In some examples, the predicted event may have a duration associated therewith, which may be determined (e.g., in block 210), for example, when the predicted event is determined. Block 222 may check whether the duration has expired. In an example, the predicted event may have a period of one hour specified for the indicated business meeting event. In further examples, the duration of the predicted event or expiration of the predicted event may be inferred based on other characteristics of the predicted event. For example, when the date of a birthday party ends, the predicted event of the birthday party for the particular date may be considered to end or expire.
In some implementations, the duration of the current predicted event can be determined as an estimate based on the duration of the user's previous event. For example, an average duration that a user spent in the past at a particular location may be determined based on previous multiple accesses to the location. In some implementations, if the user has previously accessed the current location (e.g., during a previous predicted event), the duration previously spent at that location can be used as the estimated duration of the current predicted event.
In some implementations, if user consent has been obtained, one or more operations or sensors of the local device may be checked to determine if the predicted event is over. For example, a location sensor (e.g., GPS) may be checked to determine the location of the user device. If the user device has moved away from a location associated with the predicted event (e.g., a predefined area surrounding a particular location), the predicted event may be considered to end. In further examples, a camera of one or more user devices may capture a depiction of a scene and may check the scene to determine if a predicted event is still in progress (e.g., check if people are still nearby and chat in a gathering event, etc.). In a further example, the user's actions and user-created content may be checked while operating the user device. For example, if the user deselects the "flight mode" of the device, the user's aircraft may have landed and may consider the predicted event associated with aircraft flight to end. If a user sends a message to another user (e.g., a person attending an event), the message including keywords such as "we play very happy" or "leave," etc., then it may be considered that the predicted event ends (or will end soon, which in some embodiments may result in an additional check of the system after a predetermined amount of time). In some implementations, the indication that the predicted event based on the operation of the local device or the sensor has not ended may override the indication that the predicted event based on the duration has ended. For example, while a meeting may have been scheduled to end after one hour, a device sensor or detected device operation of the user may indicate that the meeting has continued beyond that duration.
In some implementations, the condition indicating removal of one or more content items from the local memory can include storing other content items in the local memory. For example, if it is determined that one or more other pending content item sets are scheduled to be stored in local memory and immediately available in local memory or available for a short period of time from the current time (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.), removal of the content item set in local memory may be specified. For example, the next predicted event is occurring and a different set of content items to be associated with the next predicted event is stored in local memory in place of the previously stored set of content items.
If it is checked in block 222 that no condition has occurred that results in removal of the content item, the method may, for example, return to block 220 to continue to allow access to the set of content items on the local device. If it is checked in block 222 that one or more conditions have occurred that result in removal of the content item, the method continues to block 224 where removal of one or more of the stored set of content items is specified in block 224. In some examples, the content item may be removed from local memory, e.g., deleted. In other examples, the content item for removal may be specified or marked, e.g., allowing the content item to be overlaid in memory by other data as needed.
In some implementations, a "grace period" can be assigned to a set of content items such that the set of content items is designated for removal or eligible to be covered after expiration of the grace period. For example, a grace period of one week after the predicted event occurs (or after the predicted event ends) may be provided during which time the set of content items will remain in local storage in a similar state as before the predicted event occurred.
In some implementations, after a set of content items to be removed has been specified, one or more sets of content items to be determined for additional predicted events can be transmitted and stored in local memory in place of the set of content items to be removed. If a plurality of such sets of content items are pending and local memory space is available for only a portion of such content items, the highest priority set of pending content items, e.g., the set of content items associated with the pending predicted event having the highest priority, may be stored in local memory. For example, a set of content items used by a predicted event that is predicted to have no access to remote memory at the time of the predicted event may be assigned a higher priority than a set of content items used by a predicted event that has access to remote memory at the time of the predicted event, even in intermittent or restricted form.
FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating an example method 300 for determining one or more predicted events based on user data. For example, the method 300 may be used to implement the block 210 of the example method 200 of fig. 2.
In block 302, it is checked whether user consent (e.g., user permissions) has been obtained to use the user data in the implementation of method 300. For example, the user data may include user data described for method 300, and may also include user preferences, user biometric information, user characteristics (identity, name, age, gender, occupation, etc.), information about the user's social network and contacts, social and other types of actions and activities, content created or submitted by the user, ratings, and opinions, the user's current location, historical user data, and so forth. One or more blocks of the methods described herein may use such user data. If user consent has been obtained from the relevant user in method 300 where the user data is available, then at block 304, the blocks of determining the method herein may be implemented through the rational use of the user data as described for those blocks, and the method continues to block 308. If user consent has not been obtained, then in block 306 it is determined that the block will be implemented without using user data, and the method continues to block 308. For example, in some implementations, if user consent has not been obtained, the method 300 is stopped, or the method 300 is performed without using user data.
In block 308, the calendar data is checked (e.g., programmatically analyzed) for references or other indications of upcoming events. For example, entries in a user's calendar may indicate dates and times of various activities, such as meetings with other people, business meetings, holidays, travel through specific means of transportation (e.g., automobiles, airplanes, trains, etc.), special occasions (anniversaries, birthdays, holidays, visits by known people, activities (e.g., attending sporting events, attending shows, dining at restaurants, etc.), occurrence of events noticed by the user (broadcast of real-time activities or other entertainment, etc.), calendar data may be programmatically analyzed by the system for such indications, e.g., looking up keywords and key phrases (e.g., "birthdays," "anniversaries," "meetings," etc.), and/or using machine learning to look up specific words, phrases, time periods, etc., which may indicate upcoming events (e.g., machine learning based on created training data based on created calendar entries and expected determinations of events for those calendar entries).
In block 310, the message data is checked (e.g., programmatically analyzed) for references or other indications of upcoming events. For example, the electronic message sent by the user may include content indicating that the user is meeting with one or more other people. The user may have received a message indicating an impending event, such as a meeting with the user receiving the message. In various examples, the message may be an email, a text message, an instant message, a chat session message, a message sent and received in a social networking service or other networking service, or the like. The system may look for specific keywords and key phrases, such as "let us meet at. In some implementations, the system can use machine learning to find specific words, phrases, time periods, etc. that indicate upcoming events, e.g., using created messages and training data based on expected determinations of events for those messages.
In block 312, the location data is checked (e.g., programmatically analyzed) for a reference or other indication of an impending event. For example, a user uses a map application on one or more user devices and may enter a particular location as a destination for a trip or vacation. The system may determine the location as a predicted event and/or check whether the destination is associated with an upcoming event indicated by other user data. In some implementations, the system can check for locations that the user previously visited at a particular time or date, and can predict upcoming event locations from those previously visited locations. For example, if the stored historical location data indicates that the user accessed a particular city (e.g., above a threshold number of previous occurrences) on a particular holiday each year in the last five years, then an upcoming event may be predicted for that same location for a corresponding period of the current year.
In some implementations, other types of data associated with the user may also be checked. For example, if user consent has been obtained, social data related to network services, such as social network services, accessed and engaged by the user may be checked. In some examples, the social data may include a group of users defined in a social networking service that may indicate which users and people are socially connected with the user and may indicate which people are likely to attend an upcoming event. In some examples, the user group may indicate the context or location in which the user may meet those users, thereby indicating an impending event. Other types of data that may be checked (if user consent has been obtained) include user activity data that indicates user activity including exercise, games, etc. using one or more local devices. In some implementations, if user consent has been obtained from all of these other users, and if accessible, data associated with the other users (e.g., users socially connected with the user) may be checked in a manner similar to checking user data associated with the users. In some implementations, user device activity, such as a number of users viewing content items, a number of users sharing content items with other users, a number of user edits to content items, etc., may be stored and accessed as user data to indicate a user's interest in a topic or content item (e.g., as shown in fig. 4).
In block 314, a predicted event that is a meeting event is determined based on the references and other indications of the upcoming event determined in blocks 308-312 and/or based on other user data. A meeting event may be an event that predicts that a user will meet one or more other people ("event people"), for example, may wish to display one or more content items to the event person using a local device. For example, indications from calendar data, message data, location data, and/or other user data (e.g., characteristics) may be analyzed to determine when and where a particular upcoming meeting will be made with others. In some examples, calendar data may indicate a particular time of a meeting, message data may indicate that one or more people will attend the meeting, and location data may indicate a likely location of the meeting. In some implementations, different types of meetings may also be determined. For example, if the characteristics of the user data are found to indicate that the meeting is to be conducted at an office with a colleague at a workplace, etc., the meeting may be characterized as a business type meeting. Other meetings may be characterized as entertainment type meetings, for example, meetings at movie theatres, restaurants, stadiums, and the like. Other meetings may be characterized as a business type meeting, such as taking others at a train station, exercising in a gym, jogging on the road, and so forth. Other types of meetings may also be designated as determined meeting events.
In block 316, event persons that may be present (or likely to be present) at the predicted meeting event of block 314 are determined based on the predicted meeting event and the user data. For example, in some cases, the user data may directly indicate other people to be met by the user in the upcoming event. In some examples, calendar data may specify "meet Bob W at 10 points". The system may find information related to the user Bob W, for example, by looking at contact information, such as a contact list, on the user device. In some implementations, the system can determine which people will be present in an upcoming meeting by examining the user's previous meeting, e.g., the previous meeting that the user or the user's device appears to be. For example, a stored formal text or record of a previous meeting may indicate that three people participated in the meeting. For a detected upcoming meeting on the same day of the week, the system may determine that the same three people will be engaged in the upcoming meeting activity, so the three people are event people. In the message data, messages sent by the user to other users may indicate that the user will meet those other users. In some examples, receiving a message indicating a meeting (e.g., "let us meet at.) from or sending a message indicating a meeting (e.g.," let us meet at.) to the system may determine another particular user to be present in the upcoming meeting.
In some cases, the user data may not directly specify event persons that the user may be meeting, and the system may determine one or more event persons that may be attending the upcoming meeting from other user data. For example, user data, such as social data, may indicate which users and people are socially connected with the user. In some examples, the socially connected users may be included in a user group, which may indicate a context in which the user may be meeting with those users. For example, users listed in a user group such as "work contacts" may be determined to potentially attend one or more meetings that have been determined to be business meetings (e.g., based on calendar data, message data, etc.). If it has been determined that the upcoming meeting is a business meeting, it may be determined that one or more users from such a group of users are likely to be attending the upcoming meeting. Similarly, the history of the shared user content data may be examined to determine with which other users the user shared images, videos, or other content. For example, if it is determined that the upcoming meeting event is watching a baseball game, the history of sharing images may indicate that the user most commonly shares images with a particular user. If it is also determined that some particular users are depicted in the shared image (e.g., by examining user input tags in the metadata of the image, or using image recognition techniques with the consent of the depicted users), those depicted users may be determined as event persons likely to attend the upcoming event. Messages sent and received by a user relating to similar material (e.g., a baseball game) may also indicate that the person delivering the message may attend an upcoming meeting.
In block 318, other types of predicted events for the user are determined based on the characteristics of the upcoming event determined in blocks 308-312. For example, some predicted events may not include a meeting with another person, and may include one or more particular types of activity by the user. In some examples, an activity may include exercise, entertainment viewing, accessing a particular location, creating various types of works (art, business, etc.), sightseeing, vacation, etc. Such predicted events may be determined in a manner similar to the predicted meeting event determined in block 316. For example, calendar data may indicate activity, historical location data may indicate a daily destination location of a user at a particular time, and message data may indicate an event, e.g., data indicates that a user registered for a presentation, obtained confirmation of a reservation, etc. The historical data may be analyzed to determine activities that a user routinely performed at a particular time of the past week, month, and/or year, and may be used to predict upcoming events at similar times.
In block 320, in some cases or implementations, a priority of the predicted event may be determined. In some implementations, priorities may be assigned based on the type of predicted event, where a particular type of predicted event has a particular priority. In some examples, predicted events of a traffic type may be assigned a high priority and predicted events that are not traffic may be assigned a lower priority. In some implementations, the priority may be assigned based on a predicted availability of network access to the remote memory by the local device at the time of the predicted event. For example, predicted events that are indicated as being located in a location that may cause the local device to fail to access remote network memory may be assigned a higher priority than predicted events at locations with predicted normal, intermittent, or weak network memory accesses. For example, such inaccessible locations may be geographically remote from the wireless access point and/or cell tower such that the local device cannot access the wireless network connected to the remote network memory, or the location may be in an environment that otherwise prevents the local device from receiving wireless signals connected to the wireless network. In some implementations, event locations that result in reduced access to network memory by one or more local devices may be assigned a higher priority than event locations without such reduced access. In some implementations, predicted events that allow more expensive network memory access (e.g., through a cellular telephone data scheme) may be assigned a higher priority than predicted events that allow lower cost access (e.g., via a wireless LAN). In some implementations, the priority may be assigned based on the person the user is meeting at the predicted event. Some embodiments allow a user to specify a priority of an event type, for example, in stored user preferences or user inputs.
Some implementations may analyze historical user data to determine a priority of an event. For example, the frequency or duration of previous similar events may be determined, wherein predicted events, e.g., of the type that occur more frequently to the user, may be assigned a higher priority (or alternatively, a lower priority) and predicted events of the type that have a greater average duration may be assigned a higher priority (or alternatively, a lower priority). In some implementations, if it has been determined that multiple predicted events occur at least partially simultaneously, e.g., with at least partially overlapping durations, the predicted events may be assigned a priority. The priority may be used to determine which content items are stored in a local memory of the user device (e.g., storing content items associated with events having a higher priority). Some implementations may assign priorities to individual content items, e.g., based on the type of content item. For example, such priorities may be similar to the content item ranking as described in fig. 4.
In some implementations, predicted events that are not based on user data may be determined. For example, the predicted event may be a public event determined to be currently highly popular based on the public event mentioned in a publication or other public data source, such as a news event or announcement, political lecture, sports match, entertainment event, and the like. Such predicted events may be determined to have a particular time at which the event is about to occur and/or a location if the event is located to a particular geographic location (e.g., stadium, public place, etc.).
FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating an example method 400 of determining one or more content items for one or more predicted events. For example, the method 400 may be used to implement the block 212 of the example method 200 of fig. 2.
The content item may be or include any of various types of content data. For example, the content items may include images (any type of image, such as rectangular, panoramic, spherical, cylindrical, montage of multiple images, animation, moving pictures, etc.), video, audio clips of audio data, documents (e.g., including text and/or graphics), text data (e.g., electronic messages, calendars, lists, etc.), images, web pages, games (e.g., graphic video games), applications or other programs, haptic data that controls haptic output by actuators, and/or other types of content. In some examples, content items that are accessible by multiple users over a communication network may be converted to content items that do not have such shared access for transmission and storage on a local device as described herein.
In block 402, it is checked whether user consent (e.g., user permissions) has been obtained to use the user data in the implementation of method 400. For example, the user data may include the user data described above. One or more blocks of the methods described herein may use such user data. If user consent has been obtained from the relevant user in method 400 where the user data is available, then at block 404, the blocks of determining the method herein may be implemented through the rational use of the user data as described for those blocks, and the method continues to block 408. If user consent has not been obtained, then in block 406 it is determined that the block will be implemented without using user data, and the method continues to block 408. For example, if user consent has not been obtained, publicly available content items (e.g., widely published content from institutions, websites, catalogs, or other sources of information) may be obtained instead of user-created content items. In some implementations, if user consent has not been obtained, the method 400 is stopped.
In block 408, one or more content items are determined that have not been shared with event persons determined to be likely to attend the predicted event. In some implementations, the content items checked for the block can be user-accessible content items. For example, such content items may include content items associated with the user, e.g., stored in a remote memory relative to a local device carried by the user and accessible to the user, e.g., in one or more server accounts of the user. In some implementations, the checked content items can include local content items stored in a local memory of the user device. Some implementations may examine content items associated with or accessible to one or more event persons, provided that the user has permission and access to such content items. Publicly available and accessible content items, such as maps or portions of maps, images of public areas, monuments, and points of interest, as well as other publicly accessible content items that are allowed to be downloaded to and displayed by the user device, may also be examined.
The shared content item may be a content item that has been previously communicated to one or more persons via, for example, a communication network, wherein the shared content item is accessible to the one or more persons via the device. If the user previously shared a content item with an event person, the event person may not want to view the content item again when predicting the event, so that the already shared content item may be ignored or reduced in the priority of selection. Previously unshared content items may be considered as determined content items potentially contained in a set of content items sent to the local device. In some implementations, one or more content items that were not previously shared may be weighted or scored more favorably (e.g., scored higher) in terms of selection than content items that have been shared. The method continues to block 410.
In block 410, one or more topics of interest are determined for the user. For example, if user consent has been obtained, these topics may be determined based on the user data obtained in block 208 of FIG. 2. In some implementations, the topics of interest may be based on content that the user has viewed, shared, or otherwise frequently participated in, e.g., images and videos that the user has viewed, documents that the user has displayed and scrolled through, audio that the user has selected for output, etc. The subject of interest may be determined from detected image content features (e.g., faces, objects, animals, landscape features, etc.), titles of content items, authors of content items, metadata tags, etc. that are visually depicted in the images and videos. The subject of interest may be determined from images and other user content items shared by the user, and/or electronic messages sent or received by the user. For example, topics that frequently occur (e.g., exceeding a threshold number of times) in different messages or shares to and from a user may be considered topics of interest to the user. Topics that appear with terms of interest ("like", "love", etc.) may be considered topics of interest. For example, some topics may be determined as geographic locations or times/dates of interest to the user based on the frequency with which the user accesses the location, the frequency of references to times or dates in the message or content, and so forth. The method continues to block 412.
In block 412, one or more topics of interest are determined for event people predicted to attend the predicted event. For example, if user consent has been obtained, these topics may be determined based on the user data obtained in block 208 of FIG. 2. In some examples, social data from users of the network service may be checked. In some implementations, content items previously shared by users may have user content inputs (comments, ratings, views and edits from event persons, content items shared by event persons, etc.), and the interests of these event persons may be determined from their user content inputs. For example, a low rating given by an event person to an image featuring a particular image may indicate that the person's interest in that image is low, and a high rating for a different image may indicate that the interest in the subject matter of the different image is high. A large number of views or positive reviews associated with a topic may indicate a higher interest than fewer views or positive reviews. The method continues to block 414.
At block 414, one or more common topics of interest (e.g., common interests or intersections of interests) between the user and event people estimated to attend the predicted event. For example, it is determined which topic of interest of the user (e.g., determined in block 410) is the same as or similar to the topic of interest of the event person (e.g., determined in block 412). In some examples, the determined topics of interest may be compared between the user and the event person and the same topics of interest are treated as a common interest. Similar topics of interest may also be determined as common interests. For example, some implementations may compare categories of topics. For example, if the topic of interest to the user is of the same category as the topic of interest to the event person (or vice versa), then a common interest is determined. Some implementations may determine categories of topics and other related concepts by querying relationships between stored concepts provided in one or more accessible knowledge bases (e.g., knowledge graphs), databases, and so forth. In some examples, as indicated in the accessed knowledge base or other stored hierarchical classifications, the "pedunculate" subject may be considered to be in a larger category of "dogs" or "pets" and the "Bi Geer canine" subject is also found to belong to the category of "dogs" or "pets" such that the subjects of "pedunculate" and "Bi Geer canine" may be considered similar and indicate common interests. The method continues to block 416.
In block 416, one or more content items related to the common interests determined in block 414 are determined. Similar to at block 408, for example, the searched content items that are examined as related to the common interests may be user-accessible content items. In some implementations, the content items related to the common interests that are checked in block 416 can be the content items of block 408, which are determined to have not been shared with the event people.
A content item may be examined if it has one or more characteristics related to a common interest. For example, the content (e.g., material) of the content item may be examined, including examining visual content depicted in the image (e.g., image features identified using one or more image detection or recognition techniques, etc., as described by the tags), document text, audio features detected in the audio data (e.g., recognition of speech using voice recognition or audio recognition techniques or audio sound effects), metadata of the content item, and so forth. For example, if it has been determined that the common interest is "baseball," a content item having content related to baseball or baseball games is determined. For example, an image depicting a scene from a baseball game (e.g., a label or detected image feature with the term "baseball", a baseball team name, a stadium name, audio recorded from a baseball announcer directed to the team, etc.) may be determined as a content item related to the common interests. Other characteristics of the content item may be determined to be related to the common interests. For example, the location data (e.g., metadata of the content item, or location data associated with the user) may indicate that the image was captured at a baseball field, and thus the image is considered to be related to baseball. The timestamp data for a content item may indicate that the content item was captured or created at a particular time associated with a common interest, e.g., on a birthday, anniversary, baseball game date, etc. In further examples, if a common interest has been determined to be a "budget plan meeting," then content items having characteristics including the term "budget" or a creation date during a previous budget plan meeting may be determined to be relevant to the common interest. In some implementations, the content items so determined are considered to be determined content items that qualify for inclusion in the set of content items sent to the local device. The method continues to block 418.
In block 418, one or more content items related to the subject matter in the message sent or received by the user may be determined if such content items are present in the accessible content items. The content items may be determined from the accessible content items similar to that described above, and/or from a subset of the content items that are not shared content items, such as that determined in block 408. For example, topics of text messages, emails, chat messages, and other messages sent and received by a user may be examined, and content items having one or more characteristics (e.g., content/topic, location, creation time stamp, etc.) associated with the topics may be determined. The one or more determined content items may be related to the predicted event, for example, as described above with one or more characteristics (e.g., content, location, or time of creation) related to a topic found from a message used to determine the predicted event, or with one or more characteristics related to one or more event persons, etc. In some implementations, one or more of the determined content items can be independent of the predicted event.
In some examples, messages sent to an event person or messages including references to an event person may be programmatically analyzed to determine topics that may be related or associated with the received or referenced event person. In some embodiments, messages sent to or received from other than the event person are also programmatically analyzed. In some implementations, messages sent to and received from one or more event people are examined, and topics obtained from these messages may be assigned a higher ranking score (e.g., weight) than messages sent to others or messages posted or sent for viewing by multiple people. As described above, it may be determined that the user is more interested in some topics in the message.
Similar to that described above in block 416, the system may examine content items related to the detected topic. Content items related to message topics of greater interest to the user and/or one or more event personnel (e.g., topics determined to be of interest as described above) may be assigned a higher ranking score or weight. In some cases, such messages may also be examined to determine predicted events (e.g., as described with respect to fig. 3) and/or to determine common interests (e.g., as described with respect to blocks 410-416). In some examples, a message from the user to another person with content such as "i like new album from XYZ" may be detected and cause the system to examine and find content items related to the referenced music album, such as song tracks in the album, album jacket notes, text lyrics of the song, images depicting band members in performance or interviews, descriptions of band members, schedules in which the band will perform, etc. The content items thus determined are eligible for inclusion in the set of content items to be sent to the local device. The method continues to block 420.
In block 420, one or more content items related to the geographic location of the predicted event may be determined if such content items are present in the accessible content items. The content items may be determined from the accessible content items similar to that described above, and/or from a subset of the content items that are not shared content items, such as that determined in block 408. The content item may have one or more characteristics related to the location of the predicted event. For example, the geographic location of the predicted event may have one or more environmental features (e.g., terrain, buildings, roads, attractions of interest, etc.), and the available content items may be searched for content items that include content that depicts or describes the environmental features (e.g., such features detected in the image using image recognition techniques). If the location of the predicted event has one or more associated names (e.g., names of monuments, buildings, parks, streets, businesses, community names, etc.), then the accessible content items may be searched for those names. Content items previously captured or created by a user at or near the location of the predicted event (e.g., within a threshold distance, such as 200 feet, 2 miles, etc.), such as images captured by the user near the location, audio recordings recorded by the user near the location, documents created near the location, etc., may be searched for among the accessible content items. Content items related to known locations of greater interest to the user and/or one or more event personnel (e.g., topics determined to be of interest as described above) may be assigned a higher ranking score or weight. In some implementations, if user consent has been obtained, content items that were previously commonly captured or accessed by many users at the location of the predicted event can be determined (e.g., by data describing the aggregate capture and access locations of content items for many users, not for a single user). For example, it may be determined that a publicly available map, document or image has been accessed frequently at that location, e.g., captured or accessed by a threshold percentage of general users. In some implementations, the content items so determined are eligible for inclusion in a set of content items to be sent to the local device. The method continues to block 422.
In block 422, one or more content items related to calendar data associated with the predicted event and/or other data related to the predicted event are determined if such content items are present in the accessible content items. The content items may be determined from the accessible content items similar to that described above, and/or from a subset of the content items that are not shared content items, such as that determined in block 408. For example, a calendar activity or event may specify "go out with John's home," and a particular time for the calendar activity. The content item may be searched for having one or more characteristics related to a time of day of a calendar event (e.g., an image of sunset), a time of year (e.g., an image and video depicting a family member if a particular holiday), a previous dinner the user was present (e.g., an image or video depicting a dinner of the user or event person), and/or a previous content item depicting or depicting one or more event persons (john's) that the user liked, food items, etc.
In other examples, the content items captured or created on the same day or date in the previous week or month, or on the same month of the previous year, may be determined to be calendar activities. Content items related to times or dates of greater interest to a user or one or more event persons (e.g., topics determined as of interest as described above) may be determined and may be assigned a higher weight or ranking score. Other accessible data related to the predicted event may also be used to determine the content item. For example, historical data indicating similar activities that a user has performed in the past, titles of content that the user has recently viewed, or other data may be used to extract topics that can be searched among the accessible content items to find content items having one or more relevant characteristics. In some implementations, the content items so determined are eligible for inclusion in a set of content items to be sent to the local device.
In some implementations, the content item may be determined without or with more restrictions on the use of the user data. For example, public content items (e.g., publicly accessible and available content items) may be retrieved, for example, from websites, publications, web services, or other data sources on the internet, based on finding the same or similar features associated with the predicted event, similar to that described above. In some implementations, the common content items may be determined without user data or predicted events (e.g., predicted events may not yet be determined) and based on aggregated information about popularity of certain content items (e.g., related to trending topics of web services), or general popularity of current news, upcoming well-known events (e.g., popular sporting events, concerts, etc.), and other well-known information. For example, popularity may be estimated based on the number of publications describing news items or events, a list of popularity of publications, or the top ten lists, etc.
In some implementations, such common content items can be determined based on a determined location, e.g., a location of a predicted event, or if a predicted event location is not determined, such common content items can be determined based on a current location of a user device or a planned location of a user (e.g., during a travel itinerary) if user consent has been obtained. In some examples, the determined location of the concert hall may initiate retrieval of a common content item, which is a music clip, music metadata, journal article about music, or the like. A corporate office may initiate the retrieval of corporate content items, news items about a corporation, etc. A sports stadium may initiate retrieval of public content items including team player profiles, team information, etc. for sports performed on the field. In some examples, such sports-related content items may be determined based on a determination that the stadium has a current popularity at a particular time (e.g., a current time or an upcoming time within a predetermined period of the current time). If the type of content item has been pre-associated with a location, then a type of content item may be determined and retrieved, e.g., a book content item for a location associated with reading, a video content item for a venue associated with video viewing, etc. The method continues to block 424.
In block 424, one or more characteristics of the local memory are determined. These characteristics may include storage limitations, number of local devices, device capabilities, etc. For example, if the local user device has a certain amount of storage space available for storing the received content item, the amount of available storage space is determined. In some implementations, storage space on multiple local user devices may be considered, e.g., combined into total available storage. Other constraints may also be checked, such as a maximum number of content items that may be stored by the local user device, display constraints (e.g., resolution, 3D display capabilities, speakers for audio output, etc.) of a processor and/or display device associated with the content items, availability of a particular network connection (e.g., wireless network, cellular data network, etc.). In some implementations, the local device may have a certain amount of available storage, but the application, device, or user configuration only allows a portion of that available storage to be used for the content item. In some implementations, the determination of the storage constraints and other characteristics in block 424 may be a current estimate, and different storage constraints may be determined prior to transmitting the content item to the local device, for example, if a different local device is selected for storage as described below with reference to fig. 5. For example, in some implementations, the estimation of block 424 may include an estimation of the maximum storage capacity of the local device currently detected. The method continues to block 426.
In block 426, the determined content items from the previous block are ranked. Ranking may be based on various criteria. For example, individual scores or weights from various criteria may be assigned to each determined content item, and the individual scores combined to obtain a total ranking score for each determined content item.
Some content items may be assigned a ranking based on the determined interests of the user and/or one or more event persons as described above. Additionally or alternatively, the ranking score of the content items may be assigned or adjusted based on various other factors. In some examples, the determined content items may be ranked based on the recency of the determined content items (e.g., more recently created or captured content items, more strongly ranked scores, for example, more highly ranked scores), based on the content type of the determined content items (e.g., images and videos may be assigned higher scores than audio data segments or text documents), based on the content of the determined content items (e.g., faces depicted in images may be more highly ranked than other objects), based on the storage space required for the determined content items (e.g., content items requiring less storage space may be more highly ranked), based on the presentation length of the determined content items (e.g., shorter videos or audio segments may be more highly ranked), based on the person creating or sending the content of the determined content items (e.g., content items captured or created by the user may be more highly ranked than content items received from other people), and so forth.
In some implementations, a ranking score can be assigned to the determined content items based on one or more characteristics of the predicted event. For example, the ranking score may be based on a degree of similarity or degree of matching (e.g., the proximity of the match) between the content item and the subject matter or common interests of the event people who may be predicting the event as described above (e.g., the closer the match, the higher the ranking). The ranking score may be based on the duration of the predicted event. For example, if it is determined that the duration of the predicted event is above a threshold duration, the longer duration content items (e.g., video or audio) may be ranked higher than if the duration of the predicted event is below the threshold duration. Content items depicting or describing material that appears at the location of the predicted event may be ranked higher than other content items. For example, if the predicted event is in a baseball game, the content items depicting previous baseball games that the user appears to be ranked higher.
In some implementations, determined content items that have not been shared with and/or viewed by event people are assigned a higher ranking score than content items that have been previously shared with and/or viewed by such people. Some implementations may specify some instances of characteristics to be assigned the highest ranking (e.g., visually depicting images of users and all event people who may be attending a predicted event, etc.) and/or some instances of characteristics to be assigned the lowest ranking (e.g., visually depicting images of a particular specified type or material of content, creation date of a content item being greater than a threshold period of time before the current time, etc.). Some implementations may read stored user preferences previously entered by the user that indicate which types of characteristics are to be scored or weighted highest in the ranking, which types of characteristics are to be scored lowest, and so on.
Some implementations may emphasize diversity of content items (e.g., diversity of types of content items (images, video, audio, etc.), diversity of types of material depicted/described (e.g., faces, objects, scenery, etc.), diversity of creation dates (e.g., minimum time periods between content items), etc. For example, the system may reduce the ranking score of content items that are the same as or similar to previously selected content items in one or more particular characteristics. In some implementations, the diversity characteristics and criteria may be specified by user preferences or user input.
Some implementations may assign ranking scores to content items based on the storage space needed to store the content items. For example, if a greater number of items is prioritized over the item's storage size (e.g., may be indicated in stored user preferences in some implementations), a higher ranking score may be assigned to smaller sized content items and a lower ranking score may be assigned to larger sized content items, for example. In some implementations, the characteristics of the local memory determined in block 424 may affect or act on the ranking. For example, if a relatively lower amount of local memory is available (e.g., below a predetermined threshold amount), smaller sized content items may be assigned a higher ranking score than larger sized content items. The characteristics of the available local devices may influence the ranking. For example, if the only available local memory is on a local device with a small resolution or low resolution display screen, the high resolution images and videos may be assigned a lower ranking score than the low resolution images and videos.
In some implementations, the ranking score of the content items can be determined without consideration of the characteristics of the local memory, and the ranking score can be adjusted based on the local memory characteristics and/or based on user preferences. For example, if one or more highest ranked content items are too large to be accommodated in available local storage, the ranking score of those content items may be reduced and adjusted to a higher ranking score for the next highest ranked content item that can be accommodated in available local storage space. In another example, if the stored user preferences have indicated that at least half of the content items sent to the local device are of a particular type (e.g., image), various ranking scores may be adjusted until a sufficiently high number of content items of that particular type allow those content items to be accommodated in the available local storage space. The method continues to block 428.
In block 428, a content item is selected for the set of content items stored on the local user device to be determined in block 424. In some implementations, the highest ranked content item is selected for the set of content items, e.g., the content item with the highest ranking score. In implementations herein, a high ranking score indicates that the content item is more suitable for selection; other embodiments may provide other scoring schemes (e.g., a lower score indicates more appropriate selection, etc.). In some implementations, if the local memory characteristic indicates that a particular amount of storage is available for the content item, a plurality of highest ranked content items that can be stored in the available storage space are selected. In some implementations, additional checks of local device memory constraints, e.g., as described in fig. 5, may be made before or during the transfer of the content item to the local user device.
As described above, the blocks of method 400 may be performed to determine content items for a particular predicted event. In some implementations, another predicted event can be selected and the method 400 can be performed to determine a content item set for the predicted event. Thus, a respective set of content items may be determined for each predicted event. Some content items may appear in multiple sets of different predicted events.
In various embodiments, the order of the blocks in method 400 may be different. For example, some implementations may first determine and rank the sets of content items based on the content item characteristics, rather than based on the local memory characteristics, and then may adjust the ranking and select the sets of content items based on the local memory characteristics and/or user preferences, e.g., if such local memory characteristics are determined later.
Fig. 5 is a flow chart illustrating an example method 500 of transmitting a set of content items from a network memory to one or more local devices over a communication network. For example, the method 500 may be used to implement block 214 of the example method 200 of fig. 2.
In block 502, it is checked whether user consent (e.g., user permissions) has been obtained to use the user data in the implementation of method 500. For example, the user data may include the user data described above. One or more blocks of the methods described herein may use such user data. If user consent has been obtained from the relevant users who may use the user data in method 500, then at block 504, the blocks of determining the method herein may be implemented through rational use of the user data as described for those blocks, and the method continues to block 508. If user consent has not been obtained, then it is determined in block 506 that the block will be implemented without using user data, and the method continues to block 508. For example, if user consent has not been obtained, the plurality of local devices may be ranked without using the user data. In some implementations, if user consent has not been obtained, the method 500 is stopped.
In block 508, it is checked whether a wireless local network connection is available for transmitting the set of content items to the (receiving) local device. In some examples, the wireless local network connection may be a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) connection, for example, using the IEEE 802.11 standard or other similar standard, through which the local device may connect to a server device and/or other local devices. In a further example, the wireless local network connection may be a peer-to-peer wireless connection (e.g.,or other type of network connection), wherein a local device that is to receive the content item may connect to one or more other local devices via a peer-to-peer connection and receive the content item from the one or more other local devices (e.g., wherein the other local devices may have previously received the content item from network memory or may store the content item in a higher storage capacity than the storage capacity of the receiving local device). For example, some embodiments of method 500 may examine such network connections that allow faster and/or lower cost data transmission than other types of network connections, e.g., data connections such as cellular services.
If a wireless local network connection is available, the method continues to block 510 where a wireless local network is selected at block 510, and as described below, the method continues to block 514. If a wireless local connection is not available, the method continues to block 512 where a different network connection to the local user equipment is selected if available and if such a network is allowed to be used, at block 512. For example, a wireless cellular data connection may be accessed, or a wired network connection may be accessed, for example, if one or more local user devices are connected to a wired communication network. In some embodiments, if the user has provided permission to use a different network, such a network is used, or if such permission is not provided, the method is stopped. The method continues to block 514.
In block 514, it is checked whether the plurality of local user devices are eligible to receive content items from the remote storage currently storing the set of content items. In some implementations, the user may have multiple mobile local devices, each of which may store one or more of the content items in the set of content items. For example, a user may have a mobile phone, tablet device, display (e.g., augmented or virtual reality display) headset device, and watch device that are eligible to store content items. In some implementations, to determine local device eligibility, a system executing method 500 may determine which local devices are available to the user by checking which devices the user has previously used, e.g., based on previous access to the user account by the using device. For example, if the user has agreed to such access, stored data describing previous local devices that the user has used (e.g., type of device used and time/location used) may be accessed as user data.
The system is also able to detect whether these devices are currently available for receiving and storing content items. For example, in some implementations, the server implementing block 514 may send a signal to a plurality of local user devices requesting the local devices to respond with device information indicating that the devices are connected to a network and/or available to store content items, wherein the local devices are deemed unavailable if the server does not receive a reply signal. In some implementations, the server may request to receive device information indicating current status and/or characteristics of available local user devices, such as available storage capacity, processing power, etc. The local device receives the request and replies with device information indicating the requested status and characteristics. In some implementations, the system may request device information from the local device at different times, e.g., before and/or after performing method 500.
In some implementations, the system may detect a local device that the user does not own or have previously accessed, but is determined to be likely to be present at the user's location during the predicted event. For example, a business location, public service area, or other location that is open to the public may have one or more local devices available to the person and operable and available to store and display content items from public personnel or members of the organization. In some examples, the network may be configured to communicate with the network using, for example, a local network and/or peer-to-peer network protocol (e.g., ) One or more of the user's local devices may be able to detect the presence of such local devices at a particular location. In some implementations, the presence of such local devices at a particular location may be determined using publicly available information, for example, of websites or other sources related to institutions at that location.
If it is determined in block 514 that the plurality of local devices are not acceptable, the method continues to block 520 as described below. If it is determined that the plurality of local devices are eligible, the method continues to block 516 where the plurality of local devices are ranked for storage of the content item in block 516. For example, in some implementations, the ranking may be determined as a score. The ranking may be based on one or more of a variety of different factors.
For example, the ranking score of a local device may be based on device status and characteristics that indicate the available storage capacity and processing power of the local device. For example, a higher ranking score may be assigned to a device currently having a greater storage capacity. As described above, the current available storage capacity of the local device may be determined in block 512 based on the device information provided by the local device. Some implementations may determine a predicted availability of local memory at the time of the predicted event and determine a ranking score based on the predicted memory availability. For example, the prediction may be based on a current availability of local memory and an estimate of the user's use of local memory for a time remaining between the current time and the time of the predicted event, where the estimate of local memory use is based on the user's previous use of local memory of the local device over time (e.g., how local memory is filled and released over time).
In another example, the characteristic of the local device that may affect the ranking may be, for example, a current battery power level and/or battery power storage capacity as the local device reports as device information to a system implementing method 500. If the current battery level is below a predetermined threshold and the predicted event will occur in the near future (e.g., within 1 hour), the local device's rank may be reduced, indicating that it is less suitable to store the content item, as the local device may run out of power during the predicted event. Similarly, the ranking score of a local device having battery capacity that may not last for the entire duration of a predicted event may be reduced.
The ranking score of the local device may be based on whether the local device is likely to appear with the user in the predicted event. For example, a particular type of local device may be excluded from consideration (e.g., a device assigned a very low ranking score). In some examples, if the predicted event is located at a different location than the normal use location of the non-mobile local device (e.g., television, desktop computer, etc.), the non-mobile local device (e.g., television, desktop computer, etc.) may be ranked as low-scoring, or the virtual reality headset may be ranked as low-scoring for the sightseeing event location.
The ranking score of the local device may be based on previous (historical) uses of the local device by the user and/or whether such previous uses are relevant to one or more of the predicted events or event persons. For example, if user consent for retrieval has been obtained, the server may retrieve and examine stored data indicating past use of the local device by the user. The usage data may indicate a usage pattern of the local devices by the user, e.g., which local devices are most commonly used by the user, which local devices the user accesses at a particular location (e.g., at home, at work, at other locations, on vacations, etc.), and/or which local devices the user uses to view content items and/or to perform other tasks. For example, if it is determined that the predicted event occurred during a user vacation, a higher ranking score may be assigned to a local device that the user used while on a previous vacation. If the user previously used the local device to navigate or other tasks other than for viewing the content item, the device may be assigned a lower ranking score.
In some implementations, a particular type of device may be pre-associated with a particular type of content, such as content that is most commonly viewed or used on that type of device. Such associations may be stored and accessed to determine ranking scores for devices. For example, a laptop device may be associated with documents, slide presentations, and similar types of content, and a tablet device may be associated with image, video, and audio types of content. In some implementations, the ranking score of the local device can be based on the number of content items of the content item set associated with that type of device. For example, if a large number of content items in the set of content items are of the image or video type, a higher ranking score may be assigned to the mobile phone device and a lower ranking score may be assigned to the laptop computer device. In some implementations, the ranking score of the local device can be based on a percentage of content items of the set of content items that have a particular type. For example, the greater the percentage of a particular type, the higher the ranking score of the devices associated with that type.
The ranking score of the local devices may also be based on stored user preferences indicating which local devices the user prefers to store the content item. In some implementations, the system can instruct display of a prompt on one or more local devices to receive user input from a user, where the user input indicates which local devices the user prefers to store the content item.
In some implementations, a separate ranking score may be determined for each rating factor (including one or more of any of the above factors) evaluated, and the separate ranking scores of the factors may be combined (e.g., summed) to a total ranking score for each available local device. The method continues to block 518.
In block 518, a particular local device is selected to store the set of content items and a storage distribution of the set of content items in the selected local device is determined. In some implementations, the highest ranked local device is selected to store the set of content items based on the ranking of block 516. For example, the total ranking scores of the local devices are compared, and the local device with the highest total ranking score is selected. In some examples, the highest ranked device may be determined to be the most suitable local user device or devices to receive and store the content item based on the ranking score. In embodiments herein, a high ranking score indicates that the device is more suitable for selection; other embodiments may provide other scoring schemes (e.g., a lower score indicates more appropriate selection, etc.).
In some implementations, multiple local devices may be selected and a storage distribution of content items in local memories of the local devices determined. For example, a local device having a total ranking score above a predetermined ranking threshold may be selected for content item storage. In some implementations, the system can determine the available storage capacity of the highest ranked local device. If the highest ranked device does not have sufficient storage capacity to store all of the content items in the set of content items, one or more additional local devices may be selected. In some examples, if the highest ranked local device is a mobile phone determined to have a storage capacity that cannot accommodate all content items, the next highest ranked device (e.g., tablet device) may also be selected to store at least some content items.
In some implementations, if the highest ranked local device cannot store all of the content items in the set of content items, the next highest ranked device can be selected to store all of the content items, e.g., such that the entire set of content items is stored on a single device. In some implementations, a subset of the set of content items can be stored on a plurality of different devices based on various criteria. For example, some implementations may divide content items for storage on different local devices based on the type of content item. In some examples, the image may be stored on one of the local devices and the video and audio clips may be stored on a different local device. In some implementations, content items more suitable for display or output on a type of device may be assigned to local memory on that type of device. For example, higher resolution images may present better detail on devices with larger screens, so such images may be designated for transmission to local devices with larger screens (e.g., tablet devices) rather than local devices with smaller screens (e.g., mobile phones). Content items with audio components (e.g., video or audio clips) may be assigned to local devices with speakers. Even if there is sufficient storage capacity, some local devices are not currently available to store the content item, e.g., the processing power of the local device may be occupied by performing one or more tasks and may not be available to store the content item. In some implementations, such a local device may be removed from consideration for storing the content item.
Various implementations may divide content items for storage on different local devices based on one or more other criteria, e.g., subject matter depicted or described in the content items (e.g., owners or a particular person stored on one device, or all sceneries stored on one device), based on time of capture or creation (e.g., all most recent content items are selected to be stored on the highest ranked device until available storage capacity is filled, remaining old content items are selected to be stored on different local devices), based on storage size (e.g., all content items stored at a size of less than, e.g., 1 megabyte are assigned to one device, while larger content items are assigned to different local devices), based on one or more predicted events associated with each local device (e.g., all content items associated with a business event assigned to one device, all content items associated with a particular location of a predicted event assigned to a particular device, all content items associated with a particular location of a late event assigned to a particular device), based on a graph of storage size (e.g., all content items stored at a size of less than, e.g., 1 megabyte are assigned to a different local device), based on ranking of the remaining content items (e.g., a piece of content item 426 is assigned to a highest ranked content item, etc.). Some implementations may combine two or more of these criteria to determine which local devices to select to store which particular content items in the set of content items.
In some implementations, a particular content item may be assigned to memory on multiple local devices if such memory and devices are available. For example, if there is sufficient local storage on the user's mobile phone and tablet device, specific images and videos may be assigned to memory on both the user's mobile phone and tablet device.
In some implementations, one or more local devices associated with one or more other users, different from the user associated with the content item, can be selected to receive the content item for local storage. In some examples, some content items may be shared or commonly owned by multiple users. For example, a shared album may be stored on a network memory, which may store images, videos, and other content items that are accessible by any user associated with the shared album. In some cases or implementations, if it is determined that multiple users associated with a content item are to occur at a predicted event (e.g., additional users aside that are not related to the content item), one or more content items may be stored using any of the users' local devices. For example, if two users are associated with a shared album stored on a server and the local devices of the two users have limited local storage capacity to store the entire set of content items, then a first portion of the set of content items may be designated for storage on a first selected local device of a first user and a second portion of the set of content items may be designated for storage on a second selected local device of a second user.
Some implementations may determine which shared content items to store on a particular user's local device based on any of a variety of factors. For example, a content item owned, captured or created by one of the different users may be designated for storage on the user's local device. The content items depicting or describing a particular user may be stored on the local device of the user being depicted or, alternatively, on a local device of the user not being depicted or described. Content items depicting or describing material that is determined to be strongly associated with (or of interest to) one of the users may be assigned to the user's local device. For example, if it is determined that one of the users mentioned the term "baseball" in a threshold percentage of more messages than the other users, it may be specified that the baseball-related content item is stored on the user's local device.
In block 520, in some implementations, compression of one or more content items in the set of content items may be determined and performed. For example, one or more constraints may be checked to determine if one or more content items should be compressed. In some examples, the current total available storage capacity on all available local devices is checked and one or more content items may be compressed to reduce the storage space they use if it is smaller than the storage size of the content item set and/or if storage of the content items can allow less than a predetermined amount of available free storage on the local devices. In some implementations, the current available amount of memory, processing power, or other characteristics of the local device may be determined based on device information and/or network information reported and transmitted by the local device, e.g., to a server as described above. In some implementations, the local memory constraints can include transmission constraints regarding transmitting the content item to the local device. For example, a current bandwidth of a transmission channel from a system performing the method 500 to a local device may be determined, and if the bandwidth is below a predetermined threshold, then there is a constraint that one or more content items may be compressed to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted. Some embodiments may determine the predicted availability of local memory at the time of the predicted event as a constraint, which may be determined as described above.
If there are sufficient constraints, one or more content items may be compressed. For example, if the determined constraint is that the total available storage capacity of the local device is less than the storage space required for the set of content items, one or more content items may be compressed using one or more compression algorithms (e.g., using a lossy or lossless compression algorithm) to reduce the storage space required to store those content items. For example, a number of the lowest ranked content items (e.g., based on the ranking determined in block 426 of fig. 4) may be compressed to reduce the storage size of the set of content items to the available storage capacity of the local device. In some cases, the compression settings may be determined by user preferences or user input.
In some implementations, for example, by removing one or more content items in the set of content items, the number of content items in the set of content items may be reduced such that the remaining content items in the set of content items fit the storage capacity of the local device. For example, a number of the lowest ranked content items may be removed from the set of content items (e.g., based on the ranking determined in block 426 of fig. 4) such that the set of content items fits the storage capacity of the local device.
In some implementations, content items may be compressed (and/or removed) from a collection based on one or more other or additional criteria. For example, content items may be compressed (and/or removed) based on the type of content item (e.g., video and/or audio clips may be compressed prior to an image), based on the subject matter depicted or described in the content item (e.g., scenery scene compressed prior to displaying a person's scene), based on the capture or creation date of the content item (e.g., old content item compressed or removed first), etc. In some implementations, stored user preferences or current user inputs may indicate that content items are to be compressed and/or removed. For example, the user preference may indicate that having a greater number of content items is more important than the quality of those content items, in which case some or all of the content items may be compressed in order to accommodate more content items in memory. In some implementations, compression may also or alternatively be considered when selecting the content item set in the method 400 of fig. 4 (e.g., block 428), and compression may be specified for the content item determined to be compressed by block 520.
In some implementations or situations, if multiple local devices are available, compression or removal of the content item may return the method to block 518 to select one or more different local devices to store the set of content items. In some examples, the compression and/or removal of some content items may allow the collection of content items to be accommodated to a local memory of a single local device, such that a second local device may be removed from the selection and the content items not sent to the second local device. The method continues to block 522.
In block 522, a transfer of the set of content items from the network memory (or from the system performing the method 500) to the memory of the selected local device is performed. The transmitted set of content items may be a copy of the set of content items stored on the network memory. For example, in some implementations, network memory may be provided on a server and the content item sets transmitted over one or more communication networks for receipt by and storage in a local memory of the local device. In some implementations, if multiple local devices are receiving content items, the appropriate content items in the set of content items can be transmitted directly to each local device that has been selected to store those content items. In some implementations, a subset of the selected local devices (e.g., one local device) can receive the set of content items and can transmit appropriate content items to one or more other local devices for storage (where the local device receiving the set of content items removes the transmitted content items from its own memory). The first local device may use a local peer-to-peer network connection (e.g.,etc.) receives the collection of content items and forwards the appropriate content items of the received collection to one or more nearby local devices. / >
In some implementations, if one or more of the selected local devices are not currently available to receive the content item, the system can check (e.g., periodically) for availability of those devices for a period of time between the current time and the time of the predicted event. If previously unavailable devices become available, transmission of the associated content items to those devices may be made. In some implementations, if one or more unavailable local devices are unavailable to receive the associated content item before a threshold period of time prior to the predicted event, the system can send a notification to the one or more available local devices of the user requesting that the user make those unavailable devices available (e.g., turn on local device power, enable network connection, etc.).
In some implementations, one or more local devices may provide updates to a system performing the methods 300-500, the methods 300-500 describing one or more characteristics of the local devices in connection with the storage of the set of content items. For example, these characteristics may include changes in available local memory. In some implementations, if a greater local storage amount on the local device becomes available for the content item (e.g., greater than the local storage amount previously determined and used in methods 400-500) for a period of time prior to the time of the predicted event, the local device can inform the system performing the above-described method of this change. In some implementations, the system can add more content items to the stored set of content items due to the greater local storage. For example, the next highest ranked content item in the ranking of content items may be added to the set of content items in method 400, one or more suitable highest ranked local devices may be determined to store the added content items in method 500, and method 500 may be used to transmit the added content items to the determined local devices. In some cases, some or all portions of methods 400 and 500 may be performed again, e.g., re-ranking content items based on changes in local memory and/or other changes in characteristics of the local device.
Similarly, if less local memory on the local device becomes available for the content item during a period of time prior to the time of the predicted event, the local device may inform the system performing the above-described method of this change. For example, the local device may indicate that a released local storage (e.g., for other functions of the local device) is required. In some implementations, due to the reduced local storage, the system can determine which content items to remove from the stored set of content items. For example, the lowest ranked content item stored on the updated local device may be specified based on the ranking of method 400, e.g., a number of content items sufficient to release the indicated local storage. The designation/identification of the content item may be sent to the requesting local device, and the local device may remove the designated content item from the local memory. In some implementations, the local device can access the ranking of content items (e.g., stored locally) and can determine which of the lowest ranked content items are removed from the local memory. In some cases, some or all portions of methods 400 and 500 may be performed again, e.g., re-ranking content items based on changes in local memory and/or other changes in characteristics of the local device.
FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating an example method 600 of enabling a user to access a set of content items stored on one or more local devices. For example, the method 600 may be used to implement the block 220 of the example method 200 of fig. 2. In some examples, the method 600 may be performed by one or more local devices during (or prior to) a predicted event to present stored content items to a user.
In block 602, it is checked whether user consent (e.g., user permissions) has been obtained to use the user data in the implementation of method 600. For example, the user data may include the user data described above. One or more blocks of the methods described herein may use such user data. If user consent has been obtained from the relevant users in method 600 that may use the user data, then at block 604, the blocks of determining the method herein may be implemented through the rational use of the user data as described for those blocks, and the method continues to block 608. If user consent has not been obtained, then in block 606 it is determined that the block will be implemented without using user data, and the method continues to block 608. In some implementations, if user consent has not been obtained, the method 600 is stopped.
In block 608, it is checked whether one or more content items stored by the local device are associated with a predicted event other than the current (occurring) predicted event. For example, in some implementations, some content items stored on the local device may be associated with a first event and some content items stored on the local device may be associated with a second event. If the current predicted event is a first event, the content item associated with the second event is not associated with the current predicted event.
If none of the content items stored by the local device are associated with other predicted events, the method continues to block 612, as described below. If one or more content items stored by the local device are not associated with the current predicted event and are associated with one or more other predicted events, the method continues to block 610 where display highlighting of unassociated content items is reduced during the current predicted event, in block 610. For example, unassociated content items may be designated for display at the end of a list or series of displayed content items (or otherwise output by the local device) such that the associated content items are displayed first during the currently predicted event. In some implementations, it may be specified that the unassociated content item is not displayed (or otherwise output) during the currently predicted event unless the user inputs a particular command to the local device to display the unassociated content item. For example, in some implementations, unassociated content items are not identified or accessed in blocks 510-514 below. The method continues to block 612.
At block 612, it is checked whether the plurality of local devices are storing content items, e.g., storing one or more content items associated with the predicted event that is occurring. For example, as described herein (e.g., with reference to fig. 5), some implementations may store different subsets of content items on a plurality of different local devices if such devices are eligible. If there are no multiple local devices storing the content item, then a single local device is storing the content item, and the method continues to block 614 where one or more content items are presented on the local device storing the content item based on user input and/or other conditions. For example, the local device may display or otherwise output the content item based on the depicted or described material, category, capture or creation date, content type, etc., selected by the user input. Any of a variety of application programs may be used to display content items, such as viewing applications, communication applications, web browser applications, gaming applications, and the like. For example, user input may be provided in a displayed user interface of an application or other program running on the local device, e.g., to select an icon, tab, menu item, or other displayed representation of a command or content item.
If it is determined in block 612 that there are multiple local devices storing the content item, the method continues to block 614 where, in block 614, an identification of each local device storing the content item is displayed by one or more local devices, e.g., in a viewing interface. For example, if the content item is stored on the mobile phone and the tablet device, the mobile phone and/or tablet device may display an identification of the tablet device and/or mobile phone, respectively, to indicate other local devices storing the content item. In some implementations, if content items have been stored on different local devices based on a particular type, category, subject matter, creation date, or other criteria, such criteria and distribution of content items may also be displayed to indicate which devices store which content items. The method continues to block 616.
In block 616, in some implementations, one or more options may be displayed on one or more local devices, where the options enable a user to access content items stored on one or more other local devices. For example, the option allows a local device used by the user to retrieve content item data from different local devices and display the content item on the accessed local device. This allows a user to view the entire set of locally stored content items on one local device, regardless of which of the plurality of local devices store the content items. In some examples, a user may select an option displayed on a mobile phone to view a content item stored on a tablet device. In some implementations, if such an option is selected, the first (on display) local device retrieves the content item from the local memory of the second local device using a wireless peer-to-peer network connection provided between the first and second local devices, and the first local device displays the content item on the display of the first local device. For example, the option may be an icon or other display item representing the second device that, when selected by the user (e.g., using a touch screen or other input device), causes the first device to display a list of content items and/or categories of content stored on the second device for further selection and display by the first device. In some implementations, the first local device does not store the content items retrieved from the second and other local devices in the content item memory of the first device, e.g., the first local device displays only the retrieved content items (e.g., streams data of the content items and stores the content items in a temporary display buffer memory). The method continues to block 618.
At block 618, one or more content items are presented on the local device storing the content items based on user input and/or other conditions. For example, the local device may display or otherwise output the content item based on the depicted or described material, category, capture or creation date, content type, etc., selected by the user input. Any of a variety of applications may be used to output content items, such as viewing applications, audio output applications, communication applications, web browser applications, gaming applications, and the like. If the presented option is selected as described above, the content items stored by the local device may be displayed by the local device and/or the content items stored on the other local devices may be displayed on the particular device. For example, user input may be provided in a user interface of an application or other program running on the displayed local device, e.g., to select an icon, tag, menu item, or other displayed representation of a command or content item.
The blocks and operations described in the methods and configurations disclosed herein may, where appropriate, be performed in a different order than shown or described, and/or concurrently with other blocks or operations (partially or fully). Some blocks may be performed for a portion of data and, for example, performed again after another portion of data. Not all illustrated blocks and operations may be required to be performed in various embodiments. In some implementations, the blocks and operations may be performed multiple times in a method, in a different order, and/or at different times.
In some implementations, some or all of the methods may be implemented on a system such as one or more of the client devices 120, 122, 124, or 126 shown in fig. 1. In some implementations, one or more of the methods described herein may be implemented, for example, on the server system 102 as shown in fig. 1, and/or on both the server system and the client system. In some implementations, different components of one or more clients and/or servers may perform different blocks, operations, or other portions of the method.
Fig. 7 is a block diagram of an example system 700 that provides for determination of predicted events and transmission of content items to local memory of a local device in accordance with one or more features described herein.
In the example of fig. 7, server 702 is in network communication with one or more local devices associated with the user, such as local device 704 and local device 706. The local device 704 includes a local memory 708 and the local device 706 includes a local memory 710. In various embodiments, the network communication is a wireless communication, or may be a wired communication.
As described herein, server 702 may determine one or more upcoming predicted events associated with a user. In this example, server 702 has obtained the consent of the user to receive and examine user data associated with the user, which is stored in an accessible memory (e.g., one or more databases) that stores the user data. For example, the accessible memory may be one or more memory devices of server 702 and/or memory devices accessible to server 702 over a network. The user data includes calendar data 712, message data 714, and location data 716. In some examples, the data stored on these memory devices may be provided from one or more local devices that have stored and/or provided the data for use by the user and/or from a server system accessible from the local device.
In this example, server 702 determines that a calendar entry in the user's calendar indicates that the user will attend a baseball game for a particular team at a particular time and date. Server 702 may determine the geographic location of a baseball game, for example, by referencing a publicly available calendar of a baseball team available on, for example, a website of the internet or other information service. In some implementations, server 702 may also query public information (e.g., websites or databases dedicated to such information) indicating whether wireless communications are available to the participants' devices, whether such communications are reliable, etc.
In this example, server 702 also examines one or more emails and social networking messages of the user stored in message data 714 (assuming the server has obtained consent of the user and other users referenced in the data). For example, the server determines that some message has been passed between the user and another user Ji, the message referencing the determined baseball game, such as "see game on friday", and "me hopes XYZ may win once". Thus, jil is determined as the event person that the user may meet in the predicted event. In this example, server 702 also examines the user's location history from location data 716 to determine that the user was previously attended several times at the same location of the baseball game.
Server 702 determines content items stored on one or more local devices prior to the time of the predicted event, e.g., prior to the event occurring. For example, after obtaining user consent from a user, server 702 accesses network store 720 via a communication network, and network store 720 may include one or more databases or a collection of other content items, such as online albums, lists, directories, shared albums, and various network services and/or other repositories that the user uses to store the content items. The local devices 704 and 706 may also access network memory to retrieve content items. Content items stored in network memory 720 may include images, videos, audio clips or files, documents, games, and other items described herein.
In this example, after obtaining user consent from the user and other users referenced in the data, server 702 determines three content items of the set of content items to be stored on the local device, including image 722, image 724, and audio clip 726. The image 722 is determined based on stored location metadata (e.g., geographic coordinates) associated with the image 722 that indicates that the image 722 was captured at a location that matches the location of the predicted event on a previous occasion. In this case, the user captures an image 722 at the same stadium of the upcoming baseball game (predicted event) in the previous baseball game. The image 724 is determined based on image tags indicating that the user gills are depicted in the image 724 (e.g., as determined by the user adding or using one or more image face detection techniques). In addition, the stored location metadata associated with image 722 indicates that the image was captured at a baseball stadium that is different from the location of the upcoming baseball game. For example, when a user is engaged in a baseball game at the same stadium as an upcoming baseball game, the audio clip 726 has a creation date and owner metadata that indicates that it was previously created by the user at the same location as the predicted event. Further, the speech recognition analysis indicates that the user's speech and Jil's speech are recorded in the audio clip.
These three content items 722, 724, and 726 have determined stronger (e.g., higher) ranking scores than other content items stored in network memory. In this example, this is because, as described above, the content items have one or more characteristics that are related to the predicted event. For example, because the content items relate to the location of the predicted event (e.g., by the associated creation location), to previous occasions when the user accessed the location related to the predicted event (e.g., capture at a stadium related to a different baseball game, capture at the user's previous participation in the baseball game), and to one or more event personnel determined to be likely to participate in the predicted event with the user (e.g., portraying a gill, which would likely appear in an upcoming baseball game), the ranking score of the content items is higher.
The image 728 is stored in the network memory 720 but is not determined for local storage due to having a weak ranking score, e.g., a score below a threshold ranking score. For example, it may have been found that image 728 does not have characteristics associated with the predicted event (e.g., no matches to the baseball game are found in the tag or depicted image features, locations, or event personnel), and/or that image 728 may have been determined to have been previously shared with Jil's user accounts, resulting in a lower ranking. In some implementations, the image 728 may be included in a set of content items for local storage, for example, if it is determined that gills appear with the user at locations depicted in the image 728, this may increase the ranking score of the image 728 (e.g., because the image relates to the event person gills). For example, the occurrence of Jil at the location of image 728 may be determined based on past messages passed between the user and Jil when image 728 was captured or the location where image 728 was captured referenced prior to the time of capture. In some implementations, if user consent has been obtained, editing of the image by the user, etc., based on the user viewing frequency of the image 728 or other images depicting the same subject as provided in the stored user data describing the user activity, if it is determined that the user is highly interested in the image 728, e.g., related to the subject of interest to the user (e.g., far enough or small diameter), the image 728 may be included in the set of content items for local storage and the user data accessed by the server 702.
Server 702 determines which local device 704 and 706 will receive the determined set of content items (including content items 722, 724, and 726) and the distribution of the content items across local devices 704 and 706. In this example, the local device 704 is a mobile phone and the local device 706 is a tablet device. Server 702 determines the local device 704 with the most usage based on stored usage data that the user has used local devices 704 and 706 to view the content item in the past. The usage data also indicates that both devices 704 and 706 have been used in a baseball game in which the previous user participated (e.g., by correlating the date of the usage data with the date of the attendance of the baseball game). Server 702 receives status data 730 from local devices 704 and 706, status data 730 indicating the currently available local storage on the local device for the content item.
Server 702 determines a ranking score for local devices 704 and 706 based on one or more factors described herein, including the available local storage on each local device in this example. In this example, there is not enough storage available on the local device 704 to accommodate all content items. Based on the stored user preferences, server 702 determines that the user prefers to output audio and video content on local device 706, for example, because of the better quality speakers present on the device. Thus, server 702 determines to transmit images 722 and 724 to local device 704 and audio clip 726 to local device 706.
Server 702 transmits the appropriate content items of the collection in transmission data 732 to local devices 704 and 706. In addition, the server sends a notification to each local device 704 and 706 indicating which content items have been stored on the other local device 706 and 704, respectively. In some implementations, each local device 704 and 706 may present the user with options for accessing and displaying content items stored on the other content device 706 and 704, respectively, as described herein.
In other implementations, a client device (e.g., any of client devices 120-126 of FIG. 1, or local device 704 or 706) may make the above-described determination of the predicted event, the determination of the content item to be stored in the local memory of the local device, and the transmission of the content item prior to the predicted event. For example, the client device may access user data (including calendar data 712, message data 714, and location data 716) and/or network memory 720 via a communication network and/or via one or more server systems to do so.
