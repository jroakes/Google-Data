Background technology
Medical evaluation is traditionally to carry out single by trained supplier or evaluate and test to carry out several times.Generally these
Evaluation and test is in hospital or doctor's office progress.These evaluation and tests are typically incomplete, and this causes more effectively early in treatment
Stage phase fails to make disease detection.This is partially due to be with individual patients circadian rhythm in evaluation and test --- the one of such as patient
My god (circadian rhythm) --- some of continuous statistics snapshot carry out.May also due to be patient health evaluation and test can
These evaluation and tests are carried out during some particular cases that can be changed therebetween and are led to the failure, above-mentioned change is such as due to body
Locate the pressure caused by doctor's office.
These problems are partly solved by being monitored in family.Patient can be provided to the prison of such as blood pressure cuff
Depending on equipment, patient can use it special time or consistent physiological status (for example, after waking up in bed or it is early after the meal
Monitor his or her blood pressure at once).Although this partial solution, which is looked, solves scattered evaluation and test, data show
Show, patient will not generally adhere to accomplishing that family monitors.Many patients will use equipment to lose interest for a period of time and then just, this
Only can be by unfavorable health consequences.Other patients will then use once in a while equipment, in several days without using, in different time or
Described equipment etc. is used under different conditions.Also some then will be unable to proper use of equipment, and these give inaccurate knot
Really.For those correct, lasting and long-term use supervision equipment patients, because supervision equipment has been deposited in problem
Prescription is just provided after, so this partial solution still can not monitor medical conditions early.For those reasons, when
When user performs monitoring by initiative, family's monitoring tends not to provide accurately medical treatment evaluation and test, within the longer term even more
So.
Further, current medical treatment evaluation and test is adversely affected due to the intrinsic changeability of crowd, and therefore
In the health evaluation and test for attempting to calibrate individual in the presence of intrinsic difficulty.
The content of the invention
This document describes make it possible to be directed to consistent patient profiles --- and human heart life of such as people when falling asleep refers to
Mark (vitals) --- carry out the technology and device of more complete health status trend evaluation.Various noninvasive health monitors can
It is used to sense the situation of patient, such as activity, environment, mood or physiological status.These noninvasive health monitors can also be by
It is operated dynamicly and during the normal life of patient, this improves the wish that many patients obey monitoring, Er Qiezeng
The uniformity used is added, because in many cases, nearly or completely it goes without doing that anything is his or her strong to cause by patient
Health is monitored and healthy trend determines to be carried out., can be with using health status determined by gathering for consistent patient profiles
It is determined that more accurate and more robust healthy trend.Therefore, the technology can determine patient sleep and in he or
Specified point in her circadian rhythm, and heart that is daily and monitoring patient under identical patient profiles all the time.By this
Sample is done, even if the demand for being actively engaged in or being calibrated for mean of population to patient of no patient, also can determine trouble

Embodiment
General introduction
This document describes permit a determination that to allow the trend in the health status and these states that detect disease process
Technology and equipment.By continually evaluating and testing the health status of patient relative to advancing of disease time scale, it can recognize that
Healthy trend simultaneously uses it for managing patient health.Described information is not only due to its accuracy and robustness and for the doctor of patient
Treating professional has value, and why valuable it is also as it provides the True Data relevant with them for patient.No
Average, demography or the vague generalization precognition from medical professional are same as, the data related to them are more
Prompting patient is possible to take action to maintain or improve its own health.Such as deep sleep or fortune are in user or patient
The comparison promoted between a bulk measurement is estimated to them during the similar state of dynamic period, and reduced for individual come school
The demand of quasi- health measurement and model.
As a comparison, it is considered to accuracy and Shandong by healthy trend determined by being monitored in medical institutions or hospital
Rod.Assuming that having carried out four different tests in hospital or medical institutions in two months；The blood pressure of patient is measured in the morning
Once, measurement in afternoon once, is measured once after patient takes in excessive caffeine, and measures one after a late poor sleep
It is secondary.In these difference tests is carried out during the different situations of patient each time.Therefore, because these different patients
Therefore situation, the trend based on this four tests be suspicious.
Further contemplate based on average value and demographic medical advice.Many patients are all based on average value and demographics
Learn and ignore medical advice, because it is not really related to them.For example, being provided well based on demographics and average value
It is recommended that when, many people are all without following this suggestion or being insufficient to muchly follow this suggestion, because they do not have
See benefit.When people take its diet of change and the suggestion --- most people is not intended to so do --- being accustomed to, they are often
It can't see improvement.They may can be appreciated that their weight loss etc., but these are not the accurate measurement of their health.Just
Because of that, many people are returned in their old habit, and this can undergo this gall of defeat.
By way of one example of technology as described herein, it is assumed that patient has three noninvasive health in her bathroom
Supervision equipment.These three are the mirrors above mat, toilet seat sensor and her bathroom sink before her bathroom sink
Son.Each situation and health status that can individually or jointly be used to measure the patient in these equipment.Therefore,
The mat can measure the electric behavior of her body to provide electrocardiogram, and the toilet seat sensor can measure blood stream
Pressure pulse when crossing body is so as to characterize the mechanical movement of heart and blood flow, and the mirror above her tank can then make
Capillary blood flow or skin color change are measured with sensor or color camera based on radar, this can indicate difference blood
Amount is so as to provide photoplethysmogram.
Each in these physiological signals, which can be provided, to be seen clearly health status, but these states depend on health
Evaluate and test circadian rhythm, activity level and the environmental condition at moment.Commented for example, health can be carried out during similar situation daily
Survey, such as when patient just gets up, daily same time or sit down have breakfast when.Patient profiles are also based on
Physiological status, such as when patient has the heart rate between 100 to 104 heartbeats per minute, standing rather than be seated or
During recumbency, etc..Note, as long as this patient not necessarily does some things outside normal life process --- at station in mat
Washed one's face while upper, and saw to mirror and just provide its life index of sensing and physiology letter for these three equipment using closestool
Number chance.This tittle is gathered most useful data provide into her health model to there is provided can be with
The evaluation and test that previous health data are contrasted.Therefore, by being in the patient profiles similar to evaluating and testing before, movable water in patient
It is evaluated and tested in the case of flat and similar environmental condition, the healthy trend for being easier to management is identified.
The technology then can determine health status trend for consistent patient profiles and provide it to patient or
Practitioner.Assuming that in new eating habit and exercise routine, the technology determine wherein according to stroke volume (health of heart
Important measurement) measured by patient's heart health improved in surrounding 6% health status trend.Have so positive anti-
Feedback, this patient may continue her diet and exercise plan, cardiopathic chance is died from too early so as to reduce her.Phase
Instead, if it find that the elevated trend of blood pressure, the then suggestion that she can be provided to limit her Salt intake to reduce blood pressure.
These are only the examples for being able to carry out determining the various ways of health status trend for consistent patient profiles.Hereafter
There is provided other examples, the deep sleep sensing such as based on radar.Herein turning now to example context, then description example without

On noninvasive health monitoring device 106, two example is shown in Fig. 1, it is considered to the detailed diagram in Fig. 3.Nothing
Wound health monitoring device 106 can be one of various equipment or combination, and here is illustrated five examples：Radar lamp 106-1, colour
Sense mirror 106-2, pressure and electric sensor pad 106-3 (mat 106-3), ultrasound bathtub 106-4 and pressure sensitive toilet seat
106-5 (closestool 106-5).
Clearly interactive sensing for not needing patient, these noninvasive health monitoring devices 106 can also be passive
--- patient need not pick up sensor, deliberately stand on scale, or select some sensors what does.Although
It is passive in the sensing, but some in these equipment are by being sent out sound wave (for example, ultrasound bathtub 106-5), electricity
Magnetic wave, electric signal, unification illuminate (for example, mirror 106-2) and millimeter and similar radiation (for example, radar lamp 106-1) to feel
Survey the health status of patient.Miscellaneous equipment in these equipment even stopped ripple, signal and the use of radiation, such as pass through horse
Bucket 106-5 senses the blood pressure of patient 102.
Noninvasive health monitoring device 106 can have various computing capabilitys, although they can be in addition have seldom or
There is no computing capability capabilities equipment.Here equipment 106 includes one or more computer processors 302, computer-readable
Storage medium 304, health monitoring sensor 306, and can receive and transmit having for information (for example, to computing device 110)
Line or wireless transceiver 308.Each noninvasive health monitoring device 106 can be included therein with identical or different form
Different health monitoring sensors 306, so as to measure the health status or patient profiles and other side of patient.It is computer-readable
Storage medium 304 includes sensor manager 310, and it can handle sensing data and record and transmit for health monitoring
The sensing data of action.
For example, it is contemplated that Fig. 4, which illustrates the health prison that can be included in radar lamp 106-1 or colored sensing mirrors 106-2
The example based on radar of view sensor 306.As the above mentioned, health monitoring sensor 306 is configured as by this
In particular case health status and patient profiles are sensed using radar area.In order to be sensed, health monitoring sensor
306 include radar emission element 402, antenna element 404 and signal processor 406.
Radar lamp 106-1 and/or colored sensing mirror 106-2 are configured as radiation of the reflection from tissue to measure
Skin temperature and perspire, heart rate and skeleton motion, this only gives some instances.Radar lamp 106-1 includes radar emission element
402, it is such as radiated by the radiation of continuous modulation, ultra-wide-band emission or submillimeter frequency and is provided arranged to from human body group
Knit the radar area for reflecting and penetrating non-human material.These reflections can be received by antenna element 404, then by signal transacting
The processing of device 406 is so as to provide sensing data 108.The radar area can be from the human body group of such as skin, bone or cardiac muscle
Knit reflection.For example, it is assumed that patient 102 is in sleep, radar lamp 106-1 is integral with the lamp on its bedside cupboard.Under normal circumstances,
People can move in one day, therefore sensing data is probably unreliable or noisy.However, under sleep quality, radar
The chest of lamp 106-1 measurement patients 102 is offset with recording respiration speed.The skew of these chests includes the heartbeat institute by patient 102
It is caused to rock or disturb, therefore heart rate can also be calculated.
In more detail, the radar area provided by radar emission element 402 can be small size, and e.g., from about 1 millimeter extremely
About 1.5 meters, or medium size, e.g., from about 1 meter to about 30 meters.With the intermediate sizes, antenna element 404 or signal transacting
Device 406 is configured to receive and process the reflection of radar area, so that based on coming from caused by the motion of body, arm or leg
The reflection of tissue provides general state or situation.Antenna element 404 can include one or more antennas or sensor,
It is surface or volume that quantity in such as radiation sensor array, array, which is based on desired resolution ratio and this,.Antenna
Element can also be turned to including mechanically or electrically beamlet.For example, the phase gradient through transmitter array can be used in sleep
Wave beam is directed to area-of-interest by person when moving, so as to allow to enter between many individuals in continuous sensing and on bed
Row is distinguished.Signal processor 406 is configured as handling reflection received in radar area, so as to provide available for determination patient
Situation or the sensing data of health status set.
As an example, the other side of some patient profiles and status of patient, which is provided, can show that health status
Substance value.Consider deep sleep.In deep sleep, the heart and nervous system of patient are in unique position.When in depth
When being measured during degree sleep, HRV (for example, the rhythm of the heart or rhythm of the heart change) and respiratory rate carry for the health of heart of patient
The window of uniqueness has been supplied, it is particularly even more so when showing trend for multiple deep sleep stages.
Fig. 3 is returned, each in other examples equipment 106 is considered in more detail.Pressure and electric induction pad 106-3 by with
It is set to the pulse propagation time or pulse wave velocity of the blood of sensing patient 102.Pulse wave velocity can be used for determining patient's heart
Pressure versus volume ring characteristic.This pulse wave velocity is also the measurement of the vascular health state of patient.In cardiovascular system
In healthy artery, due to arterial elasticity, pulse wave velocity is relatively low, but as they are hardened and are narrowed, pulse wave velocity rise.
Although specific pulse wave velocity is temporal snapshot, its may or may not indicate exactly vascular health (for example,
Doctor's office carry out disposable test), but this pulse wave velocity change (i.e. trend) can be patient 102 painstaking effort
The accurate measurement of the change of pipe health status.Individual patient need not can be being calibrated (for example, eliminating to measurement individual
The need for aorta diameter is to understand its cardiac function) in the case of determination trend.If positive trend, then this can be strong
Change the health custom of patient 102, and if change is made in passive then encouragement.
Mat 106-3 can also measure heart by the electric pulse generated by the polarization and depolarising of heart tissue
Electrical conduction system, is then converted into waveform (individually or by another entity).Individually measure or change over time
Trend can indicate hypercalcinemia, hypocalcemia, potassemia, hypopotassaemia, coronary ischemia or myocardial infarction (the i.e. heart
Popular name for is broken out).It is also noted that the trend that the data sensed by equipment 106 are drawn with that possibly can not find originally
Situation compared to can quickly determine bad heart or other system statuses, so as to know decline in health so as to it as early as possible
Resisted and and avoided more away from invasive and dangerous treatment.For example, increase and the pleural fluid of the resting heart rate of individual
The increase of body, the change of heart-rate variability or other physiological characteristics can heart failure decompensation the last fortnight or it is longer when
Between alarm is sent to the i.e. exhaustion that will appear from.The alarm allows medical professional or patient oneself to avoid decompensation, all
Such as pass through new or replacement medicine.
Ultrasonic bathtub 106-4 is configurable to generate high frequency sound wave and assesses the echo from those ripples.The echo is one
Received at individual or multiple sensors, and the time interval between sending and receiving can be measured.These echoes make it possible to
Internal body structure is analyzed.In some cases, the acoustic impedance of the two-dimensional cross sectional of tissue can be measured, it can be surveyed
The current health or healthy trend of the measured tissue of amount.Mobile blood flow, tissue, blood position and knot can also be carried out
The three-dimensional measurement of structure.Non-active (not generating sound wave, only receive sensor) can also be used, but be relatively difficult to realize precision and
Robust measure.
Pressure sensitive toilet seat 106-5 is configured as sensing as described above for the pulse wave velocity described in mat 106-3, but
It is that can also study heart under different conditions, cardiovascular health is measured by bowel movement suddenly, some hearts are similarly to
Sick expert be used for measure cardiac response Valsalva operation (with surgeon Antonio Maria Valsalva name,
1666-1723)。
Colour sensing mirror 106-2 can be configured as such as sensing the face in patient skin using colour sensing camera
Color, regardless of whether the radar area with Fig. 4.The sensing data is enough to determine photoplethysmogram, and this is to determine patient health
One of key physiological signal.Plethysmogram according to be present in or by blood volume therein change come measure organ, limbs or its
The change of the size or color of its human body parts.These colors and color change in patient skin can show heart rate and effect
Rate.In addition, colored sensing mirror 106-2 can also be radiated (by radar or other with low and safe level to patient 102
Radiation zone), and the backscattering from the radiation is sensed, thus more robust or accurately determine the crust of patient 102, flesh
Meat or cardiovascular system health and efficiency.
These examples show certain methods, and wherein the technology can provide sensing data, pass through the sensing data
Patient profiles during normal life and health status to determine patient.As described above, general health monitoring is generally in doctor
Institute or doctor's office are carried out.However, hospital or office health monitoring can not during the normal life of patient with
Their movements through circadian rhythm and pressure from activity, mood and environmental condition and they are monitored.This can
Can be serious limitation, because in the snapshot that hospital or office capture possibly the health of patient can not be accurately reflected.This may
