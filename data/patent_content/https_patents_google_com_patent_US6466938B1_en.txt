Definitions
- the invention relates to locating a device using a database containing hybrid location data. More particularly, the invention relates to locating a device using a database which correlates location measurements having different accuracies.
- a device such as a cellular telephone or a personal digital assistant (PDA) may be able to determine its location by measuring certain signal parameters, such as signal strength and the angle of arrival of the signal from a source, assuming the location of the source is known. The device may then compute, based on the signal parameters and the angle of arrival, its location and report it to a computer system which can, for example, store it in a database or make other use of the information.
- signal parameters such as signal strength and the angle of arrival of the signal from a source, assuming the location of the source is known.
- the device may then compute, based on the signal parameters and the angle of arrival, its location and report it to a computer system which can, for example, store it in a database or make other use of the information.
- Some devices may be capable of performing such location measurements using two sources.
- a cellular telephone equipped with a local area wireless interface such as Bluetooth
- a local area wireless interface such as Bluetooth
- the relative accuracy of the measurements made with respect to the two sources may be such that one of the measurements is more accurate than the other.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a communication system.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a communication system with an obstruction.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a communication system with an obstruction and a reflecting object.
- FIGS. 4 and 5 are block diagrams of a system according to the present invention.
- FIG. 6 illustrates the structure of a database according to the present invention.
- FIG. 7 illustrates a source identifier record according to the present invention.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a measurement record according to the present invention.
- FIGS. 9 and 10 are flow charts.
- FIG. 11 shows the correlation between coarse measurements and fine measurements according to the present invention.
- FIG. 12 illustrates possible locations reported under the conditions shown in FIG. 11 .
- This disclosure builds and maintains a database which correlates coarse location measurements with fine location measurements.
- information from that device may be used to build the database.
- the database can be accessed to refine the coarse measurement using the fine measurement.
- a source 102 communicates with a receiver 104 , as shown in FIG. 1 .
- the communication between the source 102 and the receiver 104 is wireless. Any wireless method from which a relative location can be derived may be used for the purpose described in this application. Further, other location measurement techniques may be used including GPS, human entry, optical, measurement of the propagation time between the source and the receiver, measurement of the Doppler shift of the received signal, measurement of the time difference of arrival at a receiver of a signal transmitted from multiple sources at the same time, measurement of the time difference of arrival at a plurality of receivers of a signal transmitted by a source, or the cumulative time of propagation of a signal from a source to a receiver relayed by one or more intermediate devices.
- the source 102 or the receiver 104 is part of the infrastructure of the communication system and is fixed in position.
- the infrastructure device might be a cellular base station or a Bluetooth transceiver.
- the techniques described herein are not limited to such an arrangement, however, and can apply even when both the source and receiver are mobile. Further, different location determination methodologies may be associated with the source and the receiver.
- FIG. 1 illustrates the ideal case of a source 102 sending a signal to a receiver 104 without any obstructions. If the power level difference between what is sent and what is received and the angle of arrival is known, the relative location of each device to the other can be accurately determined. Consequently, if the source location is known, the receiver location can be derived.
- the introduction of some physical element, such as a wall 202 , between the source 102 and the receiver 104 will decrease the power level seen by the receiver 104 , as shown in FIG. 2 . If the signals measured in FIG. 2 are used in a location predicting algorithm and the algorithm assumes no obstructions as shown in FIG. 1 , the distance between the devices will be calculated to be larger than it actually is.
- the receiver 104 may receive a signal from both a direct route, such as the route through wall 202 , and an indirect route, such as the route reflecting from wall 302 . If only the indirect route is detectable, the source will be assumed to be along the angle of reception of the reflected signal at a distance dependent on the length of the reflected signal's path and the reflection loss. If both the indirect and direct routes are received, there are conventional techniques that use the additional information in the reflected path to refine the direct path calculation of the relative location of the source. Without knowing the attenuation factors or the true paths of the received signals, however, there are a range of source points that could produce the same results.
- One approach to improving the location finding capability in such circumstances is to attempt to communicate with two or more reference sources. Such an approach will improve the measurement accuracy in non-obstructed circumstances, but attenuation, refraction and reflection in one or more of the communication pairs will still introduce inaccuracies.
- Hybrid location determination technologies are being developed. Devices that use these multiple technologies will be able to determine their locations to a higher accuracy than single technology devices.
- a device capable of using a wide area system e.g., a cellular phone
- the same device may have the capability of communicating and performing location determination using signals on a local area network (e.g., Bluetooth).
- the typical resolution of Bluetooth may approximate 10 meters in a built out system.
- the typical resolution of a cellular signal may be 100 meters under unobstructed conditions and considerably larger under obstructed conditions.
- One approach is to use the Bluetooth location information and to ignore or throw away the cellular location information.
- the invention creates and maintains a database that stores both the coarse (e.g., cellular) and fine (e.g., Bluetooth) location information derived by the techniques just described, instead of simply throwing away the coarse information.
- the database links coarse and fine measurements made at the same or similar time or under similar circumstances.
- a receiver 402 receives a signal from a local source 404 , as shown in FIG. 4 .
- the receiver 402 receives a signal from a wide area source 406 .
- the signal from the wide area source 406 may include a direct element which is either unobstructed or obstructed by an object, such as obstruction 408 , and it may include an indirect element reflected off obstruction 410 .
- the receiver 402 will compute its location relative to the wide area source using the signal it receives from the wide area source. The computation of the relative location may be done within the receiver or by another device.
- the two computed locations are stored in a database 412 .
- the two location measurements may be stored together or they may be stored separately, with a link between the two measurements indicating that they were taken at the same time and that at least one element, in this case the receiver 402 , was common to both measurements.
- environmental measurements 414 such as temperature, humidity, date, time of day, and the like, are also stored in the database 412 along with the location information.
- the environmental measurements 414 may be stored once and then linked to the coarse and fine location measurements or they may be stored with each of the location measurements.
- a processor 416 coordinates the creation and maintenance of the database 412 . Over time, the database will acquire and maintain location reports by a number of devices in a number of locations.
- receiver 502 which is capable of receiving signals from the wide area source 406 but not from the local area source 404 , moves into the same position previously held by receiver 402 , as shown in FIG. 5, it will measure approximately the same location, assuming that the environmental measurements 414 are approximately the same. In this case, the receiver 502 is limited to the coarse location measurements possible using only the signal from the wide area source. The fine location measurement, using the signal from the local source 404 , is not available and cannot be computed.
- the database 412 is accessed, by the receiver 402 , the processor 416 , or another device, using, for example, the signal parameters of the signal from the wide area source 406 measured by the receiver 502 .
- the database 412 provides links to measurements made using the local source 404 when the signal parameters measured from the wide area source 406 were approximately the same.
- the processor 416 or the receiver 502 can use these fine location measurements to make a more accurate estimate of location than is possible using only the signals measured from the wide area source.
- the database 412 may include source identification records and measurement records, as shown in FIG. 6 .
- the measurement records may be grouped along with the source from which the measurement records were measured.
- the database may be a relational database, providing the capability of performing queries to find all measurement records made from a particular source, or other similar queries.
- the database may also take other forms.
- the source identifier record may include a source identifier field, which will identify the particular source being measured.
- the source identifier record may also include a source type field, which will identify the source as, for example, a cellular base station, a Bluetooth node, or some other signal source.
- the source identifier record may also include a source latitude field and a source longitude field, identifying the location of the source.
- the source identifier record may also include a source transmitter strength field, which will include the signal strength of the signal transmitted by the source.
- the source identifier record may also include other fields useful in the analysis of location or for some other purpose.
- the measurement record may include a receiver identifier field, which will identify the particular receiver for which the record is stored. If the measurement record is not grouped with the source identifier record in the database, the measurement record may include a link to the source identifier record, which will link the measurement record to the source from which the measurement was made.
- the measurement record may also include a receiver type field, which will identify the receiver as a cellular telephone, a PDA, or some other device. It may also include a received signal type field, identifying the received signal as, for example, a cellular signal, a Bluetooth signal, etc.
- the measurement record may also include a received signal strength field, which will include the signal strength of the signal received from the source by the receiver.
- the measurement record may also include a receiver orientation field, which records the orientation of the receiver relative to a known reference, such as true north.
- the measurement record may include a received signal angle-of-arrival field, which provides a relative angle of arrival of the signal from the source to the receiver. Using the receiver orientation field and the received signal angle-of-arrival field, the absolute angle of arrival, relative to a reference, can be determined.
- the measurement record may also include a date and time of measurement field, which will include the date and time that the measurement was made.
- the measurement record may also include an environmental condition during measurement field, which will include such information as the temperature, humidity, whether it was raining, etc., during the measurement.
- the measurement record may also include a receiver computed latitude field and a receiver computed longitude field, which include the receiver's latitude and longitude computed by the receiver or another device from the received signal characteristics and the angle of arrival information.
- the measurement record may also include a confidence factor field, which may include a metric associated with the accuracy of the receiver location computation, such as circular probable error (CPE).
- CPE circular probable error
- the measurement record may include links to measurement records taken at the same time.
- a measurement record for a measurement taken with a coarse technique such as using the cellular signal
- a measurement record derived using a finer technique such as using the Bluetooth signal.
- Each measurement record may include links to many other measurement records taken at the same time or under the same conditions.
- the links may be to measurement records taken on different days but at the same time and under similar environmental conditions.
- the database is built and maintained as shown in FIG. 9.
- a device measures received signals and, optionally, environmental parameters (block 902 ). The device then determines the source for each of the received signals (block 904 ) and estimates the receiver location and confidence factor for each of the received signals (block 906 ). The device then stores a measurement record for each received signal (block 908 ). A link is then created between each messenger record and the other messenger records stored at the same time (block 910 ).
- the measurement records may be stored in the database by the device, by a processor, such as processor 416 , or by any other device capable of administering the database 412 .
- the database is used as shown in FIG. 10.
- a device measures the received signal, in this case from the source capable of providing a coarse location measurement, and environmental parameters, if they are available (block 1002 ).
- the device searches the database for measurement records with similar signal parameters (block 1004 ).
- the device follows links in the found measurement records to other measurement records having lower circular probable errors (block 1006 ).
- the device determines whether any of the measurement records found by following links to measurement records with lower CPEs are outlyers.
- An outlyer may be, for example, a disc defined by a location and CPE that does not overlap the discs defined by the locations and CPEs of the other linked measurement records. Alternatively, it may be a location more than a predefined number of standard deviations from the mean of the locations of the other linked measurement records. Further, any technique found to be useful in identifying outlyers could be used.
- the outlyers may be thrown out (block 1010 ).
- the outlyers may be used to increase the area reported as a possible location for the device with a consequent increase in the confidence factor (block 1012 ). This could be done automatically or it could be done after receiving permission from a user.
- the lower CPE measurement records are then combined to form a location estimate and confidence factor, which is reported to the user (block 1014 ).
- a device measures the signal parameters of a signal from a coarse source and uses those signal parameters to find the records in the database having similar signal parameters.
- the CPE 1102 of those measurement records is illustrated in FIG. 11 .
- the device also follows links from those measurement records to measurement records with lower CPEs 1104 , 1106 , 1108 , 1110 , and 1112 .
- Measurement record 1112 may be considered an outlyer for a number of reasons. First, it is outside the CPE defined by measurement record 1102 . Second, it does not overlap any of the other lower CPE records 1104 , 1106 , 1108 and 1110 . Third, it is more than a predetermined number of standard deviations from the mean of the locations of the other lower CPE records.
- Lower CPE measurement record 1112 may be simply discarded in the location reporting process.
- the device When reporting location, the device combines all of the undiscarded lower CPE measurement records and reports the combination as the potential location of the device, as shown in FIG. 12 .
- shape 1202 is the union of the discs formed by the locations and CPEs of measurement records 1104 , 1106 , 1108 and 1110 , shown in FIG. 11 .
- Shape 1204 is associated only with measurement record 1112 . Therefore, if measurement record 1112 were discarded, only shape 1202 would be reported as the possible location of the device. In such a case, a confidence factor associated with shape 1202 would likely be reduced because of the presence of outlyer 1112 , represented by shape 1204 . If the user desires a report with a larger confidence factor, the device could report both shapes 1202 and 1204 in its location report along with a higher confidence factor.
- the device may use a technique such as least squares to define a smaller shape and an associated confidence factor.
- the environmental factors associated with each of the measurement records may be used to adjust the CPE associated with each of the measurement records as they are compared to each other. For example, if the CPE is found to vary with temperature, the CPE of one measurement record may be adjusted relative to the CPE of another measurement record during the computation if the two records were made when the temperature was different.
