Definitions
- the subject disclosure generally relates to communication between users of electronic devices, and, in particular, to group conversation between a plurality of participants.
- social circles are categories to which a user can assign their social networking contacts and better control the distribution and visibility of social networking messages.
- a social circle is provided as a data set defining a collection of contacts that are associated with one another.
- a social circle can be described from the perspective of an individual that is the center of a particular collection of socially interconnected people, or from the aggregate perspective of a collection of socially interconnected people.
- a social circle can have narrowly defined boundaries, all of the members of the social circle may be familiar with one another, and permission may be required for a member to join a social circle.
- a user of an electronic device may define a social circle, and the social circle, as a data set defining a collection of contacts, may reflect a real-life social circle of the user.
- a user of an electronic device may have different groups of friends, coworkers, and family, and there may be some overlap among those groups (e.g., a coworker who is also considered to be a friend, a family member who is also a coworker).
- groups e.g., a coworker who is also considered to be a friend, a family member who is also a coworker.
- the user can organize and categorize social networking contacts into various different groupings.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example client-server network environment which provides for group conversation.
- group conversation allows for ongoing electronic conversation with a select group of people.
- a user of an electronic device may wish to know which participants are currently accessing the group conversation. Differentiating the display of these participants from the remaining participants in the group conversation will be described in greater detail below, for example, with reference to FIGS. 14A and 14B .
- a user of an electronic device may wish to view profile information about another participant in the conversation. For example, the user may wish to see the name and contact information of the participant, or the most recent status message posted by the participant. In another example, the user may wish to view profile information while not even participating in a group conversation (e.g., when the user is viewing his/her list of contacts). Such display of profile information will be described in greater detail below, for example, with reference to FIGS. 15 to 18 .

U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/501, 163 U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/501,164 U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/501,165, filed June 24, 2011 U.S. Patent Application No. 13/525,163, filed June 15, 2012 U.S. Patent Application No. 13/525,190, filed June 15, 2012 U.S. Patent Application No. 13/525,202, filed June 15, 2012 - The subject disclosure generally relates to communication between users of electronic devices, and, in particular, to group conversation between a plurality of participants.
- When using electronic devices such as computers, cell phones or personal digital assistants (PDAs), it is possible to communicate with people on a 1 :1 basis (e.g., via text messaging, phone calls). It is also possible to broadcast messages to the public, for example, via a computer-implemented social networking service.
- However, it is difficult to participate in ongoing electronic conversation with a select group of people. For example, the user of an electronic device may want to contact his/her family, friends, or a small group of work colleagues. Furthermore, since multiple participants are involved, it can be difficult to organize display of such a conversation. Thus, a quicker and more convenient way to initiate communication with a select group of people, and to participate in an ongoing conversation with that group, may be desirable.

FIG. 23 conceptually illustrates an electronic system with which some implementations of the subject technology are implemented. - The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be clear and apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.
- As used herein, social circles are categories to which a user can assign their social networking contacts and better control the distribution and visibility of social networking messages. In accordance with the subject disclosure, a social circle is provided as a data set defining a collection of contacts that are associated with one another. As used herein, a social circle can be described from the perspective of an individual that is the center of a particular collection of socially interconnected people, or from the aggregate perspective of a collection of socially interconnected people. In some examples, a social circle can have narrowly defined boundaries, all of the members of the social circle may be familiar with one another, and permission may be required for a member to join a social circle. In accordance with the subject disclosure, a user of an electronic device may define a social circle, and the social circle, as a data set defining a collection of contacts, may reflect a real-life social circle of the user.
- For example, a user of an electronic device may have different groups of friends, coworkers, and family, and there may be some overlap among those groups (e.g., a coworker who is also considered to be a friend, a family member who is also a coworker). Through the creation and use of social circles, the user can organize and categorize social networking contacts into various different groupings.
-
FIG. 1 illustrates an example client-server network environment which provides for group conversation. As noted above, group conversation allows for ongoing electronic conversation with a select group of people. During such a conversation, a user of an electronic device may wish to know which participants are currently accessing the group conversation. Differentiating the display of these participants from the remaining participants in the group conversation will be described in greater detail below, for example, with reference toFIGS. 14A and 14B . - Furthermore, a user of an electronic device may wish to view profile information about another participant in the conversation. For example, the user may wish to see the name and contact information of the participant, or the most recent status message posted by the participant. In another example, the user may wish to view profile information while not even participating in a group conversation (e.g., when the user is viewing his/her list of contacts). Such display of profile information will be described in greater detail below, for example, with reference to
FIGS. 15 to 18 . - A
network enviromnent 100 includes a number of electronic devices 102-106 communicably connected to aserver 110 by anetwork 108.Server 110 includes aprocessing device 112 and adata store 114.Processing device 112 executes computer instructions stored indata store 114, for example, to assist in group conversation between electronic devices 102-106. - Users interacting with electronic devices 102-106 can participate in group conversation (e.g., using server 110), by posting messages such as text communications (e.g., comments, replies, announcements, status updates), digital photos, videos, or other appropriate electronic information. In some example embodiments, information can be posted on a user's behalf by systems and/or services external to
server 110. For example, the user may post a review of a movie to a movie review website, and with proper permissions that website may include the review in the group conversation on the user's behalf. In another example, a software application executing on a mobile device (e.g., electronic device 102), with proper permissions, may use global positioning system (GPS) capabilities to determine the user's location and automatically update the social network with the user's location (e.g., "At Home", "At Work", "In Los Angeles, CA"). - The posted messages can be formatted as text messages (e.g., SMS, MMS messages), email messages, instant messages, or other message formats for communication between electronic devices 102-106. For example, a communication message generated on
electronic device 102 can correspond to Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). The XMPP message can be received by a message service (not shown) and translated into an appropriate format for receipt by electronic devices 104-106. For example, the XMPP message can remain in XMPP, can be translated into an email, SMS, MMS or message via the message service, or can be translated into a proprietary message format via the message service. The translated message can then be forwarded to electronic devices 104-106. - Users interacting with electronic devices 102-106 can also define social circles to organize and categorize the user's relationships to other users within
network 108. Examples of the creation and use of social circles are provided in the description ofFIG. 3 , and throughout the remainder of the subject disclosure. - In some example embodiments, electronic devices 102-106 can be computing devices such as laptop or desktop computers, smartphones, PDAs, portable media players, tablet computers, or other appropriate computing devices that can be used to for group conversation within a social network. In the example of
FIG. 1 ,electronic device 102 is depicted as a smartphone,electronic device 104 is depicted as a desktop computer, andelectronic device 106 is depicted as a PDA. - In some example aspects,
server 110 can be a single computing device such as a computer server. In other embodiments,server 110 can represent more than one computing device working together to perform the actions of a server computer (e.g., cloud computing). Furthermore,network 108 can be a public communication network (e.g., the Internet, cellular data network, dialup modems over a telephone network) or a private communications network (e.g., private LAN, leased lines). -
FIG. 2 illustrates an example peer-to-peer network environment which provides for group conversation. Anetwork environment 200 includes a number of electronic devices 202-206 communicably connected to one another in a peer-to-peer manner over anetwork 208. - Users interacting with electronic devices 202-206 can participate in group conversation by posting messages, such as text communications (e.g., comments, replies, announcements, status updates), digital photos, videos, or other appropriate electronic information. In some example embodiments, information can be posted on a user's behalf by external systems and/or services. For example, the user may post a review of a movie to a movie review website, and with proper permissions that website may include the review in the group conversation on the user's behalf. In another example, a software application executing on a mobile device (e.g., electronic device 202), with proper permissions, may use global positioning system (GPS) capabilities to determine the user's location and automatically update the social network with the user's location (e.g., "At Home", "At Work", "In Los Angeles, CA").
- The posted messages can be formatted as text messages (e.g., SMS, MMS messages), email messages, instant messages, or other message formats for communication between electronic devices 202-206. For example, a communication message generated on
electronic device 202 can correspond to Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). The XMPP message can be received by a message service (not shown) and translated into an appropriate format for receipt by electronic devices 204-206. For example, the XMPP message can remain in XMPP, can be translated into an email, SMS, MMS or message via the message service, or can be translated into a proprietary message format via the message service. The translated message can then be forwarded to electronic devices 204-206. - In the example peer-to-peer communication illustrated in
FIG. 2 , the logic for coordinating group conversation between electronic devices 202-206 can be included in electronic devices 202-206 themselves, for example, by transmitting conversation identifiers between electronic devices 202-206. In addition, it is possible for electronic devices 202-206 to detect nearby conversations, and exchange messages and other information between participants of those conversations. - Users interacting with electronic devices 202-206 can also define social circles to organize and categorize the user's relationships to other users. Examples of the creation and use of social circles are provided in the description of
FIG. 3 , and throughout the remainder of the subject disclosure. - In some example embodiments, electronic devices 202-206 can be computing devices such as laptop or desktop computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), portable media players, tablet computers, or other appropriate computing devices that can be used for group conversation within a social network. In the example of
FIG. 2 ,electronic device 202 is depicted as a smartphone,electronic device 204 is depicted as a desktop computer, andelectronic device 206 is depicted as a PDA. - In some example aspects,
network 208 can be a public communication network (e.g., the Internet, cellular data network, dialup modems over a telephone network) or a private communications network (e.g., private LAN, leased lines). -
FIG. 3 illustrates an example of social circles for a user.User 302 can participate in different group conversations with different social circles. Such group conversation can occur within a client-server environment (e.g., the environment ofFIG. 1 ) or within a peer-to-peer environment (e.g., the environment ofFIG. 2 ). In the example ofFIG. 3 ,user 302 has a number ofcontacts 304a-304h with whichuser 302 can have some form of relationship (e.g., friends, coworkers, customers, teammates, clients, relatives, club members, classmates).User 302 can categorizecontacts 304a-304h by assigning them to one or more social circles, such associal circle 310,social circle 330, andsocial circle 330. - In some example aspects, social circles 310-330 are groupings created by and may be known only to user 302 (e.g.,
contacts user 302 and may be known touser 302 as well as the contacts (e.g.,contacts contacts - Social circles may be used to organize and categorize
contacts 304a-304h in ways that are relevant touser 302. For example,user 302 may definesocial circles - When initiating a group conversation,
user 302 can select a combination of individuals and social circles for participation in the group conversation, where the participants can share in viewing and posting messages within the group conversation. - Once a social circle is created,
user 302 can add (or invite) other people to join the social circle. In some example aspects,user 302 can specify individuals from his group of contacts for inclusion in the social circle. In other example aspects, while participating in a group conversation,user 302 can form a new circle with the participants of the group conversation, or can modify an existing social circle by adding the participants of the group conversation to that social circle. Furthermore, participants selected byuser 302 can automatically be included in a social circle, and these participants can be notified. Alternatively, in some examples, the selected participants can be invited to opt into the social circle, with only those who accept membership joining the group conversation. - In some example aspects, one or more default social circles can be provided or suggested to
user 302 on his/her electronic device. For example, "Friends," "Family," and "Coworkers" social circles can automatically be provided in a user's profile. Other social circles can automatically be provided including, for example, an "Acquaintances" social circle and/or a "Just Following" social circle. Although default social circles can be automatically provided, it may be left to the user to actually populate the default social circles with contacts. For example, each of the default social circles may initially be empty of contacts, where the user populates each of the default social circles. - In some example aspects, one or more default social circles can be automatically generated based on the user's profile information. For example, with proper permissions, the user's profile may include demographic data (e.g., age), job data and/or interests data (e.g., sports, hobbies). Through data mining techniques (e.g., clustering social circle creations over a threshold number of users) and user permission, it may be determined that users within a particular demographic typically create one or more particular types of social circles. By categorizing a user within a particular demographic, one or more particular default social circles can be suggested or automatically generated.
- For example, if a particular user falls within a demographic that corresponds to a college student, a default "College Friends" social circle may be suggested to or automatically created for the user. Social circles can also be suggested or created based on interest data provided in a user's profile. For example, if a particular user's interests include skiing, a default "Ski Buddies" social circle may be suggested to or automatically created for the user.
- In some example aspects, during a message write-time, a data set can be used for coordination of the group conversation. For example, the data set can be transmitted from the user's client device (e.g., electronic devices 102-106 of
FIG. 1 ) to a distribution hub which can be provided at a server (e.g.,server 110 ofFIG. 1 ). In another example, the data set can be transmitted between client devices (e.g., electronic devices 202-206 ofFIG. 2 ), where the data set is processed primarily at each of the client devices to coordinate group conversation. - The data set can include a plurality of data. For example, the data set can include content data (e.g., text, uniform resource indicator (URI)), timestamp data (e.g., a timestamp indicating the time that the message was generated), distribution data (e.g., contacts and/or one or more social circles), and identification (ID) data (e.g., an ID assigned to the data set upon generation of the message).
- In some example aspects, the distribution data is processed to provide an access control list (ACL) that specifies which contacts are participants in a group conversation. In the case of a client-server environment (e.g., the network environment of
FIG. 1 ), a distribution hub can determine end points the data set is to be distributed to based on the ACL. For example, the set of participants determined based on the ACL and the ID of the message is written to a per user/view index at the distribution hub. When fetching messages to distribute to a user, the user/view index is accessed and the IDs of the various messages that the user is allowed to view are determined. The data sets are retrieved from a data store (e.g.,data store 114 ofFIG. 1 ) and are transmitted to the client device (e.g., electronic device 102-106 ofFIG. 1 ) associated with the user. Alternatively, in the case of peer-to-peer communication (e.g., the network environment ofFIG. 2 ), the logic for transmitting and receiving data sets can be included in the client devices themselves, for example, by using conversation identifiers on each of the client devices. -
FIGS. 4A to 4C illustrate screen-shots of an example graphical user interface for participating in a group conversation. In some example aspects, the graphical user interface ofFIG. 4A illustrates the conversations, including 1-1 and group conversations, thatuser 302 is currently a participant of. These conversations are presented in amessage list 402. In this example,message list 402 indicates thatuser 302 is currently a participant in three conversations, one of which is a group conversation, and two of which are 1-1 conversations. - The graphical user interface of
FIG. 4A further illustrates anupdates section 404.Updates section 404 may provide updates foruser 302, including new friends who are signed up for social circles. In addition, the graphical user interface ofFIG. 4A may include anoptions section 406, for providinguser 302 with options such as returning to a main menu, refreshing the screen and reviewing notifications. The graphical user interface may also provideuser 302 with the option to select and access a particular conversation. In the example ofFIG. 4B ,user 302 selects the group conversation withinmessage list 402. - With reference to
FIG. 4B , the graphical user interface provides for presentation of a group conversation. As shown inFIG. 4B , the graphical user interface can include a collection ofcontact icons 412, which represents the participants of the group conversation. In some example aspects, thecontact icons 412 can be digital photos of the participants they represent, arbitrary images, or placeholders (e.g., when the contact has no image associated with their account). In some example aspects, the collection oficons 412 appear in a row at the top of the graphical user interface. A scroll bar (not shown) may also be provided foruser 302 to access additional contact icons that may not fit into the initial view. - The graphical user interface of
FIG. 4B further illustrates aconversation thread 414, which provides a history of messages posted for the group conversation. For example, for each message inconversation thread 414, the content and identification of participant can be shown. In some example aspects, a timestamp (not shown) indicating the time that the message was sent can also be displayed. - The graphical user interface may also include a
typing indicator 416 which indicates which one(s) of the participants are currently typing a message for inclusion in theconversation thread 414. In addition, the graphical user interface may include arefresh button 420 for refreshing collection ofcontact icons 412 and/orconversation thread 414. -
FIG. 4B further illustrates anmessage input box 418 foruser 302 to enter and post new messages toconversation thread 414. In the event thatuser 302 selects to enter a new message (e.g., via input box 418),user 302 can be presented with akeyboard 422 for entering the message as shown inFIG. 4C . - The graphical user interface of
FIG. 4B can also provide for anadd participant button 424 for adding (or inviting) participants to a group conversation, as described in further detail below with reference toFIGS. 6A to 6C .FIG. 4B can further include aconversation settings button 426 to allowuser 302 to change conversation settings, as described in further detail below with reference toFIG. 9B . The graphical user interface ofFIG. 4B can also include aparticipant list button 428 for displaying the participants in a particular group conversation. -
FIGS. 5A to 5D illustrate screen-shots of an example graphical user interface for selecting participants and initiating a new group conversation. As can be seen in these figures, the graphical user interface includes aparticipant dialog 502 for selecting participants of a group conversation, acontact list 504 for presenting the group of contacts foruser 302, amessage input box 506 for posting messages to the group conversation and akeyboard 508. -
Participant dialog 502 can include aparticipant input box 502a for entering text, and acontact list button 502b for presentingcontact list 504. For example, a participant can be selected by entering a name or phone number intoparticipant input box 502a. The participants can correspond to existing contacts ofuser 302. Alternatively, participants who are not contacts ofuser 302 can be included, for example, by entering a phone number directly intoparticipant input box 502a. - In some example aspects, upon
user 302 entering text withinparticipant input box 502a, contacts whose name (or number) matching the entered text can be presented withincontact list 504. In the example ofFIG. 5A , uponuser 302 inputting "A" intoparticipant input box 502a,contact list 504 can be filtered to show contact names beginning with "A." In some example aspects, an auto-complete component can be incorporated intoparticipant input box 502a itself, to enableuser 302 to type in part of the name (or number) of a social circle and/or individual contact to specify which social circles and/or individual contacts require delivery of a message. -
FIG. 5B illustrates an example of selecting a participant who is not an existing contact ofuser 302. In some example aspects,user 302 enters a phone number directly intoparticipant input box 502a. As can be seen inFIG. 5 ,contact list 504 can provide the user with the option to add the entered phone number to the group conversation. -
FIG. 5C illustrates thatuser 302 can selectcontact list button 502b to populatecontact list 504.User 302 can select participants for the group conversation directly fromcontact list 504. As seen in the example ofFIG. 5C , the graphical user interface can provide aparticipant search box 510 for searching withincontact list 504, abutton 512 for presenting individual contacts withincontact list 504, and abutton 514 for presenting social circles withincontact list 504. As noted above, the participants can automatically be added to a group conversation, or can be invited to opt into or participate in the group conversation. -
FIG. 5D illustrates a scenario in whichuser 302 has selected participants for the group conversation, and initiates the group conversation by posting a first message. In the example ofFIG. 5D ,participant dialog 502 displays the selected list of participants. It should be noted thatuser 302 can alter this list by entering (or removing) participants viaparticipant input box 502a. Onceuser 302 has finalized his/her selection of participants,user 302 can post a first message for the group conversation viamessage input box 506 andkeyboard 508. In some example aspects, this can initiate a group conversation andpresent user 302 with the graphical user interface corresponding to a group conversation (e.g., the graphical user interface ofFIG. 4B ). -
FIGS. 6A to 6C illustrate screen-shots of an example graphical user interface for adding one or more participants to a group conversation already in progress. RegardingFIG. 6A , the interface for a group conversation can include collection ofcontact icons 412,conversation thread 414, typingindicator 416,message input box 418,refresh button 420,conversation settings button 426 andparticipant list button 428, as described above with reference toFIG. 4B . - The graphical user interface for the group conversation can further include an
add participant button 424 to request the addition of participants to the group conversation. Upon making such a request,user 302 can be presented with a graphical user interface for selecting participants to be added to the group conversation. The participants can automatically be added to a group conversation, or can be invited to opt into the group conversation. - As can be seen in
FIGS. 6B and 6C , the graphical user interface can include a participant dialog 502 (including aparticipant inbox box 502a and acontact list button 502b), acontact list 504, amessage input box 506, akeyboard 508, aparticipant search box 510, andbuttons FIGS. 6B and 6C is similar to that ofFIGS. 5A to 5C and therefore will not be described in detail again. However, rather than selecting participants for a new group conversation, the graphical user interfaces ofFIGS. 6B and 6C allowuser 302 to select participants to add to an existing group conversation. The participants can automatically be added to a group conversation, or can be invited to opt into the group conversation. -
FIGS. 7A to 7C illustrate screen-shots of an example graphical user interface for selecting the participants of a group conversation for inclusion in a social circle. RegardingFIG. 7A , the interface for a group conversation can include collection ofcontact icons 412,conversation thread 414, typingindicator 416,message input box 418,refresh button 420,conversation settings button 426 and addparticipant button 424, as described above. - The graphical user interface for the group conversation can further include a

As shown in the example ofFIG. 7B , upon selection ofparticipant list button 428 byuser 302, aparticipant list 702 is displayed, including the icon and name of each participant in the group conversation. The graphical user interface ofFIG. 7B further includes an add tocircles button 704. This button allows foruser 302 to define a social circle, using the participants in the group conversation corresponding toparticipant list 702. In defining a social circle,user 302 can either create a new social circle with the participants or add the participants to an existing social circle. -
FIG. 7C illustrates a graphical user interface including a socialcircle selection dialog 706. With this dialog,user 302 can specify whether a new social circle should be created for the participants of a group conversation (e.g., "New Circle"), or whether the participants should be added to an existing social circle (e.g., "Friends," "Business" and "Family"). The graphical user interface ofFIG. 7C also includes anOK button 708 and a cancelbutton 710. - In this regard,
FIGS. 8A to 8B illustrate screen-shots of an example graphical user interface for assigning the participants selected inFIGS. 7A to 7C to a social circle. In the example ofFIG. 8A ,user 302 selects to create a new circle for the participants. The graphical user interface providesuser 302 with anew circle dialog 802 for inputting the name for the newly-created social circle. In the example ofFIG. 8B ,user 302 selects to add the participants to an existing social circle (e.g., to the "Friends" circle). - The participants can automatically be added to the social circle, or can be invited to opt into the social circle. A confirmation message (not shown) may be provided to
user 302, confirming the addition of all (or some of) the participants. -

The graphical user interface also provides for amessage notification option 906 for opting into or out of receiving message notifications, as described below. In addition, the graphical user interface provides for aleave conversation option 908, which allows for removal ofuser 302 from the group conversation. -
FIG. 10 illustrates screen-shots of an example graphical user interface for displaying the status of messages. As described above, it is possible to post messages, such as text (e.g., comments, replies, announcements, status updates), digital photos, videos, or other appropriate electronic information withinconversation thread 414. Moreover, it is possible to display status information for items posted inconversation thread 414. In some example aspects, such status information can include atimestamp 1002 indicating when a message was posted, anindication 1004 that posting of a message failed, and anindication 1006 of the type of message that was sent (e.g., SMS, MMS). -
FIG. 11 illustrates a screen-shot of an example graphical user interface for displaying activity messages within a group conversation. In addition to the messages submitted by participants (e.g., text, digital photos, videos), activity messages related to participants of a group conversation can appear incommunication thread 414, with proper permissions. In the example ofFIG. 11 , these activity messages include an indication that certain participants have been added to the group conversation, that certain participants have left the conversation, and that certain participants are currently typing in the group conversation. Of course, it should be noted that other activities related to the participants of the conversation can be tracked with proper permission, and that corresponding messages can be included inconversation thread 414. -
FIGS. 12A and 12B illustrate screen-shots of an example graphical user interface for receiving a request for participation in a group conversation. As described above,user 302 can invite others (e.g., individuals, members of a social circle) to participate in a 1-1 or in a group conversation.User 302 can also be invited by other users to participate within a 1-1 or group conversation, and this conversation may be new or existing. - As noted above,
user 302 can opt to automatically be joined into group conversation. In this case,user 302 can be presented with a notification that he/she is now a participant of a conversation. In other example aspects,user 302 can accept or decline participation in a conversation. Thus, whenuser 302 is selected by another user for inclusion in a group conversation,user 302 may be provided with a request to accept or decline participation. - In the example of
FIG. 12A , a graphical user interface providesuser 302 with the participant(s) 1200 in a conversation, and aconversation invite 1202 allowinguser 302 to accept (e.g., "continue") the conversation, or decline (e.g., "block") the conversation. The conversation can correspond to a 1-1 conversation in which case oneparticipant 1200 can be displayed, or can correspond to a group conversation in which casemultiple participants 1200 can be displayed. In the event thatuser 302 accepts, a communication window can be displayed, as shown inFIG. 12B . In the example ofFIG. 12B , the participant communicating withuser 302 is not an existing contact, anduser 302 is presented with an add tocircles button 1204 for adding that participant to a social circle. -
FIG. 13 illustrates a screen-shot of an example graphical user interface for notifying a user of a message within an existing conversation, when the user is not currently accessing the conversation. As described earlier with reference toFIG. 4A , it is possible foruser 302 to be involved in multiple conversations, including 1-1 and group conversations. In the event thatuser 302 is not currently accessing a conversation (e.g., when the user has electronic device 102-106 or electronic device 202-206 in his/her pocket), the user can be notified, with proper permissions, of messages from any of his/her conversations. - In this regard,
FIG. 13 illustrates amessage notification 1302 alertinguser 302 that a new message was posted within a group conversation of his "Friends" social circle.FIG. 13 further illustratesinterface elements 1304, which may correspond to an application home screen on the electronic device. Of course,message notification 1302 is not limited to presentation within a home screen, and can be displayed in other scenarios when the user is not currently accessing a particular conversation. In some example aspects,message notification 1302 can be accompanied by an optional audio or vibrate alert to notifyuser 302 of the new message. -
FIGS. 14A and 14B illustrate screen-shots of an example graphical user interface for differentiating between participants in a group conversation. As described above, collection ofcontact icons 412 can represent the participants of a group conversation, with each icon graphically representing a respective participant. The icons can be digital photos, arbitrary images, or placeholders. The collection oficons 412 can appear in a row at the top of the graphical user interface, and a scroll bar may be provided for access to additional contact icons that may not fit into the initial view. - During a group conversation, it is possible that some, but not all, of the participants are currently accessing the group conversation. "Currently accessing" a group conversation can refer to those participants who are currently viewing the conversation on their electronic device, allowing them to write to or read from the conversation thread. However, it may be desirable for the display of those participants to be differentiated on the graphical user interface.
- Regarding
FIG. 14A ,contacts icons 1402 correspond to those participants who are currently accessing the group conversation. In this regard,contact icons 1402 can be differentiated in display from the other contact icons in the graphical user interface. In the example ofFIG. 14A ,contact icons 1402 are presented with a thicker border. This thicker border is a visual indicator which differentiatescontact icons 1402 from the other icons. However, other visual indicators for differentiatingcontact icons 1402 can be employed, such as highlighting, enlarging, shrinking or emphasizing with a common color (e.g., shading with green). - In differentiating between participants, it may be necessary to determine which of the participants are currently accessing the group conversation. In some example aspects, in a client-server environment (e.g., the network environment of
FIG. 1 ),server 110 may coordinate this information, based on indications received from electronic devices 102-106. Each of electronic devices 102-106 may periodically transmit an indication toserver 110 of whether the group conversation is currently being accessed by that device.Server 110 may coordinate this information and relay it to other devices which are currently accessing the group conversation. - Alternatively, in a peer-to-peer environment (e.g., the network environment of
FIG. 2 ), the coordination of the above information may be handled by electronic devices 202-206. For example, the indication of whether the group conversation is being currently accessed by electronic devices can be transmitted between the electronic devices themselves. -
FIG. 14B illustrates that the contact icons corresponding to participants currently accessing the group conversation can be grouped separately from the remaining icons. In the example ofFIG. 14B ,contact icons 1404 represent participants who are currently accessing the group conversation.Contact icons 1404 are presented on the on the left side of collection ofcontact icons 412. - In some example aspects, collection of
contact icons 412 can be presented in order. For example, the contact icons can be ordered based on how recently participants accessed (or posted to) the group conversation. In addition, the contact icons can be ordered based on how frequently participants accessed (or posted to) the group conversation. -
FIG. 15 illustrates a screen-shot of an example graphical user interface for presenting profile information in the form of a hover card. As noted above,user 302 may wish to view profile information about a particular one of his contacts. For example, during group conversation,user 302 may wish to receive profile information about a particular participant.User 302 may wish to see the name and contact information of the participant, or the most recent status message posted by the participant. - In the example of
FIG. 15 ,user 302 may wish to see the profile information for a particular contact (e.g., "Adam Jones"). As such, the user may select this contact icon from the collection ofcontact icons 412. Profile information associated with the participant can be presented as a hovercard 1502, which is an overlay presented on top of the current graphical user interface display. In this regard, it should be noted that the display of profile information is not particular to the context of a group conversation. For example, hovercard 412 can be pervasive in any place that a contact icon is shown (e.g., in the user's list of contacts, within a conversation thread, within other applications on the operating system of the electronic device). In the example ofFIG. 15 , the hover card can provide the name, GPS-location and recent status update of participant "Adam Jones." - It is also possible for
user 302 to view the entire profile of a contact. As such,user 302 may be provided with different interfaces for either viewing the hover card or the full profile of a contact. For example,user 302 can initially be presented with a hover card view by clicking on a contact icon, and can be presented with a full profile for viewing by selecting the name portion within the hover card. Of course, other interfaces may be provided for presenting either a hover card or full profile view. -
FIG. 16 illustrates a screen-shot of an example graphical user interface for presenting profile information in the "about" section of a full profile view. As noted above,user 302 may select to view a full profile of a contact, rather than a hover card. In some example aspects, the full profile view can provide for more comprehensive information about the selected contact. - In the example of
FIG. 16 , the full profile can be divided between an "about" section, a "posts" section and a "photos" section. In some embodiments, the full profile view may default to show the "about" section. To switch between these sections,user 302 can be provided with an aboutbutton 1616, aposts button 1618 andphotos button 1620. As shown inFIG. 16 , the about section for a contact can include information such as aprofile header 1602,introductions 1604,contact 1606,location 1608,personal life 1610, work andeducation 1612 andlinks 1614. A scroll bar (not shown) may also be provided foruser 302 to access information that may not fit into the initial view. -
FIG. 17 illustrates a screen-shot of an example graphical user interface for presenting profile information in the "photos" section of a full profile view. In some embodiments, the photos section can displayprofile header 1602 and aphotos portion 1702.Photos portion 1702 may include, for example, photos of the contact, profile photos and photos that the contact has posted. -
FIG. 18 illustrates screen-shots of an example graphical user interface for a profile header. In this regard, it is possible for profile headers to be displayed in different manners. This may depend, for example, on whether the contact is a member of asocial circle 320, or on permissions set by the contact. In the example ofFIG. 18 ,profile header 1602a corresponds to a contact sharing social circles withuser 302,profile header 1602b corresponds to a contact which does not share social circles withuser 302, andprofile header 1602c corresponds to a contact for which social circle information is not provided (e.g., based on permissions set by the contact). -

Atstep 1904, user input is received via the graphical user interface. The user input specifies a selection of participants from the group of contacts for a group conversation. The group conversation provides for sharing communication messages among the participants. - At
step 1906, a conversation window is presented on the graphical user interface based on the received user input. The conversation window displays a collection of contact icons with each contact icon respectively corresponding to one of the selected participants of the group conversation. The conversation window also displays a conversation thread for the group conversation. -
FIG. 20 illustrates a process by which contacts are assigned to a social circle for a user of an electronic device. The social circle defines a preset collection of contacts associated with one another. Atstep 2002, first user input is received via a graphical user interface on the electronic device. The first user input requests identification of a plurality of participants of a group conversation which the user is participating in. The group conversation provides for sharing communication messages among the plurality of participants. Atstep 2004, for each of the plurality of participants, the graphical user interface displays a contact icon and identification information corresponding to the participant. - At
step 2006, second user input is received via the graphical user interface. The second user input requests that the plurality of participants be assigned to a social circle. Atstep 2008, the plurality of contacts are assigned to the social circle. -
