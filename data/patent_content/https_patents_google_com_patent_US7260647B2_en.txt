Definitions
- the present invention relates to a data transmission system wherein several routers can be used for transferring data from a plurality of servers to a network and relates in particular to a method of load balancing the traffic between routers in such a data transmission system.
- Load balancing involves providing several pieces of equipment which share a given workload that cannot be handled by a single piece of equipment. Depending upon the type of equipment, several techniques are now used. In the case of web servers, load balancing can be achieved by using a network dispatcher, the function of which is to distribute the task among several web servers transparently to the web customer.
- the problem of load balancing is also raised with routers connecting servers to a network.
- a router When installed, a router is adapted to receive, on one interface, the traffic from different servers.
- the router Because of throughput and/or because of the resources required in the router to process the received data such as CPU, memory, and so forth, it is necessary to introduce a second router that will be able to offload the first one.
- a traditional way to split the traffic among several routers is to use the Virtual Route Routing Protocol (VRRP) to send the traffic to different routers.
- VRRP Virtual Route Routing Protocol
- This protocol was created to overcome problems due to the failure of a router in a network using static routing. It allows the servers to see the redundant routers as a single virtual router. At any instant, only one router really owns the virtual router function based on the availability of the router interfaces or on static priorities associated with them by configuration. The interface having the highest priority is the one elected to own the virtual router interface. The associated router acts as a virtual router until it fails or until another interface with a higher priority appears.
- VRRP dynamic host configuration protocols
- This typically provides configuration for an end host IP address and a default gateway. However, this creates a single point of failure. Loss of the default router results in a catastrophic event isolating all end hosts that are unable to detect any alternate path that may be available.
- VRRP is designed to eliminate the single point of failure. It specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers. The election process provides dynamic backup in the forwarding responsibility if the primary router (the router having the highest priority) becomes unavailable.
- the backup routers are inactive and their spare processing power is not used.
- nothing in the VRRP protocol prevents a router from participating in several elections of virtual routers in several VRRP groups.
- VRRP has been used to split the traffic on several routers. The idea is to have the routers participating in different VRRP groups with different priorities. Assuming there are two routers A and B, VRRP will be configured for a first VRRP group in such a way that router A will be the primary and router B will be the secondary. All traffic sent to the virtual router of this group will therefore flow through router A. At the same time, it is possible to configure the routers for another group where router B is the primary whereas router A is the secondary. All traffic sent to the virtual router of this second group will therefore flow through router B.
- a drawback of this method is that it is purely static. When configuring the network, it is necessary to make a one-time choice of which flows will use which router. Consequently, the method cannot respond dynamically to changes in traffic, and, in other words, changing the balance of traffic among the routers requires explicit network reconfiguration.
- an object of the invention is to provide a method used in a data transmission system including several routers between the servers and the network, wherein the routers automatically adapt their behavior to the traffic load so that they will share the load without intervention of an external component.
- the invention relates therefore to a method of load balancing traffic between routers in a data transmission system including a network, a set of routers, and a plurality of servers grouped in several groups of servers.
- Each group of servers transfers its flow of data to the network through one of the routers, the address of which has been assigned to this group of servers by a routing protocol.
- the method is automatically achieved in each router by periodically examining the load (L) of the router and assigning thereto a new priority for at least a group of servers lower than the priorities associated with all routers if the load becomes higher than a predetermined high threshold (Tu), so that the flow of data from the group of servers is automatically transferred to another router.
- L load
- Tu predetermined high threshold
- FIG. 1 is a block-diagram representing a data transmission system wherein a single router amongst three routers is used to transfer data from several groups of servers to a network.
- FIG. 2 is a block-diagram representing the system illustrated in FIG. 1 when the current load of the first router is higher than a predetermined high threshold and a part of this load has been transferred to a second router.
- FIG. 3 is a block-diagram representing the system illustrated in FIG. 2 when the current load of the first router is again higher than the predetermined high threshold and another part of this load has been transferred to the second router.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart of the method according to the invention.
- the method according to the invention can be implemented in environments such as the exemplary environments illustrated in FIG. 1 , FIG. 2 , and FIG. 3 , wherein a plurality of servers may access a network 10 by the intermediary of several routers 12 , 14 , and 16 which are configured to use the Virtual Route Routing Protocol (VRRP) on their interfaces.
- the servers are grouped in several groups of servers. For example, a first group of servers 18 includes two servers, a second group of servers 20 includes three servers, and a third group of servers 22 includes two servers.
- FIG. 1 assumes that all the traffic goes through a unique router, that is router 12 , because this router has been elected by the VRRP protocol as being the primary virtual router. In other words, all groups of servers 18 , 20 , and 22 have been assigned the address of router 12 by the VRRP protocol to access network 10 .
- each router continually examines its own load. Assuming that the workload of router 12 becomes higher than a predetermined high threshold, a lower priority is assigned to one of the group of servers, for instance group 18 , thus transferring the flow of data to router 14 , the priority of which is higher than the priority of router 12 for the group 18 , as illustrated in FIG. 2 . If the load of router 12 again becomes higher than the predetermined high threshold, the priority of router 12 is replaced by a lower priority for the second group of servers 20 , so that the second group of servers 20 transfers its flow of data to router 14 , as illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- a higher priority is reassigned to the router when its load becomes less than a predetermined low threshold, thereby causing the flow of each group of servers to transfer back to this router. If the flow of a group of servers, for instance group 18 , has been transferred to router 14 as illustrated in FIG. 2 , it is not possible to transfer this flow back to router 12 when the load of router 14 becomes higher than the predetermined high threshold. Rather, the flow for the group of servers may be transferred only to router 16 .
- This method of automatically reassigning, for each group of servers, a lower priority to the router when its load becomes higher than a predetermined high threshold and, reciprocally, reassigning a higher priority to the router when its load becomes less than a predetermined low threshold, is achieved by running the same program in each router.
- FIG. 4 the method according to the invention achieved in router 12 is represented in FIG. 4 , bearing in mind that this method is also executed in each router.
- router 12 It is also assumed that at the time when priority of router 12 is A, the priorities of the other routers 14 and 16 are lower. In other words, all the data from the three groups of servers is transferred through router 12 .
- a variable STATE is set to S 0 , whereas two other states S 1 and S 2 can be established as described hereafter.
- the following step is to find the current load L of the router (step 32 ).
- a check is then made to determine whether the variable STATE is S 0 (step 34 ). If so, a check is made to determine whether the load L is higher than a predetermined high threshold Tu (step 36 ). If the load is higher than the predetermined high threshold, the priorities seen from the groups of servers are changed: PG 1 is set to E and PG 2 is set to A (step 38 ). At the same time, the variable STATE is set to S 1 . If the load L is not higher than the threshold Tu, the process loops back to the step of finding the current load L (step 32 ).
- PG 1 and PG 2 are set to E, and the STATE is set to S 2 (step 44 ).
- a further check is made to determine whether the load of router 12 is less than the predetermined low threshold Td (step 50 ). If the load is less than the predetermined low threshold, this means that a part of the load which was transferred to router 14 may be transferred back to router 12 . Therefore, PG 1 is set to E, PG 2 is set to A, and STATE is set to S 1 (step 52 ). If the load is not less than the predetermined low threshold, there is no change and STATE remains S 2 .
