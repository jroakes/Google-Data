Particular embodiments may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. The recipient of a user-initiated call interacting with the click-to-call control may be presented with additional information obtained from the user interacting with resources other than the click-to-call control (e.g., in addition to the information provided by the click-to-call control). The additional information may be used to automatically populate data fields associated with the call, which may reduce data entry errors and complete various tasks associated with the call in a shorter time. The additional information may include online activity (or information derived from online activity) performed at the client device (or by a user of the client device) prior to the user interacting with the click-to-call control. The online activity may be embedded in a data field of call data created by the user's interaction with the click-to-call control to generate a combined data set that includes both the information needed to connect the client device to the called number and additional information. Embedding additional data into the combined data set enables a device receiving the call to obtain and/or present the additional data before answering the call, thereby providing additional information about the nature or purpose of the call before it is answered. The additional information may be presented by providing the additional information (e.g., user online activity or activity with an application installed on the calling device) in a manner that formats the additional information into call data and provides the information to the called device, otherwise the additional information is not available on the called device. Embodiments may address issues associated with how to provide information about a calling party to a call recipient associated with the online activity of the calling party.
The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

Detailed Description
Systems, methods, and computer program products are described for providing additional information (also referred to as context information) in addition to information for connecting a telecommunications call to a called party. For example, a call routing server may receive a request to establish a call between a client device and a remote telecommunication device (e.g., a telecommunication device located at a different location than the client device). The request may include an indication (e.g., data flag or other data) of: when the click-to-call control is visually rendered at the client device, it is interacted with, for example, by a user. Click-to-call controls may be presented with particular numeric components, such as controls provided for presentation with a search results page presented in response to a search query submitted by a user from a client device, for example.
Based on the telephone number included in (or received with) the request, the call context server may determine that a given transmission criteria that triggers distribution of a particular digital component to the client device is triggered. For example, a given transmission criterion may be a search query (or a phrase matching the search query, such as a distribution keyword) that, when the user interacts with the click-to-call control, triggers the presentation of a particular numeric component that is visually presented with the click-to-call control at the client.
Using a given transmission standard, the call context server may identify a set of context information mapped to the given transmission standard and send the set of context information to a remote telecommunication device being called or a computing device associated with the remote telecommunication device, for example, while a call is being connected or ongoing. In some implementations, the call context server sends the set of context information to the remote telecommunication device while the call routing server connects the client device to the remote telecommunication device (e.g., in parallel or asynchronous). In some embodiments, the call context server sends the set of context information to the remote telecommunication device through the call routing server. For example, the call context server may provide the set of context information to the call routing server, which in turn may include the set of context information in call setup data sent to the remote telecommunication device to establish the call during call setup, or in other data in call data sent to the remote telecommunication device after call setup is complete. When the remote telecommunication device receives a set of context information, it may present some or all of the set of context information in the display, either during call setup or during the call.
For example, mapping of context information to transmission criteria may occur over time using historical information identifying user interactions and corresponding results. For example, the history information may identify keywords used by the user (e.g., keywords in a search query), corresponding resources selected and presented to the user based on the keywords, and conversions made by the user. The conversion may include: such as user selection of a click-to-call control, user purchase, user navigation to or selection of other content, or other user actions due to the presentation and reaction of content. The mapping, for example, may indicate (or be used to infer) a user's interest in a topic, such as by identifying keywords that trigger presentation of content to the user that is relevant to a particular topic.
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which content is distributed to client devices. The example environment 100 includes a network 102, such as a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), the internet, or a combination thereof. The network 102 connects an electronic document server 104, a client device 106, a third-party content server 108, and a third-party content distribution system 110 (also referred to as a content distribution system). The example environment 100 may include many different electronic document servers 104, client devices 106, and third-party content servers 108. In some implementations, the content can be provided to a remote telecommunication device 128, such as a support system and entity that provides products and/or services. For example, the remote telecommunication device 128 may include a communication device located at an entity that may provide products and/or services to a user using the client device 106. Further, the environment 100 may enable communication between users and entities, as described in more detail below. In some implementations, the third-party content distribution system 110 can include a call routing server 214 (e.g., for routing click-to-call calls) and a call context server 220 (e.g., for providing context information for routed calls), as described below with reference to fig. 2.
The client device 106 is an electronic device capable of requesting and receiving resources (e.g., electronic documents) over the network 102. Example client devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102. Client devices 106 typically include user applications, such as web browsers, to facilitate sending and receiving data over network 102, but native applications (native applications) run by client devices 106 may also facilitate sending and receiving data over network 102.
An electronic document is data that presents a collection of content at a client device 106. Examples of electronic documents include web pages, word processing documents, Portable Document Format (PDF) documents, images, videos, search result pages, and feed sources (feed sources). Native applications (e.g., "apps"), such as applications installed on mobile devices, tablets, or desktop computing devices, are also examples of electronic documents. The electronic document may be provided to the client device 106 through the electronic document server 104. For example, the electronic document server 104 may include a server hosting a publisher's website. In this example, the client device 106 may initiate a request for a given publisher web page, and the electronic document server 104 hosting the given publisher web page may respond to the request by sending machine-executable instructions that initiate presentation of the given web page at the client device 106.
In another example, the electronic document server 104 may include an app server from which the client device 106 may download apps. In this example, the client device 106 may download files needed to install the app at the client device 106, and then run the downloaded app locally.
The electronic document may include various contents. For example, the electronic document may include static content (e.g., text or other specified content) that is within the electronic document itself and/or that does not change over time. The electronic document may also include dynamic content that may change over time or on a per-request basis. For example, a publisher of a given electronic document may maintain a data source for populating portions of the electronic document. In this example, the given electronic document may include a tag or script that causes the client device 106 to request content from a data source when the given electronic document is processed (e.g., rendered or run) by the client device 106. The client device 106 integrates the content obtained from the data source into the presentation of the given electronic document to create a composite electronic document that includes the content obtained from the data source.
In some cases, a given electronic document may include a third-party tag or a third-party script (e.g., a portion of code) that references the third-party content distribution system 110. In these cases, the client device 106 runs a third party tag or third party script when the client device 106 processes a given electronic document. The execution of the third party tag or third party script configures the client device 106 to generate a content request 112 for third party content that is sent to the third party content distribution system 110 over the network 102. For example, a third party tag or third party script may enable the client device 106 to generate a packetized data request including a header and payload data. Content request 112 may include the following data: such as the name (or network location) of the server from which the third-party content is requested, the name (or network location) of the requesting device (e.g., client device 106), and/or information that the third-party content distribution system 110 can use to select the third-party content to provide in response to the request. The content request 112 is sent by the client device 106 to a server of the third-party content distribution system 110 over the network 102 (e.g., a telecommunications network).
The content request 112 may include data specifying characteristics of the electronic document and the location where third party content may be presented. For example, data specifying a reference (e.g., a URL) to an electronic document (e.g., a web page) in which third-party content is to be presented, data specifying available locations (e.g., third-party content slots) of the electronic document within the presentation of the electronic document that are available for presenting third-party content, sizes of the available locations, locations of the available locations, and/or media types that are eligible for presentation in the locations may be provided to the third-party content distribution system 110. Similarly, data specifying keywords associated with the electronic document ("document keywords") or entities (e.g., people, places, or things) referenced by the electronic document may also be included (e.g., as payload data) in the content request 112 and provided to the third-party content distribution system 110 to facilitate identifying third-party content items that are eligible for presentation with the electronic document.
The content request 112 may also include data related to other information, such as information that the user has provided, geographic information indicating the state or region in which the request was submitted, or other information that provides context for the environment in which the third party content is to be displayed (e.g., the type of device, such as a mobile device or tablet device, at which the third party content is to be displayed). Data specifying characteristics of the client device 106 may also be provided in the content request 112, such as information identifying a model of the client device 106, a configuration of the client device 106, or a size (e.g., a physical size or resolution) of an electronic display (e.g., a touchscreen or desktop monitor) on which the electronic document is presented. Content request 112 may be transmitted, for example, over a packetized network, and content request 112 itself may be formatted as packetized data with a header and payload data. The header may specify the destination of the packet and the payload data may include any of the information discussed above.
The third-party content distribution system 110 selects third-party content (e.g., information about apps) to be presented with a given electronic document in response to receiving the content request 112 and/or using information included in the content request 112. In some implementations, the third-party content is selected in less than one second to avoid errors that may be caused by delayed selection of the third-party content. For example, delays in providing third-party content in response to the content request 112 may result in page loading errors at the client device 106, or cause portions of the electronic document to remain unfilled even after the portions of the electronic document are rendered at the client device 106. Further, as the latency of providing third party content to the client device 106 increases, it is more likely that the electronic document will no longer be presented at the client device 106 when the third party content is provided, thereby negatively impacting the user's experience with the electronic document. Further, delays in providing third-party content may result in delivery of the third-party content failing, for example, if the electronic document is no longer presented at the client device 106 when the third-party content is provided.
In some implementations, the third-party content distribution system 110 is implemented in a distributed computing system that includes, for example, a server and a collection of multiple computing devices 114, the computing devices 114 being interconnected and identifying and distributing third-party content in response to content requests 112. The set of multiple computing devices 114 operate together to identify a set of third party content that is eligible for presentation in an electronic document in a corpus of millions of available third party content (3PC 1-x). For example, millions of available third party content may be indexed in the third party corpus database 116. Each third-party content index entry may reference corresponding third-party content and/or include distribution parameters (DP1-DPx) (e.g., selection criteria) that regulate distribution of the corresponding third-party content.
In some implementations, the distribution parameters (e.g., selection criteria) for particular third-party content can include distribution keywords that must be matched (e.g., matched with the electronic document or term specified in the content request 112) in order for the third-party content to qualify for presentation. The distribution parameters may also require that the content request 112 include information specifying a particular geographic region (e.g., country or state) and/or information specifying a particular type of client device (e.g., mobile device or tablet) that initiated the content request 112 in order for the third party content to qualify for presentation. The distribution parameters may also specify a selection value (e.g., a bid) and/or a budget for distributing particular third-party content.
The identification of eligible third party content may be segmented into a plurality of tasks 117a-117c, which are then distributed among the computing devices within the set of multiple computing devices 114. For example, different computing devices in the set of multiple computing devices 114 may each analyze different portions of the third party corpus database 116 to identify various third party content having distribution parameters that match the information included in the content request 112. In some implementations, each given computing device in the set of multiple computing devices 114 may analyze a different data dimension (or set of dimensions) and communicate the results 118a-118c of the analysis back to the third-party content distribution system 110. For example, the results 118a-118c provided by each computing device in the set may identify a subset of third-party content that is eligible for distribution in response to the request and/or a subset of third-party content that has certain distribution parameters or attributes.
In some implementations, a context database 124 maintained, for example, by the third-party content distribution system 110, can store contextual information including the content request 112 (e.g., a search query) and corresponding reply data 120 (e.g., search results) (and identifying relationships between the content request 112 and the reply data 120). The context information may also include third party requests 121 and the resulting third party data 122. In some implementations, the context database 124 can maintain historical context information, for example, based on past user interactions and/or context information for the current session (such as the current content request 112, the current reply data 120, the current third party request 121, and/or the current third party data 122).
The third-party content distribution system 110 aggregates the results 118a-118c received from the set of multiple computing devices 114 and uses information associated with the aggregated results to select one or more instances of third-party content to be provided in response to the content request 112. For example, the third-party content distribution system 110 may select a set of winning third-party content based on the results of one or more content evaluation processes. In turn, the third-party content distribution system 110 may generate and send back complex data 120 (e.g., digital data representing replies) over the network 102 that enables the client device 106 to integrate the set of winning third-party content into a given electronic document such that the set of winning third-party content is presented on the display of the client device 106 along with the content of the electronic document.
In some implementations, the client device 106 executes instructions included in the reply data 120 that configure and enable the client device 106 to obtain a winning set of third-party content from one or more third-party content servers. For example, the instructions in the reply data 120 may include a network location (e.g., a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) and a script that causes the client device 106 to send a third-party request 121 to the third-party content server 108 to obtain a given winning third-party content from the third-party content server 108. In response to the request, the third-party content server 108 will send the third-party data 122 to the client device 106 such that the given winning third-party content is incorporated into the electronic document and rendered at the client device 106.
In some implementations, the click-to-call request 126 presented at the client device 106 can be used to access content. For example, the reply data 120 or third party data 122 may be formatted upon request, e.g., in response to the content request 112 or third party request 121, respectively, to include a click-to-call request 126. As a result, the click-to-call request 126 may include a script that dials a particular phone number in response to the user's interaction with the click-to-call control and also initiates a request for additional data to be appended to the call. For example, the particular phone number may be the phone number that connects the user of the client device 106 to the called party identified in the reply data 120 or the third party data 122. Meanwhile, the additional data requested in response to the user's interaction with the click-to-call control may include contextual information obtained from the context database 124. For example, the context information may be presented to the called party at the remote telecommunication device 128 so that the called party may obtain some context about the nature of the call before answering the call. Further details regarding the use of click-to-call request 126 and the resulting operation are described below with reference to fig. 2 and 3.
Fig. 2 illustrates an example system 200 for providing contextual information associated with a call being connected. For example, a user 206 using a client device 106a may select a click-to-call control 210, such as a search results page, a web page, a landing page, or some other resource, presented with a numeric component 212. The click-to-call control 210 may be presented with a content item being presented to the user in a digital component 212, such as a content item published by an entity called in response to user interaction with the click-to-call control 210. In some implementations, stages 1-5 may be used to process click-to-call requests 216 that are initiated when a user interacts with the click-to-call control 210.
In some implementations, the digital components are discrete content units that are inserted into an electronic document that includes other information. For example, the digital component may be one or more files that present text, images, and/or other content within a web page or other resource, and may be formatted as an advertisement (or convey advertising information) in some embodiments. In these implementations, the digital component may be provided from a different source (e.g., a digital component server) than the electronic document (e.g., a web page or native application) in which the digital component is presented. In this way, the digital component may be integrated into the electronic document when the electronic document is rendered at the client device.
At stage 1, as a result of selecting the click-to-call control 210, a click-to-call request 216 may be received at the call routing server 214 for establishing the call 202 between the client device 106a and the remote telecommunication device 128. For example, the click-to-call request 216 may indicate that the user 206 interacted with the click-to-call control 210 on the digital component 212 (e.g., a digital component maintained by an entity called in response to the user interacting with the click-to-call control or with a portion of content presented with the digital component).
In stage 2, using the information in the click-to-call request 216, the call context server 220 may determine that given transmission criteria 222a trigger the distribution of the digital component 212, the digital component 212 is visually rendered with the interacted click-to-call control at the client device 106 a. For example, assume that the numeric component 212 is presented in a search results page at the client device 106 a. In this example, a given transmission criteria 222a may include a search query that is used to trigger presentation of a search results page and/or numerical component 212.
In phase 3, the call context server 220 may identify a set 226 of context information using a given transmission criteria 222 a. For example, the call context server 220 may identify (e.g., lookup) the context information using a data store 228 that identifies a relationship between transmission criteria 230 and context information 232. As a result, the set 226 of identified contextual information may provide information about what user 206 may be calling about in order to provide the information to called party 208 so that, for example, called party 208 may better assist the calling party.
In stage 4, the call routing server 214 may connect the call 202 between the client device 106a (e.g., the mobile device of the user 206) and the remote telecommunication device 128 (e.g., a computer at the location 204 of the called party). For example, the telephone number 224 identified in the click-to-call request 216 may be used to make the connection.
In phase 5, the call context server 220 may send a set of context information (e.g., "user X is calling for reason Y") to the remote telecommunication device 128. The communication of the context information may be communicated to the called party in various ways before the called party communicates with the calling party. For example, the context information may be provided in the form of "whisper" accompanying the incoming call, such as in the form of a message audibly presented to called party 208 prior to communication between the calling party and called party 208. In some embodiments, the contextual information is presented in a visual form, such as in the form of a caller identification field 234 in a display 236 displayed on the remote telecommunication device 128. Alternatively or additionally, the context information may be sent to a computing device (or mobile device) of the called party. For example, the context information may be sent as a text message, multimedia message, email, instant message, or in other forms, and presented by a device other than the remote telecommunication device 128 that receives the telephone call. In this way, context information may be provided even when the called party's phone does not support the presentation of context information.
Fig. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for providing contextual information associated with a call being connected. In some implementations, the third-party content distribution system 110 and the components included therein may perform the steps of the process 300 using one or more servers and memory devices storing instructions executed by one or more processors. For example, call routing server 214 may route a call generated by selecting a click-to-call control, and call context server 220 may provide context information for the call. Fig. 1 and 2 are used to provide example structures for performing the steps of process 300. For example, stages 1-5 described with reference to FIG. 2 respectively trace back to step 302-310.
For example, process 300 may begin when a call routing server receives a request to establish a call between a client device and a remote telecommunication device (302). The request includes an indication to interact with a click-to-call control when visually rendered at the client device, the click-to-call control rendered with a particular digital component. For example, the call routing server 214 may receive (e.g., at stage 1 in fig. 2) a click-to-call request 216 to establish the call 202 between the client device 106a and the remote telecommunication device 128. Click-to-call request 216 may (e.g., using indication 218) instruct user 206 to select click-to-call control 210 on digital component 212 (e.g., an advertisement or web page provided by an entity that was called in response to user interaction with the click-to-call control).
In some implementations, the click-to-call request 216 may include information regarding the user-initiated request, such as information obtained from a cookie associated with the user 206 and stored on the client device 106 a. In some implementations, the cookie information in the cookie may include information about the user 206 and information about past interactions of the user 206. For example, cookie information may include information identifying previous online search activity, browsing history, transaction history, or other online activity.
A given transmission standard that triggers the distribution of a particular digital component to a client device is determined (304). The given transmission standard may be a transmission standard that causes a particular digital component to be visually rendered with the click-to-call control when the user interacts with the click-to-call control. A given transmission standard that triggers the distribution of a particular digital component may be determined based on the telephone number included in the request. For example, using the information in the click-to-call request 216, the call context server 220 may determine (e.g., at stage 2 in fig. 2) that the given transmission criteria 222a is a search query entered by the user 206 on the client device 106 a. Identifying a search query as a given transmission criteria 222a may include, for example, identifying search query terms included in the search query that cause presentation of a digital component 212 (e.g., a digital component of an entity of the called party). For example, the search query terms may include search query terms that identify an entity of called party 208. For example, the search query term may identify the entity by name, or the search query term may identify a product or service offered by the entity. For example, telephone number 224 included in click-to-call request 216 may be a telephone number known to be bound to called party 208. The telephone number 224 may also be used with search query terms to identify transmission criteria. For example, the call context server 220 may determine by looking up the transmission criteria associated with the telephone number 224 (e.g., 555-. For example, the call context server 220 may also identify the telephone number 224 as belonging to the called party's location 204 and use this information, along with other information in the click-to-call request 216, to identify a given transmission criterion 222 a. Other manners of identifying a given transmission criterion may be used, such as by using information from the context database 124 indicating past user interactions with the content or user interactions with the content in the current session. For example, the contextual information may include terms from a search query submitted by the user or terms from a search results page (of a subsequent page) generated by the search query.
In some implementations, interactions by the user in the current session or at a previous time can be identified from information in the cookie, such as identifying a name of an entity bound to a particular digital component, and optionally including information identifying past interactions by the user with the particular digital component. Information in the cookie, such as an identifier of the user 206 or other information, may be included in the click-to-call request 216 and used to map the click-to-call request 216 to the user 206.
In some implementations, determining a given transmission standard that triggers distribution of a particular digital component to a client device includes: the particular digital component is determined based on the telephone number included in the request and the given transmission standard is determined based on the time of interaction or an identifier of the particular digital component. For example, by comparing the presentation time of the digital component to the selection time of the click-to-call control 210, the call context server 220 may determine that a given transmission standard causes the digital component 212 to be presented. For example, a comparison may be made between the time a search query is entered and the time a click-to-call request 216 is made from a numeric component provided to the user 206 in response to or as a result of the search query. If the time difference is below a threshold (e.g., five minutes), the search query may be determined to be given transmission criteria 222 a. In another example, call context server 220 may determine a given transmission standard 222a based on an identifier of numeric component 212. For example, if digital component 212 is a web page owned or published by called party 208, identifying a given transmission criteria 222a may include parsing a URL or other indicator of the digital component or parsing the digital component itself. For example, the resolution may extract a term identifying the name of called party 208, or an entity owned or operated by called party 208 that provides a product and/or service of called party 208. In some implementations, the time of interaction may correspond to the time of day indicating the likelihood that the calling party has particular interest or may take particular actions. For example, the history information may indicate that the user's selection of the click-to-call control in the evening has a high correlation with the products and services received the next day.
The call context server identifies a set of context information mapped to a given transmission standard in a data store that stores a mapping of transmission standards to context information (306). For example, the call context server 220 may identify (e.g., at stage 2 in fig. 2) a set 226 of context information using a given transmission criterion 222 a. For example, the call context server 220 may use a data store 228 that identifies the relationship between the transmission criteria 230 and the context information 232. For example, the data store 228 may include an entry 228a, and when the transmission criteria 230 includes certain search query terms, the context information 232 specifies that user X is calling for reason Y.
In some implementations, historical data identifying past or recent interactions of the user 206 can be used to determine content. For example, prior to selecting click-to-call control 210, if user 206 has searched for topic Z (or viewed a digital component containing information about topic Z), click-to-call request 216 may include information identifying topic Z. For example, a mapping may be created between the contextual data and the search history of the user 206. In some implementations, for example, the updated search activity of the user 206 may indicate a greater confidence of the mapping than a few days ago search activity.
The client device connects to the remote telecommunication device through the call routing server using the telephone number (308). For example, the call routing server 214 (e.g., at stage 4 in fig. 2) may connect the client device 106a (e.g., the mobile device of the user 206) with the remote telecommunication device 128 (e.g., a phone or computer at the location 204 of the called party). For example, the connection may be made using the telephone number 224 identified in the click-to-call request 216.
When a call is connected or ongoing, a set of context information is sent by the call context server to the remote telecommunication device or a computing device associated with the remote telecommunication device (310). For example, the call context server 220 may send (e.g., at stage 5 in fig. 2) a set of context information to the remote telecommunication device 128 (e.g., "user X is calling for reason Y"). In some embodiments, the context information may be in the form of whisper accompanying the incoming call, such as in the form of a message that may be heard by the called party 208 prior to communicating with the calling party. In some embodiments, the contextual information is presented in a visual form, such as in the form of a caller identification field 234 in a display 236 displayed on the remote telecommunication device 128.
In some implementations, the indication that the click-to-call control interacted with the client device is received in the form of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call information that specifies a telephone number corresponding to a particular numeric component presented with the click-to-call control. In these cases, the set of contextual information sent to the remote telecommunication device may be embedded in the VoIP call setup data sent to the remote telephony device. For example, the call context server 220 may format text included in the context information set 226 as numeric data that may be inserted into a field of VoIP call setup data. In this way, the context of the call 202 may be rendered at the remote telecommunication device 128, for example, as text presented in the display of the called telecommunication device. In some embodiments, VoIP call setup techniques may be used to create packets that include other multimedia features, including video capabilities, such as graphically providing a calling reason for a calling party in the calling party identification field 234 or connecting the call 202 as an audiovisual presentation. For example, techniques for handling VoIP calls may include signaling, channel establishment, digitization of analog voice signals (or conversion from text), encoding, and then transmission of IP packets over a packet-switched network. In this manner, call 202 and context information 226 may be delivered to called party 208, which may be using a combination of headphones, a computer screen, and/or other devices.
In some implementations, the set of contextual information is sent to the remote telecommunication device in the form of an audible message that audibly communicates the set of contextual information when the remote telecommunication device is activated to receive a call but before enabling audio communication between the user of the client device and the user of the remote telecommunication device. For example, the set 226 of contextual information may be provided as whisper that may be heard by the called party 208 before beginning a conversation with the user 206.
In some implementations, the request to establish the call specifies a search query that triggers presentation of a particular digital component that is visually presented at the client device with the click-to-call control upon interaction with the click-to-call control. In these cases, packetized data specifying a particular post-call activity mapped in the data store to a given transmission standard may be generated and transmitted to the remote telecommunication device. For example, based on information in the received click-to-call request 216, the call context server 220 may determine that the search query (e.g., "nearby Z entity") entered by the user 206 on the client device 106a is a transmission criteria 222b that causes presentation of the digital component 212 (e.g., a search result or advertisement related to the Z entity). As a result, the set 226 of context information provided by the call routing server 214 to the remote telecommunication device 128 may indicate that user X is calling for reason Y, as determined by the mapping of entry 228a in the data store 228.
In some implementations, the call context server 220 can determine the intent of the query using keywords from the search query, thereby determining the set 226 of context information. For example, the keyword may be associated with a set of known servers available to an entity (e.g., the called party's location 204). In some implementations, the call context server 220 can determine the set 226 of context information from keywords that appear on numeric components (e.g., containing click-to-call controls 210) that the user arrives at from search results of the query.
In some embodiments, the packetized data may cause the remote telecommunication device to visually render a particular post-call activity on the display. For example, the set of context information 226 may include information about the call 202 in the display 236 on the remote telecommunication device 128. For example, the post-call activity may include information received from client device 106a, which may be used to display initial information in a visual representation of a conversation between user 206 and called party 208.
In some embodiments, the set of context information is sent as caller identification information presented in a caller identification field of a display of the remote telecommunication device. For example, caller identification field 234 in display 236 presented on remote telecommunication device 128 may identify cause Y as a post-call activity associated with call 202 being received by called party 208.
In some embodiments, sending the set of contextual information to the remote telecommunication device may include sending text-to-speech data specifying the set of contextual information to the remote telecommunication device. For example, the information provided by the call context server 220 for use in the caller identification field 234 may include information generated from the context information 232. The digital data may be consumed by remote telecommunication device 128, such as to produce whisper preceding the audible connection between user 206 and called party 208.
In some implementations, the set of context information 226 can include information, such as user-specific information, that can be used at the remote telecommunication device 128 to automatically perform a function. For example, an application running at the remote telecommunication device 128 may automatically fill in user-related information, such as in a tabular form, or automatically navigate to a screen associated with certain types of users or services, to name a few. In some implementations, the set of contextual information 226 can include information through which scheduling can be performed, e.g., to display available time slots for providing services related to contextual information about the user making the call 202. In some implementations, the set of context information 226 (or incoming telephone number) can be used to automatically find (such as from a user file) user information when the call 202 is connected, thereby simplifying interaction with the calling party during the call.
In some implementations, the set of context information 226 may be determined and communicated in various ways. For example, in a mobile environment, taps to a telephone number link may be tracked and details about the calling party may be passed to the enterprise (e.g., the location 204 of the called party). In some implementations, an intermediate server, such as call routing server 214, may act as an intermediate server that calls-forwards the unique telephone number presented to user 206 along with click-to-call control 210. In this example, the call routing server 214 may provide query information used by the user 206, e.g., including query terms that produce search results that guide the presentation of the click-to-call control 210.
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of example computing devices 400, 450, which can be clients or servers or multiple servers, which can be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document. Computing device 400 is intended to represent various forms of digital computers, such as laptops, desktops, workstations, personal digital assistants, servers, blade servers, mainframes, and other appropriate computers. Computing device 400 is also intended to represent any other typical non-mobile device, such as a television or other electronic device with one or more processors embedded or attached therein. Computing device 450 is intended to represent various forms of mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smart phones, and other computing devices. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are meant to be exemplary only, and are not meant to limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this document.
The memory 404 stores information within the computing device 400. In one implementation, the memory 404 is a computer-readable medium. In one implementation, the memory 404 is a single volatile memory unit or a plurality of volatile memory units. In another implementation, the memory 404 is a single non-volatile memory unit or a plurality of non-volatile memory units.
The storage device 406 can provide mass storage for the computing device 400. In one implementation, the memory 406 is a computer-readable medium. In various different implementations, the storage device 406 may be a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, a flash memory or other similar solid state memory device, or an array of devices included in a storage area network or other configurations. In one embodiment, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions which, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as the methods described above. The information carrier is a computer-or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 404, the storage device 406, or memory on processor 402.
The high speed controller 408 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for the computing device 400, while the low speed controller 412 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. This allocation of duties is only an example. In one embodiment, the high-speed controller 408 is coupled (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator) to memory 404, display 416, and to high-speed expansion ports 410, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown). In this embodiment, a low-speed controller 412 is coupled to the storage device 406 and a low-speed bus 414. A low-speed bus 414 (e.g., a low-speed expansion port), which may include various communication ports (e.g., USB, bluetooth, ethernet, wireless ethernet), may be coupled to one or more input/output devices, such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a scanner, or a network device such as a switch or router, for example, through a network adapter.
The computing device 450 includes a processor 452, memory 464, an input/output device such as a display 454, a communication interface 466, and a transceiver 468, among other components. The computing device 450 may also be equipped with storage devices, such as microdrives or other devices, to provide additional storage. Each of the components 450, 452, 464, 454, 466, and 468 are interconnected using various buses, and several of the components may be mounted on a common motherboard or in other manners as appropriate.
The processor 452 may process instructions for execution within the computing device 450, including instructions stored in the memory 464. The processor may also include separate analog and digital processors. For example, the processor may provide for coordination of the other components of the computing device 450, such as control of user interfaces, applications run by the computing device 450, and wireless communication by the computing device 450.
The processor 452 may communicate with a user through a control interface 458, and a display interface 456 is coupled to a display 454. For example, the display 454 may be a TFT LCD display or an OLED display, or other suitable display technology. The display interface 456 may comprise appropriate circuitry for driving the display 454 to present graphical and other information to a user. The control interface 458 may receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to the processor 452. Additionally, an external interface 462 may be provided in communication with processor 452, so as to enable near area communication of computing device 450 with other devices. For example, external interface 462 may provide for wired communication (e.g., through a docking process) or wireless communication (e.g., through bluetooth or other such technology).
For example, the memory may include flash memory and/or MRAM memory, as described below. In one embodiment, a computer program product is tangibly embodied in an information carrier. The computer program product contains instructions which, when executed, perform one or more methods, such as the methods described above. The information carrier is a computer-or machine-readable medium, such as the memory 464, expansion memory 474, or memory on processor 452.
The computing device 450 may communicate wirelessly through the communication interface 466, which communication interface 466 may include digital signal processing circuitry as necessary. Communication interface 466 may provide for communications under various modes or protocols, such as GSM voice calls, SMS, EMS, or MMS messaging, CDMA, TDMA, PDC, WCDMA, CDMA2000, or GPRS, among others. Such communication may occur, for example, through the transceiver 468 (e.g., a radio frequency transceiver). In addition, short-range communications may occur, such as using a bluetooth, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). Additionally, GPS receiver module 470 may provide additional wireless data to computing device 450, which may be used as appropriate by applications running on computing device 450.
Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system and at least one output device.
These computer programs (also known as programs, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and may be implemented in a high-level procedural and/or object-oriented programming language, and/or in assembly/machine language. Other programming paradigms may be used, such as functional programming, logical programming, or other programming. As used herein, the terms "machine-readable medium" "computer-readable medium" refers to any computer program product, apparatus and/or Device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory and Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a Programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term "machine-readable signal" refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other types of devices may also be used to provide for interaction with a user; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user may be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front-end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), and the internet.
The computing system may include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of particular inventions.
