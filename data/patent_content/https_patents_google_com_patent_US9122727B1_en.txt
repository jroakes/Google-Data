Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to information retrieval.
- Information retrieval systems help users by retrieving information, such as web pages, images, text documents and multimedia content, in response to search queries.
- a search engine locates and stores the location of documents in a searchable index used to facilitate fast information retrieval.
- the search engine may use a variety of statistical measures to determine the relevance of the documents in the index to the user's query to identify and provide search results.
- Formulating a search query that accurately represents the user's information need can be challenging.
- the search engine may identify a number of resources which match terms in the user's query, but which are unrelated to the actual information need of the user. The user may thus have to enter a number of different queries during the same search session. Although these queries are different, the search results returned from the search engine may be quite similar because these queries relate to the same information need of the user. In such a case, the same highly ranked search results may be provided to the user multiple times during the search session.
- a method in some implementations, includes identifying a respective ordered list of search result documents for each query in a plurality of queries.
- the method further includes identifying a given query in the plurality of queries; a first and second grouping in the ordered list for the given query; and a first and second grouping in the ordered list for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries.
- the method also includes determining non-overlap scores between the given query and each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries. The non-overlap scores measure the dissimilarities between the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered list for the given query appear and the first grouping in the ordered list for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries.
- the method also includes selecting one or more candidate queries from the remaining queries in the plurality of queries based on the non-overlap scores.
- the method also includes determining overlap scores between the given query and each of the candidate queries.
- the overlap scores measure the similarities between the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the second grouping in the ordered list for each of the candidate queries.
- the method also includes selecting one or more related queries from the candidate queries based on the overlap scores.
- the method also includes associating the related queries with the given query.
- the non-overlap scores may be determined based on a comparison of the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within a first grouping in the ordered lists for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries. In some implementations, the non-overlap scores may be determined based on similarity scores between the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered lists for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries. In yet other implementations, the non-overlap scores may be determined based on both the comparison of the search result documents within the respective first groupings and on similarity scores between the search result documents within the respective first groupings.
- the overlap scores may be determined based on a comparison of the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within a second grouping in the ordered lists for each of the candidate queries. In some implementations, the overlap scores may be determined based on similarity scores between the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered lists for each of the candidate queries.
- the search results documents in the first grouping in the ordered list for the given query may have the same ordering as the respective search result documents in the first grouping in the ordered list for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries.
- the search results documents in the second grouping in the ordered list for the given query may have the same ordering as the respective search result documents in the second grouping in the ordered list for each of the candidate queries.
- At least one search result document within the respective first groupings in the respective ordered lists may have a higher numerical order than at least one search result document within the respective second groupings in the respective ordered lists.
- Each search result document within the respective first groupings in the respective ordered lists may have a higher numerical order than each search result document within the respective second groupings in the respective ordered lists.
- the ordered lists of search result documents may be obtained from a search engine.
- the search results corresponding to each of the search result documents within the first grouping in the respective ordered lists may appear on a first search results page received from the search engine in response to the corresponding queries.
- none of the search results corresponding to the search result documents within the second range in the respective ordered lists may appear on the first search results page received from the search engine in response to the corresponding queries.
- the first grouping may comprise a predetermined number of highest ranked search result documents in the respective ordered lists.
- the queries in the plurality of queries may be past queries submitted by prior users. Selecting one or more of the candidate queries may be further based on a frequency that the respective candidate queries were submitted by the prior users. Selecting one or more of the candidate queries may be further based on elapsed times since the respective candidate queries were submitted by the prior users.
- the method may further include receiving the given query.
- One or more of the related queries may then be transmitted as query suggestions for the received given query.
- Transmitting the selected one or more related queries may include transmitting a search results page.
- the search results page may include the one or more related queries and identify search results documents in the ordered list for the given query.
- the search results page may further identify search results documents in the ordered list for the one or more related queries.
- Selecting one or more candidate queries from the remaining queries in the plurality of queries may include selecting a predetermined number of remaining queries having the highest non-overlap scores.
- Selecting one or more related queries from the candidate queries can include selecting a predetermined number of candidate queries having the highest overlap scores.
- implementations may include a non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing instructions executable by a processor to perform a method such as one or more of the methods described herein.
- implementations may include a system including memory and one or more processors operable to execute instructions, stored in the memory, to perform a method such as one or more of the methods described herein.
- Particular implementations of the subject matter described herein may identify search queries that represent related topics or concepts, but which do not represent substantially the same information request.
- one or more of its related queries may then be provided as a query suggestion to the user.
- These related queries represent information requests that may be relevant to the information need of the user, while also producing search results different from the information already being searched by the user.
- the subsequent submission of a related query by the user may reduce or eliminate the repeated, prominent presentation of the same search results during a search session. In doing so, meaningful query suggestions can be provided which increase the likelihood of assisting users in obtaining search results containing the information they actually seek.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example environment in which identifying related queries that represent different information requests can be used.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow chart illustrating an example process for identifying related queries that represent different information requests.
- FIGS. 3A-3B are screenshots illustrating example environments that can be used to provide related queries to a user.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system.
- Technology described herein identifies search queries that represent related topics or concepts, but which do not represent substantially the same information request.
- the technology includes associating queries as related if their higher ranked search results are quite different, and their lower ranked search results include a number of documents in common. An appreciable overlap among their lower ranked search results in comparison to their higher ranked search results indicates a likelihood that the two queries represent related information requests, but that these two queries do not represent the same or similar information request.
- one or more of its related queries can then be provided as query suggestions to the user.
- These related queries represent information requests that may be relevant to the information need of the user, while also producing search results different from the information already being searched by the user.
- the subsequent submission of a related query by the user can reduce or eliminate the repeated, prominent presentation of the same search results during a search session. In doing so, meaningful query suggestions can be provided which increase the likelihood of assisting users in obtaining search results containing the information they actually seek.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example environment in which identifying related queries that represent different information requests can be used.
- the environment 100 includes a client computing device 110 and a search engine 150 .
- the environment 100 also includes a communication network (or networks) 140 that allows for communication between various components of the environment 100 .
- the network 140 includes the Internet.
- the network 140 can also utilize dedicated or private communication links that are not necessarily part of the Internet.
- the network 140 uses standard communications technologies, protocols, and/or inter-process communication technologies.
- the client computing device 110 and the search engine 150 each include memory for storage of data and software applications, a processor for accessing data and executing applications, and components that facilitate communication over the network 140 .
- the client computing device 110 executes an application, such as a web browser 120 , which provides a search field that allows the user to formulate search queries and submit them to the search engine 150 .
- the client computing device 110 may be for example a desktop computer, a laptop, a tablet computer, a mobile phone, or any other type of computing device.
- the search engine 150 receives a search query submitted from the client computing device 110 , and executes the search query against a collection of documents 160 such as web pages, images, text documents, and multimedia content to produce search results.
- the search results identify an ordered list of search result documents in the collection of documents 160 that are relevant to the user's query.
- the search engine 150 can use conventional or other techniques to determine which documents in the collection of documents 160 to include in the ordered list, and the ranking of each of the documents within the list.
- the collection of documents 160 may be collectively stored on multiple computers and/or storage devices.
- a document in the collection of documents 160 may be a web page, a word processing document, a portable document format (PDF) document, or any other type of electronic document.
- PDF portable document format
- the collection of documents 160 is obtained from the World Wide Web.
- the search engine 150 maintains records 135 of past queries submitted by prior users.
- the records 135 may be collectively stored on one or more computers and/or storage devices.
- the search engine 150 may maintain an aggregated or anonymized record of queries.
- the past queries in the records 135 are analyzed by a related query engine 180 using the techniques described herein to identify and associate queries that are related, but which represent different information requests.
- the related query engine 180 determines that two queries are related based at least in part on if their higher ranked search results are quite different, and their lower ranked search results include a number of documents in common. The appreciable overlap among their lower ranked search results in comparison to their higher ranked search results indicates that two queries may represent related information requests, but that these two queries do not represent the same or similar information request.
- the related query engine 180 can be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software running on hardware. The related query engine 180 is described in more detail below with respect to FIGS. 2-4 .
- the search engine 150 provides the user's query to the related query engine 180 .
- the related query engine 180 transmits one or more related queries for the user's query to the search engine 150 .
- These related queries represent information requests that may be relevant to the information need of the user, while also being different from the information already being searched by the user. Since the related queries have different highly ranked search results, the subsequent submission of a related query by the user can reduce or eliminate the repeated, prominent presentation of the same search results during the user's search session. This in turn increases the likelihood of providing search results containing the information the user actually seeks.
- the search engine 150 then generates and transmits a search results page that includes these related queries for the user's query, as well as the search results for the user's query.
- the search results page may be displayed in the web browser 120 or other application executing on the client computing device 110 .
- One or more of the related queries may then be selected by the user for submission as a search query to the search engine 150 , so that search results relevant to the selected related query can be obtained.
- the search results page also includes search results for one or more of the related queries.
- the search results for the user's query within the search results page can be displayed separate from the search results for the related queries.
- the search results for the user's query may appear on the left side of the search results page, while the search results for one or more of the related queries may appear on the right side.
- these search results may be located in other positions of the search results page.
- the positions of the search results may also be user configurable.
- a partial query is a query formulated by a user prior to an indication by the user that the query is complete.
- a user may indicate completion of the query by entering a carriage return or equivalent character.
- the user may indicate completion of the query by selecting a search button in a user interface presented to the user during entry of the query.
- the user may indicate completion of the query by saying a command in a speech interface or pausing more than a predetermined period of time.
- the web browser 120 or other application executing on the client computing device 110 also transmits partial queries being formulated by the user to a suggestion engine 170 .
- the suggestion engine 170 includes memory for storage of data and software applications, a processor for accessing data and executing applications, and components that facilitate communication over the network 140 .
- the suggestion engine 170 provides a set of query suggestions to the related query engine 180 .
- These query suggestions may for example be past queries submitted by prior users. These query suggestions represent search queries that the user may want to submit instead of the partial query actually being typed.
- the suggestion engine 170 may use conventional or other techniques to determine which query suggestions to include in the set for the partial query. For example, the suggestion engine 170 may use prefix based matching. The suggestion engine 170 may also use other techniques to determine the query suggestions to include in the set.
- the related query engine 180 can then modify the set of query suggestions by adding one or more related queries for at least one query suggestion in the set.
- the related query engine 180 can then provide the modified set for display to the user of the client computing device 110 .
- the techniques for adding the related queries to the set of query suggestions can vary from implementation to implementation.
- the related queries may be added to the beginning or end, before or after the query suggestions in the set.
- other techniques may be used to add the related queries to the set.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a flow chart illustrating an example process for identifying related queries that represent different information requests. Some implementations may perform the steps in different orders and/or perform different or additional steps than the ones illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 2 will be described with reference to a system of one or more computers that performs the process.
- the system can be, for example, the related query engine 180 as described above with reference to FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 2 will be also be described with reference to a first grouping of search result documents that may be a continuous first grouping of search result documents in some implementations; and/or a second grouping of search result documents that may be a continuous second grouping of search result documents in some implementations.
- a first grouping of search result documents and/or a second grouping of search result documents may comprise search result documents from one or more non-continuous ranges.
- the first grouping may include the 2nd to the 10th highest ranked search result documents and the second grouping may include the 12th to the 14 th highest ranked search result documents.
- the first grouping may include the 2 nd to the 6 th highest ranked search result documents and the 9 th to the 15 th highest ranked search result documents
- the second grouping may include the 5 th to the 10 th highest ranked search result documents and the 16 th to the 20 th highest ranked search result documents.
- the system identifies an ordered list of search result documents for each query in a plurality of queries.
- the system retrieves these queries from the records 135 .
- these queries can be obtained using other techniques.
- the system calculates or determines non-overlap scores between a given query and remaining queries by comparing the search result documents within a first, relatively high range in their corresponding ordered lists. As described in more detail below, this range is “relatively high” because it includes search result documents that are more highly ranked in the ordered lists than those within a second range that are used in step 240 below.
- the non-overlap score for a remaining query is based at least in part on how infrequently search result documents within the first range in the ordered list for the remaining query appear within the same range in the ordered list for the given query.
- the non-overlap score is thus a measure of the differences between the search results within this first range for the remaining query and the given query.
- the upper and lower ranked positions that define this first range can vary from implementation to implementation.
- the first range may be a predetermined number of the highest ranked search result documents in the ordered lists, such as the 5 or 10 highest ranked search result documents.
- the first range may omit one or more of the highest ranked search result documents, such as being the 2nd to 10th highest ranked search result documents.
- the omission of one or more of the highest ranked search result documents may also be query dependent. For example, the highest ranked search result document for a particular query may be omitted if it is frequently selected by users upon being presented within search results for the particular query.
- This predetermined number of highest ranked search result documents may for example be less than or equal to the number of search results documents that appear on the first search results page received from the search engine 150 in response to the corresponding query.
- queries that have little or no overlap among the search result documents appearing on their corresponding first search results page are more likely to be identified as being related. Since it has been observed that many users only review the search results on the first search results page before submitting another query, the subsequent submission of a related query by a user is less likely to prominently display search results that contain the same information that has already been passed over by the user.
- the non-overlap scores measure the dissimilarities between the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered list for the given query appear and the first grouping in the ordered list for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries.
- the non-overlap scores may be determined based on a comparison of the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within a first grouping in the ordered lists for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries.
- the non-overlap scores may be independently determined based on similarity scores between the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered lists for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries.
- the non-overlap scores may be determined based on both the comparison of the search result documents within the respective first groupings and on similarity scores between the search result documents within the respective first grouping.
- the non-overlap scores may be based on a comparison of the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within a first grouping in the ordered lists for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries.
- the non-overlap score may be calculated as a function of the number of search result documents within the first range in the ordered list for the remaining query that do not appear within the same range in the ordered list for the given query. This function may be for example proportional to the number of search result documents that do not appear within the first range of both the remaining query and the given query.
- the non-overlap score may be based on whether the number of search result documents that appear within the first range of both the remaining query and the given query exceeds a threshold number of documents. In such a case, the non-overlap score may be assigned the lowest value if the number of overlapping documents exceeds the threshold number of documents.
- the non-overlap scores may be independently determined based on similarity scores between the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within the first grouping in the ordered lists for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries.
- the similarity score between the given query and the remaining query can be based on the similarity between the content in the search result documents that appear within the first range in the ordered list for the given query, and content in the search result documents that appear within the first range in the ordered list for the remaining query.
- the techniques for calculating the similarity scores can vary from implementation to implementation.
- individual similarity scores are calculated between each term in the search result documents that appear within the first range in the ordered list for the given query, and each term in the search results documents that appear within the first range in the ordered list for the remaining query.
- the similarity score between two terms may for example be calculated based on their co-occurrence over a collection of documents, such as html web pages.
- the final similarity score between the given query and the remaining query may then be calculated as a function of the individual similarity scores. This function may be for example based on a sum of the individual similarity
- the non-overlap scores may be determined based on both the comparison of the search result documents within the respective first groupings and on similarity scores between the search result documents within the respective first grouping. For example, the non-overlap score may be calculated using the following equation:
- NS ⁇ ( Q A , Q B ) Non-Occurrence ⁇ ⁇ ( SR A , SR B ) SS ⁇ ( SR A , SR B )
- NS (Q A ,Q B ) is the non-overlap score between given query Q A and remaining query Q B
- Non-Occurrence (SR A , SR B ) is the number of search result documents within the first range in the ordered list SR A for the given query Q A that do not appear within the first range in the ordered list SR B for the remaining query
- SS(SR A , SR B ) is the similarity score between the content in the search result documents within the first range in the ordered list SR A for the given query Q A and content in the search result documents within the first range in the ordered list SR B for the remaining query Q B .
- the system uses the non-overlap scores to select one or more of the remaining queries as candidate queries for the given query.
- These candidate queries represent queries that potentially are related to the given query, but that do not return the same information as the given query.
- the techniques for selecting the candidate queries can vary from implementation to implementation. For example, a predetermined number of the remaining queries having the highest non-overlap scores may be selected. As another example, the non-overlap scores may be compared to a threshold, and the remaining queries that have non-overlap scores that satisfy the threshold may be selected as candidate queries.
- the system calculates overlap scores between the given query and the candidate queries by comparing the search result documents within a second, relatively low range in their corresponding ordered lists.
- the overlap score for a candidate query is based at least in part on how frequently search result documents within the second range in the ordered list for candidate query appear within the second range in the ordered list for the given query.
- This second range is “relatively low” because it includes at least some search result documents that are lower ranked in the ordered lists than those within the first range used to calculate the non-overlap scores as described above.
- the overlap score is thus a measure of the similarity between the relatively low search results for the candidate query and the given query.
- the upper and lower ranked positions that define the second range can vary from implementation to implementation.
- the second range includes at least some of the search result documents within the first range. That is, the upper ranked position of the second range is greater than the lower ranked position of the first range.
- the first range may include the 10 highest ranked search result documents in the ordered lists, while the second range may include the 5 th to 100 th highest ranked search result documents.
- the second range may not overlap with the first range.
- each of the documents within the first range is higher ranked in the respective ordered lists than each of the documents within the second range.
- the first range may include the 5 highest ranked search results documents in the lists, while the second range may include the 20 th to 200 th highest ranked search results documents.
- none of the search results corresponding to search documents within the second range in the lists appear on the first search results web page received from the search engine 150 in response to the corresponding queries.
- the overlap scores measure the similarities between the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the second grouping in the ordered list for each of the candidate queries.
- the overlap scores may be determined based on a comparison of the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within a second grouping in the ordered lists for each of the remaining queries in the plurality of queries.
- the overlap scores may be independently determined based on similarity scores between the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered lists for each of the candidate queries.
- the overlap scores may be determined based on a comparison of the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within a second grouping in the ordered lists for each of the candidate queries.
- the overlap score can be calculated as a function of the number of search result documents within the second range in the ordered list for the remaining query that appear within the same range in the ordered list for the given query. This function may be for example proportional to the number of search result documents that do appear within the second range of both the remaining query and the given query.
- the overlap scores may be independently determined based on determining similarity scores between the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered list for the given query and the search result documents within the second grouping in the ordered lists for each of the candidate queries.
- the similarity score between the given query and the remaining query can be based on the similarity between the content in the search result documents that appear within the second range in the ordered list for the given query, and content in the search result documents that appear within the second range in the ordered list for the candidate query.
- the techniques for calculating the similarity scores can vary from implementation to implementation.
- individual similarity scores are calculated between each term in the search result documents that appear within the second range in the ordered list for the given query, and each term in the search results documents that appear within the second range in the ordered list for the candidate query.
- the similarity score between two terms may for example be calculated based on their co-occurrence over a collection of documents, such as html web pages.
- the final similarity score between the given query and the candidate query may then be calculated as a function of the individual similarity scores. This function may be for example based on a sum of the individual similarity scores.
- the system selects one or more of the candidate queries as related queries for the given query using the overlap scores.
- the techniques for selecting the related queries can vary from implementation to implementation. For example, a predetermined number of the candidate queries having the highest overlap scores may be selected. As another example, the overlap scores may be compared to a threshold, and the candidate queries having overlap scores that satisfy the threshold may be selected as related queries.
- the system stores data associating the related queries with the given query. This data can then be used in a subsequent computerized process to provide the queries that are related to the given query. This data may for example be stored in the form of a related query list, or any other type of data structure maintained by the system.
- the steps 210 , 220 , 230 , 240 and 250 can then be repeated for another query in the plurality of queries.
- the system may also compute additional signals that are used to determine which of the candidate queries to select as related queries for the given query. For example, the system may calculate popularity scores for the candidate queries.
- a popularity score for a candidate query can be calculated based on a frequency of submission of the candidate query as a search query by prior users.
- the popularity score is calculated by counting the number of times the candidate query appears as a past search query in the records 135 .
- the popularity score may also be weighted based on the elapsed times since the past search queries were submitted by the prior users. In such a case, the popularity scores can adapt to changes in users' searching behavior with time.
- a content freshness score may be based on elapsed times since content within the search result documents within the second range in the ordered list for a candidate query has been updated or otherwise changed.
- the system may then use the popularity scores and/or other computed signals to determine which of the candidate queries to select as related queries for the given query. For example, the system may calculate a final score for a candidate query that is a function of its overlap score and its popularity score. These final scores can then be used to select the candidate queries. This function may be for example proportional to the overlap score and the popularity score. For example, the final score for a candidate query may be calculated as a weighted average of its overlap score and its popularity score. In implementations in which the system computes other signals, such as the content freshness scores mentioned above, the final score may be based on a weighted average of each of these computed signals.
- the system can then provide the related queries as query suggestions for the given query.
- These related queries represent information requests that may be relevant to the information need of the user who submitted the given query, while also being different from the most relevant information already being searched by the user.
- One or more of the related queries may then be selected by the user for submission as a search query to a search engine, so that search results can be obtained.
- FIGS. 3A-3B are screenshots illustrating example environments that can be used to provide related queries to a user.
- the screenshot includes a search field 300 and a search button 310 .
- the related queries are embedded within the search results web page as “related searches.”
- the related queries include “panda conservation”, “red panda”, “beijing zoo”, “panda research centers” and “toronto zoo”.
- the related queries include “incubator”, “ipo”, “silicon valley”, “entrpreneurship” and “tech blogs”.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example computer system.
- Computer system 410 typically includes at least one processor 414 that communicates with a number of peripheral devices via bus subsystem 412 .
- peripheral devices may include a storage subsystem 424 , comprising for example memory devices and a file storage subsystem, user interface input devices 422 , user interface output devices 420 , and a network interface subsystem 416 .
