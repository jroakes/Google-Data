Definitions
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of content. For instance, images, audio, video, and web pages for many different topics are accessible through the Internet.
- the accessible content provides an opportunity to present advertisements to users. Advertisements can be placed within content, such as a web page, image or video, or the content can trigger the display of one or more advertisements, such as presenting an advertisement in an advertisement slot within the content and/or in an advertisement slot of a pop-up window or other overlay.
- the amount of traffic information available regarding even a basic Internet transaction can be cumbersome for interested parties. Users may visit numerous and different uniform resource locators (URLs), to complete substantially the same types of transactions. For example, an advertiser may wish to know more about the number of users that actually add a product to an online shopping cart. However, a unique URL may be generated each time a user adds a product to a shopping cart.
- URLs uniform resource locators
- various parties may be interested in how users arrive at certain webpages. For example, one user may perform an Internet search for a specific product, while another user may follow an advertisement link, to arrive at the same product description page. Therefore, the number of traffic paths that users may follow may also be large. For these and other reasons, generating visualizations of the flow of Internet traffic is challenging and difficult.
- the method includes receiving, from an interface, a selection of steps in an online process and selection of a source type.
- a step in the online process corresponds to visiting one or more webpages and the source type is indicative of a characteristic of a device that accesses the one or more webpages.
- the method also includes retrieving, from a memory, data representative of nodes and traffic paths between nodes based in part on the selection of steps and the selection of the source type. At least one node corresponds to the source type and at least another node corresponds to a group of the one or more webpages.
- the method further includes determining a level for each node, the level representing a step in the online process.
- the method also includes generating visualization data configured to cause an electronic display to display two or more of the nodes and one or more traffic paths between the displayed nodes based in part on the levels of the two or more nodes.
- the method further includes providing the visualization data to an electronic device.
- a system for generating a visualization of network traffic includes a processing circuit configured to receive a selection of steps in an online process and selection of a source type.
- a step in the online process corresponds to visiting one or more webpages and the source type is indicative of a characteristic of a device that accesses the one or more webpages.
- the processing circuit is also configured to retrieve data representative of nodes and traffic paths between nodes based in part on the selection of steps and the selection of the source type. At least one node corresponds to the source type and at least another node corresponds to a group of the one or more webpages.
- the processing circuit is further configured to determine a level for each node, the level representing a step in the online process.
- the processing circuit is also configured to generate visualization data configured to cause an electronic display to display two or more of the nodes and one or more traffic paths between the displayed nodes based in part on the levels of the two or more nodes.
- the processing circuit is further configured to provide the visualization data to an electronic device.
- a further implementation is one or more computer-readable media having instructions stored therein, the instructions being executable by one or more processors to cause the one or more processors to perform operations.
- the operations include receiving a selection of steps in an online process and selection of a source type.
- a step in the online process corresponds to visiting one or more webpages and the source type is indicative of a characteristic of a device that accesses the one or more webpages.
- the operations also include retrieving data representative of nodes and traffic paths between nodes based in part on the selection of steps and the selection of the source type. At least one node corresponds to the source type and at least another node corresponds to a group of the one or more webpages.

- traffic data may include information as to how a user arrives at a website (e.g., by starting their web browsing at the website, by following a hyperlink from another website, etc.), how a user navigates within the website (e.g., by traversing from a product information page to a shopping cart page, by traversing from a shopping cart page to a purchase page, etc.), and where users go after visiting the website (e.g., by clicking on advertisements, by navigating to other websites, etc.).
- Interested parties can use traffic information to make changes to the website, tailor an advertising campaign a certain way, and perform other activities.
- Interested parties may access various reports and visualizations that convey information regarding user interactions with the content and the flow of traffic through certain websites.
- a traffic analysis tool may aggregate and display traffic data, to assist an interested party in discerning how users interact with various webpages. For example, an advertiser may wish to know the percentage of users that actually click on an advertisement or how many users actually complete a purchase of the advertised product. The analysis and reporting of the traffic data can enable an advertiser to make advertising budget allocation decisions.
- a website administrator may make changes to the website that lead to a greater number of users reaching certain pages of a website.
- the analysis tool may operate to simplify the presentation of information to an interested party about the flow of traffic.
- the analysis tool may aggregate and group certain types of information into “nodes” in the visualization.
- displayed nodes may be “clusters” of aggregated URLs.
- URLs associated with viewing a shopping cart may be aggregated into a single cluster for display on a traffic flow visualization.
- other types of URLs within a particular website may be clustered (e.g., a main page, a search page, etc.) and the traffic between these URLs may also be aggregated.
- URL clustering is described in greater detail in the co-filed U.S.
- the analysis tool may also automatically determine which nodes and flows of traffic are displayed in a visualization, according to various implementations. Aggregated flows of traffic among nodes may still be difficult to follow for a user of the visualization. For example, traffic may flow from node A to node D by traversing both nodes B and C. Traffic may also traverse from node A to node C and on to node D. Some traffic may flow directly from node A to node D. In addition, some traffic may follow a backwards path (e.g., by arriving at a previous node). For example, a user may traverse from node B to node C and then choose to return to node B, before continuing on to node D. In some implementations, the analysis tool may use a scoring function to determine whether or not certain paths of traffic are displayed in a traffic flow visualization.
- the analysis tool may allow a user to select a source type.
- a source type is any way to classify information about network traffic that arrives at a displayed node in the visualization.
- a source type may be the source webpages from which traffic flow to a node in the visualization. For example, some traffic may arrive at a merchant's website from a search engine, while other traffic arrives by following advertisements on other websites.
- a source type may categorize information about the user devices that access the various webpages.
- a source type may be the geographic locations of user devices (e.g., based on the IP addresses of the devices, based on GPS location information, etc.), system information about the user devices (e.g., type of web browser, operating system, the type of device, etc.) or other types of information about the accessing devices.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which an advertisement management system manages advertising services.

- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- a resource 105 is any data that can be provided over network 102 .
- a resource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with resource 105 , such as a URL.
- Resources 105 can include web pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, programming elements, interactive content, and feed sources, to name only a few.
- Resources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions.
- Embedded instructions can include code that is executed at a user's device, such as in a web browser. Code can be written in languages, such as, JavaScript® or ECMAScript®.
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user.
- User device 106 is configured to request and receive resources 105 over network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over network 102 .
- user device 106 may includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over network 102 .
- User device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing resource 105 can be provided to user device 106 for presentation by user device 106 (e.g., on an electronic display, as an audible sound via a speaker, or a combination thereof).
- the data representing resource 105 can include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which advertisements can be presented. These specified portions of resource 105 or user display are referred to as advertisement slots.
- environment 100 may include a search system 112 that identifies resources 105 by crawling and indexing resources 105 provided on websites 104 .
- Data about resources 105 can be indexed based on resource 105 with which the data is associated.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of resources 105 are stored in a search index (not shown).
- User devices 106 can submit search queries to search system 112 over network 102 .
- search system 112 accesses the search index to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query.
- a search query includes one or more keywords.
- Search system 112 identifies resources 105 that are responsive to the query, provides information about resources 105 in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result can include data generated by search system 112 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query, and can include a link to resource 105 .
- An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from web page 104 , a rendering of resource 105 , and the URL of the web page 104 .
- Search results pages can also include one or more advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented.
- a search result page can be sent with a request from search system 112 for the web browser of user device 106 to set an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) cookie.
- a cookie can represent, for example, a particular user device 106 and a particular web browser.
- search system 112 includes a server that replies to the query by sending the search results page in an HTTP response.
- This HTTP response includes instructions (e.g., a set cookie instruction) that cause the browser to store a cookie for the site hosted by the server or for the domain of the server. If the browser supports cookies and cookies are enabled, every subsequent page request to the same server or a server within the domain of the server will include the cookie.
- the cookie can store a variety of data, including a unique or semi-unique identifier.
- the unique or semi-unique identifier can be anonymized and is not connected with user names. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, the use of cookies allows an external service, such as search system 112 or other system, to track particular actions and status of a user over multiple sessions. A user may opt out of tracking user actions, for example, by disabling cookies in the browser's settings.
- advertisement management system 110 receives a request for advertisements to be provided with resource 105 or search results.
- the request for advertisements can include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results page, and can be provided to advertisement management system 110 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the advertisement slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the advertisement slot can be provided to advertisement management system 110 .
- keywords i.e., one or more words that are associated with content
- source keywords i.e., one or more words that are associated with content
- search query for which search results are requested
- advertisement management system 110 can also be provided to advertisement management system 110 to facilitate identification of advertisements that are relevant to resource 105 or search query.
- advertisement management system 110 can select advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible advertisements”).
- eligible advertisements can include advertisements having characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries.
- advertisements having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords, the search query, or portions of the search query are selected as eligible advertisements by advertisement management system 110 .
- Advertisement management system 110 selects an eligible advertisement for each advertisement slot of a resource 105 or of a search results page.
- Resource 105 or search results page is received by user device 106 for presentation by user device 106 .
- User interaction data representing user interactions with presented advertisements can be stored in a historical data store 119 .
- data can be stored in a log file 116 .
- Log file 116 can be aggregated with other data in historical data store 119 .
- historical data store 119 contains data representing the advertisement impression.
- the presentation of an advertisement is stored in response to a request for the advertisement that is presented.
- the ad request can include data identifying a particular cookie, such that data identifying the cookie can be stored in association with data that identifies the advertisement(s) that were presented in response to the request.
- the data can be stored directly to historical data store 119 .
- data representing the selection of the link can be stored in log file 116 , a cookie, or historical data store 119 .
- the data is stored in response to a request for a web page that is linked to an advertisement.
- the user selection of the advertisement can initiate a request for presentation of a web page that is provided by (or for) the advertiser.
- the request can include data identifying the particular cookie for the user device, and this data can be stored in the advertisement data store.
- User interaction data can be associated with unique identifiers that represent a corresponding user device with which the user interactions were performed.
- user interaction data can be associated with one or more cookies.
- Each cookie can include content which specifies an initialization time that indicates a time at which the cookie was initially set on the particular user device 106 .
- additional information may be collected about a particular user.
- additional information may include information relating to the user's demographics, geographic location (e.g., based on a GPS function in a mobile device, based on an IP address, etc.), system information (e.g., which web browser is being use, the type of computing device used, etc.), and any other type of information about a user's interaction with environment 100 .
- Log files 116 also store references to advertisements and data representing conditions under which each advertisement was selected for presentation to a user.
- historical data store 119 can store targeting keywords, bids, and other criteria with which eligible advertisements are selected for presentation.
- historical data store 119 can include data that specifies a number of impressions for each advertisement and the number of impressions for each advertisement can be tracked, for example, using the keywords that caused the advertisement impressions and/or the cookies that are associated with the impressions.
- Data for each impression can also be stored so that each impression and user selection can be associated with (i.e., stored with references to and/or indexed according to) the advertisement that was selected and/or the targeting keyword that caused the advertisement to be selected for presentation.
- Advertisers 108 can submit, to advertisement management system 110 , campaign parameters (e.g., targeting keywords and corresponding bids) that are used to control distribution of advertisements. Advertisers 108 can access advertisement management system 110 to monitor performance of the advertisements that are distributed using the campaign parameters. For example, an advertiser can access a campaign performance report that provides a number of impressions (i.e., presentations), selections (i.e., clicks), and conversions that have been identified for the advertisements. The campaign performance report can also provide a total cost, a cost-per-click, and other cost measures for the advertisement over a specified period of time.
- campaign parameters e.g., targeting keywords and corresponding bids
- Advertisers 108 can access advertisement management system 110 to monitor performance of the advertisements that are distributed using the campaign parameters. For example, an advertiser can access a campaign performance report that provides a number of impressions (i.e., presentations), selections (i.e., clicks), and conversions that have been identified for the advertisements. The campaign performance report can also provide
- the referring web page (or other resource) for that interaction can be identified, for example, by execution of code that is referenced by the web page being accessed and/or based on a URL that is used to access the web page.
- a user can access an advertiser's website by selecting a link presented on a web page, for example, as part of a promotional offer by an affiliate of the advertiser. This link can be associated with a URL that includes data (i.e., text) that uniquely identifies the resource from which the user is navigating.
- the link http://www.example.com/homepage/% affiliate_identifier%promotion — 1 specifies that the user navigated to the example.com web page from a web page of the affiliate that is associated with the affiliate identifier number that is specified in the URL, and that the user was directed to the example.com web page based on a selection of the link that is included in the promotional offer that is associated with promotion — 1.
- the user interaction data for this interaction i.e., the selection of the link
- Advertisement management system 110 includes a performance analysis apparatus 120 that may use traffic and other data stored in logs 116 , historical data 119 , or elsewhere, to generate one or more flow visualizations of traffic in environment 100 .
- performance analysis apparatus 120 may analyze cookie data to determine how many users traverse from one of websites 104 to another.
- performance analysis apparatus 120 may aggregate sets of data into nodes and/or traffic paths for the visualization.
- Performance analysis apparatus 120 may also determine which nodes and traffic paths are displayed in a traffic flow visualization.
- performance analysis apparatus 120 may utilize one or more scoring functions based on the amount of traffic between nodes to determine which traffic paths are displayed. The scoring function may also be based on level weights. For example, each of the traffic paths going from nodes A to B to C may have a level weight of 1, whereas a path that traverses directly from A to C may have a level weight of 2.
- FIG. 2 is an illustration of an example visualization 200 of online traffic.
- visualization 200 displays a plurality of source nodes 216 (e.g., URL clusters, groups of demographics, groups of geographic locations, or any other grouping of information).
- source nodes 216 e.g., URL clusters, groups of demographics, groups of geographic locations, or any other grouping of information.
- a first source node may be an aggregate of social networking sites while a second source node may be an aggregate of search engines.
- Some or all of source nodes 216 may also include a grouping of URLs for a particular website.
- a particular website may include the following URLs:
- visualization 200 may aggregate these URLs into a single source node 216 labeled “Example.com.”
- Visualization 200 may include nodes that correspond to goals, according to some implementations.
- a goal may be a group of URLs associated with a certain action performed by users.
- a first goal 206 may be to view product categories on a particular website or set of websites.
- Goal 206 may be used to generate a node 220 , for example, by aggregating all URLs that display product information.
- a second goal 208 may be then to view a shopping cart, thereby indicating that a website visitor has added a product to their shopping cart.
- Goal 208 may be used to construct node 226 .
- a third goal 210 may be for users to login to the website and used to construct a node 232 .
- a fourth goal 212 may be for users to place an order and used to construct a node 238 .
- a fifth goal 214 may be for users to complete their orders and utilized to construct a node 244 .
- Visualization 200 may display traffic flow information between nodes.
- traffic paths 218 represent the flow of traffic from source nodes 216 to node 220 .
- visualization 200 may also provide indicia of the amount of traffic between nodes (e.g., by varying the appearance of traffic flows by traffic volume, by providing icons or text indicative of traffic volume, or by other ways of conveying the amount of traffic between nodes).
- traffic paths 218 are shown to vary in size in visualization 200 , thereby representing their different traffic volumes.
- traffic paths 224 , 230 , 236 , and 242 represent the flow of traffic from node 220 to 244 (e.g., through completion of a purchase) via nodes 226 , 232 , and 238 .
- the decreasing size of traffic paths 224 , 230 , 236 , and 242 in visualization 200 indicate that only a fraction of users that view products at node 220 actually complete a purchase at node 244 .
- Visualization 200 may show drop-off traffic flows.
- a drop-off traffic flow is one in which a user exits the process defined by goals 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 (e.g., by stopping their web browsing session, by leaving to visit a different retailer's website, etc.).
- drop-off traffic paths 222 , 228 , 234 , and 240 are attached to nodes 220 , 226 , 232 , 238 , respectively, to denote the flow of traffic away from each of these steps (e.g., that do not return to another node associated with a goal in visualization 200 ).
- drop-off traffic flows may include indicia that distinguishes them from other traffic flows (e.g., by applying a coloration, text or icon, etc.).
- drop-off traffic path 222 may be colored red to denote the flow of traffic away from the product description pages of node 220 (e.g., by going to a competitor's website, by stopping the shopping process, etc.).
- Visualization 200 may include source input 203 , according to some implementations.
- Source input 203 is configured to receive a selection of a source type for source nodes 216 .
- source nodes 216 may be of a different type of grouping than that of other nodes.
- nodes 220 , 226 , 232 , 238 , 244 may be groups of webpages, while source nodes 216 may be groups based on system information about the devices used to visit the webpages.
- Source types may include types of traffic sources (e.g., advertisement campaigns, referring websites, etc.), system information (e.g., web browser, operating system, installed programs, screen resolution, version information, etc.), types of geographic-related information (e.g., city, language, region, country, etc.), or any other way to group the network traffic data.
- a source type may also be user-defined. For example, source input 203 may receive a selection of multiple types, such as a selection of sources broken down by region and web browser.
- Visualization 200 may include time input 204 , according to some implementations.
- Time input 204 is configured to receive a selection of a time or date for which visualization 200 is to be generated.
- time input 204 may receive a selection of a date range that can be used to filter traffic information provided by visualization 200 .
- an advertiser may wish to view website traffic information around a certain holiday, to tailor an advertising campaign.
- time input 204 may be preset (e.g., the previous week, the previous month, a time period defined in a user's profile, etc.).
- Visualization 200 may include zoom input 205 , which receives a selection of a zoom level. For example, a user of visualization 200 may use zoom input 205 to zoom out, thereby showing more nodes. Zoom input 205 may also be used to zoom in, thereby focusing the display of visualization 200 on only a subset of nodes. Zoom input 205 may be one or more icons, a sliding bar, or other selectable area of visualization 200 .
- visualization 200 may include a connection selector 202 .
- Connection selector 202 receives a selection of an amount of traffic flows to be displayed on visualization 200 . As shown, connection selector 202 is set to display only a minimal amount of traffic flows on visualization 200 .
- Connection selector 202 may be an input field that receives a number of flows to display, one or more icons (e.g., an up and down arrow), a slide bar, or any other selectable area for receiving a selection on visualization 200 .
- FIG. 3 is an illustration of an example visualization 300 , showing more traffic flow connections than that of visualization 200 .
- Visualization 300 displays all of the same information as that of visualization 200 , except that connection selector 202 has been adjusted in visualization 300 to display more traffic flow connections than that of visualization 200 .
- traffic path 302 may be displayed in visualization 300 when connection selector 202 receives a command to increase the number of displayed traffic connections.
- Traffic path 302 differs from that of the traffic flows in visualization 200 in that it denotes a backwards traffic path.
- traffic path 302 may signify that a number of users return to view details about a second product, after adding a first product to their shopping carts (e.g., a user opts to continue shopping, instead of completing an order).
- This information may be pertinent to a user of visualization 300 , in certain situations.
- an online merchant may run a promotion where shipping is free when the total purchase price of an order is over a certain limit. Traffic path 302 allows the merchant to analyze how effective the promotion is at prompting customers to increase their orders.
- a scoring function may be used to control which traffic flows are displayed in visualization 300 .
- a scoring function may be based in part on the volume of traffic over a particular traffic flow and/or a level weight.
- data flow 224 may have a higher traffic weight factor than that of data flow 242 , since more users add items to their shopping carts than actually complete their purchases.
- a length weight factor may be defined to give greater priority to displaying certain traffic flows over others in visualization 300 .
- traffic flows that connect nodes from one level to the next along the levels of goals 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 may be given the highest length weight factors. Therefore, traffic flows that follow the steps defined by goals 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , and 214 may be displayed over other types of traffic flows. Traffic flows in the negative direction may be given lower length weight factors, to reduce the number of backwards traffic paths that may be displayed. For example, traffic path 302 may have a length of ⁇ 1, since traffic flowing in this direction moves away from the overall goal of a completed purchase, i.e., goal 214 . Traffic flows that also skip levels (“skips”) may be given other length weight factors. For example, traffic flowing from a source node 216 directly to node 232 may have a length of three, since it skips over two levels.
- the traffic weight factor for a particular traffic flow may be high enough to offset a lower length weight factor.
- traffic path 302 may have a lower length weight factor than that of traffic path 224 , since it flows in the opposite direction.
- the amount of traffic flowing back from node 226 to node 220 may be great enough to cause traffic path 302 to be displayed.
- Other backwards traffic paths that have less traffic may still be concealed from display, depending on the level of detail defined by connection selector 202 .
- a flow of traffic from node 232 to 226 may be concealed while traffic path 302 is displayed, since traffic path 302 has a much larger volume of traffic.
- FIG. 4 is an illustration of an example visualization 400 , showing more traffic flow connections than that of visualization 300 in FIG. 3 .
- Visualization 400 displays all of the same information as that of visualizations 200 and 300 , except that connection selector 202 has been adjusted in visualization 400 to display all traffic paths over which traffic flows between the nodes of visualization 400 . For example, backwards paths and skips may be shown in visualization 400 , even though they may have only a small volume of traffic. While only three settings of connection selector 202 are shown in FIGS. 2-4 , any number of different settings may be used to vary the number of displayed traffic flows.
- FIG. 5 is an illustration of an example visualization 500 showing traffic path information 504 .
- selection of a displayed node or traffic path may cause additional information about the node or traffic path to be displayed.
- a node or traffic path may be selected via a pointer 502 controlled by a pointing device (e.g., as a “hover-over” action, using a mouse click, etc.), via a touch-screen display, using a keypad, or using any other form of selection mechanism.
- additional information about the node or traffic path may be displayed. For example, additional information may be shown as a pop-up, in a separate window or tab, in a table, or using other forms of visual indicia in visualization 500 .
- traffic path information 504 may appear when drop-off traffic path 222 is selected using pointer 504 .
- Traffic path information 504 may include additional information about where traffic flows from node 220 that does not connect to another node in visualization 500 (e.g., information about the individual traffic paths that are aggregated to form drop-off traffic path 222 ).
- Traffic path information 504 may, for example, include information about traffic that leaves the website associated with node 220 entirely. Such traffic may be denoted as “exit” traffic, or the like, in traffic path information 504 . Traffic that stays within the website associated with node 220 , but outside of the webpages of the nodes of visualization 500 , may also be shown.
- some webpage visitors that view product information via a webpage in node 220 may navigate to a contact page (e.g., /shop.axd/contact).
- a contact page e.g., /shop.axd/contact
- Such a page may be within a vendor's website, but outside of the process defined for visualization 500 .
- Traffic path information 504 may include statistics about the traffic in drop-off traffic path 222 .
- traffic path information 504 may include information about the amount of traffic that navigates to a specific exit and/or the percentage of drop-off traffic that navigates to the particular exit.
- traffic path information 504 may indicate that 3.63% of drop-off traffic from node 220 navigates to a shopping home page for the website (e.g., /shop.axd/home).
- other statistics may be provided that incorporate the source type.
- traffic path information 504 may include a breakdown of users by region that drop off from the process shown in visualization 500 .
- FIG. 6 is an illustration of an example visualization 600 showing a selection of a source type.
- source input 203 may be used to receive a selection 602 of a source type.
- the traffic data used to generate visualization 600 may include any number of different metrics regarding users, user devices, network traffic patterns, etc.
- source nodes 604 are grouped based on the type of web browser used by the different users. Associated with source nodes 604 may also be statistics regarding the web browsers, such as the total number of users that use a particular web browser, the percentage of total users that use a particular web browser, or other similar statistics. For example, the number of users that access the various nodes in visualization 600 using the Android web browser is shown to be 1,230.
- System information such as the web browser used, may be relevant to the website operator and to others, to ensure that a visited website is optimized for certain web browsers.
- source nodes 604 may differ in type from the rest of the nodes in visualization 600 .
- source nodes 604 may be grouped by web browser, while node 220 may be a group of webpages (e.g., URLs, etc.) for one or more websites.
- nodes 220 , 226 , 232 , 238 , and 244 may also include indicia to denote the various groups of source nodes 604 flowing through the nodes.
- node 220 may include various colors, bars, etc., that denote the makeup of traffic through node 220 corresponding to the source type.
- node 220 may be colored red to denote those users that used an Internet Explorer web browser, while another portion of node 220 may be colored green to denote those users that used a Firefox web browser.
- Other forms of indicia may also be used, such as icons, text, images, or the like, to demarcate traffic through a node based on the selected source type.
- Traffic paths leading from source nodes in a visualization may also differ, depending on the source type.
- traffic paths 606 differs from those of traffic paths 218 in FIGS. 2-4 .
- Traffic paths 606 may vary in width to show the relative amount of traffic that arrives at node 220 using the various web browsers represented by source nodes 604 .
- non-source nodes e.g., nodes 220 , 226 , 232 , 238 , and 244
- traffic paths between such nodes may remain the same, even when the source type is changed via source input 203 . In this way, an interested party may view visualization 600 to determine which web browsers are most heavily used, while still being able to view the flow of traffic between the different levels of visualization 600 .
- FIG. 7 is an illustration of an example visualization 700 of online traffic showing source nodes 704 based on region.
- source input 203 has been used to receive a selection 602 of a region source type.
- Source region information may be determined, for example, through analysis of IP addresses, location data (e.g., via GPS, cellular triangulation, etc.), or other ways of determining the geographic location of an electronic device that accesses a webpage of a node.
- Traffic paths 706 may represent the traffic arriving at node 220 from the geographic regions of source nodes 704 . Similar to traffic paths 606 , traffic paths 706 may also differ based on the selected source type. In this way, information regarding where users reside can be conveyed via visualization 700 , as well as information regarding the network traffic between nodes 220 , 226 , 232 , 238 , and 244 .
- FIG. 8 is a flow diagram of an example process 800 to display network traffic data.
- process 800 may be performed by a server that aggregates network traffic data (e.g., performance analysis apparatus 120 in FIG. 1 , etc.).
- a server may utilize process 800 to generate a visualization of the network traffic and to provide visualization data to a user device.
- the network traffic data may first be downloaded to a user device that utilizes process 800 to analyze the traffic data (e.g., using one or more scripts, programs, or other routines running on the user device).
- Process 800 may include receiving a selection of steps in an online process and a selection of a source type (block 802 ).
- the online process may include any number of steps performed by a user navigating between one or more webpages.
- the steps may correspond to visiting a particular webpage or a group of webpages.
- a step in the online process may be “view product information” that corresponds to visiting any number of webpages that display product information.
- the selection of steps may also include a specific ordering of steps. For example, one step may be to view product information, followed by the step of adding a product to a shopping cart.
- the selection of a source type may include any way of classifying traffic data associated with the first step of the online process.
- a first step of an online process may be to view product details. Traffic information regarding visits to one or more webpages associated with viewing a product can then be classified by source type.
- the source traffic data may be classified by source webpage, system configuration, geographic information, etc.
- Process 800 may include retrieving data representative of nodes and traffic paths based in part on the selected steps and source type (block 804 ).
- nodes may be any grouping of data related to the network.
- nodes may be clusters of websites, URLs, servers, or other groups of content sources in the network.
- nodes may be grouped based on a plurality of factors.

- Traffic paths connect nodes and represent a grouping of network traffic between nodes.
- one node may be a cluster of URLs for www.example.com and a second node may be a cluster of URLs for www.example.org.
- a traffic path may connect node one to node two and a second traffic path may connect node two to node one.
- Process 800 may include determining a level for each node (block 806 ).
- a level correspond to the separation between nodes. For example, traffic that passes from nodes A to B to C traverses two levels, since it flows through two traffic paths: A to B and then from B to C. In such a case, node A may be assigned level 1, node B may be assigned to level 2, and node C may be assigned level 3.
- a node corresponding to the selected source type may be assigned to a start level. For example, source nodes may be assigned to a level 0, if node A is assigned to level 1.
- Process 800 may include generating visualization data (block 808 ).
- the visualization data may be configured to cause an electronic display to display two or more nodes and one or more traffic paths between the nodes based in part on the levels of the two or more nodes.
- at least one node is a source node that corresponds to the selected source type.
- the nodes in the visualization data may be unique, i.e., each node is displayed only once in a visualization.
- the visualization data may also be configured to cause the electronic display to display indicia of traffic that does not go to a node displayed in the visualization (e.g., flows of traffic that “drop off” from the process).
- the visualization data may be configured to cause the electronic display to display additional information about a node or traffic flow. For example, additional information about component webpages of a node, component traffic of a traffic path, or other metrics may be displayed.
- Process 800 may include providing the visualization data to an electronic device (block 810 ).
- the electronic device may be one or more electronic displays.
- a user device may receive network traffic data and use the received data to generate a visualization.
- the user device may provide the visualization data directly to the display.
- the visualization data may be generated by a server or other remote device and provided to a user device.
- the user device may use the visualization data to cause an electronic display to display the visualization.
