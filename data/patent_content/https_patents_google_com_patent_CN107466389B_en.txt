Description
Cross Reference to Related Applications
This application claims us provisional patent application No.62/155,357 filed on day 4/30 of 2015 and us provisional patent application No.62/237,750 filed on day 6/10 of 2015, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Background
Small-screen computing devices continue to proliferate, such as smart phones and computing bracelets, finger rings, and watches. Like many computing devices, these small-screen devices typically use a virtual keyboard to interact with the user. On these small screens, however, many people find it difficult to interact through a virtual keyboard, as this often results in slow and inaccurate input. This frustrates users and limits the applicability of small-screen computing devices. This problem is partially solved by screen-based gesture recognition techniques. However, due to the size of these screens, these screen-based gestures still face a number of usability problems.
To address this problem, optical finger and hand tracking technology has been developed that enables gesture tracking that is not performed on the screen. However, these optical techniques are large, expensive, or inaccurate, thereby limiting their usefulness in solving usability problems for small screen computing devices.
Moreover, control by gestures continues to proliferate for other devices and uses, such as medium to large distances. People want to control not only devices close to them, but also those at moderate to large distances, such as controlling stereo across rooms, thermostats in different rooms, or televisions several meters away.
Disclosure of Invention
Techniques and apparatus for type-agnostic Radio Frequency (RF) signal representation are described herein. These techniques and apparatus enable the use of multiple different types of radar systems and fields through a standard set of type-agnostic RF signal representations. By doing so, the identification and application layer analysis may be independent of various radar parameters that differ between different radar systems and fields.
Through the use of these techniques and devices, a wide range of gestures can be used, both in terms of the size of the gesture and the distance from the radar sensor. Even a single device, for example, with different radar systems, may recognize these gestures using gesture analysis that is independent of the different radar systems. Sitting on a sofa to control a television, standing in a kitchen to control an oven or refrigerator, a few centimeters from a small screen display of a computing watch to control gestures of a person applying, or even walking out of a room to cause the lights to turn off-all of which can be recognized without building type-specific recognition and application layer analysis.
This summary is provided to introduce simplified concepts related to type-agnostic representation of RF signals, which are further described below in the detailed description.

Detailed Description
Overview
Techniques and apparatus to enable type-agnostic RF signal representation are described herein. These techniques and devices enable large-amplitude motions and gestures induced by different radar types or venues, such as gestures to use, control, and interact with various devices from smart phones to refrigerators. The techniques and apparatus are able to do so without the need to build type-specific recognition and application-level analytics.
Consider fig. 1, which illustrates an example environment 100 in which techniques to enable type-agnostic RF signal representation may be embodied. Environment 100 includes different type-specific radar systems 102, shown with some number from 1 to N systems, labeled as type-specific radar systems 102-1, 102-2, and 102-N. These type-specific radar systems 102 may include various types of radar systems capable of providing a wide variety of radar fields, such as single tone (tone), stepped frequency modulation, chirp, impulse, or chirp.
Each of these type-specific radar systems 102 provides a different radar field through a different structure or different operation of radar-emitting elements 104 (shown as 104-1, 104-2, and 104-N). These radar fields may be different from those noted herein and may have different modulations, frequencies, amplitudes, or phases. Each of these type-specific radar systems 102 also includes an antenna element 106 and, in some cases, a preprocessor 108, each labeled as antenna element 106-1, 106-2, and 106-N and preprocessor 108-1, 108-2, and 108-N, respectively.
Each of these type-specific radar systems 102 transmits radar to provide a radar field 110, and subsequently receives reflected signals 112 from objects moving in the radar field 110. Here, three human hands are shown, each performing a different gesture, a hand shake gesture 114, a box shake gesture 116 ("Yes" for American Symbolic Language (ASL) gestures), and a finger pinch gesture 118, although the techniques are not limited to human hands or gestures.
As shown, each of the type-specific radar systems 102 provides type-specific raw data 120 in response to receiving a reflected signal 112 (only one system shows receiving a reflected signal 112 for visual clarity). Each of the type-specific radar systems 102 provides type-specific raw data 120, shown as raw data 120-1, 120-2, and 120-N, for each system accordingly. Each of these raw data 120 may be, but need not be, raw digital samples for which pre-processing has been performed by the type-specific radar system 102 pre-processor 108.
These type-specific raw data 120 are received by abstraction module 122. In general, abstraction module 122 transforms each of the different types of type-specific raw data 120 into type-agnostic signal representations 124, shown as type-agnostic signal representations 124-1, 124-2, and 124-N, respectively for each of the type-specific raw data 120-1, 120-2, and 120-N. These type-agnostic signal representations 124 are then received by an identification module 126. In general, the recognition module 126 determines a gesture 128 or action of an object within a respective two or more different radar fields for each of the type-agnostic signal representations 124. Each of these gestures 128 is shown as gestures 128-1, 128-2, and 128-N, respectively for each of the type-agnostic signal representations 124-1, 124-2, and 124-N. With the determined gestures 128 or actions, the recognition module 126 passes each gesture 128 or action to another entity, such as an application executing on the device, to control the application. Note that in some cases a single gesture or action is determined for multiple different raw data 120, and thus multiple different types of agnostic signal representations 124, such as where two radar systems or fields are simultaneously used to sense motion of a person in different radar fields. The functionality and capabilities of abstraction module 122 are described in more detail as part of fig. 2 and the functionality and capabilities of recognition module 126 are described in more detail as part of fig. 3.
Example abstraction Module
Fig. 2 illustrates an example of abstraction module 122 of fig. 1. Abstraction module 122 receives one or more of the type-specific raw data 120 and outputs a type-agnostic signal representation 124-1, 124-2 through 124-N for each of the raw data 120-1, 120-2 through 120-N, respectively. In some cases, the raw data 120 is first processed by a raw signal processor 202 configured to provide a complex signal based on the type-specific raw data 120, wherein the complex signal contains amplitude and phase information from which the phase of the type-specific raw data 120 can be extracted and unwrapped. For impulse radar (a low power ultra-wideband radar type), examples of processing types include smooth bandpass filtering and hilbert transform. Processing for frequency modulated continuous wave (FM-CW) radar includes window filtering and fast-time fourier transform (FFT). Further, the processing of the raw signal processor 202 may be configured as a pulse shape filter and a pulse compression Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) radar.
Whether processed by the raw signal processor 202 or received as type-specific raw data 120, the signal transformer 204 is used to transform the raw data (processed, etc.) into the type-agnostic signal representation 124. In general, the signal transformer is configured to model the object captured by the raw data as a set of scattering centers, where each of the set of scattering centers has a reflectivity that depends on a shape, size, aspect, or material of the object that is moved to perform the gesture or action. To do so, the signal transformer 204 may extract object properties and dynamics from the type-specific raw data 120 as a function of fast-time (e.g., with each acquisition) and slow-time (e.g., with multiple acquisitions) or transient or late Electromagnetic (EM) responses of the set of scattering centers.
This is illustrated with four example transformations, which may be used alone or in combination. These include transforming the data into a range-doppler-time profile 206, a range-time profile 208, a micro-doppler profile 210, and a fast-spectrogram 212. The range doppler timeline 206 resolves scattering centers in the range and velocity dimensions. The range timeline profile 208 is a time history of ranges. The micro-doppler profile 210 is a profile of the time history of doppler. Fast spectrogram 212 identifies frequency/target dependent signal fading and resonances. Each of these transformations is a type-agnostic signal representation, although the type-agnostic signal representation 124 may include one or more of each.
Example gesture Module
As noted above, the functionality and capabilities of the identification module 126 are described in more detail as part of FIG. 3. As shown, fig. 3 illustrates an example of the recognition module 126 of fig. 1, which includes a feature extractor 302 and a gesture recognizer 304. In general, the recognition module 126 receives the type-agnostic signal representations 124 (shown with 1-to-N signal representations, although as few as one may be received and recognized) and determines gestures or actions of objects within the respective different types of type-specific radar fields from which the type-agnostic signal representations 124 are determined based on the type-agnostic signal representations 124. More specifically, feature extractor 302 is configured to extract type-agnostic features, such as signal transformations, engineering features, computer vision features, machine learning features, or inferred target features.
More specifically, gesture recognizer 304 is configured to determine an action or gesture performed by an object, such as a gesture to walk out of a room, sit, or change channels, turn off a media player, or turn off an oven. To do so, the gesture recognizer 304 may determine gesture classification, motion parameter tracking, regression estimation, or gesture probability based on the type-agnostic signal representation 124 or the extracted features from the feature extractor 302. Gesture recognizer 304 may also map gesture 128 to a pre-configured control gesture associated with a control input to application and/or device 306. The recognition module 126 then passes each determined gesture 128 (shown as a 1-to-N gesture, although as few as one may be determined) for effective control of the application and/or device 306, such as controlling or altering a user interface on a display, a function or capability of the device. As shown in fig. 1, these gestures may include gestures of a human hand, such as a hand gesture 114, a fist gesture 116, and a finger gesture 118, to name a few.
As noted above, the technique for determining a type-agnostic RF signal representation allows identification and application-layer analysis to be independent of various radar parameters that differ between different radar systems and fields. This makes few or none of the elements of fig. 3 specific to a particular radar system. Thus, the identification module 126 need not be specific to a radar field type or be constructed to accommodate one or even any type of radar field. Further, the application and/or device 306 need not require application layer analysis. The identification module 126, as well as the application and/or device 306, may thus be universally applicable to many different types of radar systems and fields.
Turning now to an example computing device, therein a type-agnostic RF signal representation may be used, followed by an example method and an example radar field, ending with an example computing system.
Example computing device
Fig. 4 illustrates a computing device through which type-agnostic RF signal representation may be enabled. Computing device 402 is illustrated as various non-limiting example devices, desktop computer 402-1, computing watch 402-2, smartphone 402-3, tablet 402-4, computing ring 402-5, computing glasses 402-6, and microwave 402-7, although other devices may also be used, such as home automation and control systems, entertainment systems, audio systems, other home appliances, security systems, notebooks, automobiles, and e-readers. Note that the computing device 402 may be wearable, non-wearable but mobile, or relatively non-mobile (e.g., desktop and appliance).
Computing device 402 includes one or more computer processors 404 and computer-readable media 406, which include memory media and storage media. An application and/or operating system (not shown) embodied as computer-readable instructions on computer-readable medium 406 may be executed by processor 404 to provide some of the functionality described herein. The computer-readable medium 406 also includes the abstraction module 122 and the recognition module 126, and may also include each of their optional components, the raw signal processor 202, the signal transformer 204, the feature extractor 302, and the gesture recognizer 304 (as described above).
The computing device 402 may also include one or more network interfaces 408 for communicating data over wired, wireless, or optical networks and a display 410. By way of example, and not limitation, network interface 408 may communicate data over a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), a Personal Area Network (PAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), an intranet, the internet, a peer-to-peer network, a point-to-point network, a mesh network, and so forth. The display 410 may be integrated with or associated with the computing device 402, such as with the desktop computer 402-1.
Computing device 402 is also shown to include one or more type-specific radar systems 102 from fig. 1. As noted, these type-specific radar systems 102 each provide different types of radar fields 110, whether by different types of radar-emitting elements 104 or using different manners of just one type of radar-emitting element 104, and thus provide different types of raw data 120.
More specifically, different types of radar fields 110 may include continuous wave and pulsed radar systems, as well as fields for closed or far identification, or for line-of-sight or occluded use. Pulse radar systems typically have shorter transmit times and higher peak powers and include both impulse and chirped radar systems. The pulsed radar system has a time-of-flight based range and a frequency shift based velocity. Chirped radar systems have a range based on time of flight (pulse compression) and a velocity based on frequency shift. Continuous wave radar systems typically have relatively longer transmit times and lower peak powers. These continuous wave radar systems include single tone, chirp (FM) and step FM types. Single tone radar systems have a limited range based on phase and a speed based on frequency shift. Linear FM radar systems have a range based on frequency shift and a velocity that is also based on frequency shift. A stepping FM radar system has a range based on phase or time of flight and a velocity based on frequency shift. Although these five types of radar systems are mentioned here, other types, such as sinusoidal modulation scheme radar systems, may also be used.
These radar fields 110 may vary from small sizes, such as one to fifty millimeters, to half a meter to five meters, to even one to about thirty meters. In larger size fields, the antenna element 106 may be configured to receive and process reflections of the radar field to provide large body gestures based on reflections from human tissue caused by body, arm, or leg motion, although smaller and more precise gestures may also be sensed. Example large-sized radar fields include those in which a user makes a gesture to control a television from a couch, change songs or volume from stereo across a room, turn off an oven or oven timer (near field would also be useful), turn on or off lights in a room, and so forth.
It is also noted that type-specific radar system 102 may be used with or embedded in many different computing devices or peripherals, such as in a wall at home to control home appliances and systems (e.g., an auto control panel), in an automobile to control internal functions (e.g., volume, cruise control, or even driving an automobile), or as an accessory to a laptop to control computing applications on the laptop.
Radar emitting element 104 may be configured to provide narrow or wide radar fields, including a full continuous field radar field as opposed to a beam scanning radar field, from a short distance (if any) from the computing device or its display. Radar-emitting element 104 may be configured to provide the various types of radar set forth above. Antenna element 106 is configured to receive reflections of the radar field or induce interactions in the radar field. In some cases, the reflections include reflections from human tissue within the radar field, such as movement of a hand or arm. Antenna element 106 may include one or many antennas or sensors, such as an array of radiation sensors, the number in the array based on the desired resolution and whether the field is surface or volume.
Example method
FIG. 5 depicts a method 500 of recognizing gestures and actions using type-agnostic RF signal representations. Method 500 receives type-specific raw data from one or more different types of radar fields, then transforms these type-specific raw data into a type-agnostic signal representation, which is then used to determine gestures or actions within the respective different radar fields. The method is shown as a collection of blocks that specify operations performed, but is not necessarily limited to the order or combination shown for performing the operations of the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion, reference may be made to the environment 100 of FIG. 1 and as specifically described in FIG. 2 or 3, the reference to which is by way of example only. The techniques are not limited to execution by an entity or entities operating on a device.
More specifically, method 500 receives, at 502, different types of type-specific raw data representing two or more reflected signals. The two or more different reflected signals, as noted above, each reflect from an object moving in each of two or more different radar fields. These reflected signals may be received at the same or nearly the same time for one motion in two radar fields, or two different motions in two different fields at different times. These different movements and times may include, for example, micro-movements of two fingers to control a smart watch and large gestures to control stereo in another room, as well as one movement done today and the other yesterday. Although different types of radar systems are illustrated in fig. 1, different radar fields may be provided by even the same radar system following two or more modulation schemes.
By way of example, consider four different radar fields 110, shown in radar fields 602, 604, 606, 610, and 612 of FIG. 6. Although it is difficult to show differences in granularity levels, etc., of modulation schemes, fig. 6 illustrates some of the different applications of these radar fields from near to far and from high to low resolution, etc. Radar fields 602, 604, and 606 include three similar radar fields for detecting user actions and gestures, such as walking into or out of a room, making a large gesture to operate a game on a television or computer, and a small gesture to control a thermostat or oven. Radar field 608 shows a smaller field for the other hand of the user not wearing the watch to control the computing watch. Radar field 610 shows a non-volumetric radar field for control of a hand of a user wearing a computing watch. Radar field 612 shows a medium sized radar field enabling control of a computer approximately 1/2 to 3 meters away.
These radar fields 602-612 enable a user to perform complex or simple gestures with his or her arm, body, finger(s), hand(s) (or device such as a stylus) interrupting the radar field. Example gestures include many gestures that may be used with current touch-sensitive displays, such as swipe, pinch between two fingers, extend, rotate, tap, and so forth. Other complex or although simple, three-dimensional gestures may also be enabled, examples include many symbolic language gestures, such as those in the American Symbolic Language (ASL) and other symbolic languages worldwide. Several examples of these are: shake the fist up and down, indicating "Yes" (Yes) in ASL; open index finger and middle finger move to connect open thumb, representing "No" (No); the spreader hand moves one step up, representing "forward" (Advance); the flat and angled hand moves up and down, representing "Afternoon" (Afternoon); gripping the fingers and opening the thumb to move to the opening fingers and open thumb, representing a "taxi" (taxi); the index finger moves up in a generally vertical direction, representing "up" (up), and so on. These are but a few of the many gestures that can be sensed and mapped to a particular device or application, such as a forward gesture to skip another song on a web-based station application, the next song on a compact disc playing on stereo, or the next page or image in a file or album on a computer display or digital picture frame.
Returning to FIG. 5, at 504, the method 500 transforms each of the different types of type-specific raw data into a type-agnostic signal representation. As noted above, these transformations may be performed by determining a range Doppler time profile 506, determining a range time profile 508, determining a micro Doppler profile 510, and determining a fast spectrogram 512. These are described in more detail as part of the description of fig. 2.
At 514, the method 500 determines, for each of the two or more type-agnostic signal representations created at operation 504, a gesture or action of an object within a respective two or more different radar fields.
Note that the object that moves in each of the two or more different radar fields may be the same object that performs the same action. In such a case, two different types of radar fields are used to improve gesture recognition, robustness, resolution, and so on. Thus, the gesture or action performed to determine the motion of the object is in this case simultaneously based on two or more type-agnostic signal representations.
At 516, the method 500 passes each of the determined gestures or actions to an application or device in order to effectively control or alter a display, function, or capability associated with the application.
Example computing System
Fig. 7 illustrates various components of an example computing system 700 that can be implemented as any type of client, server, and/or computing device as described above in connection with previous fig. 1-6 to implement a type-agnostic RF signal representation.
The computing system 700 includes a communication device 702 that enables wired and/or wireless communication of device data 704 (e.g., received data, data being received, data scheduled for broadcast, data packets of data, etc.). The device data 704 or other device content can include configuration settings of the device, media content stored on the device, and/or information associated with a user of the device (e.g., the identity of the actor performing the gesture). Media content stored on computing system 700 can include one or more data inputs 706 via which any type of data, media content, and/or inputs can be received, such as human speech, interaction with radar fields, user-selectable inputs (explicit or implicit), messages, music, television media content, recorded video content, and any other type of audio, video, and/or image data received from any content and/or data source.
