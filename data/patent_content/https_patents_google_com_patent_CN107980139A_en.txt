The system carries out skeletonizing to identify the curvature of line segment to each connection component on text image.The system estimation
Maximum flexion and elimination in curved section determine linear vertical line segment beyond the curve of threshold value.If it is present
The tropic through remaining point produces V- line elements.
The Systematic selection H- line elements pair and V- line elements are to (step 306).In some embodiments, the system is random
Ground selects line element.In some other embodiments, line element selection is not completely random.For example, the system can be based on
Line segment length performs the descending sort to the set of line element, and preceding 20 hundredths of the set from line element are randomly chosen
First line element and from preceding 50 hundredths select the second line element.The system is using the H- line elements to determining horizontal end point
And using the V- line elements to determining vertical end point.
The system comes calculated level and vertical end point (step 308) by using the line element of selection.Horizontal end point
It is the point that all H- line elements meet or intersect when H- line elements are extrapolated and either extend to infinite by the system.Vertical end point
It is the point that all V- line elements meet or intersect when V- line elements are extrapolated and either extend to infinite by the system.End point is line
The function of first vector pair.Corresponding end point is the crosspoint of the two line elements,Wherein,It is end point,
It is the line element in online member set,It is the different line elements in identical line element set, and " x " representation vector multiplication cross.
For example, the system can use model --- such as random sampling uniformity (RANSAC) model --- to determine end point.
The system can also reevaluate end point by using weighted least squares regression.
The system is extrapolated to by performing homography matrix by V- line elements and H- line elements infinite to recover in text diagram
