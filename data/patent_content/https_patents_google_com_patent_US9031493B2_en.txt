- FIG. 2 is a high-level diagram illustrating a user device 200 configured to record and play back synchronized narrations in accordance with some embodiments.
- the user device 200 includes an electronic book reader 210 , a network interface 120 , and a data store 116 .
- the electronic book reader 210 includes a display module 212 , a recording module 214 , a correlation module 216 , and a playback module 218 .
- an electronic book is obtained by a user and retained in the user device's 200 local data store 116 .
- One method by which the electronic book is obtained is via network interface 120 , which enables the user device 200 to interact with online book vendors and repositories such as GOOGLE BOOKSTM and GOOGLE EBOOKSTORETM.
- the electronic book can be copied to the data store 116 from portable computer readable media such as a FLASHTM drive, compact disc (CD) or digital versatile disc (DVD).
- the electronic book is accessed by the electronic book reader 210 directly from a remote storage source via the network interface 120 .
- the synchronized narration of the electronic book is provided by the book vendor. Users either purchase the electronic book with a synchronized narration or download it later as an add-on. In this way users can choose between many different professionally recorded narrations. Synchronized narrations need not be provided by a single narrator. For example, in some instances each character in an electronic book is read by a different voice actor, with another voice actor providing the general narration.
- DRM is used to ensure that an electronic book reader 210 will only play a specific synchronized narration if the user has purchased the right to do so.
- a flat fee (on top of the electronic book purchase price) is charged for the right to use synchronized narrations with an electronic book.
- the synchronized narration is user generated. Synchronized narrations can be recorded locally on the same device that they will ultimately be played back on, or transferred via network interface 120 to another user device 200 .
- a parent records a synchronized narration for a child on a user device 200 during the day and then at bedtime the child plays the narration back on the same user device 200 .
- a parent who is away from home sends it to their child via email.
- a plurality of a child's relatives record synchronized narrations for a particular electronic book. Every time a child reads the electronic book they select which synchronized narration to listen to.
- user generated synchronized narrations are shared for download via the internet, either free of charge or for a price.
- the quality of a synchronized narration is obtained by crowd-sourcing. For example, users who have downloaded a particular synchronized narration are asked to give it a star rating out of 5. Alternatively, “+1” voting is used to determine the popularity of the synchronized narration.
- users are able to vote on and/or rate the individual parts.
- Users may “mix and match” character parts from different narrations, e.g., if a first synchronized narration has a higher rating for a first character and a second synchronized narration has a higher rating for a second character, the user is given the option of downloading the higher rated readings of each character and combining them into a new synchronized narration.
- the electronic book reader 210 is software running on the user device 200 that configures the user device 200 to display and manipulate electronic books stored as one or more data files in the local data store 116 and/or accessed via the network interface 120 .
- the display module 212 reads electronic book data files responsive to user selection of a specific electronic book and presents the content described therein to the user on the graphics display 110 of the user device 200 .
- the illustrated electronic book reader 210 operates in two modes; recording and playback.
- user devices e.g., user device 200
- these modes are provided separately with a first group of user devices configured to record synchronized narrations and a second group of user devices configured for synchronized narration playback.
- a user of user device 200 opens an electronic book for display by the display module 212 .
- the recording module 214 then directs the user to read the electronic book aloud.
- the recording module 214 records the narrator reading aloud using audio input device 126 .
- the recording of the narrator will generally contain one or more additional utterances, corresponding to the narrator deviating from the written text, for example by repeating a word for emphasis, commenting on an illustration, misreading a word, coughing, describing a word or phrase, or in any other way in which the narrator decides to elaborate on the written text.
- the display module 212 is configured to automatically turn to the next page when the end of the current page is reached. In alternative embodiments, the display module waits for user input before changing page, or allows the user to toggle between automatic and manual page turning.
- the recording module 214 directs the narrator to read specific segments of the electronic book for which narration is required.
- the order in which the narrator is directed to read the segments of the electronic book need not make sense to the narrator, but nevertheless ensures a portion of narration is recorded that corresponds to every segment of text.
- the correlation module 216 compares the recording of the narrator to the digital text of the electronic book and correlates portions of the recording with segments of the digital text. The correlation module 216 also determines which portion(s) of the recording correspond to additional utterances made by the narrator. The correlation module 216 then determines correlations between each additional utterance and a corresponding component of the electronic book. Components to which an additional utterance can correspond include illustrations, page breaks, chapter breaks, portions of digital text, and positions in the digital text. This may be implemented in a variety of ways.
- correlations between components and additional utterances are determined by a logical analysis of the electronic book, the recording of the narrator, and any previously determined correlations (e.g., correlating an additional utterance to an illustration is favored over other possible correlations if the additional utterance is identified to include a key-word such as, “see”, “look”, “picture”, or “drawing”).
- the narrator is asked to manually assign additional utterances to components after the recording of the narration is complete.
- a logical analysis is used to determine likely correlations between each additional utterance and a component of the electronic book and the narrator is prompted to confirm or override each correlation.
- the recording of the narrator is made by the recording module 214 and the correlation data determined by the correlation module 216 are stored in data store 116 for later access by the playback module 218 .
- the recording of the narrator and the correlation data are sent to an online repository, such as a cloud server, using the network interface 120 .
- the correlation data and the recording of the narrator are stored in a manner which enables the playback module 218 to be aware of the association between them.
- the correlation data is stored as time-stamp metadata within an audio file containing the recording of the narrator.
- the correlation data is stored as a separate file in the same directory as the file containing the recording, with the same file name but a different file extension.
- the recording and correlation data are stored in independent files and the correlation module 216 creates a resource association file which informs the playback module 218 where to find all the data required.
- a user of user device 200 When operating in playback mode, a user of user device 200 opens an electronic book for which a synchronized narration has previously been recorded.
- the display module 212 displays the electronic book and the playback module 218 loads the narration and correlation data. Responsive to user input, the playback module 218 plays the synchronized narration back.
- the playback module 218 interacts with the display module 212 to provide visual indicia of the correlations stored in the correlation data. For example, in one embodiment, the display module 212 highlights each word as it is played back. When an additional utterance is played back, the component that was previously determined to correspond to the additional utterance is highlighted. In another embodiment a karaoke style bouncing ball performs the same function.
- the embodiments described above have recording and playback occurring separately, but this is not a requirement.
- the correlation data and recording of the narrator are sent in real time to a playback module 218 of a second user device (not shown), via the network interface 120 .
- the correlation data is used by the display module 212 of user device 200 to generate visual indicia in real time, in which case playback of the recording is not required.
- One exemplary use of this is a parent reading a book to a child, with the electronic book reader 210 automatically providing a visual indication of the segment of the book being read to help the child “read along.”
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating the high-level steps of a method 300 , used in exemplary embodiments, for creating a synchronized narration of an electronic book.
- the method begins by obtaining a portion of a recording of a narrator reading an electronic book aloud (step 310 ).
- the correlation module 216 uses a speech to text algorithm to determine whether the portion correlates with an expected segment of the electronic book's body text (step 320 ).
- the first portion of the recorded narration is expected to correspond to the first word (or first syllable) of the electronic book's body text.
- the portion of the recorded narration is expected to correspond to a segment of the electronic book's body text that immediately follows the last segment for which a correlation was determined.
- correlations are found between portions and segments that are whole words.
- correlations with the electronic book's body text are determined syllable by syllable. Specific applications may require determining correlations for coarser or finer divisions of the body text and recorded narration.
- this correlation is stored (step 360 ).
- the correlation can be stored as time-stamp metadata within the narration recording, or as correlation data in a separate file, with the correlation and narration recording files linked by a common file name or an entry in a resource association file.
- a correlation algorithm is used to determine a correlation between the portion and a component of the electronic book (step 330 ).
- the correlation module 216 continues to search through portions of the audio recording of the narration until it finds a portion that does correspond with the expected segment.
- the correlation module 216 then combines all the portions between the previously correlated portion and the portion correlating with the expected segment into a single uncorrelated portion and runs the correlation algorithm a single time for the combined uncorrelated portion.
- the order in which all the text on a page is to be read may not be clear, or may even be optional. For example, books for young children often have text scattered across the page and the specific order that the text is read in is often not important.
- the electronic book considers all the text on the page as “expected segments” when checking for correlations during step 320 .
- the electronic book contains a suggested order and if the narrator chooses a different order the correlation data generated in step 330 is used to override the suggested order.
- the correlation module 216 checks the previous and next pages for correlations, as a narrator that knows the electronic book well may skip ahead and back over a page break.
- the result is checked for error conditions (step 340 ). If no error was reported the correlation is stored and the method loops back to the beginning (step 360 ). The method then obtains a new portion of the audio recording of the narration to correlate (step 310 ). In the embodiment shown the method ends if an error is reported (step 350 and the narrator must begin again. In other embodiments, the error is reported to the narrator and managed before the method returns to 310 to continue looping.
- the narrator indicates which component of the electronic book they are narrating as they record the narration. For example, the narrator selects a paragraph by tapping it on a touch screen and then reads the paragraph aloud. The narrator then wishes to record a narration corresponding to an illustration, so they tap the illustration and then record their narration for that component.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary correlation algorithm 400 in one embodiment.
- the correlation algorithm 400 begins by determining if the portion correlates with an earlier segment of the electronic book's body text (step 410 ).
- a threshold is used to determine how far back from the current position in the text (the current position being just after the last segment of text for which a correlation was determined) to search for a segment that corresponds with the portion. For example, the narrator is likely to repeat an important word or phrase for emphasis, but it is unlikely they will jump back several pages. If a correlation is determined, the correlation is stored (step 360 ) and the algorithm 400 ends.
- the algorithm 400 continues and attempts to determine a correlation between the portion and an illustration (step 420 ).
- the algorithm 400 considers the current position in the text and searches for illustrations that are spatially proximal on the electronic book page. If one or more illustrations are found, the portion is assumed to correlate with the illustration that is spatially closest to the current position. This correlation is then stored (step 360 ) and the algorithm 400 ends.
- existing correlations between other portions and a specific illustration are also considered by the algorithm 400 in determining whether the portion correlates with the specific illustration. For example, in one such embodiment each illustration is only allowed to correlate with one portion of the audio recording of the narration.
- the algorithm 400 continues and attempts to determine whether the portion correlates to a chapter break (step 430 ). This is a simple test as to whether the last segment correlated is at the end of a chapter. If a chapter break is found and thereby a correlation determined, the correlation is stored (step 360 ) and the algorithm 400 ends.
- the ability to correlate a portion of a narration with chapter breaks is likely to be of particular interest to a parent who is recording a narration for their child as “bedtime reading.”
- the parent can record an end of chapter message such as, “That's enough for tonight, time for bed!”
- the electronic book reader 210 is configured not to allow playback to continue past such a message until a set time, e.g., the next night's bedtime.
- a parent can override this with specific instructions, such as by entering a password.
- the algorithm 400 continues and attempts to determine a correlation between the portion and a later segment of the electronic book's body text (step 440 ). Starting with the current position, the algorithm 400 steps forward through the text one segment at a time, checking for a correlation with the portion. A threshold value is used to determine how far ahead of the current position to search for a correlation. For example, a narrator is likely to skip a word or line, or even a whole page when traversing a page break; but they are unlikely to skip several pages.
- a correlation is determined between the portion and a later segment, then an error is reported (step 350 ). In some embodiments this error is reported to the narrator visually (e.g., a flashing red light) and the narrator chooses how to respond. If the narrator continues to narrate, the correlation module 216 assumes the segment was skipped intentionally, stores the correlation with the later segment (step 360 ), and continues to determine and store correlations from the newly determined current position. Alternatively, the narrator elects via user input to re-record the narration from a point before the skipped segment.
- the error condition times out if the narrator does not elect to re-record within a pre-determined time of the error being generated (e.g., 10 seconds). In other embodiments, the recording module 214 automatically stops recording and instructs the narrator to begin re-recording at a point before the skipped segment that generated the error.
- the algorithm 400 assumes that the portion corresponds to the current position (step 450 ).
- the narrator may have expanded on the section just read with a personal example such as, “Do you remember when we saw the lions at the zoo? They were big and scary!” or they may have described the meaning of a long or unusual word.
- This correlation is stored (step 360 ) and the algorithm ends.
- the display module 212 provides user interface controls for the narrator to override a determined correlation between a portion of the recorded narration and a component of the electronic book. For example, if the correlation module 216 determines that the portion corresponds to first illustration on a page, but the narrator was actually talking about a second illustration, the narrator may reassign the portion to be correlated with the second illustration. In this case, the stored correlation data is removed and replaced with the new narrator-determined correlation data. In one such embodiment, the narrator performs reassignments as part of an editing process after completing the initial narration.
- the narrator dynamically performs reassignments during the narration process, for example by tapping the component to which the portion should correspond immediately after the incorrect correlation has been determined. In this manner, an experienced narrator can reassign incorrectly correlated portions without pausing the narration process.
- controls are provided for the narrator to delete portions of the recorded narration. For example, if the narrator accidentally reads a line twice they can delete the repeated portion without having to re-record any part of the narration.
- user controls are provided for the narrator to re-record portions of the recorded narration. For example, the narrator may have read the correct words in a paragraph but not be happy with the delivery of a particular sentence. The system therefore allows the narrator to replace the sentence they are not satisfied with without having to re-record the rest of the paragraph.
- the system prompts them to record narrations for additional components such as illustrations and chapter breaks. This is particularly useful for children's books in which there are many illustrations for which a parent may wish to provide commentary. In this way, a highly interactive electronic book narration can be created in which all (or most) of the components of the electronic book have an associated narration portion.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating a method 500 used in an exemplary embodiment for the playback of a synchronized narration.
- a user opens an electronic book for which a synchronized narration has been previously created in an electronic book reader 210 (step 510 ).
- the user is queried as to whether they wish to read the book with or without the synchronized narration, in another embodiment the synchronized narration is automatically used.
- additional parameters may be selected by the user, such as: choosing a particular narrator, choosing whether to include portions of the narration that do not correspond to the body text of the electronic book, and enabling/disabling the use of additional voices for specific characters as well as the narrator's voice.
- the playback module 218 of electronic book reader 210 loads the relevant recorded audio narration portions and associated correlation data that makes up the synchronized narration from the data store 116 (step 520 ).
- the playback module 218 begins playback of the synchronized narration (step 530 ).
- the display module 212 uses the correlation data to provide visual indicia of the segment or other electronic book component to which the portion corresponds.
- each word becomes highlighted as it is read and other components are similarly highlighted as corresponding portions of the narration are played.
- a corresponding illustration is outlined in the highlight color
- a chapter break will comprise a visual marker that becomes highlighted once reached, and a repeated word will be re-highlighted in a different color to add emphasis.
- portions that were determined to correlate with a position in the text are indicated by a flashing icon on the display of user device 200 .
- a karaoke style bouncing ball is used to indicate the correlations between portions of the audio narration and segments of the electronic book's body text.
- the order in which the synchronized narration should be played back is not clear.
- a number of different options for determining playback order are possible, including: an order specified in the electronic book, an order specified by the narrator, and user selection of components causing playback of narration corresponding with that component. For example, when the user selects a paragraph, just the portions of the synchronized narration that correlate with that paragraph will play back, and then playback will stop until the user selects another component, such as a proximal illustration.
- Different embodiments provide different subsets of playback order selection options, depending on factors such as the intended group of users and intended type of electronic book.
- a portable computer 600 e.g., a tablet computer running the ANDROIDTM operating system
- a touch screen 601 e.g., a touch screen 601 , a microphone 602 , and a front-facing camera 603 .
- a portable computer 600 e.g., a tablet computer running the ANDROIDTM operating system
- a touch screen 601 e.g., a touch screen 601 , a microphone 602 , and a front-facing camera 603 .
- a microphone 602 e.g., a microphone 602
- a front-facing camera 603 e.g., a front-facing camera 603 .
- such devices currently available typically also provide rear facing cameras, accelerometers, GPS receivers, Wi-Fi and advanced cellular communications capabilities, and various other features.
- the portable computer 600 is running electronic book reader software 210 configured to act both as a recording device and a playback device.
- the reader software 210 is displaying one page of an electronic book on the touch screen 601 .
- the page shown includes body text 610 , an illustration 615 , and an in-line marker 614 indicating the narration contains one or more additional utterances that were determined to correspond to that position in the body text.
- Some segments of the body text 610 are highlighted, indicating that portions of the synchronized narration corresponding to those segments have already been played back.
- the last word highlighted 612 corresponds to the portion of the synchronized narration currently being played back.
- the segment corresponding to the currently playing portion of the synchronized narration is highlighted in a different manner than the segments for which the corresponding portions have already been played back, for example by using a different color, different intensity, or pulsating the highlighting.
- FIG. 6B shows the same portable computer 600 as FIG. 6A at a later time during playback of the synchronized narration.
- the portions of the synchronized narration corresponding to the entire first paragraph have now been played back, as illustrated by the entire paragraph being highlighted.
- the illustration 615 on the page has also become highlighted, indicating that a portion of the synchronized narration that was determined to correspond to the illustration 615 is currently being played back.
- the highlighting of the illustration is visually distinguishable from that of previously narrated segments and components while the portion of the synchronized narration to which is corresponds to being played back.
- the embodiment of book reader software 210 running on tablet computer 600 shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B also provides a number of user interface elements.
- the user interface elements are displayed on the touch screen 601 and interacted with by a user touching them with a finger or stylus.
- the user interacts with the user interface elements in other manners, for example by clicking on them using a pointing device such as a mouse.
- the record button 627 begins the process of recording a synchronized narration.
- user settings selected from a preferences menu determine where the correlation module 216 initially considers the current position to be. The user selects an option from a list of options, e.g., the beginning of the electronic book, the beginning of the current page, or a user selected position.
- the correlation module 216 may be configured to search the entire electronic book and determine where the user began their narration responsive to determining correlations between portions of the narration and segments of the body text. In other embodiments, only a subset of these options is available, for example in one embodiment the user is required to begin narrating from the beginning of the electronic book.
- the display module 212 provides visual indicia of the word to be read to guide the narrator's pace and make it easier for them to follow the text without making mistakes, such as skipping words or lines.
- the correlation module 216 monitors the recorded narration to ensure the narrator is not too far ahead or behind the visual indicia.
- user controls are provided with which the narrator can modify narration visual indicia preferences, such as the recommended speed of narration, the type of visual indicia, and how the system responds to the narrator being ahead or behind the visual indicia. Options for how the system responds to a narrator not being synchronized with the visual indicia include automatically adjusting the visual indicia, changing the set narration speed, and providing the user with a warning, such as a flashing red light.
- the play/pause button 626 serves a dual purpose. Firstly, pressing it when the electronic book reader 210 is idle initiates playback of the synchronized narration. In one embodiment, the user may customize where playback begins from by default using the preferences menu, as described above in relation to recording. Similarly, in other embodiments only a subset of the options is made available. Secondly, if playback (or recording) is already occurring, the play/pause button 626 pauses the playback (or recording) without losing the current position. Pressing the play/pause a second time causes the playback (or recording) to resume from the current position.
- the stop button 624 halts playback without guaranteeing that the current position will be retained.
- the stop button 624 automatically causes the current position to revert to an earlier location, such as the start of the electronic book, the start of the current chapter, the start of the current page, or the start of the current paragraph.
- the stop button 624 will retain the current position unless further criteria are met (such as the user changing page or closing the book reader 210 ).
- the display module 212 causes the page to automatically turn when the end of the current page is reached during playback or recording. In another embodiment the page is automatically turned a pre-determined time before the end of the page is reached.
- the rewind 622 button causes the current position to be moved rapidly back through the body text.
- the fast forward button 628 causes the current position to be moved rapidly forward through the text.
- the visual indicia are used to indicate the location of the current position in the body text.
- a sped-up form of the audio recording of the narration is played during fast forwarding to inform the user of the current position.
- the forward 630 and back 620 buttons change the display on the touch screen 601 to show the next and previous pages in the electronic book respectively.
- the user selects using the preferences menu how playback is affected by the user changing pages using the forward and back buttons 630 and 620 .
- Options include: automatically starting playback from the beginning of the new page, automatically pausing playback, and continuing playback unaffected.
- FIGS. 6A and 6B are exemplary and should not be considered limiting.
- One of skill in the art will recognize that many variations in interface and implementation are possible without deviating from the spirit and scope of the method and system disclosed.
- Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware modules.
- a hardware module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner.
- one or more computer systems e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system
- one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g., a processor or a group of processors
- software e.g., an application or application portion
- a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically.
- a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations.
- a hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.
- processors may be temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions.
- the modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.
- the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a “cloud computing” environment or as a “software as a service” (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., application program interfaces (APIs).)
- SaaS software as a service
- the performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines.
- the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or a server farm). In other example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.
- any reference to “one embodiment” or “an embodiment” means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment.
- the appearances of the phrase “in one embodiment” in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.
- Coupled and “connected” along with their derivatives.
- some embodiments may be described using the term “coupled” to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact.
- the term “coupled,” however, may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other, but yet still co-operate or interact with each other.
- the embodiments are not limited in this context.
- the terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes,” “including,” “has,” “having” or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion.
- a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus.
- “or” refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).
