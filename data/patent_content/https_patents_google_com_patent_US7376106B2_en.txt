Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to digital signal processing, and specifically to methods and systems for simultaneous reception and processing of signals from multiple transmitters sharing a common frequency band using code-division multiple access (CDMA).
- CDMA code-division multiple access
- CDMA is widely used in cellular and other wireless systems for multiplexing communications among multiple users on a common frequency band.
- DS direct-sequence
- the transmitter multiplies each user's signal by a distinct code waveform.
- the code waveforms of the different users have the form of “pseudo-noise” (PN) sequences, also known as spreading codes, and are chosen so as to be as much as possible mutually orthogonal.
- PN pseudo-noise
- the receiver receives a composite signal made up of the sum of all of the users' signals, which overlap in time and frequency. To recover the individual signal of a given user, the receiver correlates the composite signal with that user's distinct code.
- MAI Multiple access interference
- MAT Multiple access interference
- MAT limits the capacity and performance of DS-CDMA systems.
- MAI results from the lack of complete orthogonality between the spreading codes, due to random time offsets between the signals of different users, for example.
- MAI becomes increasingly problematic as the number of interfering users and their power increases, particularly when there are power imbalances among the users. These imbalances typically result from differences in distance between the users and the base station, as well as from fading and other factors that affect signal power.
- the problems caused by MAT have led a number of groups to develop multi-user detection techniques, in which information about multiple users and their respective code waveforms is used jointly to better detect each individual user. A survey of these techniques is presented by Moshavi in “Multi-User Detection for DS-CDMA Communications,” IEEE Communications Magazine (October, 1996), pages 124-136, which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the received complex-envelope baseband signal x(t) is a superposition of the users' individual signal waveforms, including channel distortion and additive noise n(t):
- * denotes convolution
- h k (t) is the impulse response of the kth user channel (including delay, attenuation, multipath and filtering effects).
- n(t) is assumed to be Gaussian with mean zero and without correlation between successive noise samples.
- the kth user's signal waveform is given by:
- b k (m) is the mth symbol transmitted by the kth user, wherein b k is selected from a predefined constellation (or alphabet) A.
- PSK phase-shift keyed
- T b is the symbol duration
- p T (t) is a rectangular pulse with unity value in t ⁇ [0,T), and zero elsewhere.
- the multi-user detection problem can be stated as follows: Let the received signal x(t) be sampled, and assume that the impulse responses h k (t) and the spreading waveforms c k (t) are known. Now estimate the symbols b k (m) from the samples x(t) for all k and m. For the sake of simplicity in framing the problem, it is assumed that the impulse responses of the channels can be expressed as complex scalars h k , that the user signals are mutually synchronized, and that the samples are taken at mid-chip, at a sampling rate equal to the chip rate (i.e., N samples per symbol). It is possible to relax some of these assumptions and still achieve multi-user detection, as described hereinbelow.
- the samples taken during the mth symbol interval can be arranged as a N ⁇ 1 complex vector x(m).
- x ( m ) S ( m ) b ( m )+ n ( m ) (5)
- n(m) is a N ⁇ 1 complex vector of noise samples.
- S(m) is a complex N ⁇ K matrix, whose kth column is a signature vector s k (m) representing the “symbol signature” of the kth user during the mth symbol interval.
- the decorrelating detector has been found to provide substantial performance responses over conventional single-user detection, with significantly lower computational complexity than the maximum-likelihood detector proposed previously. It performs well even in the presence of substantial power imbalances among the users. It still entails a substantial computational burden, however, in inverting the matrix S H S.
- Multi-user detection methods generally require that the channel responses h k be known.
- the channel responses are not known a priori, but must rather be determined by a suitable channel estimator in the receiver.
- repetitive spreading codes c k (t) are used, subspace-based signal array processing techniques can be used to solve the channel estimation problem. Such techniques are described, for example, by Madhow in “Blind Adaptive Interference Suppression for Direct-Sequence CDMA,” Proceedings of the IEEE 86:10 (October, 1998), pages 2049-2069, which is incorporated herein by reference.
- Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide simpler, more efficient methods and systems for estimating channel response and detecting CDMA multi-user symbols, particularly PSK symbols.
- the CDMA receiver estimates the channel response h k for each of the multiple user signals by means of a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE).
- MLE incorporates both the channel responses and the user symbol values as parameters, and then estimates the responses and the symbol values that give the greatest likelihood of being correct.
- the MLE is first decoupled into a set of independent, single-user estimator matrices. Each matrix contains the “fingerprints” of the respective user signals, which are determined by multiplying samples of the received signals x by chip sequences of the user's spreading waveform. The main singular value of each fingerprint matrix is calculated in order to determine an initial estimate of the channel response for each user.
- a method of alternate-searching likelihood maximization is used to iteratively refine the estimated channel responses and the detected user signals until both the responses and signal values converge.
- the MLE of the present invention enables the receiver to estimate multi-user channel response in CDMA systems that use long (PN) spreading codes with greater accuracy and reduced computational cost than systems known in the art.
- This MLE works particularly well in conjunction with the multi-user detector described above, in which the transmitted symbols are assumed to lie on the unit circle.
- the MLE is not limited to this implementation, however, and may likewise be used in conjunction with multi-user detectors of other types, and with symbol constellations that are not restricted to the unit circle.
- a method for channel estimation including:
- processing the sequence of complex samples to estimate a channel response for each of the transmitters by maximizing, individually for each of the transmitters and based on the respective spreading code of the transmitter, a likelihood of correctly decoding the transmitted symbols using the estimated channel response.
- processing the sequence of complex samples includes computing respective fingerprints of the transmitters, based on the respective spreading code and the sequence of samples, and determining the channel response for each of the transmitters so as to maximize a product of the respective fingerprints with decision values of the symbols transmitted by the transmitter.
- determining the channel response includes assembling a respective matrix of the fingerprints for each of the transmitters, and finding a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the respective matrix.
- finding the SVD includes deriving a unitary matrix from the matrix of the fingerprints, and estimating the channel response based on the unitary matrix, wherein estimating the channel response includes determining the decision values of the symbols based on the unitary matrix, and computing the estimated channel response from the decision values.
- estimating the channel response includes computing the estimated channel response based on the unitary matrix and on a singular value determined by the SVD.
- the transmitters transmit known pilot signals in addition to the encoded symbols, and assembling the respective matrix includes augmenting the matrix to account for the pilot signals, and finding the SVD includes computing the SVD of the augmented matrix so as to estimate the channel response using the pilot signals.
- the symbols belong to a real-valued constellation
- determining the channel response includes maximizing the product of the respective fingerprints with the decision values while restricting the decision values to real values.
- processing the sequence of complex samples includes estimating a respective delay time for each of the transmitters by maximizing the likelihood of correctly decoding the transmitted symbols over a range of possible delay times.
- sampling the input signal includes generating the samples at a sample rate that is substantially equal to a chip rate of the spreading code.
- sampling the input signal includes generating the samples at a sample rate that is substantially greater than a chip rate of the spreading code.
- receiving the input signal includes receiving the signal through multiple antennas, and processing the sequence of complex samples includes estimating the channel response from each of the transmitters to each of the multiple antennas.
- processing the sequence of complex samples includes processing the sequence of complex samples using the estimated channel response for all the transmitters to determine decision values corresponding to the symbols transmitted by each of the transmitters, and re-estimating the channel response for each of the transmitters based on the decision values of the symbols.
- re-estimating the channel response includes iteratively repeating the steps of processing the sequence of complex samples to determine the decision values and re-estimating the channel response until a convergence criterion is satisfied.
- the transmitted symbols belong to a predetermined constellation
- processing the sequence of complex samples to determine the decision values includes finding soft decision values corresponding to the symbols while constraining the soft decision values to a range of values to which the constellation belongs, and projecting the soft decision values onto the constellation to estimate the transmitted symbols.
- the constellation is real-valued, and constraining the soft decision values includes requiring the soft decision values to be real.
- the symbols in the constellation have a fixed magnitude and a variable phase, and constraining the soft decision values includes constraining the soft decision values to a circle in a complex plane.
- the transmitters transmit known pilot signals in addition to the encoded symbols, and processing the sequence of complex samples to estimate the channel response includes estimating the channel response using the pilot signals, while processing the sequence of complex samples to determine the decision values includes estimating the decision values independent of the pilot signals.

- FIG. 1 is a schematic, pictorial illustration of a wireless communication system 20 , typically a cellular system, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- a base station 22 transmits downlink signals to a plurality of users 24 , and receives uplink signals from the users in return.
- the signals are modulated using a DS-CDMA scheme, with PSK modulation, as described in the Background of the Invention.
- base station 22 employs a novel detection scheme using a constrained statistical model, as described in detail hereinbelow.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram that schematically illustrates elements of a transmitter 26 operated by users 24 in system 20 .
- the operation of this transmitter is represented mathematically by equations (2) and (3) above.
- Each symbol b(t) to be transmitted is multiplied by a complex PN spreading waveform, with different real (I) and imaginary (Q) parts C I (t) and C Q (t), respectively.
- b(t) has real and imaginary parts, as well, b I (t) and b Q (t).
- real-valued modulation such as BPSK
- b I (t) b Q (t).
- the output of transmitter 26 is a complex-valued signal b(t)[C I (t)+jC Q (t)]e j ⁇ 0 t , wherein ⁇ 0 is the carrier frequency.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram that schematically illustrates a receiver 28 used in base station 22 for demodulating and decoding the signals from transmitters 26 , in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the signals are received over the air and downconverted to baseband by a radio receiver front end 30 .
- the baseband signals are then digitized by an analog/digital converter (ADC) 32 .
- ADC analog/digital converter
- Front end 30 and ADC 32 provide an input to a channel estimator 36 and to a multi-user detection block 38 that is substantially of the form given by equation (1).
- the channel estimator estimates the respective impulse responses (or channel responses) h k (t) of the user channels.
- Multi-user detection block 38 uses the channel response estimates to processes the superposed signal x(t) of all of users 24 , modulated by the respective PN complex signatures of the users, in order to estimate an individual symbol stream ⁇ circumflex over (b) ⁇ k (m) for each user.
- the estimated user symbol streams generated by multi-user detection block 38 are input to an individual data processing block 40 for each user. This block performs further data decoding and control channel processing, as is known in the art. The operation of blocks 40 is outside the scope of the present invention.
- estimator 36 and block 38 comprise one or more digital signal processor circuits, comprising a single dedicated chip or a group of chips that are configured to carry out the methods described below.
- estimator 36 and block 38 may be carried out in software on a suitable general-purpose microprocessor.
- certain digital processing functions of estimator 36 and block 38 that are described below may equivalently be accomplished in the analog domain using suitable matched filters, as are known in the art. All these various implementations will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.
- channel estimators in accordance with the principles of the present invention may also be used in other receivers and in conjunction with multi-user detectors of other types, and not only with multi-user detection block 38 .
- the multi-user detection block may receive its channel response estimates from sources other than channel estimator 36 , including other types of channel estimators, as are known in the art.
- the soft decision values ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ k are then determined by minimizing f( ⁇ ) over ⁇ .
- ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ is constrained to the unit circle, the number of real parameters that must be solved for in equation (8) is only half the number used in methods known in the art, as exemplified by the more general equation (5).
- Detection block 38 must estimate only the phase angles of ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ k , and not the amplitudes. In other words, it is evident from this analysis that, at least where PSK modulation is concerned, methods known in the art use an over-parameterized model for their solution. Over-parameterization tends to increase estimation error, and the inventors have indeed found that in most cases, the constrained detector implemented in block 38 achieves a lower bit-error rate (BER) than do decorrelating detectors known in the art.
- BER bit-error rate
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for multi-user detection implemented by block 38 , in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- the method performs an alternating phase search (ALPS) to iteratively reduce the cost function f along each of the axes ⁇ k ⁇ .
- APS alternating phase search
- the entries of ⁇ are set to some initial values, at an initialization step 50 .
- a useful method for initialization is described below with reference to FIG. 6 .
- Detection block 38 then iterates through the users, preferably beginning with the strongest user signal (user K), finding for each user k the angle ⁇ k that will minimize f, as given by equation (10), at an angle determination step 52 . After each angle ⁇ k is calculated, the new value is substituted into ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ , at a substitution step 54 , for use in calculating ⁇ k for the subsequent users in the iteration. The residual vector r is updated at the same time.
- detection block 38 checks the results to determine whether the computation has converged, at a convergence checking step 56 . Convergence may be inferred, for example, when the differences between the previous and current soft decision values ( ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ k ) drop below a predetermined threshold. Until convergence is reached, block 38 repeats the iteration of steps 52 and 54 .
- block 38 converts them to the nearest elements of the constellation alphabet A, in a hard decision step 58 .
- the detection block iterates through the user soft decision values, from the strongest to the weakest, to determine the hard decision values: ⁇ circumflex over (b) ⁇ k ⁇ (s k H r+ ⁇ s k ⁇ 2 ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ k ) (14) r ⁇ r+s k ( ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ k ⁇ circumflex over (b) ⁇ k )
- the operator ⁇ ( ) projects the soft decisions onto the nearest alphabet members, taking into account the residual r (which is adjusted after each step in the iteration).
- the final residual gives an estimate of the noise vector ⁇ circumflex over (n) ⁇ .
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram showing a part of detection block 38 , including a circuit suitable for carrying out the method of FIG. 4 , in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- Current soft decision values ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ k are held in respective registers 60 .
- a spreader 62 comprising a bank of multipliers 64 , multiplies each soft decision value by the respective entries of matrix S, except for the soft decision value for user k, which is currently being updated.
- the choice of k at each iteration is determined by a bank of switches 66 , as shown in the figure.
- An adder 68 sums the products of multipliers 64 to give the current value of s k e j ⁇ k .
- a second adder 70 subtracts this current value from the received signal x(t) to give x (k) (t), as defined above.
- a matched filter 72 holding the current values of the elements of matrix S multiplies x (k) (t) to give the result s k H x (k) derived above.
- a multiplexer 76 enters this value into the appropriate register 60 , and the circuit then iterates to user k+1, thus continuing until done.
- FIG. 6 is a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for initializing the estimated signal values at step 50 of the ALPS procedure, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Substantially any suitable method may be used to set the initial values of b, but the inventors have found the method of FIG. 6 to give generally superior results.
- the method begins by recasting equation (8) in terms of an upper triangular matrix T, using QR factorization of matrix S, as is known in the art, at a signal recasting step 80 .
- the factorization is preferably performed using successive Givens rotations or Householder transformations of the matrix, as described, for example, by Golub and Van Loan in Matrix Computations (Johns Hopkins Series in Mathematical Sciences, 1996), which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the columns of the matrix are preferably ordered according to the approximate strengths of the signals received from the respective users, so that the first column corresponds to the weakest user, and the last column to the strongest.
- T 1 [ T 0 ] , in which T is a K ⁇ K upper-triangular matrix.
- explicit computation of Q is preferably avoided, by applying the Givens rotations to the signal vector x, as well as to S.
- ⁇ circumflex over (b) ⁇ K ⁇ ( z K /T KK ) (17) Assuming that the columns of S were properly ordered at step 80 , this step should give the symbol value for one of the strongest user signals, so that the likelihood of error in determining ⁇ circumflex over (b) ⁇ k is relatively small.
- z (K ⁇ 1) T (K ⁇ 1) b (K ⁇ 1) + ⁇ 1 (K ⁇ 1) (18)
- b (K ⁇ 1) contains the first K ⁇ 1 components of b
- T (K ⁇ 1) contains the upper-left (K ⁇ 1) ⁇ (K ⁇ 1) components of T
- the model of equation (18) is again triangular in structure.
- the alphabet lies both on the unit circle and on the real axis. Therefore, at step 50 , the values of b are initialized using a decision-feedback detector in which the decision values are constrained to the real axis.
- the soft decision values of b are computed with the unit circle constraint, as described above, after which the final hard decision values are determined by constraining b to the actual, real alphabet.
- Equation (20) combines both the unit circle and real axis constraints that apply to the BPSK constellation.
- the ALPS procedure may be applied to z and T, as determined by the methods of FIG. 6 using S and x .
- equations (8) and (9) relate to samples x(t) collected during a single symbol interval
- the method embodied in these equations can readily be extended to multiple successive symbol intervals, i.e., to samples collected over [0,MT b ).
- Such an extended observation window may be necessary in order to deal with loss of synchronism among the user signals and to deal with impulse responses h k (t) whose duration is longer than a single chip period (due to multi-path effects, for example).
- the model of equations (1) and (2) can be recast in the following form:
- the composite symbol signature waveform can vary from symbol to symbol and is of finite duration, say (N+L k ) chip intervals.
- the size of L k reflects the duration of the impulse responses.
- equation (21) can be rewritten as follows:
- s k (t; m): ⁇ hacek over (s) ⁇ k (t; M)p MTb (t)
- the summation in m is over all the symbols having non-zero truncated signatures s k (t;m) in the observation window.
- the columns of S typically contain a few leading zero entries, followed by (N+L k ) non-zero entries, and ending with trailing zeros.
- multi-user detection block 38 can operate on asynchronous signals in the same manner as was described above with respect to synchronous signals.
- restriction of ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ to the unit circle and the application of equation (10) to find the values of ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ k can be performed on asynchronous signals, as well.
- the performance of block 38 in the asynchronous case depends on the width of the observation window. For ideal channels and an observation window synchronized with a symbol interval of one of the users, b should typically have (2K ⁇ 1) elements, compared with K elements in the synchronous case. For improved performance under non-ideal conditions, the observation window may be even wider.
- FIG. 7 is a block diagram showing details of signals conveyed in system 20 , which will be useful in understanding the operation of channel estimator 36 ( FIG. 3 ).
- the symbols b k (m) transmitted by the k-th user 24 are up-sampled and modulated by the user's spreading code c k (i) to generate chips d k (i).
- Each user channel is assumed to have a linear response h k (i).
- the signal x(i) at the receiver of base station 22 is a superposition of all the user signals, together with noise n(i). Assuming for simplicity that the receiver samples the superposed signal at the chip rate, the received baseband signal can be represented as:
- Equation (2) can likewise be recast to express the chips d k (i) as a function of the spreading gain (or spreading response) N k and the code sequence c k (i)
- T k is an integer between 1 and N k that indicates the symbol start-time
- w Nk is a rectangular window function, which is 1 for i in [1, N k ), and zero elsewhere.
- channel estimator 36 or some other element of the receiver typically performs a clock recovery function to determine T k for each user.
- M is chosen to be considerably greater than
- ⁇ k 1 K ⁇ ⁇ L k .
- code sequences ⁇ c k (i) ⁇ are independent of the symbols and consist of independent identically-distributed complex random variables with zero mean. All the code sequences are assumed to be known at the receiver, and are mutually orthogonal. This is a reasonable assumption with the regard to the long PN spreading codes used in IS-95 and other modern CDMA standards. For simplicity in the derivation that follows, we assume that users 24 apply BPSK modulation. Other alphabets may also be used with minor modifications to the channel estimator, as described below. When BPSK modulation is used, the chip sequences ⁇ d k (i) ⁇ are also mutually orthogonal.
- MLE maximum likelihood estimation
- L(b) can be cast as an explicit function of b by using the definition of d k (i) in equation (25):
- B k represents the set of symbols that affect D k , i.e., those symbols having non-zero matrix elements in the signature matrix C k (m) for user k.
- the signature matrix is a M ⁇ L k Toeplitz matrix.
- the elements of the signature matrix are completely determined by the transmitted signature of the symbol b k (m), as described above in reference to equation (25).
- the i-th entry in the first column of C k is the signature w N k (i ⁇ mN k ⁇ T k )c k (i).
- FIGS. 8 and 9 schematically illustrate a method used by channel estimator 36 to determine the channel response vector h k for each channel k, based on the fingerprint matrices F k , in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 8 is a flow chart showing the method itself
- FIG. 9 is a block diagram showing a portion of the circuitry that may be used to implement the method in the channel estimator.
- the method of FIG. 8 begins with calculation of the fingerprint matrix F k for each user channel, at a matrix calculation step 90 .
- a number of matrices may be calculated, each for a different value of ⁇ k , as described further hereinbelow.
- the received samples x(i) are input to a bank of matched filters 92 , as shown in FIG. 9 .
- Filters 92 have coefficients corresponding to the elements of the columns of the signature matrices C k (1), . . .
- Each column of array 94 corresponds to the fingerprint f k (m) for one of the M symbols in the observation interval.
- Each of the columns comprises a sequence of taps 96 , with a one-chip delay between the taps imposed by delay elements 98 .
- Each tap holds the value of one of the elements of F k .
- a matrix processor 99 reads out and processes the elements of F k from taps 96 of array 94 in order to maximize L k (b k ), at a matrix processing step 100 .
- L k ( b k ): ⁇ F k b* k ⁇ 2 (36)
- F _ [ F F ] , a real matrix made by stacking the real and imaginary parts of F, in the manner of S described above.
- the maximization of L k over the real constellation of b k is ambiguous, in that the maximum can be determined only up to multiplication of b k by a real scalar (such as ⁇ 1).
- processor 99 preferably performs a singular value decomposition (SVD) of F k , as is known in the art:
- F k U k ⁇ k V k T (37) wherein U and V are unitary matrices, and ⁇ is diagonal. Efficient methods for SVD are described in the above-mentioned text by Golub et al.
- v k (1) is the first column of V k
- ) ⁇ is added so that the absolute values of the elements of ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ k will be close to one.
- processor 99 can determine a vector of hard decision values ⁇ circumflex over (b) ⁇ k simply by taking the sign of each element of ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ k , at a decision step 102 .
- the determination of the elements of ⁇ circumflex over (b) ⁇ k is uncertain as to multiplication by ⁇ 1, and other means must be applied in order to resolve this ambiguity.
- the channel response vector for each user k can be determined by substituting these values into equation (29), in which the chip matrix D has been replaced by the equivalent fingerprint matrix F k :
- the channel response vectors may be estimated based on the soft decision values ⁇ tilde over (b) ⁇ k given by equation (38). In this case:
- ⁇ k (1) is the first (i.e., largest) singular value in ⁇ k
- u k (1) is the first column of U k .
- the notation u with underbar denotes the inverse of the overbar operation used earlier, i.e., “unstacking” of u from a real vector of length 2L to a complex vector of length L.
- ⁇ k directly from the fingerprint matrix F k in this manner allows matrix processor 99 to update the channel response vectors easily as new samples are received, and corresponding new fingerprints are added to array 94 .
- the matrix processor may use subspace tracking methods, as are known in the art, to compute the new major singular vector u k (1) and the corresponding singular value ⁇ k (1) iteratively, based on the previous values.
- An efficient method for subspace tracking is described, for example, by Yang in “Projection Approximation, Subspace Tracking,” IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 43:1 (January, 1995), pages 95-107, which is incorporated herein by reference.
- matrix processor 99 also estimates the propagation delay ⁇ k of signals transmitted from user k to base station 22 , at a delay estimation step 104 .

Abstract
Description
Here “*” denotes convolution, and hk(t) is the impulse response of the kth user channel (including delay, attenuation, multipath and filtering effects). In the derivation that follows, n(t) is assumed to be Gaussian with mean zero and without correlation between successive noise samples.
In this equation, bk(m) is the mth symbol transmitted by the kth user, wherein bk is selected from a predefined constellation (or alphabet) A. In phase-shift keyed (PSK) modulation, the alphabet set lies on the unit circle in the complex plane. For example, in quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), A={−1, −j, 1, j}. For binary phase shift keying (BPSK), which is currently the most common modulation scheme in current cellular systems, bk is a bit selected from A={−1,1}. Tb is the symbol duration, and pT(t) is a rectangular pulse with unity value in t ∈[0,T), and zero elsewhere. ck(t) is a complex-valued PN spreading waveform, with a chip period Tc=Tb/N, wherein N is the spreading response of the DS modulation:
γk (I)(i) and γk (Q)(i) are independently drawn from {−1,1} with uniform distribution.
b(m):=(b 1(m), . . . b K(m))T (4)
The samples taken during the mth symbol interval can be arranged as a N×1 complex vector x(m). Rearranging equations (1) and (2) in similar vector form gives the following expression:
x(m)=S(m)b(m)+n(m) (5)
Here n(m) is a N×1 complex vector of noise samples. S(m) is a complex N×K matrix, whose kth column is a signature vector sk(m) representing the “symbol signature” of the kth user during the mth symbol interval. The elements of the signature vectors sk(m) are samples of the following waveform:
s k(t;m):=h k c k(t), mT b ≦t≦(m+1)T b (6)
{tilde over (b)}=(S H S)−1 S H x (7)
wherein SH is the conjugate transpose of S.
-
- input circuitry, coupled to receive an input signal due to a superposition of waveforms encoding symbols transmitted respectively by a plurality of transmitters in a common frequency band, wherein each transmitter among the plurality of transmitters modulates the symbols with a respective spreading code, and to sample the input signal at sampling intervals over the duration of an observation period to provide a sequence of samples; and
- channel estimation circuitry, coupled to receive and process the sequence of complex samples so as to estimate a channel response for each of the transmitters by maximizing, individually for each of the transmitters and based on the respective spreading code of the transmitter, a likelihood of correctly decoding the transmitted symbols using the estimated channel response.
bk=ejφ
The model of equation (8) permits equation (5) to be restated as follows in terms of a cost function f(φ) and a vector φ of the phases of the soft decision values:
f(φ)=∥x−Se jφ∥2 (9)
ejφ=(ejφ
The soft decision values {tilde over (b)}k are then determined by minimizing f(φ) over φ.
φk=angle(s k H x (k)) (10)
wherein sk is the k-th column of S, and x(k) is defined by:
x (k) =x−Se jφ
r=x−S{tilde over (b)} wherein {tilde over (b)}=ejφ (12)
{tilde over (b)}k←ω(sk Hr+∥sk∥2{tilde over (b)}k)
r←r+xk({tilde over (b)}k (old)−{tilde over (b)}k) (13)
Here the operator ω( ) projects its argument onto the unit circle. {tilde over (b)}k (old) represents the value of {tilde over (b)}k prior to the current update.
{circumflex over (b)}k←α(sk Hr+∥sk∥2{tilde over (b)}k) (14)
r←r+sk({tilde over (b)}k−{circumflex over (b)}k)
Here the operator α( ) projects the soft decisions onto the nearest alphabet members, taking into account the residual r (which is adjusted after each step in the iteration). The final residual gives an estimate of the noise vector {circumflex over (n)}.
S=QT1 (15)
wherein Q is a N×N unitary matrix, and T1 is a N×K matrix having the structure
in which T is a K×K upper-triangular matrix. Q can be partitioned into Q=└Q1 Q2┘, wherein Q1 is a N×K matrix having a column span equal to the column span of S, and Q2 is its complement. In practice, explicit computation of Q is preferably avoided, by applying the Givens rotations to the signal vector x, as well as to S.
z=Tb+ν 1 (16)
wherein z:=Q1 Hx, and ν1:=Q1 Hn. Thus, since Q1 is unitary, the transformed noise vector ν1 remains Gaussian and uncorrelated in character.
{circumflex over (b)} K=α(z K /T KK) (17)
Assuming that the columns of S were properly ordered at
z (K−1) =T (K−1) b (K−1)+ν1 (K−1) (18)
Here b(K−1) contains the first K−1 components of b, T(K−1) contains the upper-left (K−1)×(K−1) components of T, and the K−1 components of z(K−1) are given by zi (K−1)=zi (K)−TiK{circumflex over (b)}K. The model of equation (18) is again triangular in structure. Thus, it is now possible to repeat
This equation uses the notation
in which S
f(φ)=∥
Equation (20) combines both the unit circle and real axis constraints that apply to the BPSK constellation. Again, the ALPS procedure may be applied to z and T, as determined by the methods of
Here the symbol signature waveform sk(t;m) of equation (6) is replaced by a composite symbol signature waveform, given by:
{hacek over (s)} k(t, m)=h k(t)*[c k(t)p Tb(t−mT b)] (22)
The composite symbol signature waveform can vary from symbol to symbol and is of finite duration, say (N+Lk) chip intervals. The size of Lk reflects the duration of the impulse responses.
wherein sk(t; m):={hacek over (s)}k(t; M)pMTb(t), and the summation in m is over all the symbols having non-zero truncated signatures sk(t;m) in the observation window. Ordering the symbols according to their signature-start-times, the sample vector x can now be expressed in the form given by equation (5), x=Sb+n, except that now x is a NM×1 vector, and the columns of S are the sampled truncated signatures. Typically, the columns of S contain a few leading zero entries, followed by (N+Lk) non-zero entries, and ending with trailing zeros.
This equation is a simplified form of equation (1). Note that higher sampling rates may also be used, as described further hereinbelow.
Here Tk is an integer between 1 and Nk that indicates the symbol start-time, and wNk is a rectangular window function, which is 1 for i in [1, Nk), and zero elsewhere. We refer to the product sN
Here the superscript T indicates the transpose of a vector and dk(i):=(dk(i), dk(i−1), . . . , dk(i−Lk+1))T, wherein Lk is the length of the channel vector hk:=(hk(1), hk(2), . . . , hk(Lk))T. Preferably, for accurate estimation of hk, M is chosen to be considerably greater than
D:=[D1, . . . , DK] (27)
D k :=[d k T(1), . . . , d k T(M)]T
It can be seen from equation (25) that the elements of the chip matrix depend on the (unknown) symbols {bk(m)}.
L(b, h)=−∥x−Dh∥ 2 (28)
over the unknown parameters b and h. The solution to equation (28) for any fixed b is given by:
ĥ=(D H D) −1 D H x (29)
Based on the mutual orthogonality of the chip sequences noted above (and hence the mutual orthogonality of the columns of D), DHD≈MI for large M, wherein I is the identity matrix. Substituting equation (29) back into equation (28) then gives:
Bk represents the set of symbols that affect Dk, i.e., those symbols having non-zero matrix elements in the signature matrix Ck(m) for user k. The signature matrix is a M×Lk Toeplitz matrix. The elements of the signature matrix are completely determined by the transmitted signature of the symbol bk(m), as described above in reference to equation (25). In other words, the i-th entry in the first column of Ck is the signature wN
fk is a “fingerprint vector” of length Lk, matched to the signature of the (k,m)-th symbol, which is given by:
f k(m):=C k H(m)x (33)
Collecting the consecutive symbols {bk(m)} for all m ∈Bk into a column vector bk, and collecting the corresponding fingerprints into a Lk×|Bk| fingerprint matrix Fk (wherein |Bk| is the number of elements in the set Bk), allows equation (32) to be rewritten as:
Since the symbol vectors bk are separate and independent, equation (34) is maximized over b simply by maximizing each of the individual user components of L(b), i.e., for each k, finding bk to maximize:
L k(b k):=∥F k b* k∥2 (35)
Preferably, the maximization is carried out over the known alphabet A of the symbol constellation.
L k(b k):=∥
Here
a real matrix made by stacking the real and imaginary parts of F, in the manner of
wherein U and V are unitary matrices, and Σ is diagonal. Efficient methods for SVD are described in the above-mentioned text by Golub et al. Equation (36) can be maximized by setting symbol values bk to the soft decision values:
{tilde over (b)}k=√{square root over (|Bk|)}vk(1) (38)
Here vk(1) is the first column of Vk, and the scaling factor √{square root over (|Bk|)} is added so that the absolute values of the elements of {tilde over (b)}k will be close to one.
In estimating {circumflex over (b)}k and ĥk in this manner, the individual user channels are decoupled, so that each channel is estimated independently based on the superposed samples x(i) of all the channels and the spreading code of the individual channel.
Here σk(1) is the first (i.e., largest) singular value in Σk, and uk(1) is the first column of Uk. The notation u with underbar denotes the inverse of the overbar operation used earlier, i.e., “unstacking” of u from a real vector of length 2L to a complex vector of length L. An advantage of deriving ĥk directly from the fingerprint matrix Fk in this manner is that it allows
τk =arg max∥
The decision values {circumflex over (b)}k and ĥk are determined based on this extended fingerprint matrix substantially as described above.
There are now two code matrices in the equation: Ck
and pk(i):=[pk(i), pk(i−1), . . . , pk(i−L+1)]T, in analogy to dk(i).
Here Fk is the fingerprint matrix defined above, taken in the absence of pilot signals. The fingerprint matrix is extended by the pilot fingerprint, given by nk=Pk Hx. Applying the SVD of equation (37) to
{tilde over (b)} k =sign(V k(1,1))(√{square root over (|B k|+1)}){dot over (v)} k(1) (46)
By comparison with equation (38), it can be seen that the sign ambiguity of the estimated symbol vector is now resolved by Vk(1,1), which is the first entry in the first column of the matrix Vk. {dot over (v)}k(1) represents the first column of Vk, without the first entry Vk(1,1). The hard decision values of {circumflex over (b)}k are given simply by the sign of the corresponding soft decision values, and the channel estimate is:
wherein β is the (known) ratio of pilot signal power to data traffic signal power.
ĥ=(({circumflex over (D)}+P)H({circumflex over (D)}+P)−1({circumflex over (D)}+P)H x (48)
The procedure continues through
