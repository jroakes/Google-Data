- a computer readable medium can have stored thereon instructions to measure and indicate impact of image modification that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to applying one or more edit operations to modify an image and determine one or more individual impact scores for the edit operations.
- the processor is caused to determine, based on the one or more individual impact scores, a visualization that indicates the modification of the first image by the one or more edit operations, and provide the visualization for display by a display device.
- the instructions cause the processor to provide a modified image for each of the one or more edit operations, where each modified image associated with an edit operation having an individual impact score satisfying an impact score threshold is included in the visualization.
- the instructions further cause the processor to combine the one or more individual impact scores to determine an overall degree of visual impact of the one or more edit operations with respect to the image, and provide an indication of the determined overall degree of visual impact in the visualization.
- the instructions cause the processor to apply the edit operations sequentially such that a first edit operation is applied to the first image and each subsequent edit operation modifies a modified image resulting from a previous edit operation.
- the instructions can cause the processor to determine an accumulated impact score that includes the individual impact score associated with a particular edit operation and the individual impact score associated with at least one of the edit operations which does not satisfy an impact score threshold and is applied prior to the application of the particular edit operation, and to add the modified image associated with the particular edit operation to the visualization based on the accumulated impact score satisfying the impact score threshold.

- a camera, cell phone, tablet computer, wearable device, or other client device can capture an image and can perform the method 200 .
- a client device can send a captured image to a server device over a network, or the server device can obtain an image from other sources (e.g., other servers, storage, etc.), and the server device can process the image using method 200 .
- Some implementations can initiate method 200 based on user input.
- a user may, for example, have selected the initiation of the method 200 from a user interface, e.g., a social networking interface, application interface, or other interface.
- the method obtains an image for processing.
- the method can select an image from one or more images stored in memory or other storage device, can receive or retrieve the image from a source (storage device, a different device over a network, etc.), etc.
- the image can be a digital image composed of multiple pixels, for example, and can be stored on one or more storage devices of the implementing system or otherwise accessible to the method, e.g., a local storage device or storage device connected to or in communication with a network accessible to the system.
- the image can be automatically selected by the method.
- the image can be obtained from a variety of sources, e.g., uploaded by a user to a server over one or more networks, an image from an album or other stored collection of multiple images, etc.
- the collection can be locally stored and accessible by the device performing method 200 , and/or can be remotely stored on a server or client device, e.g., as an album provided in an account of a user of a social networking system.
- the system can determine which image to select based on evaluating one or more characteristics of accessible images, e.g., the color distributions of images, timestamps and other metadata of images, and/or identified and recognized content depicted in the images (e.g., persons, faces, or objects).
- a user can provide or designate one or more images to obtain.
- the method determines one or more edit operations (e.g., image processing operations) for the image. For example, in some implementations the method applies the one or more edit operations to the image to modify the image, e.g., modifies one or more pixel values of one or more pixels of the image to apply the edit operation to the image.
- the image is initially considered an input image and each edit operation provides a modified image derived from the input image.
- the edit operations can be performed in a sequence such that a first edit operation is applied to the input image and each successive edit operation is applied to the modified image that resulted from the previous edit operation of the sequence.
- a “final” modified image (e.g., final with respect to the currently-provided edit operations to be performed) has been created and includes the edit operations applied to the image starting with the input image.
- the final modified image can be considered an output image.
- the method can determine that one or more of the edit operations have been or will be applied to the image. For example, the method can receive information describing the application of the edit operations by a different process, e.g., information indicating which edit operations have been or will be applied to the image (e.g., applied to the input image or to a derived modified image) by one or more other processes, the sequence of application of those edit operations, and/or the particular parameters used for those edit operations. For example, if the edit operations have been applied, the method can determine the impact scores and other information in the blocks of method 200 based on the received information describing the applied edit operations and by comparing modified images before and after application of each edit operation.
- a different process e.g., information indicating which edit operations have been or will be applied to the image (e.g., applied to the input image or to a derived modified image) by one or more other processes, the sequence of application of those edit operations, and/or the particular parameters used for those edit operations.
- the method can determine the impact scores and other
- the edit operations can include any modifications to the visual characteristics of one or more pixels of an image.
- the edit operations can be applied through application of a filter, preset, or other change in pixel color values in some implementations.
- the edit operations can modify other image characteristics such as size, orientation (e.g., rotation of image, etc.), visible area, etc.
- an edit operation can be a change of a single visual characteristic of the image, e.g., brightness.
- an edit operation can include multiple changes, e.g., changes to different characteristics of the image (e.g., brightness and contrast, color warmth and saturation, or several characteristics changed in a filter, e.g., an aging or “retro” filter that changes an image to have a worn, scratched, and/or otherwise aged appearance like an old photograph, etc.).
- changes to different characteristics of the image e.g., brightness and contrast, color warmth and saturation, or several characteristics changed in a filter, e.g., an aging or “retro” filter that changes an image to have a worn, scratched, and/or otherwise aged appearance like an old photograph, etc.
- the method determines individual impact scores for the edit operations. For example, the method can determine an individual impact score for each edit operation applied to an image (e.g., applied to the initial input image or to a successive modified image).
- An individual impact score is an estimated measurement of a visual impact that the associated individual edit operation has made to an image, e.g., as compared to the visual appearance of the image before that edit operation was applied.
- the individual impact score can be based on any of a variety of different factors related to the image and/or to the individual edit operation that was applied, including one or more particular characteristics of the associated edit operation.
- the factors can include one or more characteristics of the application of the edit operation to the image and/or of the modification to the image caused by the edit operation.
- Example characteristics can include the type of the edit operation, magnitude of parameters used by the edit operation, location of application of and/or modification by the edit operation in the image, extent or size of application and/or modification by the edit operation in the image, etc. Some examples of factors are described in greater detail below with respect to FIG. 4 .
- the method determines an overall degree of visual impact on the image based on impact score(s) determined for individual edit operation(s). For example, the method can determine a total or overall impact score for the image, which can indicate the visual impact of all the edit operations performed on (or to be performed on) the input image, e.g., indicate a viewer-perceptible difference between the input image and the output image.
- the total impact score can be based on individual impact scores of edit operations determined in block 206 .
- the individual impact scores of the edit operations of block 206 can be combined to obtain the total impact score, e.g., by summing the individual impact scores and/or by performing a different function to combine the individual impact scores, e.g., an averaging function and/or other types of functions.
- Some implementations can weight one or more individual impact scores differently in the determination of the total impact score, e.g., such that different individual scores may contribute a greater or lesser amount to the total impact score based on their weighting factor.
- one or more edit operation characteristics and/or application characteristics related to an individual impact score can influence such weighting, some examples of which are described below with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the method determines a visual impact ranking of the output image based on the total impact score determined in block 208 .
- the ranking can indicate the amount of impact that edit operation(s) have made upon the output image with respect to multiple other images.
- the image can be ranked in correlation with the degree of visual impact provided by the one or more edit operations, e.g., the image can be ranked higher in response to the applied edit operations creating a larger degree of visual impact in the modified output image.
- the total impact score of the output image can be compared to total impact scores that are stored in association with the other images so that the rank of the output image can be determined in comparison to the other images.
- overall image quality can also be included in the ranking determination.
- the other images can be any set of images.
- the other images can be images owned or accessible to a user who also owns or can access the output image, or images of multiple users stored by an image collection or distribution service, social networking service, or other network service accessible over a network by the system processing the output image.
- Some implementations can determine a visual impact ranking of the output image based on individual impact scores instead of or in addition to the total impact score of block 210 .
- an individual impact score for a particular edit operation applied to the image may indicate a particularly high visual impact for that edit operation (e.g., a high individual impact score that satisfies a predetermined threshold), and the edit operation may be known to be of a type that provides high visual impact as compared to other types of edit operations (e.g., a list can be maintained of known high-impact edit operations).
- individual edit operations can be ranked with respect to other edit operations applied to the image, and/or ranked with respect to individual edit operations applied to other images. For example, individual edit operations can be ranked based on their individual impact scores.
- the method provides a display of an indication of visual impact on the image caused by the edit operations of block 204 , and/or provides a display of an indication of the ranking of the output image.
- the display can be provided by a display device, e.g., connected to a system implementing method 400 and/or a different system.
- the method can cause or provide a display of an indication of the visual impact on the image caused by the edit operations, e.g., by a display device.
- the method can display a visualization indicating the modification to the input image.
- the visualization can include one or more modified images. Some examples of such visualizations are described below with respect to FIGS. 3 and 4 .
- a visualization can display the total impact score determined in block 208 , and/or display one or more of the individual impact scores of block 206 .
- Some visualization implementations can display descriptions of the edit operations associated with individual impact scores.
- the visualization can include an indication (e.g., a summary) of the visual impact based on the total impact score compared to predefined ranges of scores.
- the method can output a description of “minor visual change” if the total impact score is less than a predetermined lower total score threshold, output a description of “some visual change” if the total impact score is between the lower total score threshold and a higher total score threshold, and output a description of “major visual change” if the total impact score is greater than the higher total score threshold.
- the displayed indication of visual impact can be accompanied by a display of the output image, the input image, and/or one or more intermediate modified images resulting from a sequence of application of the edit operations.
- the method can cause display of an indication of the visual impact ranking of the output image determined in block 210 .
- the indication of ranking can be displayed in a visualization of image modifications.
- Some implementations can display the output image in a manner to indicate its ranking In some examples, the output image can be displayed within a ranked order including the output image and the other ranked images, e.g., displayed in a list or sequence of images that are displayed in the ranking order.
- a ranked sequence of images can be displayed on a displayed area of a display device in a spatial sequence (e.g., a sequence indicated by a top to bottom order, left to right order, etc.) and/or a time sequence (e.g., a sequence indicated by displaying images in the sequence over time).
- a spatial sequence e.g., a sequence indicated by a top to bottom order, left to right order, etc.
- a time sequence e.g., a sequence indicated by displaying images in the sequence over time.
- the ranking can be used to display the most visually changed images in a collection of images, e.g., used by an image collection service to showcase the most visually changed images stored in a user's collection, stored on the site, and/or stored in a particular category or topic matching the content of the images (e.g., where an image's topics or categories can be based on labels stored as image metadata and describing the image content, or based on recognized image features in the image (e.g., using image recognition techniques), etc.).
- a collection of images e.g., used by an image collection service to showcase the most visually changed images stored in a user's collection, stored on the site, and/or stored in a particular category or topic matching the content of the images (e.g., where an image's topics or categories can be based on labels stored as image metadata and describing the image content, or based on recognized image features in the image (e.g., using image recognition techniques), etc.).
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method 300 to provide a visualization of image modifications.
- Method 300 can be implemented by a system that is or includes, for example, a server and/or client device as described above for method 200 .
- method 300 can be performed by a system that also measures the visual impact of images as described above in method 200 of FIG. 2 .
- One example of combining measuring and visualization features for images based on visual impact of image modifications is described below with respect to FIG. 4 .
- Some systems can perform method 300 without performing method 200 or independently and/or separately from method 200 .
- the method obtains an input image, e.g., similarly as described above for block 202 of FIG. 2 .
- the method determines that one or more edit operations (e.g., image processing operations or techniques as described above) have each provided a modified image derived from the input image, where the edit operations are applied to the input image or modified images.
- the edit operations can be performed in a sequence such that that the first edit operation is applied to the input image and each successive edit operation is applied to the modified image resulting from the previous edit operation of the sequence.
- the final modified image in the sequence can be considered an output image.
- the method can apply one or more of the edit operations to obtain one or more of the modified images.
- Some implementations can obtain modified images by receiving one or more of the modified images that are provided by a different process(es) that performed the associated edit operations.
- the method can also receive information describing the application of the edit operations by a different process, e.g., information indicating which edit operations have been applied to the input image or to a derived modified image, the sequence of application of the edit operations, and/or the particular parameters used for the edit operations.
- an edit operation can include any modification(s) to the visual characteristics of one or more pixels of an image, e.g., application of one or more filters, presets, or other changes in pixel color values in some implementations.
- an edit operation can be a change of a single visual characteristic of the image, or can include multiple changes.
- some implementations of the method can determine an individual impact score for each of the edit operations of block 304 .
- the method can calculate one or more of the individual impact scores similarly as described herein, and/or can obtain one or more of the individual impact scores from one or more other processes that have calculated the individual impact scores.
- Each individual impact score can be an estimated measurement of a visual impact that the associated edit operation has made to an image as compared to the visual appearance of that image before that edit operation was applied. This block can be performed similarly to block 206 of FIG. 2 , for example.
- the method provides for display a visualization of modification for the input image, where the visualization includes multiple images.
- An image modification “visualization,” as referred to herein, is a visual presentation of images indicating the modification to an input image caused by one or more edit operations.
- the visualization can include the input image and multiple modified images showing modifications to the input image and to other modified images.
- the modified images can show a progression of changes over sequential modifications to the input images, in some implementations.
- the visualization can be provided to and displayed by a display device included in or in communication with the system implementing method 300 , e.g., a display screen, projector, etc.
- block 308 can include creating the visualization from the input image and modified images described above for blocks 302 and 304 .
- the input image and all determined or obtained modified images can be included in the visualization.
- the individual impact scores of block 306 may not be needed and block 306 can be omitted.
- the method can examine the modified images of block 304 and determine which of the modified images should be included in the visualization. For example, this determination can be based on the individual impact score associated with each edit operation that provided a modified image. For example, modified images that are associated with impact scores satisfying an impact score threshold can be included in the visualization. In some implementations, the modified images that satisfy the threshold have achieved a threshold level of visual impact. In some examples, if a modified image has a threshold level (or better) of visual impact relative to the previous image provided in the sequence of edit operations (e.g., change in visual impact relative to the previous image), then it is retained and included in the visualization.
- a threshold level or better
- a modified image does not satisfy (e.g., has less than) the threshold level of visual impact relative to the previous image, then it can be removed, discarded, or not included in the visualization.
- criteria for including one or more modified images in the visualization can be predetermined and/or specified, e.g., by default criteria and/or by a user via user input provided to the method via a user interface (e.g., stored user preferences or user selections).
- Some implementations can use a predetermined or selected range (e.g., threshold range) of visual impact to determine which modified images to include in the visualization.
- modified images having a visual impact (relative to the previous image) over a particular threshold amount may be undesired and are not included in the visualization.
- modified images having visual impact within a particular range e.g., having upper and lower thresholds
- the visualization can include all modified images regardless of their individual impact scores.
- the visualization can include modified images that resulted from the application of particular types of edit operations (e.g., filters) that are predetermined and designated as important or significant edit operations. For example, visual impact of edit operations as described above need not be measured for such important edit operations.
- edit operations e.g., filters
- the visualization can be output by a display device in any of a variety of forms.
- the visualization images can be displayed, in whole or in part, simultaneously, sequentially, or in a combination of simultaneous and sequential presentations. Some visualization examples are described below with reference to FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating an example method 400 including measuring and visualizing visual impact of image modifications.
- Method 400 can be implemented by a system, e.g., a server and/or client device as described above for methods 200 and 300 .
- the method selects and/or obtains an input image, e.g., similarly as described above for blocks 202 and 302 .
- the method adds the input image to a visualization.
- the visualization can be a stored set of visualization images including an input image (e.g., initial or starting image) and multiple modified images that show a sequence of modifications to the input image. For example, if an image is added to the visualization, the image can be displayed in response to the visualization being displayed (or the image can be displayed based on user input, etc. if the visualization is to be displayed).
- the input image can be added to the visualization as the first or starting visualization image in a visualization sequence that indicates the sequence of modifications to the input image.
- Some implementations can add the input image to other positions in the visualization sequence, e.g., after an existing set of images already stored in the visualization from a different or earlier process.
- Some implementations can add the input image to a visualization that does not display a sequence of images, e.g., displays a simultaneous spatial arrangement of the input image and modified images.
- the method applies the next edit operation to the last image, thus providing a modified image.
- the last image is the input image obtained in block 402 .
- the last image can be a modified image that was most recently created by applying a previous edit operation.
- the edit operation can provide a modification of one or more image characteristics, as described above for FIGS. 2 and 3 , and/or can include the application of one or more filters, presets, or other changes to the last image.
- the edit operation can use one or more parameters that define the modification(s) made by the edit operation.
- the parameters can be magnitudes of changes made to particular characteristics of one or more pixels of the image (e.g., +30 to brightness magnitude, ⁇ 15 to contrast magnitude, etc., in a predetermined scale).
- the edit operation applied in block 406 is an automatic enhancement of the input image.
- a user of a network service e.g., a social networking service, photo collection or photo serving service, etc.
- the system can examine the input image and apply one or more edit operations to enhance the input image.
- the system can measure brightness, contrast, saturation, and other image characteristics of one or more pixels of the input image and can decide to apply one or more edit operations to enhance the image, based on predetermined criteria to achieve predetermined desired results.
- the system can examine the content of the image, e.g.
- the system can determine that one or more faces are located in the input image that would benefit from a vignette edit operation that applies a gradually-darkening effect to border areas of the image surrounding a center region of predetermined size or determined size.
- the system can determine the various parameters of the edit operation that need to be changed. If the system decides that multiple edit operations are to be applied (e.g., in a particular order), then an appropriate one of those edit operations is selected and applied in block 406 .
- the edit operation applied in block 406 is specified by a user, e.g., it is a manual edit operation.
- a user can cause various types of edit operations to be performed on an image using functions of an image editing program running on the user's device or running on a server in communication with the user's device.
- the user can change particular parameters to perform the edit operation, e.g., change parameters of a filter. If the user has instructed to apply multiple edit operations, one of those edit operations can be selected and applied in block 406 .
- a combination of multiple image processing operations can be selected as an “edit operation” and applied in combination or sequence in block 406 .
- the method 400 does not apply the edit operation
- block 406 can include receiving the modified image from a particular source after a different process has applied the edit operation to create the modified image (e.g., and store it in an accessible storage device or send it to the method 400 ).
- other data describing the edit operation can also be obtained by method 400 , e.g., the particular parameters used, the time when the edit operation was performed, a sequence of edit operations, etc.
- the method determines an individual impact score for the edit operation applied in block 406 based on one or more particular factors.
- the individual impact score can measure a visual impact that the associated edit operation has made to an image as compared to the visual appearance of the image before that edit operation was applied.
- each factor of a set of predetermined factors can be evaluated for the applied edit operation and each factor evaluated for the image to which it was applied (if appropriate), and a contribution amount or value can be determined for each factor based on how the edit operation provides or implements that factor and/or applies that factor to the image. For example, the contribution value can be added to the individual impact score for the edit operation.
- a higher impact score indicates a greater visual impact than a lower impact score.
- other implementations can reverse this convention (e.g., use a lower score for more visual impact), or can use a different score system to indicate greater vs. lesser impact.
- Other factors e.g., other edit operation characteristics
- One example characteristic of the edit operation that can influence the impact score is the particular edit operation being applied, e.g., the type of edit operation.
- each type of edit operation can be associated with a corresponding amount of contribution to the impact score.
- certain types of edit operations can be known to have a greater visual impact on an image's visual appearance than other types, and so the types having greater impact can provide a larger contribution value to the impact score than other types.
- an edit operation that typically affects a main subject of an image and/or affects a depicted object that typically attracts the eyes of viewers in an image can be assigned a larger impact score.
- a skin softening type of edit operation blurs details of faces detected in an image (e.g., by detecting faces in an image using facial recognition techniques and applying a skin softening blur (and/or other modifications) to facial pixels of the image). Since faces are known to draw the attention of image viewers, a skin softening type of edit operation can provide a larger contribution value to its impact score than, for example, other edit operations that affect all image features equally. Other edit operations that generally affect faces more than other types of image features can similarly contribute a larger contribution value. In contrast, a type of edit operation that is known to typically modify all content of an image equally (e.g., a brightness filter) can contribute a lower or average contribution value based on its type.
- a type of edit operation that is known to typically modify all content of an image equally (e.g., a brightness filter) can contribute a lower or average contribution value based on its type.
- one type of edit operation e.g., a contrast filter
- a contrast filter may be known (e.g., through previous observational testing by many persons) to visually change an image in subtler ways (regardless of its parameter values) than a different type of edit operation (e.g., a saturation filter).
- the former type of edit operation e.g., contrast filter
- the latter operation e.g., saturation filter
- the values of the parameters can be associated with corresponding amounts of contribution to the impact score.
- a parameter value that is greater may indicate that the associated edit operation was applied in a greater amount or magnitude to the image, and so the greater parameter value provides a greater contribution value to the impact score than the same edit operation applied with a lower value in that same parameter.
- a brightness edit operation applied with a parameter value of +60 increases the brightness of the image pixels to a greater extent than a brightness operation applied with a parameter value of +10, and so the operation with the greater parameter value provides a greater contribution value to the impact score.
- Some characteristics that can be used to influence the impact score may relate to the application of the edit operation to the particular image (e.g., which can be referred to herein as “application characteristics”).
- the application of the edit operation can be considered without regard to the actual modification made to the image by the edit operation, e.g., by examining an area or pixel values of the image which will be affected by the edit operation.
- the application of the edit operation can include consideration of the resulting modification to the particular image made by the edit operation.
- application characteristics may vary in their visual influence (e.g., contribution value) based on how the edit operation is applied to and/or affects this particular image.
- the visual influence of the edit operation on the image may be based on particular image features depicted in the image and modified by the edit operation, e.g., the types of image features (faces, objects, landscapes, monuments, etc. as detected by image content recognition techniques), the size of those image features, the spatial position of those image features in the image, the spatial relationship between image features, etc.
- the visual influence of the edit operation may be based on the color of pixels of the image that are affected by the edit operation, e.g., particular color(s) present in the image, the number of pixels having those colors, the shape or size of collections of contiguous pixels having those colors, etc.
- the visual influence of the edit operation may be based on other characteristics of modified pixels in the image other than color, e.g., brightness, contrast, gradients of color or brightness between adjacent pixels, etc.
- Application characteristics based on the actual modification to the image can be determined after the edit operation is applied to and modifies the image.
- an application characteristic that can influence the impact score based on edit operation application to the image is the size of the area of the image to which the edit operation is applied (e.g., the size of the area to be modified and/or modified by the edit operation).
- the method can determine how many pixels and/or the percentage of all image pixels that are modified in the image due to application of the edit operation (e.g., image pixels that will be modified, or have been modified).
- the method can determine modification in one or more pixel values of the pixels (color, brightness, etc.), e.g., by checking pixels for more than a threshold amount of change in the pixel values.
- An edit operation that is determined to be applied to a smaller area of an image will have a smaller contribution to the impact score than an edit operation determined to be applied to a larger area of the image, based on the modified image area size.
- a larger size of application can provides a larger contribution to the impact score.
- an edit operation that is applied to 1% of the area of an image can contribute a smaller value to the impact score than an edit operation applied to the entire image or to 30% of the area of the image, based on the size characteristic.
- the size of the area affected image area may not be known until the edit operation is applied to an image. For example, a color edit operation that changes yellow hues will modify a variable-sized image area, depending on the colors in a particular image.
- Another modification characteristic that can influence the impact score is an estimated importance of the image area(s) of the image to which the edit operation is applied and/or which the edit operation modifies (e.g., modifies more than a threshold amount in pixel value).
- the method can determine which pixels of the image are modified by the edit operation similarly as described above and whether those pixels are included in any detected important image areas.
- An edit operation that modifies image features considered to be more important by the method will provide a larger contribution value than an edit operation that modifies image features considered by the method to be less important.
- the method can determine whether particular characteristics are present for the edit operation and/or its application to the image, where such particular characteristics may have a predetermined importance value or contribution value.
- image areas e.g., depicted image features such as objects, backgrounds, or other image areas
- application of the edit operation to particular types of image areas can be known from previous user samples and testing to be more visually important than application to other types of image areas.
- human faces depicted in an image are typically considered more important than other types of depicted objects since most viewers' eyes are attracted to faces.
- Other particular types of objects may also be generally considered important, e.g., animals, vehicles, etc. (especially when not surrounded by many other same or similar types of objects in the image).
- a main subject of an image can also be considered more important than other subjects in the image, e.g., a foreground image feature (e.g., closer to the camera lens) being generally more important than a background image feature (e.g., further from the camera lens).
- this foreground/background status can be determined based on size of depicted features in the image relative to the entire image area, where larger features may be foreground objects and smaller features may be background objects (similar to the area size characteristic above).
- depth data and/or other data
- depth data can assist determination of foreground features (closer to the camera lens) and background features (further from the camera lens).
- importance can be based on location of the area affected by the edit operation with respect to the entire image area and/or with respect to predetermined locations in the image. For example, image features located closer to the center of the image may be considered more important or more likely foreground features than image features located closer to the sides and borders of the image, and thus may be considered more important than image features at other locations.
- image areas can also make image areas important, e.g., color of the pixels in the area (e.g., bright colors or standout colors attract more viewer attention than more faded or dull colors and colors which blend in with other colors appearing over a large image area), texture, shape, edges (e.g., large discontinuities in color between adjacent or nearby pixels, forming a continuous edge), and other characteristics.
- image recognition techniques e.g., object recognition, facial recognition, landscape feature recognition, and other techniques, which in some implementations can compare examined image areas to stored reference patterns of known image feature types.
- the contribution value from all the characteristics (and other factors) can be combined (e.g., summed) to obtain the individual impact score for the edit operation.
- one or more contribution values can be adjusted by a particular weighting factor or value. For example, if some characteristics are considered more important to visual impact than other factors, they can be weighted more strongly (e.g., higher).
- the characteristic of parameter values can be weighted highly compared to other factors since the magnitude of parameter values can directly affect the visual impact of an edit operation. Also or alternatively, such weighting can be inherent in the magnitude or range of contribution values that can be contributed for each factor.
- a contribution value for a particular factor can be adjusted by a different weight based the particular modification in the factor or based on the values involved in the modification. For example, it may have been previously determined (e.g., via testing of responses by various users or other persons) that changes in brightness in an image have more visual impact if the starting and ending brightness pixel values in the changes occur within a middle range of brightness parameter values, e.g., between values 30 and 60 in a value range of 0-100, as compared to brightness pixel values that occur above or below this middle range.
- a change to brightness pixel values occurring within (or overlapping) the middle range can be weighted higher in contribution values for the brightness filter compared to changes in brightness pixel values occurring outside the middle range.
- the method determines the accumulated impact score for all edit operations performed since the last image (e.g., the most recently added image) was added to the visualization.
- the last image is the input image obtained in block 402 .
- the last image can be a modified image that was most recently added to the visualization (e.g., in block 414 , described below).
- the accumulated impact score can be a combined score that includes all of the of the individual impact scores for all of the edit operations performed since the last image was added to the visualization (e.g., relevant edit operations).
- the accumulated impact score can be a combined score that includes one or more the of the individual impact scores for one or more of the edit operations performed since the last image was added to the visualization. In some implementations, the accumulated impact score includes a sum of the individual impact scores for those relevant edit operations. In some implementations, the accumulated impact score can be based at least in part on another function that combines those individual impact scores, e.g., an average, median, or a function taking the maximum individual impact score.
- the method determines whether the accumulated impact score determined in block 410 satisfies a predetermined impact score threshold.
- a predetermined impact score threshold In the example shown, it is checked whether the accumulated impact score is greater than the threshold.
- this threshold can define a particular minimum impact score that indicates a particular amount of visual change in the latest modified image as compared to the last image added to the visualization.
- the particular amount of visual change is a predetermined amount considered to be sufficiently noticeable by a user so as to allow the latest modified image to be added to the visualization.
- Other checks or comparisons can be used in other implementations to determine if the accumulated impact score satisfies the impact score threshold.
- the method continues to block 416 , described below. If the accumulated impact score does satisfy (e.g., is greater than) the impact score threshold, then the method continues to block 414 in which the method adds the current modified image (resulting from block 406 ) to the visualization.
- the visualization is stored as a data structure or list
- an identifier for the modified image can be added to the data structure or list to indicate an appropriate position for the modified image after the last image in the visualization sequence.
- the latest modified image is added to the visualization. This feature permits modified images having sufficiently visible changes to appear in the image visualization, while modified images showing less visible changes will not appear.
- the method also creates one or more descriptive labels for the added modified image and stores such labels to be associated with the modified image.
- the label can describe and/or name the edit operations that were applied to the image since the last added image to indicate to a user the particular modifications made to that image.
- Other information can also or alternatively be included in the labels, e.g., particular parameter values of the applied edit operations, time that an edit operation was applied, image features recognized in the image and influencing the impact score of an applied edit operation, etc.
- the labels can be added directly into the image (e.g., changing pixel values of the image).
- labels can be superimposed over the image as a separate (and removable) graphical layer in a display program, or positioned near to the image in the display of the visualization.
- the labels can also or alternatively be added to the image as metadata stored in metadata fields of the image or stored in association with the image.
- the method can check to determine if there are too many labels assigned to a single image in a visualization. If so, the method can designate that only those labels corresponding to the most significant filters be displayed in the visualization.
- the most significant filters can be determined using the impact scores and contribution values described above and/or other criteria (e.g., the highest such impact scores and/or contribution values).
- the method can highlight particular areas of the added modified image which were changed by the edit operations applied since the previous image in the visualization.
- the highlights can indicate to a user particular image pixels that were modified. Such particular areas can be highlighted in a visible color, texture, outline, border, or other indicator or marker. Other effects can also be added.
- the method then continues to block 416 .
- the method determines whether there is another edit operation to process in a subsequent iteration of blocks 406 - 414 . For example, multiple edit operations may have been designated to be applied for a particular enhancement process for the input image, and the method can check whether one or more of those edit operations must still be considered (and applied, if appropriate). If there are one or more edit operations to process, the method returns to block 406 to apply the next edit operation (or select the next modified image to which the next edit operation was applied). If there are no further edit operations, the method continues to block 418 .
- the method determines whether the accumulated impact score does not satisfy (e.g., is less than) the impact score threshold. At this stage, no further edit operations are left to be processed in the above blocks, and so the method checks to see how visually different the last modified image is compared to the image previous to that last modified image in the visualization (e.g., the penultimate image). If the accumulated impact score satisfies (e.g., is greater than) the threshold, then the method continues to block 424 , described below.
- the method removes the last image in the visualization. For example, this block can be performed so that the final image in the visualization (added below in block 422 ) will not be too visibly similar to the previous (penultimate) image in the visualization (which the current accumulated impact score indicates might be the case). The method then continues to block 422 .
- the method adds the last modified image to the visualization as the final image (if appropriate). For example, since the accumulated impact score did not satisfy the threshold, one or more of the last applied edit operations were not included in the visualization, and so the last modified image resulting from the last iteration of block 406 is added as the final image.
- the method adds final labels to the final image in the visualization.
- labels and/or other effects can be added similarly as described above for block 414 .
- labels e.g., “output image” or “final image”
- Other modifications can also or alternatively be added to the final image, e.g., highlights of the modifications made, a frame around the borders of the final image, or other effect.
- block 418 can be omitted and blocks 422 and 424 can be performed in reverse sequence to the sequence shown in FIG. 4 .
- the method can always remove the last image in the visualization, add labels to the last modified image, and then add the labelled image to the visualization as the final visualization image.
- the method provides the visualization for display.
- This block can be performed at any time, and can include storing the visualization on an accessible storage device for access by another process of a system, e.g., a loading or display process and/or sending the visualization for display on a display device of the system or a different system.
- the stored visualization can include the visualization images, any labels or other effects, and information describing the visualization sequence.
- the visualization can present the visualization images simultaneously in a horizontal row, a vertical column, or a combination of row(s) and column(s).
- a row or column can present the visualization images in a sequence indicating the corresponding sequence of modifications applied to the input image and successive modified images.
- a single visualization image can be displayed at a time (or a subset of the images can be displayed at one time), followed by removing the image from the display and displaying a next visualization image in the modification sequence or a next subset of images.
- the visualization images can be presented as video frames in a displayed video sequence (e.g., movie data or animated GIF image) that is the same as the modification sequence, where each visualization image is displayed for a predetermined amount of time.
- a movie can be created to include additional frames presenting progress of edit operations being applied. Some video sequences can include special effects, e.g., different types of fades, dissolves, or other transitions between sequential images.
- a single visualization image can be displayed, and a user can select one or more user input controls (e.g., a right arrow or a left arrow of a hardware control or displayed graphical control) to display a corresponding next or previous visualization image in the sequence of visualization images.
- the first and/or last images in the visualization can be displayed at a larger size or otherwise visually distinguished from intermediate images in the visualization.
- the method determines the total impact score for all edit operations performed relative to the input image.
- the total impact score can be a combination of all the individual impact scores for the applied edit operations.
- the combination can be a sum of the individual impact scores, and/or can be based on some other function, e.g., an average, median, or maximum function.
- one or more of the individual impact scores can be weighted differently and contribute different amounts to the total impact score based on their weights. For example, individual impact scores associated with particular types of edit operations can be weighted higher than individual scores associated with other types of edit operations, similarly as described above for block 408 .
- the method can weight higher the individual impact scores that are associated with edit operations having one or more characteristics providing a large contribution value (e.g., over a predetermined threshold value) to their individual impact scores as determined in block 408 .
- the method determines a visual quality of the final modified image. Any of a variety of techniques can be used by the method (and/or by other accessible methods) to evaluate the quality of the final modified image. In some cases, some or all of the image characteristics used to determine visual quality can be different than the factors and characteristics used to determine visual impact. For example, image characteristics including exposure level, noise level or profile, and sharpness/blurriness level of the final modified image can be evaluated to determine quality. In one example, an exposure score can be determined for the final modified image, where a better exposed image receives a better (e.g., higher) score.
- a noise profile score can also be estimated, where a less noisy image (e.g., image having less color noise) receives a better (e.g., higher) score.
- a sharpness score can also be determined, where a sharper image receives a better (e.g., higher) score.
- the scores can be summed to obtain an overall visual quality score indicating an overall visual quality of the final modified image.
- an overall visual quality score can be determined by evaluating additional and/or alternative characteristics of the final modified image.
- Some implementations can determine an overall visual quality score for the original input image instead of the final modified image. For example, a visual quality of the input image can be evaluated and visual quality score determined by a different process before the method 400 is performed, where the method 400 obtains the overall visual quality score from that process.
- the method combines the total impact score and the overall visual quality score to obtain a ranking score.
- the two scores can be summed, and/or another one or more functions used to combine the scores.
- the combination of impact score and visual quality score can reduce the chance of a lower-quality image having a high ranking score.
- Some implementations can omit the use of visual quality score in determining the ranking score for an image.
- the method determines a visual impact ranking of the final modified image with respect to one or more other, different images that have had a ranking score determined (e.g., based on modifications to those images and visual quality of those images similarly as described above).
- the method can compare the ranking score determined in block 430 with ranking scores associated with the other images to determine the ranking of the final modified image. This ranking can thus be based on the visual quality as well as the visual impact of modifications made to the image.
- the final modified image having the highest ranking score can be assigned the highest rank, followed by the final modified image having the next highest ranking score, etc.
- the blocks described in the methods of FIGS. 2-4 can be performed in a different order than shown and/or simultaneously (partially or completely) with other blocks, where appropriate. In some implementations, blocks can occur multiple times, in a different order, and/or at different times in the methods.
- the impact scores of block 408 can be determined at a variety of times in various implementations. The impact scores can be determined at the same time an input image is processed and modified by edit operations, can be determined in advance of image modification (e.g., when parameters of upcoming edit operations can be estimated), or can be determined after the image was modified based on saved values of parameters and any other needed stored information describing the edit operation(s).
- the input image can be part of a video sequence of images, e.g., a frame in a sequence of video frames.
- the method can determine impact scores for each of multiple frames of the video sequence. Some implementations can determine a total impact score for the entire video sequence of images, e.g., as a function of impact scores of individual edit operations applied to single frames. Alternatively, some edit operations may be multi-frame edit operations that are applied to multiple frames of a video. The method can determine an individual impact score for each multi-frame edit operation, and a total impact score for the video sequence can be a function of multi frame filter scores or a function of both single-frame and multi-frame filter scores.
- different versions of an input image can be used to determine the impact scores and ranking of the input image, and/or different versions can be used in the visualization.
- the “image” processed in the methods herein can be a version of an input image.
- an input image can be downscaled or upscaled to a version that has different size and/or pixel resolution (e.g., a preview image or thumbnail image), and the impact scores can be determined based on the scaled input image.
- such scaled versions of the input image can be the basis for the visualization images added to the visualization instead of using the actual input image.
- a system can provide a recommendation or selection of one or more edit operations based on visual impact of the edit operations determined as described herein.
- a visual impact edit threshold can be predetermined, and/or can be specified by a user, e.g., via a user interface, stored user preferences, etc., to specify a desired visual impact.
- the recommendation or selection by the system can be based on whether the individual impact scores of edit operations satisfy the visual impact edit threshold, e.g., whether an edit operation provides (or does not provide) the desired visual impact.
- a user can input different parameters to an edit operation, the system determines the visual impact on an input image, and the system outputs an indication of the visual impact of the edit operation on the input image.
- the user can input one or more different parameters to the edit operation to further determine visual impact of the edit operation on the input image or on a modified image.
- the system can recommend or disapprove the particular edit operation for future use in modifying images, e.g., via visual displayed output.
- a system can determine which edit operations of the one or more edit operations are to be retained and applied to create the output image as described in FIGS. 2-4 and which of the one or more edit operations are to be disregarded and not applied to create the output image. For example, in an initial test to determine impact scores, the system can apply the one or more edit operations to the image and determine individual impact scores as described herein, and compare the resulting individual impact score of each edit operation to the visual impact edit threshold.
- Edit operations that have an individual impact score satisfying the visual impact edit threshold can be retained and edit operations that have an individual impact score not satisfying the visual impact edit threshold can be disregarded. For example, only the qualifying edit operations can be applied to the image to create the output image.
- a score satisfying the visual impact edit threshold can be a score greater than the threshold, less than the threshold, in a range defined by multiple thresholds, etc.
- the retained edit operations can be the edit operations that produce modified images that qualify for inclusion in the visualization as described above with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4 .
- a system can test the application of multiple types of edit operations on an image and use the resulting impact scores determined in any of the methods described herein to recommend or select one (or more) of the edit operations having a desired visual effect on the image. For example, an edit operation can be selected having the highest individual impact score, lowest individual impact score, etc. of multiple tested edit operations.
- the modified image resulting from the selected edit operation can be retained and included in the visualization while modified images resulting from other tested edit operations can be discarded or ignored.
- the one or more edit operations can be applied to the image in one or more different orders and impact scores can be determined for each order applied.
- a different total impact score may result depending on the order of application of the edit operations to the image.
- Some implementations can test multiple different orders of application of the edit operations and can recommend or select an order of edit operations providing a desired visual effect on the image. For example, an order of application providing the highest total impact score out of the tested orders of application can be selected as the desired order of edit operations to be applied to the image.
- the methods of FIGS. 2, 3 , and/or 4 can apply edit operations, determine total impact scores, and/or determine visualizations for one or more portions of an image, where a portion can be an area of the image less than the entire area of the image.
- the portion can be a predetermined area with a predetermined size and/or shape (e.g., square or circular regions), or can be an area determined based on one or more detected features in the image, such as color edges, an outline of a detected object, face, or other recognized feature, etc.
- block 206 of FIG. 2 can determine individual impact scores for edit operations applied to a particular portion of the image, and block 208 of FIG. 2 can determine an overall degree of visual impact on (and/or total impact score for) that particular portion of the image.
- a total impact score can be determined for each modified portion of the image, e.g., multiple impact scores determined for multiple portions of the same image.
- Some implementations can apply the one or more edit operations to the entire image, and determine individual impact scores for those edit operations indicative of degrees of visual impact of the edit operations to a particular portion of the image. A total impact score can also be determined for that particular portion. Other portions in the image can similarly be associated with individual impact scores and a total impact score. Thus the impact of an edit operation applied to the entire image can be determined for one or more particular image portions. For example, an edit may affect different portions of the image differently. Some implementations can test multiple types of edit operations on an image and use this impact information from different image portions, for example, to select one (or more) of the edit operations having a desired effect on the image portions for actual application to the image.
- edit operation(s) can be selected having the highest mean total impact score based on the total impact scores determined in multiple image portions, or the lowest mean total impact score, highest or lowest variance between total impact scores in different regions (e.g., to vary brightness or contrast throughout an image), etc.
- FIGS. 3 and 4 can provide visualizations that include displayed indications of the modified portion(s) of the image (e.g., where the modified portion(s) are highlighted in a particular color or shading, are outlined, or are otherwise indicated).
- a single visualization can highlight multiple modified portions in each modified image included in the visualization.
- Some implementations can provide a different and/or separate visualization for each modified portion of an image.
- the methods 200 , 300 , and 400 can be implemented, for example, on a server system (e.g., server system 102 shown in FIG. 1 ).
- a server system e.g., server system 102 shown in FIG. 1
- one or more client devices e.g., client devices shown in FIG. 1
- an image can be modified or enhanced by edit operations on a client device and impact scores can be determined on a server device, or vice versa.
- Methods described herein can be implemented by program instructions or code, which can be executed on a computer.
- the code can be implemented by one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors or other processing circuitry), and can be stored on a computer program product including a non-transitory computer readable medium (e.g., storage medium), e.g., a magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, or semiconductor storage medium, including semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), flash memory, a rigid magnetic disk, an optical disk, a solid-state memory drive, etc.

- the program instructions can also be contained in, and provided as, an electronic signal, for example in the form of software as a service (SaaS) delivered from a server (e.g., a distributed system and/or a cloud computing system).
- SaaS software as a service
- a server e.g., a distributed system and/or a cloud computing system.
- one or more methods can be implemented in hardware (logic gates, etc.), or in a combination of hardware and software.
- One or more methods can be performed as part of or component of an application running on the system, or as an application or software running in conjunction with other applications and operating system.
- FIG. 5 is a diagrammatic illustration of an example input image 500 that can be processed using one or more features described herein.
- image 500 can be displayed on a display device, e.g., of a client device 120 , 122 , 124 , and/or 126 of FIG. 1 , or a server system 102 in some implementations.
- the input image 500 can be processed as described herein without being displayed, or can be displayed after all processing is complete, e.g., in a visualization.
- a user can view images shown in FIGS. 5-9 displayed in a graphical user interface by a display device of a client device. Images 500 , 600 , 700 , 800 , and 900 are shown as line drawings in FIGS. 5-9 for explanatory purposes to represent images with pixels, including images that have had various edit operations applied.
- Methods and systems described above can receive input image 500 and process modified images shown below that are originally derived from image 500 .
- a method that measures impact of image modifications and/or determines a visualization of image modifications can apply the edit operations to obtain the modified images below, and/or can receive one or more of these modified images that have had edit operations applied by other methods or systems, as well as receive information describing the edit operations performed.
- method 400 can be used to measure image modifications and determine a visualization of the image modifications.
- Input image 500 is added to a visualization created for the image 500 , and is the first image in the visualization. Furthermore, in this example, input image 500 is analyzed by a system that can perform an automatic enhancement to the image to improve quality.
- the automatic enhancement involves the application of one or more edit operations which are applied to the image if the system determines such edit operations are needed based on analyzing the image.
- the system determines that input image 500 should be modified with a number of edit operations applied in a particular sequence as described in FIGS. 6-9 .
- shown modifications are approximated in line drawings and may be exaggerated in magnitude for explanatory purposes.
- the system can refer to indirect user input (e.g., stored user preferences or settings) to guide the evaluation and application of edit operations, e.g., to the image 500 .
- indirect user input e.g., stored user preferences or settings
- user-specified thresholds may have been previously input.
- some or all of the edit operations can be determined and/or instructed manually by a user with direct user input (e.g., instructing particular edit operations with particular parameters to be performed, in a displayed image editing program or other interface, for example) instead of automatically being performed by a system without direct user input.
- FIG. 6 shows an example modified image 600 resulting from the application of an edit operation to input image 500 .
- the system has applied an edit operation that includes a brightness filter, contrast filter, and saturation filter to provide the modified image 600 .
- the method 400 can then evaluate the modified image 600 to determine its visual impact, e.g., determine an individual impact score for that edit operation.
- each of these filters can be considered its own individual edit operation, so that an individual impact score can be determined for each filter.
- the method can determine the individual impact score for the edit operation based on factors.
- Factors can include characteristics such as, for example, the type of edit operation (e.g., brightness can have a strong visual impact), magnitudes of parameters used by the edit operation (small magnitudes applied in this case), percentage of image area modified by the edit operation (e.g., the whole image, in this case), and importance of modified image areas (e.g., important areas are affected in this case, such as a face as detected in the image using one or more facial recognition techniques).
- the system combines (e.g., sums) individual impact scores for edit operations performed since the last image was added to the visualization, which in this case only involves the individual impact score for this edit operation.
- the system finds that the accumulated impact score is above (e.g., satisfies) the impact score threshold, and so the modified image 600 is added to the visualization as the second visualization image after the first image 500 .
- FIG. 7 shows an example modified image 700 resulting from the application of a next edit operation in sequence to the modified image 600 .
- the system has applied an edit operation that includes a skin softening filter to provide the modified image 700 , e.g., a blurriness added to facial features (approximated with grey facial lines in FIG. 7 ).
- the method can determine the impact score for the edit operation based on factors that can include the type of edit operation (e.g., skin softening which has a high visual impact since it affects a face), magnitude of parameters used (low magnitude in this example), percentage of image area affected (e.g., just the face area in this example), and importance of modified image areas (e.g., important areas such as the face were affected in this example).
- the method 400 then combines (e.g., sums) individual impact scores for edit operations performed since the last image was added to the visualization, which in this case only involves the individual impact score for this skin softening edit operation.
- the method finds that the accumulated impact score is above the impact score threshold, and so the modified image 700 is added to the visualization as the third visualization image positioned after the second image 600 in a visualization sequence.
- FIG. 8 shows an example modified image 800 resulting from the application of multiple edit operations in sequence to modified image 700 .
- the system has applied multiple edit operations including a sharpness filter applied to modified image 700 at a low parameter magnitude, and then a color filter applied to the sharpened image at a low parameter setting to remove a small amount of detected color cast.
- These edit operations are each evaluated to find individual impact scores, e.g., based on one or more factors similarly as described above.
- the impact score of the sharpness filter is below the impact score threshold and so its resulting associated modified image is not added to the visualization.
- the accumulated impact score includes the impact score of the sharpness filter plus the impact score of the color filter. In this example, this accumulated impact score is still below the impact score threshold, so the modified image resulting from application of the color filter is also not added to the visualization.
- the system applies an edit operation including a vignette filter to the latest modified image resulting from application of the color filter.
- the resulting image is modified image 800 .
- the method can determine the impact score for this edit operation based on factors that can include the type of edit operation (e.g., vignette in this case, which may not have a high visual impact since it does not affect a face directly), magnitude of parameters used (in this case, high magnitude parameters to darken the image border areas significantly), percentage of image area affected (e.g., in this case, much of the image around the face), and importance of modified image areas (e.g., unimportant areas such as the border areas are affected in this case).
- the type of edit operation e.g., vignette in this case, which may not have a high visual impact since it does not affect a face directly
- magnitude of parameters used in this case, high magnitude parameters to darken the image border areas significantly
- percentage of image area affected e.g., in this case, much of the image around the face
- the method 400 then combines (e.g., sums) individual impact scores for edit operations performed since the last image was added to the visualization to determine the accumulated impact score, which in this case involves the individual impact scores for the sharpness filter, the color filter, and the vignette filter.
- the method finds that the accumulated impact score is above the impact score threshold, and so the modified image 800 is added to the visualization as the fourth visualization image after the third image 700 .
- FIG. 9 shows an example modified image 900 that is the final image added to the visualization.
- image 800 is the final image of the visualization.
- the method can add one or more labels to the image 800 , such as the example label 902 shown in FIG. 9 , to create image 900 which, in some implementations, can be stored in place of image 800 as the final image of the visualization.
- the system can determine a total impact score for the final modified image based on the individual impact scores for all the edit operations applied as described above.
- the total impact score can be combined with an overall quality score of the image 800 (or image 900 ) to determine a ranking score that is compared with ranking scores similarly determined for other images to determine a ranking of the final modified image 800 or 900 with reference to rankings of the other images.
- FIG. 10 shows an example of a displayed visualization 1000 in which visualization images are presented simultaneously in a vertical column.
- the images 500 (with label added), 600 , 700 , and 900 are shown in the sequential order in which they were produced by the sequentially-applied edit operations.
- Example labels have also been added in association with some of the images.
- the first and last images in the sequence include the labels “original image” and “final image,” respectively.
- labels 1002 have each been added to one side of an associated one of the last three images in the sequence to indicate which edit operation(s) were applied since the previous image in the sequence to obtain the associated image. This can allow a user to view the changes made to the image by an automatic modification process and/or by a user manually instructing edit operations to an image.
- implementations can present the visualization images in a row or other configuration (box, diagonal line, etc.). Some implementations can display only one or a subset of the visualization images at a time, and present the other visualization images automatically over time or in response to input of a user viewing the visualization, e.g., display the visualization images in a time sequence.
- the total impact score, and/or a message based on the total impact score can be displayed as part of the visualization (e.g., near the final image of the visualization, etc.).
- the ranking of the output image can be displayed as part of the visualization, e.g., displayed as a ranking number indicating the ranking.
- a description of a set of images in which the ranking applies can also be displayed, e.g., a set of images of a user's collection, a set of images uploaded by users to a network service in a particular time frame, etc.
