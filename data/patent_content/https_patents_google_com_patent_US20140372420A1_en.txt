Description
- 1. Field of the Invention
- Embodiments of this invention relate generally to search industries and, more particularly, to special purpose machines, systems, methods and computer instructions for providing search results relating to mobile entities.
- 2. Description of the Related Art
- The Internet provides access to a large number of resources, including, for example, webpages, maps, articles, files, and the like. To locate resources on the Internet, persons often employ Internet searches or similar resource locating services. For example, a person may visit an Internet search website and submit search query for “ice cream” in hopes of locating nearby businesses that serve ice cream. Search results are typically displayed in a ranked listing based at least in part on their relevance to the search query, and may be accompanied by a map illustrating locations associated with at least some of the search results. For example, search results for the search query “ice cream” may include a listing of nearby ice cream shops, and a map having markers at the locations of the ice cream shops.
- Unfortunately, the search results provided to the user may only correspond to brick-and-mortar businesses having a fixed location, and may not include results for “mobile” businesses (i.e., business that have a variable location). For example, the search results for the search query “ice cream” may include search results for brick-and-mortar ice-cream shops near the user, but may not include a search result for an ice cream truck that is located even closer to the user. Thus, the search results may not provide a complete listing of results that are of interest to the user.
- Various embodiments of methods and apparatus for identifying and providing search results relating to mobile entities are provided herein. In some embodiments, provided is a computer-implemented method that includes receiving mobile business location information indicative of a geographic location of a mobile business, receiving a search request, identifying a set of search results responsive to the search request, the set of search results including a search result corresponding to the mobile business, identifying a current geographic location of the mobile business based at least in part on the mobile business location information, ranking the set of search results based at least in part on the current geographic location associated with the mobile business to generate a set of ranked search results, and providing the set of ranked search results for display.
- In some embodiments, provided is a system including one or more memories storing instructions and one or more processors coupled to the one or more memories and configured to execute the instructions stored thereon to perform the following steps: receiving mobile business location information indicative of a geographic location of a mobile business, receiving a search request, identifying a set of search results responsive to the search request, the set of search results including a search result corresponding to the mobile business, identifying a current geographic location of the mobile business based at least in part on the mobile business location information, ranking the set of search results based at least in part on the current geographic location associated with the mobile business to generate a set of ranked search results, and providing the set of ranked search results for display.
- In some embodiments, provided is a non-transitory computer readable medium comprising program instructions stored thereon that are executable by a processor to cause the following steps: receiving mobile business location information indicative of a geographic location of a mobile business, receiving a search request, identifying a set of search results responsive to the search request, the set of search results including a search result corresponding to the mobile business, identifying a current geographic location of the mobile business based at least in part on the mobile business location information, ranking the set of search results based at least in part on the current geographic location associated with the mobile business to generate a set of ranked search results, and providing the set of ranked search results for display.

FIG. 6 is a block diagram that illustrates a search query environment in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. -
FIG. 7 is a block diagram that illustrates an exemplary computer system in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. - As discussed in more detail below, provided are systems and methods for providing search results relating to mobile entities. Although certain embodiments are described with regard to mobile businesses for the purpose of illustration, it will be appreciated that the same or similar techniques may be employed for any variety of mobile entities (i.e., entities that are associated with a variable geographic location).
- An “Internet search” or “web search” may include a search that is employed by a user to locate resources on the Internet. An Internet search may include, for example, a free-text web search, a map-based web search or the like. A free-text web search may include employing user submitted search criteria, such as a text search string or similar query, to search the Internet for resources that match or are otherwise related thereto. A map-based web search may include may include employing user submitted search criteria to search the Internet for resources relating to places (e.g., locations, business, landmarks, points of interest, etc.) that match or are otherwise related thereto. The search results that are identified are typically displayed to the user in a list, a map or similar presentation format. For example, the user may be presented with an ordered listing of a given number of the highest ranked search results of the set of search results (e.g., including links to webpages, maps, or other resources that correspond to the highest ranked search results). Although certain embodiments are described herein with regard to map-based searches for the purpose of illustration, it will be appreciated that the same or similar techniques may be provided for any variety of searches, such as free-text, universal searches (i.e., searches that combine results from a plurality of different types of searches, such as, map-based searches and so forth), and the like.
- As described herein, certain embodiments include receiving mobile business location information (e.g., location information indicative of the dynamic/variable geographic location of a mobile business) and providing search results that are based on a location of the mobile business at or near the time of a corresponding search query. For example, a mobile business operator may provide mobile business location information for their business, which is stored in a database, and, upon receiving a search query for which the mobile business is identified as a search result, the mobile business location information may be used to determine a location of the mobile business at or near the time of the search and a ranking of the search result corresponding to the mobile business may be adjusted (e.g., boosted/lowered) based at least in part on the determined location. Such a technique may enable search results to reflect the location of mobile businesses at or near the time of a search query. For example, when a user submits a search for “ice cream” and an ice cream truck mobile business is not in the vicinity of the user, the result for the ice cream truck may not be ranked high enough to be listed in the search results that are displayed to the user. However, when the user submits the search for “ice cream” and the ice cream truck mobile business is in the vicinity of the user, the result for the ice cream truck may be ranked high enough to be listed in the search results that are displayed to the user. Thus, the user may be provided with a complete listing of search results, including mobile businesses that are determined to be located near the user at the time of the search.
- In some embodiments, in an effort to aid the user in interpreting the search results, the displayed search results may include an indication that a result corresponds to a mobile business. For example, a search result for the ice cream truck may be accompanied by an icon (e.g., an icon depicting a car) that is indicative of the search result being associated with a mobile business. As a further example, a map-based search result for the ice cream truck may include a map having a marker (e.g., an icon depicting a car) at a current location of the ice cream truck and a path indicative of the expected route for the ice cream truck and/or markers that identify locations along the route and expected times of arrival of the mobile business at those locations. Search results associated with fixed locations, such as business having brick-and-mortar locations, may be associated with different identifiers, such as a pin style marker, thereby enabling the user to quickly decipher which results correspond to mobile businesses and which search results do not.
- The mobile business location information for a mobile business may be obtained in a variety of manners. For example, the mobile business location information for a mobile business may be obtained via tracking of the mobile business (e.g., real-time tracking of the location of a mobile device carried on the ice cream truck), via manual location updates (e.g., via regular social network updates, such social status updates, such as microblog messages (e.g., “Tweets”), location messages (e.g., “check-ins”) or the like, submitted by the ice cream truck driver using Twitter, Google Latitude or a similar service), or via a predefined route (e.g., a route/schedule that indicates where the ice cream truck will be and when).
-
FIG. 1 is a flowchart that illustrates amethod 100 of updating mobile business location information in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.Method 100 may generally include receiving mobile business location information, such as route information, dynamic location updates, or the like, that is indicative of a location of a mobile business and updating an entity database (or similar data repository) to reflect the mobile business location information. Although certain embodiments are described with respect to receiving and updating location information for a single business for the purpose of illustration, it will be appreciated that such techniques can be used to receive an update location for any number of mobile businesses. That ismethod 100 may be repeated for any number of updates for any number of mobile businesses. -
Method 100 may include receiving mobile business location information indicative of the location of a mobile business (block 102). In some embodiments, the mobile business location information is received by a search provider from a mobile business operator, and may be employed to determine a location of the mobile business at various times of the day. For example, an operator of a mobile business, such as an ice cream truck driver, may submit, to a search provider, information about the location of their mobile business and various times throughout the day, and the search provider may store the mobile business location information for use in determining a location of the mobile business at or near the time of a search query that is later submitted by a user. - In some embodiments, receiving mobile business location information indicative of the location of a mobile business includes receiving route information indicative of the expected location of mobile business. For example, where an ice cream truck has a regular route that traverses a neighborhood, the ice cream truck operator may specify route information indicative where the ice cream truck will be and when. The route information may include one or more locations along a route and times when it is expected that the mobile business will be at those locations. For example, the operator of the ice cream truck may specify route information indicating that the ice cream truck will be at 100 Main St. at 1:15 pm, at 200 Main St. at 1:20 pm, at 1100 2nd St. at 1:25 pm, and so forth. Accordingly, the route information may include one or more locations along a route, and a schedule for the mobile business arriving at those locations.
- In some embodiments, receiving mobile business location information indicative of the location of a mobile business includes receiving manual location updates indicative of a current location of the mobile business. For example, while traversing the route for the ice cream truck, the ice cream truck operator may periodically submit manual location updates that provide the current location of the ice cream truck. The location updates may be submitted via a mobile device, such as a mobile phone, that travels with the mobile business. For example, upon arriving at 100 Main St. at 1:15 pm, the ice cream truck operator may simply open a locating application (e.g., Google Latitude) on the operator's mobile phone, and submit a “check-in” for the ice cream truck business. Upon submitting the check-in, the location (e.g. geographic coordinates) of the mobile phone may be determined (e.g., via an integrated positioning device, such as a GPS device in the phone, triangulation using cellular-phone towers, or the like), and the determined location may be associated with the ice cream truck at the time of the check-in.
- In some embodiments, receiving mobile business location information indicative of the location of a mobile business includes receiving automatic location updates indicative of a current location of the mobile business. For example, while traversing the route for the ice cream truck, the location of the ice cream truck may be tracked in real-time (e.g., tracking the ice cream truck's location at least hourly or more often) to provide the current location of the ice cream truck. Tracking may be accomplished via regular querying of the location a mobile device, such as a mobile phone, that travels with the mobile business. For example, a mobile phone of the operator of the ice cream truck may be queried (e.g., by a server) once per minute to track the location of the ice cream truck as it traverses its route. Thus, a 1:15 pm, 1:16 pm, 1:17 pm and so forth, the location (e.g. geographic coordinates) of the mobile phone may be determined (e.g., via an integrated positioning device, such as a GPS device in the phone, triangulation using cellular-phone towers, or the like) and the determined locations may be associated with the ice cream truck at each of the respective times. In some embodiments, the tracking may be effectuated by location updates initiated by a mobile device associated with the mobile business. For example, a locating application executing on the mobile phone of the ice cream truck operator may be employed to automatically send location updates (e.g., to a server) on a regular basis (e.g., once every five minutes). In some embodiments, the tracking may occur only during a given timeframe and/or at a specified interval. For example, the ice cream truck operator may specify that tracking of the ice cream truck take place during business hours (e.g., 8 am to 5 pm) and at a given interval (e.g., once every five minutes).
-
Method 100 may include updating an entity database to reflect the mobile business location information indicative of the location of the mobile business (block 104). In some embodiments, a database of entities includes entries for traditional businesses (e.g., brick and mortar businesses associated with a fixed/static location) as well as entries for mobile businesses (e.g., businesses associated with a variable location). The entries for traditional businesses may be associated with static location information that is indicative of one or more fixed locations (e.g., a given street address, a given set of geographic coordinates or the like), whereas entries for mobile businesses may be associated with a variable location information (e.g., predefined routes, dynamic location updates, such as check-ins/tracking, or the like) that is indicative of movement of the mobile business and/or is capable of being dynamically updated to reflect changes in location of the mobile business. Referring now toFIG. 2 , which includes a table that illustrates an entity database storing mobile business location information in accordance with one more embodiments of the present invention, an entry corresponding to a mobile business may be may be associated with corresponding mobile location information, whereas entries corresponding to business or other entities having fixed locations may be associated with non-mobile location information. For example, the entries for “The Ice Cream Truck” and the “Airport Shuttle” are associated with mobile business location information “LI1” and “LI4,” respectively) that includes, or is at least based on mobile business location information, such as predefined routes, location updates (e.g., check-ins/tracking), or the like, for the respective businesses. Thus for example, where the operator provides route information for the ice cream truck, LI1 may include the route information. Where dynamic location updates are provided for the ice cream truck (e.g., via check-in, tracking, or the like), LI1 may include the location information associated with the dynamic updates (e.g., a time of the update and geographic coordinates indicative of a location of a mobile device associated with the mobile business at the time of the update). Table 200 may be updated dynamically as mobile business location information is received. Entries for business having a fixed location, such as “The Ice Cream Parlor” and “The Restaurant” are associated with non-mobile business location information “LI2” and “LI3,” respectively. Such information may include fixed locations (e.g., addresses or geographic coordinates associated with the businesses brick-and-mortar locations). Such non-mobile business location information may not be based on mobile business location information, such as predefined routes, location updates (e.g., check-ins/tracking), or the like, for the respective businesses. - As discussed herein, such mobile business location information may be used to identify, rank and/or display search results. For example, the location of mobile businesses may be determined at or near the time of a search query (based at least in part on the mobile business location information), and the determined locations may be used to rank the search results for the query.
-
FIG. 3 is a flowchart that illustrates a method of servicing asearch query 300 in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.Method 300 may generally include receiving a search query, identifying a set of search results responsive to the search query, determining whether at least one of the search results identified correspond to a mobile business, and, in response to determining that at least one of the search results identified corresponds to a mobile business, identifying geographic locations associated with the mobile business, ranking the set of search results based on the determined locations and providing the ranked set of search results for display. Although certain embodiments are described with respect to a single mobile business of the search results for the purpose of illustration, it will be appreciated that such techniques can be used for search results including any number of mobile businesses. -
Method 300 may include receiving a search query (block 302). In some embodiments, receiving a search query includes a search server receiving a search query submitted by a user. For example, a user may submit the search string “ice cream” via a search application, such as a free-text or map-based search webpage. The search query may be received by a search server that is tasked with servicing the search query. -
Method 300 may include identifying a set of search results responsive to the search query (block 304). In some embodiments, identifying a set of search results responsive to the search query includes identifying a plurality of search results that are related to the search query. For example, the search server may identify the search results corresponding to “The Ice Cream Parlor,” “The Restaurant,” “The Ice Cream Shop”, “The Ice Cream Truck”, and so forth in response to the map-based search query for “ice cream”. -
Method 300 may include determining whether at least one of the search results of the set of search results identified corresponds to a mobile business (block 306). It may be determined that at least one of the search results of the set of search results identified corresponds to a mobile business if at least one of the search results is identified as a mobile business and/or is associated with mobile business location information. For example, the search server may determine that the set of search results responsive to the map-based search query for “ice cream” includes a result for a mobile business based on the set of search results including the search result for “The Ice Cream Truck”. In some embodiments, in response to determining that the set of search results does not include a result corresponding to a mobile business, the process may proceed to ranking (block 307) and displaying the set of search results (block 312). For example, the search server may rank the set of search results based at least in part on fixed location information associated with some the search results of the set of search results, and serve a search results webpage, including the ranked set of search results, for display to the user. -
Method 300 may include identifying a location associated with the mobile business in response to determining that the set of search results does include at least one result corresponding to a mobile business (block 308). In some embodiments, determining a location associated with the mobile business includes determining a location of the mobile business based at least in part on the mobile business location information currently associated with the mobile business. For example, the server may determine a location for the ice cream truck based on the mobile business location information LI1 that is currently associated with the ice cream truck. Where the mobile business location information includes route information for the mobile business, determining a location associated with the mobile business may include estimating or otherwise determining a location of the mobile business at or near the time of the search query based on the route information. For example, where the route information that indicates that the ice cream truck will be at 100 Main St. at 1:15 pm, at 200 Main St. at 1:20 pm, at 1100 2nd St. at 1:25 pm and so forth, and the search query is received at 1:17 pm, the server may estimate the location of the ice cream truck as about half-way between 100 Main St. and 200 Main St. based on an interpolation of the specified locations of 100 Main St. at 1:15 pm and 200 Main St. at 1:20 pm. In some embodiments, the location is determined as the location specified as being visited immediately prior to the time of the query. For example, the server may determine the location of the ice cream truck to be 100 Main St. based on the query time of 1:17 pm. In some embodiments, the location is determined as the location to be visited immediately following the time of the query. For example, the server may determine the location of the ice cream truck to be 200 Main St. based on the query time of 1:17 pm. Further, a location for the mobile business may be determined based on one or more prior location updates. For example, where a location update is received at 1:15 pm that indicates the ice cream truck is located at 100 Main St., the server may determine the location of the ice cream truck to be 100 Main St. based on the most recent location update (i.e., the location update received immediately prior to the search query). -
Method 300 may include ranking the set of search results based at least in part on the determined location (block 310). In some embodiments, ranking the set of search results may include ranking each of the search results relative to one another based on a plurality of factors, such as relevance to the search string, proximity of a location associated with the user to a location associated with the search result, and so forth. In some instances, ranking includes scoring the search results based on the various factors, and ranking the search results based on the scoring (e.g., a search results having a high score may be ranked/ordered above one or more other search results having a lower score and vice versa). Thus, for example, where ranking is based at least in part on a proximity of a location associated with the user to a location associated with the search result, a search result for a mobile business may experience a boost of its score/ranking when it is located proximate to the location associated with the user and/or may experience a decrease in score/ranking when it is not located proximate the location associated with the user. -
FIGS. 4A and 4B are tables that illustrate ranked sets of search results in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention.FIG. 4A is a table that illustrates a first set of ranked search results for the search query “ice cream” submitted at or about 1:05 pm (e.g., when the ice cream truck is still far away from the user), andFIG. 4B is a table that illustrates a second set of ranked search results for the same search query submitted twelve minutes later (e.g., at or about 1:17 pm) (e.g., when the ice cream truck is close to the user). Locations “L1” and “L5” for the ice cream truck may be determined based on the mobile business location information “LI1” (seeFIG. 2 ). Accordingly, where, for example, the location “L5” is closer than “L1” to a location associated with the user, the search result for the ice cream truck may receive a boost in score/ranking relative to the other search results as it approaches the location associated with the user. Moreover, as the ice cream truck moves away from the location associated with the user the search result for the ice cream truck may experience a decrease in its score/ranking relative to the other search results. -
Method 300 may include providing the ranked set of search results for display (block 312). In some embodiments, providing the ranked set of search results for display includes serving the set of search results for display to the user. For example, upon identifying and ranking the search results, the server may generate a search results webpage, including a given number of the highest ranked search results of the set ofsearch results -
