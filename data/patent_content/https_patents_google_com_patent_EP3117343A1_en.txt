Definitions
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which content for native applications are subject to being verified as consistent with web content.
- a resource publisher website 104 includes one or more web resources 105 associated with a domain and hosted by one or more servers in one or more locations.
- a resource publisher website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 is maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104.
- the web index 112 is an index of publisher content that has, for example, been built from crawling the publisher web sites 104, by receiving data feeds from the publisher websites 104, or by other appropriate methods of collecting and indexing data.
- Fig. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for verifying native application content.
- the process 200 can be implemented in a data processing apparatus of one or more computers in data communication.
- the process 200 determines if the first content and the second content are consistent content (208).
- the content is determined to be consistent if one or more comparison processes, such as entity matching, n-gram similarity, phrase matching, and feature similarity, indicate a threshold level of consistency between the first and second content.
- comparison processes such as entity matching, n-gram similarity, phrase matching, and feature similarity.
- the process 300 extracts first n-grams from the first content and second n- grams from the second content (312).
- the n-grams may be, for example, bi-grams and tri-grams.
- the content can be parsed to produce the n-grams, or the n-grams may be extracted if they exist in a predefined dictionary of n-grams.
- the identification data for identifying native applications installed on the user device is a user device identifier that uniquely identifies the user device.
- the search system 110 (or another system in data communication with the search engine) can accesses account data for the device identifier, where the account data specifies native applications installed on the device.
- the account for example, may be a user account through which a user purchases native applications for installation on the user device. If the account is tied to more than one user device, where each device may have different native applications installed, then the identification data can be a combination of the device identifier and an account identifier different from the device identifier. As both identifiers are tied to the account, the account data specifies the native applications installed on each user device tied to the account.
- the account data can be stored in the native application data 114, or be accessible by the native application search result generator 116.
- selection of the image 534, or any other portion of the native application search result 532, at the user device causes the native application to launch and request the content that is relevant to the search query.
- the search result 530 would be a web resource search result instead of a native application search result.
- a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer.
- a display device e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor
- a keyboard and a pointing device e.g., a mouse or a trackball
- Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a user computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components.
- the components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network.
- Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- inter-network e.g., the Internet
- peer-to-peer networks e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks.
