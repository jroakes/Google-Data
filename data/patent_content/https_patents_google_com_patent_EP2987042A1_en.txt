Definitions
- This patent specification relates to systems, apparatus, methods, and related computer program products for controlling an HVAC system during a demand-response event. More particularly, this patent specification relates to techniques for intelligently selecting and/or optimizing a control trajectory of an HVAC system during a demand-response event.
- Demand also generally tends to vary based on work habits, where demand peaks when people leave for work and again when people return from work. During some points in the year, such as during extremely hot days, demand may reach extreme peaks.
- Utility companies have a variety of options for dealing with the variable demand for energy. They may, for example, increase their ability to satisfy higher peak demands by building additional power plants. However, the costs of doing so are often prohibitive and building such plants is often inefficient as the added capacity is used for only short durations throughout the year. They may buy additional capacity from other utility company's or energy providers, but doing so is also costly as such company's may charge a premium and the energy transfer from those other companies is often less efficient. Instead of increasing supply, utility companies may also address peak demands by reducing the demand via load shedding.
- Load shedding is a technique in which the utility company reduces the amount of energy demanded by its consumers during a period of peak demand.
- a variety of load shedding techniques are in use today, most of which are based on the utility company directly controlling the cooling systems of its consumers. During such peak demand periods the utility company controls the cooling systems to reduce their energy demand.
- Such events which most often take place on very hot days in the mid-to-late afternoon and have a duration in the general range of two to six hours, are referenced in the literature by a variety of different names such as load shedding events, load shifting events, and demand response events.
- the goal of the utility company in carrying out such events is not necessarily to reduce the total amount of energy consumed over the whole day, but rather to reduce the peak demand during that particular two-to-six hour interval, i.e., during the load shedding interval or demand-response interval.
- the end result is that the energy that would have been consumed during the load shedding interval is instead consumed in the hours subsequent to the load shedding interval, as the cooling systems of the participating homes work to regain their cooler normal setpoint temperature.
- Such control often creates an inconvenience to the consumers who sign up to participate in such a 'demand response program' as their cooling system may not cool their residence as expected. However, in return for this inconvenience the consumer is often granted certain benefits, such as more favorable rates for energy consumed outside of the peak demand period.
- One common load shedding technique involves the periodic on-and-off cycling of power to the cooling system of each participating customer under the direct control of the utility during the load shedding period.
- a remotely controllable switch is installed on the cooling system of each customer and is operable to disconnect power to the cooling system under the direct control of the utility company.
- the power to the cooling system may then be directly controlled by the utility company such that it is turned off for regular, fixed time intervals during a peak demand period.
- Consumers may express some degree of animosity towards such a technique, however, as direct load control results in a lack of control by the consumer of their cooling system, and often results in inside temperatures that are found to be uncomfortable by the consumer.
- Another known load shedding technique involves remote control of the setpoint temperature of the thermostat of each participating customer by the utility, wherein the utility sends a common setback value to the thermostats of the participating customers.
- the participating thermostats will control the indoor temperature to a temperature setpoint value that is higher than the normally scheduled temperature setpoint value by the setback amount.
- This control by the utility company will typically result in an ambient temperature that is less comfortable than what the consumers would have otherwise experienced, but provides the benefit of both energy and cost savings.
- this technique can have disadvantages including lack of control by the consumer and the utility company's ability to set the setback value to any value the utility company deems suitable.
- the use of a single setback value for all consumers fails to recognize differences in perceptions in comfort, differences in thermal characteristics of residences, differences in cooling capacities of the cooling systems, and other differences among the base of participating customers.
- U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0053745 to Howard Ng discusses a system and method for establishing load control during a load shedding event. Specifically, Ng discusses a technique that allows a customer or utility to control a maximum temperature rise under a direct load control program. The customer may set a comfort range on their thermostat that indicates a range of temperatures from a desired temperature that the customer is comfortable with.
- a switch on a space conditioning load is activated so that the space conditioning load undergoes direct load control (i.e., fixed-width duty cycling).
- the space conditioning load undergoes direct load control until the indoor temperature exceeds the upper value of the comfort range, at which point control will be transferred from direct load control to temperature setback control.
- One or more issues arise in relation to each of the above- described load shedding methods that is at least partially addressed by one or more of the embodiments described herein.
- the above described methods of direct load control, temperature setback control, and direct load control followed by temperature setback control will generally result in some amount of reduced energy use during the load shedding event across the base of participating customers, such "one-size-fits-all" approaches to the customer base can result in substantial missed opportunities for more effective load shifting and reduced customer inconvenience.
- such issues and/or missed opportunities can arise with respect to one or more of: predicting with greater certainty the impact of a particular load shedding strategy for certain groups or subgroups of participating customers; increasing the tolerability and acceptance of load shedding programs such that more customers will be willing to participate; optimizing the load shedding strategy for particular groups or subgroups of customers in a manner that (i) reduces the amount of customer discomfort per unit of shifted energy demand, and/or (ii) increases the amount of shifted energy demand per "unit" of customer discomfort for those groups or subgroups; more readily identifying the groups or subgroups of customers who would be the best candidates for participation in any particular load shedding event; and more readily assessing the effectiveness of preceding load shifting event strategies for particular groups or subgroups of customers such that future load shifting events are better optimized.
- Other issues arise as would be apparent to one skilled in the art upon reading the present disclosure.

- Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to techniques for controlling an HVAC system during a demand-response event.
- the entities in a system for controlling an HVAC system during a demand-response event typically include a utility provider that provides electrical or other forms of energy from a power source (e.g., an electrical generator) to individuals' homes or businesses.
- the individuals typically pay for the amount of energy they consume on a periodic, e.g., monthly, basis.
- an energy management system is disposed between the utility provider and the individuals.
- the energy management system operates to intelligently and effectively shift energy consumption of the individuals from one particular time period to other time periods. Such energy shifting is usually performed so as to shift energy consumption from a high energy cost period to a low energy cost period.
- energy is shifted from the DR event period to time periods outside of the DR event period.
- energy shifting may be motivated by an effort to reduce peak loads on the power grid.
- energy shifting may be motivated by a utility company's desire to sell energy supply to another utility company during a particular (e.g., high cost) period rather than to that utility company's own customers.
- the end user i.e,. energy consumer
- the energy consumer may be provided with an unprecedented level of control as to how their energy consumption devices (e.g., their HVAC system) are controlled during a DR event period.
- the energy consumer may select minimum disturbances to occupant discomfort which may result in minimal reductions in energy consumption, or may select maximum reductions in energy consumption which may result in greater disturbances to occupant discomfort, or may select something in between.
- Such a choice may be made prior to the DR event beginning, or during the DR event period, and in some cases may be modified during the DR event. Based on the user's choice, the most suitable HVAC control trajectory may be generated to attain such user defined objectives.
- the most suitable HVAC control trajectory may optimize a variety of HVAC control characteristics, such as the duration of a pre-cooling period, an amount of temperature setback applicable throughout the DR event period, and a maximum duty cycle of the HVAC.

- the energy management system includes an intelligent, network-connected thermostat located at an individual's home(s) or business(es). Such a thermostat can acquire various information about the residence, such as a thermal retention characteristic of the residence, a capacity of an HVAC associated with the residence to cool or heat the residence, a likelihood of the residence being occupied (via occupancy sensors that, over time, can build an occupancy probability profile), a forecasted weather, a real-time weather, a real-time occupancy, etc. Moreover, the thermostat can be programmed by its users or may learn, over time, the preferences and habits of its users to set scheduled temperature setpoints.
- a population of such network-connected thermostats associated with a respective population of individual homes and businesses is configured to communicate with one or more central servers managed by one or more cloud service providers.
- Each network- connected thermostat is associated with one or more accounts managed by the cloud service provider(s), and data is sent back and forth as needed between each network-connected thermostat and the central server(s) for providing a variety of advantageous functionalities such as facilitating remote control, reporting weather data, reporting HVAC control data and status information, and providing the centralized and/or partially centralized control and data communications useful for carrying out the DR-related, time-of-use (TOU)-related, and/or real-time pricing functionalities described herein.

- the energy management system Prior to a DR event, based on a wealth of information the energy management system possesses regarding the residences it is managing, the energy management system can effectively predict how much energy a residence is likely to consume over an given period, such as over a DR event.
- the energy management system may also generate variations to the residence's original thermostat setpoints that can be implemented during the DR event period. The variations can be made so that that the residence consumes less energy over the DR event period. Further yet, because of this wealth of information the energy management system has regarding the residences, the energy management system may also accurately predict the amount of energy likely to be reduced over the DR event period or, in other words, shifted from the DR event period to one or more time periods outside (e.g., shouldering) the DR event period.
- the energy management system disclosed herein may intelligently choose the participants in an energy savings program to maximize efficiency and minimize costs.

If a serious fire event is sensed, the remote security/monitoring service or fire department is advised of how many occupants there are in each bedroom, and whether those occupants are still asleep (or immobile) or whether they have properly evacuated the bedroom. While this is, of course, a very advantageous capability accommodated by the described extensible devices and services platform, there can be substantially more "profound" examples that can truly illustrate the potential of a larger

- a DR event having a DR event period is identified.
- a DR event is a time period over which energy reduction mechanisms are to be actively engaged.
- the DR event is defined by a DR event profile which includes information identifying a DR event period which defines the time period over which energy reduction mechanisms are to be actively engaged.
- the time period may be on the order of minutes, tens of minutes, hours, tens of hours, or other suitable time period for which energy shifting is desired.
- a DR event period may be on the order of a few minutes and referred to as an 'instantaneous DR event', which is an event narrowly tailored to an expected peak in aggregate energy demand.
- the peak in energy demand may be identified a few minutes (or a few hours) prior to the expected peak time, and in some embodiments the duration of the peak energy demand (i.e., the duration during which expected demand exceeds supply) may last only a few minutes.
- a DR event may be part of a DR program.
- a DR program is a program that attempts to reduce load on the electrical grid supplying the energy consumer residences 150A - 15 ON during certain critical times which are generally times when demand gets close to or is expected to exceed supply.
- the DR program often allows for participation in the program by the energy consumers to be voluntary, although in some embodiments participation may be mandatory. In exchange for participation, the energy consumers are often rewarded monetary incentives, reward-based incentives, or other types of incentives to garner increased participation, but in some embodiments the energy consumers may not be provided such incentives.
- a DR program may run for set periods, such as for a certain number of months, days, years, may be seasonal (e.g., implemented in seasons such as summer when energy demand is expected to increase substantially), may be perpetual, and/or may be executed over any suitable period of time.
- a DR program may define one or more DR events.
- the DR event in addition to having a time period, may also include other information suitable for effectively managing energy consumption over the DR event period.
- the DR event may also include information identifying a DR event magnitude which defines a magnitude of the desired energy reduction (either on a per-consumer basis, a group basis, an aggregate basis, or other basis).
- the DR event may include information identifying a geographical scope of the DR event, where the geographical scope may describe a region that relates to one or more electrical grids from which load shedding is desired. The region may be defined using any suitable parameters such as state, county, zip code, address, or the like, or may identify one or more particular electrical grids from which such addresses of residences may subsequently be inferred.
- the DR program may also identify costs per unit of energy over the course of the DR program, DR events, etc.
- consumers may be grouped according to characteristics other than geographical characteristics. For example, consumers may be grouped based on similar (or different) characteristics regarding their structures (e.g., thermal retention), their affluency (e.g., absolute wealth, annual income, etc.), their tendency to participate in DR events and/or programs, the amount of energy shifting likely achieved by their participation in a DR event and/or program, etc.
- a particular DR event may be identified by a device, such as thermostat 202, in any one or more of a variety of fashions. For example, information identifying a DR event may be communicated from remote server 264, or other computing element of energy management system 130 and/or utility provider computing system 120, to thermostat 202. For another example, thermostat 202 may generate and/or define a DR event based on sensed information. For example, thermostat 202 may monitor outdoor temperature or otherwise receive information regarding outdoor temperature, and based on the outdoor temperature define a DR event (e.g., thermostat 202 may generate a DR event when the outdoor temperature exceeds some value).
- thermostat 202 may monitor grid conditions (e.g., variations or other characteristics in power supplied via power distribution network 160), and based on those grid conditions define a DR event.
- thermostat 202 may be in communication with other thermostats arranged in the same or different structures in a similar geographical area as thermostat 202, and may receive information indicative of a DR event from those other thermostats.
- an optimized control trajectory of an HVAC system is determined to be in effect during the DR event period, where the optimized control trajectory minimizes a cost function.
- the control trajectory indicates how the HVAC system should be controlled over a period of time, such as the DR event period.
- the control trajectory may include one or more of a variety of tangible control sequences for controlling the HVAC system, such as a schedule of setpoint temperatures, an HVAC duty cycle schedule, etc.
- an original control trajectory e.g., a schedule of setpoint temperatures initially defined by a user to be implemented during the DR event period, and perhaps over a regular periodic interval
- a space of possible control trajectories may be searched to find an optimal control trajectory that is optimal in some sense.
- the optimal control trajectory is optimal in that it minimizes a cost function.
- the cost function in determining a cost of a particular control trajectory, may incorporate one or more of a variety of factors.
- the cost function may include a factor representative of a total energy consumption during the DR event period. This factor may indicate, for example, the total energy (kW), or a value ($) of the total energy likely to be consumed by the HVAC system during the DR event period in the event the HVAC system is controlled in accordance with the particular control trajectory.
- the value of the total energy may be determined based on real-time energy pricing.
- the factor representative of total energy consumption may indicate a value of the energy consumed over a period of the day (e.g., the DR event period), where the value of the energy consumed is determined based on both the magnitude of energy consumed at a number of time instances over the period and a cost of energy at those time instances.
- the cost function may additionally or alternatively include a factor representative of a metric of occupant discomfort.
- This factor may indicate, for example, a level of discomfort likely to be experienced by one or more of the occupants of the structure in the event the HVAC system is controlled in accordance with the particular control trajectory. In some embodiments, such a factor may be indicative of discomfort of any arbitrary occupant of the structure. In other embodiments, the occupant(s) likely to be present during a DR event period may be specifically identified, and the discomfort factor may be specifically tailored to that/those specific
- the cost function may additionally or alternatively include a factor representative of deviations of a rate of energy consumption over the DR event period.
- an HVAC system may consume high amounts of energy during a first portion of the event period, and low amounts of energy during a last portion of the event period, or vice versa.
- the HVAC system energy consumption may be distributed or otherwise equalized across the DR event period such that the rate of consumption over the DR event period is substantially constant.
- the factors used by the cost function may be weighted the same or differently, such that they are all given equal consideration in determining a cost of a particular control trajectory, or one factor may be given more weight than another.
- the weightings may be determined based on one or more of a variety of information, such as a user input indicative of a user amenability to DR load shifting, occupant characteristics (e.g., age, income, net worth, health, spending habits, energy-management habits, lifestyle, occupancy times as defined, for example, by an occupancy probability profile, etc.), structure characteristics (size, number of rooms/bathrooms/etc., type of windows, type of insulation, type of electronic devices of structure, whether windows and/or doors are open/closed, etc.), or other characteristics indicative of a users' tendency to prefer energy-savings over comfort or vice versa.
- occupant characteristics e.g., age, income, net worth, health, spending habits, energy-management habits, lifestyle, occupancy times as defined, for example, by an occupancy probability profile, etc.
- an occupancy probability profile may be used to determine a likelihood of the structure being occupied during the DR event period, where a greater likelihood results in a greater weighting of likely discomfort. For another example, if a user had refused to participate in a previous DR event, such information may result in a greater weighting of likely discomfort and/or a lower weighting of energy consumption savings.
- the factors may be weighted based on the age of occupants, where if the occupants include children or elderly, such information may result in a greater weighting of likely discomfort.
- the factors may be weighted based on the health of the occupants, where if occupants recently went to the hospital, such information may result in a greater weighting of likely discomfort.
- the factors may be weighted based on characteristics of other devices in the structure, or even the structure itself, where if other devices are energy-saving devices (e.g., Energy Star® compliant), or the structure includes energy-saving features (e.g., includes cavity- wall insulation, multipane windows, etc.), such information may correspond to an increased weighting on energy consumption savings.
- the factors may be weighted based on user interaction with a control trajectory during the DR event period, where if a user modifies the temperature to consume less energy, such information may correspond to an increased weighting on energy consumption savings.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a process for determining an optimized control trajectory according to an embodiment which, according to some embodiments, may be a process for determining an optimized control trajectory as described with reference to operation 704.
- the process 704 is described with reference to FIGS. 1, 2, 9A to 9D, and 10A to 10B, although it should be understood that embodiments of the process 704 are not limited to those described with reference to FIGS. 1, 2, 9A to 9D, and 10A to 10B.
- each parameter set characterizes an associated candidate setpoint schedule for a DR event.
- Each parameter set includes a plurality of parameters each having a parameter value, where the parameters in the set, and their corresponding parameter values, characterize a specific setpoint schedule.
- FIG. 9A illustrates a schedule of original setpoint temperatures 800 that are scheduled setpoint temperatures defined prior to determining an optimized control trajectory according to an embodiment.
- the original schedule may have been generated in one or more of a variety of fashions.
- the schedule may be set by a user of thermostat 202, and may be input for storage in thermostat 202 via a user interface of thermostat 202, access device 266, and/or another computing device of smart home environment 200.
- the schedule may be generated by an entity of smart home environment 200, such as the thermostat 202 itself, by learning the tendencies and preferences of the occupants of the structure associated with the thermostat 202.
- the original schedule may be generated by an entity of system 100 other than smart-home environment 200, such as by remote server 264, energy management system 130, or another entity of system 100, and either pre-programmed in the thermostat 202 prior to installation of the thermostat 202 or communicated to the thermostat 202 post-installation.
- the original schedule of setpoint temperatures may be generated based on a combination of one or more of the above.
- the original schedule may initially be defined by the energy consumer, and subsequently tailored via learning.
- the schedule of original setpoint temperatures 800 is defined over a period of time (in this example, from before noon until after 7pm) including a DR event period extending between a DR event period begin time 802 and a DR event period end time 804.
- the DR event period may also include a pre-event period extending between a pre-event period begin time 806 to the DR event period begin time 802.
- the DR event period may also include a post-event period extending between the DR event period end time 804 and a post- event period end time that is sometime after the DR event period end time (not shown).
- the DR event period may include one or both of a pre-event period and a post-event period.
- FIG. 9B illustrates a schedule of candidate setpoint temperatures 808 characterized by a parameter set according to an embodiment.
- the parameter set in this particular embodiment includes a first parameter 810 that indicates a temperature-wise offset from a first temperature setpoint of the schedule of original setpoint temperatures 800 (i.e., a temperature setpoint defined at the beginning of the pre-event period 806).
- the offset is 2°F in a direction of increased energy consumption with respect to the corresponding original setpoint. That is, in this particular example, the outdoor temperature is greater than the indoor temperature and an air conditioning system is actuated to reduce the indoor temperature in accordance with the original and/or candidate schedule.
- the optimized schedule of setpoint temperatures should ultimately reduce the amount of energy consumed during the DR event period.
- a pre-cooling is performed during the pre-event period.
- pre- cooling is performed over the course of the pre-event period (i.e., from 1pm to 2pm), at a temperature offset defined by the first parameter 810.
- the parameter set also includes a second parameter 812 that indicates a temperature- wise offset from a last temperature setpoint of the schedule of original setpoint temperatures 800 (i.e., a temperature setpoint defined at the end of the DR event period 804).
- the offset is 3°F in a direction of decreased energy consumption with respect to the corresponding original setpoint. That is, in this particular example, the indoor temperature is allowed to rise 3°F by the end of the DR event period as compared to the schedule of original setpoint temperatures.
- the first parameter 810 and the second parameter 812 can be used to define a slope of a linear sequence of temperature setpoints that may be used to determine the candidate schedule.
- FIG. 9C illustrates a relationship between the first parameter 810, the second parameter 812, and a linear sequence 814 of temperature setpoints according to an embodiment.
- the first 810 and second parameter 812 indicate a magnitude of maximum temperature change over a time period with respect to an arbitrary reference temperature.
- the time period is the DR event period (i.e., between the DR event period begin time 802 and the DR event period end time 804)
- the arbitrary reference temperature is 73 °F.
- Linear sequence 814 is then the linear sequence of temperature setpoints that increase from the reference temperature to the combined magnitude of the first and second parameters over the DR event period, and has a slope defined by the DR event period and the combined magnitude of the first and second parameters.
- the slope defined by the DR event period and the combined magnitude of the first and second parameters may be used to determine the candidate schedule of setpoint temperatures 808 such that deviations in the rate of energy consumption over the DR event period are reduced.
- the candidate setpoint temperatures 808 continue to increase linearly, from the newly transitioned setpoint temperature, at the rate of change defined by the slope of the linear sequence 814.
- a change in temperature magnitude in the original schedule e.g., a drop of 5°F in the original schedule 808 at 5pm
- a corresponding change in temperature in the candidate schedule 808 e.g., a drop of 5°F in the original schedule 808 at 5pm
- a first parameter 810 that indicates a temperature-wise offset from a first temperature setpoint of the schedule of original setpoint temperatures 800
- a second parameter 812 that indicates a temperature-wise offset from a last temperature setpoint of the schedule of original setpoint temperatures 800
- a first parameter may indicate a temperature-wise offset from any setpoint of the original schedule 800. This may be an offset at the pre-event period begin time 806, the DR event period begin time 802, the DR event period end time 804, somewhere in-between any of those times, or somewhere outside of those times.
- this may be an offset of 0°F from the 4pm temperature setpoint of 75 °F defined by the original schedule 800.
- a second parameter may then indicate a slope of a linear sequence of temperature setpoints passing through a point at the temperature -wise offset from the temperature setpoint of the original setpoint schedule.
- the second parameter may indicate a slope of a linear sequence of temperature setpoints passing through the setpoint temperature of 75 °F at 4pm, where the slope is an increase in temperature of 1 °F per hour.
- the original schedule 800 and modified schedule 808 as described with reference to FIGS. 9 A and 9B are merely used for explanation purposes and the scope of the embodiments are not intended to be so limited.
- the aforementioned slope could be greater or less than 1 °F per hour, could be positive (as shown) or negative, and could be constant (as shown) or variable over the DR event period.
- the modified schedule 808 may include a temperature setpoint over the pre-event period that is constant (as shown) or variable (e.g., it may have a slope the same as or different than the aforementioned slope), and may have a duration of lhr (as shown) or a duration greater or less than lhr.
- the slope may be defined based on a time period extending between the DR event period begin time 802 and the DR event period end time 804 (as described), or between other periods (e.g., between the pre-event period begin time 806 and the DR event period end time 804).
- the schedule of candidate setpoint temperatures 808 may begin changing linearly from a setpoint temperature other than that associated with a temperature offset during the pre-event period. For example, with reference to FIG.
- a third parameter 816 is indicative of a duration of the pre-event period.
- the third parameter 816 may extend between the pre-event period begin time 806 and the DR event period begin time 802, thereby defining a duration of the pre-event period.
- the third parameter may also or alternatively extend between other periods of time, such as over the post-event period. That is, the third parameter may also or alternatively extend between the DR event period end time 804 and the post-event period end time (not shown).
- FIG. 9D illustrates a candidate duty cycle schedule that corresponds to the schedule of candidate setpoint temperatures 808 according to an embodiment. That is, the candidate duty cycle schedule indicates a sequence of ON/OFF states that the HVAC system is expected to be controlled in upon implementation of the candidate schedule 808.
- the candidate duty cycle schedule includes a number of HVAC system ON periods 818, where the HVAC system is controlled to be in an ON state during those periods and in an OFF state outside of those periods.
- a fourth parameter 820 is indicative of a maximum HVAC duty cycle period.
- the maximum HVAC duty cycle period may indicate a maximum ON time of 45 minutes for every 60 minute period.
- the fourth parameter 820 need not be indicative of a maximum ON time, but similarly could also or alternatively indicate a minimum HVAC OFF time for a given period (e.g., 15 minutes for every 60 minute period).
- the duration of the pre-event period (during which, e.g., pre-cooling may be performed), the maximum duty cycle length, etc.
- the benefits of up to or more than three energy shifting strategies may be realized while the drawbacks associated with such strategies may be reduced on a home-by- home basis.
- an optimal control trajectory may be realized where the control trajectory is optimal for the user's particular preference.
- a first parameter set may include a first parameter 810 having a value of 2°F, and a second parameter 812 having a value of 3°F, where this particular parameter set characterizes an associated candidate setpoint schedule (e.g., candidate setpoint schedule 808 as shown in and described with reference to FIG. 9B).
- a second parameter set may include a first parameter 810 having a value of 2.5°F, and a second parameter 812 having a value of 3.5°F, where this particular parameter set characterizes a different candidate setpoint schedule (not shown).
- an optimal one of the parameter sets is identified that results in minimization of a cost function when the associated candidate setpoint schedule is applied as an input to a prediction model-based simulation of the HVAC system. That is, one of the parameter sets generated in operation 704A may be identified as being optimal with respect to a cost function.
- the candidate setpoint schedule for each candidate parameter set may be applied to a prediction model-based simulation of the HVAC system.
- a prediction model-based simulation of the HVAC system may include, and may continuously update, a model of the HVAC system that is operable to predict the thermodynamic behavior of a structure, for example the model may be operable to predict an indoor temperature profile and/or an HVAC duty cycle schedule for a schedule of setpoint temperatures.
- the model may be generated/updated using some or all of a variety of information, such as a history of indoor temperature, a history of outdoor temperature, a history of temperature of the structure, characteristics of the HVAC system (e.g., a carryover of a rate of indoor temperature change that was occurring immediately prior to a change in actuation state of the HVAC system), etc.
- a history of indoor temperature e.g., a history of outdoor temperature
- a history of temperature of the structure e.g., a carryover of a rate of indoor temperature change that was occurring immediately prior to a change in actuation state of the HVAC system
- characteristics of the HVAC system e.g., a carryover of a rate of indoor temperature change that was occurring immediately prior to a change in actuation state of the HVAC system
- a default model may be used whereby the default model provides a default
- thermodynamic behavior of the structure e.g., a default relationship between a given control trajectory and an indoor temperature profile.
- a predicted indoor temperature profile and/or HVAC duty cycle schedule for the candidate setpoint schedule may be generated.
- the predicted indoor temperature profile and/or HVAC duty cycle schedule for the candidate setpoint schedule may then be used in the cost function to determine a cost associated with the candidate setpoint schedule.
- the predicted HVAC duty cycle schedule may be used to determine an amount of total HVAC usage and/or cost for the expected HVAC usage over the DR event period for the candidate setpoint schedule.
- the predicted indoor temperature profile may be used to determine a metric indicative of occupant discomfort were the candidate setpoint schedule implemented over the DR event period.
- the space of parameter sets may be searched to identify the parameter set that minimizes the aforementioned cost function.
- each parameter set includes a limited number of parameters (e.g., an offset and a slope), rather than a space defined by each of the temperature setpoints of a candidate schedule (which may be numerous), the search for an optimal schedule may advantageously be significantly expedited.
- Such a search may thus be performed by relatively low-power devices (or devices having a relatively low computational complexity) such as a thermostat, and may be performed on a regular basis (e.g., every 15 minutes) without unduly burdening the device.
- operation 704C it is determined whether identification of an optimal parameter set failed.
- the identification of an optimal parameter set may fail for any one or more of a variety of reasons. For example, the minimization algorithm may fail to identify a local or global minimum of the cost function. If the identification fails, processing may continue to operation 704D where a default parameter set is selected as the optimal parameter set.
- the default parameter set may be a set of parameters that result in at least some energy reductions over the DR period as compared to the user's original schedule.
- the first parameter 810 may be a 1°F temperature offset in the direction of increased energy consumption while the second parameter 812 may be a 1 °F temperature offset in a direction of decreased energy consumption.
- Such a parameter set may result in less energy consumption over the DR event period as compared to the original schedule, but may not be optimal in terms of minimizing energy consumption, occupant discomfort, etc.
- processing may continue to operation 704E.
- a baseline parameter set may be a parameter set that corresponds to the original setpoint schedule.
- it may be determined whether the duty cycle schedule characterized by the optimal parameter set is identical to, or within some tolerance of, the duty cycle schedule characterized by the original setpoint schedule. In other words, it may be determined whether the optimal schedule is expected to result in the HVAC system being controlled in a similar fashion as if the HVAC system was to be controlled in accordance with the original schedule.
- the predicted duty cycle schedule characterized by the optimal parameter set and the original setpoint schedule may be compared. If the duty cycle schedules are identical or similar to one another, then it may be determined that the optimal parameter set is within the baseline set. Otherwise, it may be determined that the optimal parameter set is not within the baseline set.
- FIG. 10A illustrates a predicted HVAC duty cycle 900 resulting from implementation of an optimal setpoint schedule 808 according to an embodiment.
- the HVAC duty cycle 900 includes HVAC ON periods beginning at approximately 1pm, 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm, where the HVAC ON periods beginning at 1pm and 5pm each last for approximately 50 minutes, and the HVAC ON periods beginning at 3pm and 4pm each last for approximately 30 minutes.
- FIG. 10B illustrates a predicted HVAC duty cycle 902 resulting from implementation of the original setpoint schedule 800 according to an embodiment.
- the HVAC duty cycle 902 includes HVAC ON periods beginning at approximately lpm, 2:30pm, and 3:50pm, with durations ranging from 30 minutes to over 2 hours.
- the HVAC duty cycle 900 may be compared to the HVAC duty cycle 902. If the duty cycles are identical or similar, then the original setpoint schedule 800 may be used rather than optimal schedule 808. A variety of characteristics of the duty cycles may be used in the comparison, such as the HVAC ON times, HVAC ON periods, HVAC OFF times, and HVAC OFF periods, where schedules within 5% (or some other threshold greater than or less than 5%) of one another may be considered similar.
- processing may continue to operation 704F where the baseline parameter set is selected as the optimal parameter set. That is, instead of using a setpoint schedule characterized by the optimal parameter set to subsequently control the HVAC system, the original setpoint schedule may be selected and used. In this fashion, the HVAC system may be advantageously controlled precisely as expected by the user, thereby increasing the likelihood of the original setpoint schedule, which in this particular case is substantially optimal, being accepted or otherwise not interfered with by the user for the duration of the DR event period.
- FIG. 8 provides a particular process for illustrates a process for determining an optimized control trajectory according to an embodiment.
- the various operations described with reference to FIG. 8 may be implemented at and performed by one or more of a variety of electronic devices or components described herein. For example, they may be implemented at and performed by one or more electronic devices in the smart home environment 200 (e.g., thermostat 202), the energy management system 130 (e.g., remote server 264), etc.
- Other sequences of operations may also be performed according to alternative embodiments.
- alternative embodiments of the present invention may perform the operations outlined above in a different order.
- the individual operations illustrated in FIG. 8 may include multiple sub-operations that may be performed in various sequences as appropriate to the individual operations.
- additional operations may be added or existing operations removed depending on the particular applications.

- the particular control trajectory used may be that determined as a result of operation 704, and thus may be the control trajectory resulting from optimization of the cost function, a default control trajectory, and/or the original control trajectory.
- a setpoint temperature profile over the DR event period may be determined.
- the setpoint temperature profile may be determined based on the particular control trajectory being used. For example, if the original setpoint schedule is used, then the setpoint temperature profile may correspond to the setpoint temperatures defined by the original setpoint schedule. Similarly, if the default or optimal setpoint schedules are used, then the setpoint temperature profile may correspond to the setpoint temperatures defined by the default or optimal setpoint schedules.
- the implemented setpoint schedule includes setpoint temperatures with a high rate of change over the DR event period, for example, setpoint temperatures that change every 5, 10, or 15 minutes (see, e.g., candidate schedule 808 in FIG. 9B, where the setpoint temperatures continuously change over the DR event period), it may be desirable to reduce the rate of change of setpoint temperatures displayed or otherwise
- FIG. 11 A illustrates an expected indoor temperature profile 1002 resulting from implementation of the optimal schedule 808 according to an embodiment.
- the expected indoor temperature profile 1002 may be determined by applying the optimal setpoint schedule 808 to the prediction model-based simulation of the HVAC system.
- FIG. 1 IB illustrates effective setpoint temperatures 1004 relative to the expected indoor temperature profile 1002 according to an embodiment.
- the effective setpoint temperatures 1004 may be determined by identifying the peaks and troughs of the expected indoor temperature profile 1002.
- an effective temperature setpoint may be defined as a peak
- an effective temperature setpoint may be defined as a trough temperature (e.g., at 3:30pm) for a duration extending from a previous peak (e.g., at 3pm) to the time at which the trough temperature is located (i.e., at 3:30pm).
- the combination of effective setpoint temperatures 1004 may then be used as the setpoint temperature profile. That is, instead of using the (continuously changing) setpoint temperatures defined by the optimal schedule 808 as the setpoint temperature profile, the
- a relatively static schedule e.g., as defined by the combination of effective temperature setpoints 1004.
- the presentation of a relatively static schedule may advantageously reduce the likelihood of user interference with implementation of the optimal schedule.
- the setpoint temperatures defined by the setpoint temperature profile may be displayed, or otherwise communicated to the user, during the DR event period in operation 712.
- the effective setpoint temperatures 1004 may be sequentially displayed on thermostat 202 as a current setpoint temperature over the course of the DR event period.
- processing may continue to operation 714 where it is determined whether there is a need to re-determine the control trajectory.
- reasons for the control trajectory to be re-determined such as the actual HVAC states and/or indoor temperatures being different than the expected HVAC states/indoor temperatures, a real-time occupancy of the structure changing, the indoor temperatures crossing some safety thresholds, etc.
- control trajectory may be re-determined when: (1) where an optimal schedule is implemented, the actual indoor temperature profile is different than the predicted indoor temperature profile; (2) where the original schedule is implemented as it's deemed to result in similar control as an optimal schedule, the actual indoor temperature profile crosses some safety thresholds; (3) a real-time occupancy of the structure changes; and/or (4) where an optimal or original schedule is implemented, the actual HVAC states are different than the predicted HVAC states.
- an actual indoor temperature of the structure may be monitored during the DR event period and compared to the expected indoor temperature profile.
- the actual HVAC states may be monitored and compared to the expected HVAC states defined by the expected HVAC duty cycle schedule.
- an occupancy status of the structure may be monitored.
- control trajectory may be re-optimized as described with reference to operation 704, whereas in other cases an alternative control trajectory, such as one characterized by the original setpoint schedule or the default setpoint schedule, may be used in place of an optimal schedule. For example, in situations where the occupancy status of the structure changed, then the control trajectory may be re-optimized. For another example, in situations where the current control trajectory is characterized by an optimal setpoint schedule or original setpoint schedule and the actual HVAC state differs from the expected HVAC state, then the control trajectory may be re-optimized.
- the default control trajectory may be implemented.
- the current control trajectory is characterized by the original setpoint schedule and the some safety thresholds are exceeded (e.g., HVAC ON period exceeds a maximum duration)
- the default control trajectory may be implemented.
- control trajectory may be re-optimized. Re-optimization of the control trajectory may be similar to the original optimization described with reference to operation 704, thus further description is omitted. Upon re -optimization of the control trajectory, processing may return to operation 708 where the HVAC system is then controlled in accordance with the re-optimized control trajectory. If, on the other hand, it is determined that the control trajectory should not be re-optimized but rather than alternative control trajectory should be determined, then processing may continue to operation 720 where an alternative control trajectory, such as one characterized by the default schedule or the original schedule, is determined. Processing may then return to operation 708 where, in this case, the HVAC system is controlled in accordance with the alternative control trajectory.
- alternative control trajectory such as one characterized by the default schedule or the original schedule
- processing may continue to operation 722 where it is determined whether the DR event period is complete. If it is not, processing may return to operation 708 where the HVAC system is controlled in accordance with the control trajectory. Otherwise, processing may continue to operation 724 where the DR event period is completed.

- GUI graphical user interfaces
- the GUI's, or other user interfaces may notify the user that a DR event is ongoing, and in some cases may notify the user that their HVAC system is being controlled in accordance with one or more of the processes described herein.
