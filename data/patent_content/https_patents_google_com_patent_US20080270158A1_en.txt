Definitions
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method and apparatus for geo-spatial and social relationship analysis.
- a social network may correspond to a social structure made of nodes, which may include individuals and/or organizations, and links between the nodes.
- the links may correspond to varying degrees of social familiarity, from those of casual acquaintances to close familial bonds.
- the social networks may be tracked and maintained on web-based applications, enabling friends, business partners, and/or other individuals to connect with one another using a variety of tools.
- users may create profiles that include information such as a name, an address, a contact information, a picture, and/or other personal information.
- a friend-based social network may allow the users to upload photos to their profiles
- a business social network may allow the users to include work experience, education, and/or references on their profiles.
- Connections, or links may also be made between the users in the online social network. For example, two users on the friend-based social network may become “friends” if both the users approve the connection. Similarly, a business connection may be made on the business social network if two users have worked together and are interested in collaborating on future work.
- the connections, or links, between the users form the basis of the online social networks and social network theory in general.
- a “small world phenomenon” postulates that a searching member of the social network may be connected to another member using a relatively short path of links between the members.
- a “six degrees of separation” hypothesis suggests that each member of the social network is no more than six links away from another member.
- neither the “small world phenomenon” nor the “six degrees of separation” hypotheses consider geo-spatial proximity of the members with each other. Instead, both hypotheses model links of currently known social familiarity between the members of the social network (e.g., a second degree member may live next door to a sixth degree away member). As a result, it may take a long time for the member to reach a connection that is four, five, or six degrees away from him.
- the searching member may have to send a request to and get permission from each one of the members connected one, two, and three degrees away to reach a member who is four, five, and/or six degrees away from the searching member.
- the members who are one, two, and/or three degrees away from the searching member may not use the social network often and/or may be reluctant to forward the request to the next member in the chain. It may be possible that one of the users who is one, two, or three degrees away is a next door neighbor of a target user (i.e., physically lives next door to the person six degrees away, who the user wants to reach).
- the social network may still require the searching member to go through six degrees of separation.
- a person that the searching member seeks to connect with may not be a member of the social network at all. In such situations, it may be difficult for the searching member to contact the person through the social network.
- a method of contacting a target member of a community includes obtaining a target location of the target member (e.g., a person, a business, and/or an organization), obtaining a social path to the target member, determining an association between a node location of at least one node (e.g., a member of the community) of the social path and the target location of the target member, generating a geo-spatial index that determines a geographic proximity (e.g., associated with a location of the target member) each node is from the target member, and communicating with the target member using the at least one node of the social path based on the geographic proximity between each node and the target member.
- a target location of the target member e.g., a person, a business, and/or an organization
- determining an association between a node location of at least one node (e.g., a member of the community) of the social path and the target location of the target member generating a geo-spatial index
- the method may further include establishing a social link with the target member using the at least one node.
- the method may include obtaining a global positioning system (GPS) coordinate of the at least one node, and generating the geo-spatial index using the GPS coordinate.
- the method may also include displaying the geographic proximity on a geo-spatial map.
- GPS global positioning system

- the social network may further include a relationship management module configured to determine a shortest path (e.g., determined using the social path and the geo-spatial link) between the first of the plurality of members and the second of the plurality of members.
- the relationship management module may be configured to establish a social link between the first of the plurality of members and the second of the plurality of members.

Abstract
Description
- This disclosure relates generally to the technical fields of communications and, in one example embodiment, to a method and apparatus for geo-spatial and social relationship analysis.
- A social network may correspond to a social structure made of nodes, which may include individuals and/or organizations, and links between the nodes. The links may correspond to varying degrees of social familiarity, from those of casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. The social networks may be tracked and maintained on web-based applications, enabling friends, business partners, and/or other individuals to connect with one another using a variety of tools.
- In online social networks, users may create profiles that include information such as a name, an address, a contact information, a picture, and/or other personal information. For example, a friend-based social network may allow the users to upload photos to their profiles, while a business social network may allow the users to include work experience, education, and/or references on their profiles.
- Connections, or links, may also be made between the users in the online social network. For example, two users on the friend-based social network may become “friends” if both the users approve the connection. Similarly, a business connection may be made on the business social network if two users have worked together and are interested in collaborating on future work. The connections, or links, between the users form the basis of the online social networks and social network theory in general.
- Several hypotheses exist for connectedness of the social network. A “small world phenomenon” postulates that a searching member of the social network may be connected to another member using a relatively short path of links between the members. A “six degrees of separation” hypothesis suggests that each member of the social network is no more than six links away from another member. However, neither the “small world phenomenon” nor the “six degrees of separation” hypotheses consider geo-spatial proximity of the members with each other. Instead, both hypotheses model links of currently known social familiarity between the members of the social network (e.g., a second degree member may live next door to a sixth degree away member). As a result, it may take a long time for the member to reach a connection that is four, five, or six degrees away from him.
- The searching member may have to send a request to and get permission from each one of the members connected one, two, and three degrees away to reach a member who is four, five, and/or six degrees away from the searching member. Sometimes, the members who are one, two, and/or three degrees away from the searching member may not use the social network often and/or may be reluctant to forward the request to the next member in the chain. It may be possible that one of the users who is one, two, or three degrees away is a next door neighbor of a target user (i.e., physically lives next door to the person six degrees away, who the user wants to reach). However, the social network may still require the searching member to go through six degrees of separation. In other cases, a person that the searching member seeks to connect with may not be a member of the social network at all. In such situations, it may be difficult for the searching member to contact the person through the social network.
- A method and apparatus for geo-spatial and social relationship analysis are disclosed. In one aspect, a method of contacting a target member of a community includes obtaining a target location of the target member (e.g., a person, a business, and/or an organization), obtaining a social path to the target member, determining an association between a node location of at least one node (e.g., a member of the community) of the social path and the target location of the target member, generating a geo-spatial index that determines a geographic proximity (e.g., associated with a location of the target member) each node is from the target member, and communicating with the target member using the at least one node of the social path based on the geographic proximity between each node and the target member.
- The method may further include establishing a social link with the target member using the at least one node. The method may include obtaining a global positioning system (GPS) coordinate of the at least one node, and generating the geo-spatial index using the GPS coordinate. The method may also include displaying the geographic proximity on a geo-spatial map.
- In another aspect, a social network includes a geo-spatial repository consisting of a plurality of locations, a member repository consisting of a plurality of members (e.g., the plurality of members may include at least one selected from a group consisting of a person, a business, and/or an organization), a social relationship analysis module configured to determine a social path (e.g., the social path may include a plurality of nodes from the member repository and a plurality of links between the plurality of nodes) between a first of the plurality of members and a second of the plurality of members, and a geo-spatial relationship analysis module configured to determine a geo-spatial link (e.g., the geo-spatial link may include a proximity between a first of the plurality of locations associated with the one of the plurality of nodes and a second of the plurality of locations associated with the second of the plurality of members) between one of the plurality of nodes and the second of the plurality of members.
- The social network may further include a relationship management module configured to determine a shortest path (e.g., determined using the social path and the geo-spatial link) between the first of the plurality of members and the second of the plurality of members. In addition, the relationship management module may be configured to establish a social link between the first of the plurality of members and the second of the plurality of members. The social network may include a member management module configured to obtain member data (e.g., a location) associated with each of the plurality of members. In addition, the location may be obtained using a global positioning system (GPS).
- The social network may further include a user interface consisting of a user update module configured to obtain changes to the member repository, a member search module configured to obtain a search result for the second of the plurality of members based on a query by the first of the plurality of members, a relationship display module configured to display the one or more links and the geo-spatial link, and a geo-spatial tracker configured to display and update the geo-spatial link on a geo-spatial map.
- In yet another aspect, a computer readable medium containing software instructions embodied therein for causing a computer system to perform a method of contacting an nth degree away member (e.g., a person, a business, and/or an organization) of a community includes determining a location of the nth degree away member, obtaining a social path to the nth degree away member, determining a geo-spatial association between a node (e.g., a member of the community) of the social path and the location, and contacting the member using the node of the social path based on the geo-spatial association.
- The method of the computer readable medium may include establishing a social link with the nth degree away member using the node. The method of the computer readable medium may also include obtaining a global positioning system (GPS) coordinate of the at least one node, and generating a geo-spatial index using the GPS coordinate. In addition, the method of the computer readable medium may include displaying the geographic proximity on a geo-spatial map.
- The methods, systems, and apparatuses disclosed herein may be implemented in any means for achieving various aspects, and may be executed in a form of a machine-readable medium embodying a set of instructions that, when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform any of the operations disclosed herein.

members 106A-N of thecommunity 104 ofFIG. 1 ) includes obtaining a target location of the target member 106, obtaining a social path (e.g., using the socialrelationship analysis module 112 ofFIG. 1 ) to the target member 106, determining an association between a node location of a node of the social path and/or the target location of the target member 106, generating a geo-spatial index (e.g., using the geo-spatialrelationship analysis module 114 ofFIG. 1 ) that determines a geographic proximity each node is from the target member 106, and communicating with the target member 106 using the node of the social path based on the geographic proximity between each node and the target member 106. - In another embodiment, a social network (e.g., the
social network 102 ofFIG. 1 ) includes a geo-spatial repository (e.g., the geo-spatial repository 116 ofFIG. 1 ) consisting of any number of locations, a member repository (e.g., themember repository 110 ofFIG. 1 ) consisting of any number of members (e.g., themembers 106A-N ofFIG. 1 ), a social relationship analysis module (e.g., the socialrelationship analysis module 112 ofFIG. 1 ) configured to determine a social path (e.g., the social path may include a set of nodes from the member repository and a set of links between the plurality of nodes) between a first member 106 and a second member 106, and a geo-spatial relationship analysis module (e.g., the geo-spatialrelationship analysis module 114 ofFIG. 1 ) configured to determine a geo-spatial link (e.g., the geo-spatial link may include a proximity between a first location associated with the one of the nodes and a second location associated with the second member 106) between the node and the second member 106. - In yet another embodiment, a computer readable medium containing software instructions embodied therein for causing a computer system to perform a method of contacting an nth degree away member 106 of a community (e.g., the
community 104 ofFIG. 1 ) includes determining a location of the nth degree away member 106, obtaining a social path (e.g., using the socialrelationship analysis module 112 ofFIG. 1 ) to the nth degree away member 106, determining a geo-spatial association between a node of the social path and the location, and contacting the member 106 using the node of the social path (e.g., based on the geo-spatial association). -
FIG. 1 is a system view of asocial network 102 communicating withmembers 106A-N of acommunity 104, according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 1 illustrates thesocial network 102, thecommunity 104, themembers 106A-N, a member management module 108, amember repository 110, a socialrelationship analysis module 112, a geo-spatialrelationship analysis module 114, a geo-spatial repository 116, and arelationship management module 118, according to one embodiment. - The
social network 102 may be a social structure formed by themembers 106A-N associated with thecommunity 104. The social structure may include nodes, which include themembers 106A-N, and social links, which represent relationships between themembers 106A-N. For example, the social links may include personal relationships (e.g., family, friends, etc.) and professional relationships (e.g., coworkers, business associates, clients, etc.). Thecommunity 104 may refer to a group (e.g., sociological group) ofmembers 106A-N associated with specific geographic locations. Each member 106 may be a person, a business, and/or an organization associated with the specific geographic location in thecommunity 104. The member management module 108 may be configured to obtain member 106 data (e.g. a specified geographic location) associated with themembers 106A-N. Themember repository 110 may be a database containing profile information (e.g., names, addresses, professions, etc.) associated with themembers 106A-N. - The social
relationship analysis module 112 may determine a social path between a first member 106 associated with a location and a target member 106 associated with another location in thesocial network 102. The social path may include a set of nodes and social links between the first member 106 and the target member 106. For example, multiple social paths may exist between the first member 106 and the target member 106. As a result, the socialrelationship analysis module 112 may determine the most direct social path between the first member 106 and the target member 106. - In one example embodiment, the first member 106 and the target member 106 may have two social paths between them, one with two nodes, and one with four nodes. As a result, the target member 106 may be three degrees of separation from the first member 106 using the path with two nodes, or the target member 106 may be five degrees of separation from the first member 106 using the path with four nodes. The social
relationship analysis module 112 may then select the path with two nodes as the social path from the first member 106 to the target member 106. - The geo-spatial
relationship analysis module 114 may determine a geo-spatial link (e.g., a geographic proximity) between one of the nodes (e.g., themembers 106A-N in the community 104) and the second member 106 (e.g., the target member 106) in thesocial network 102. In one example embodiment, the geo-spatial link may shorten the social path between two members 106 (e.g., themembers 106A-N ofFIG. 1 ) by using the geo-spatial link in lieu of one or more social links in the social path. The geo-spatial repository 116 may be a database containing the location information associated with themembers 106A-N of thecommunity 104. Therelationship management module 118 may determine the shortest path (e.g., using the social path and the geo-spatial link) between the first member 106 and the target member 106. - In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 1 , themembers 106A-N associated with thecommunity 104 communicate with each other through thesocial network 102. For example, the members 106 A-N of thesocial network 102 may communicate with one another using messages, instant messages, emails, voice calls, etc. (e.g., physical and/or electronic communication using computers over a network, portable communication devices, etc.) Thesocial network 102 includes the member management module 108, themember repository 110, the socialrelationship analysis module 112, the geo-spatialrelationship analysis module 114, the geo-spatial repository 116 and therelationship management module 118 interacting with each other, according to one embodiment. - A target location of the target member 106 (e.g., a person, a business, and/or an organization) and/or the social path to the target member may be obtained (e.g., using the social
relationship analysis module 112 ofFIG. 1 ). An association between a node location of a node (e.g., a member of the community 104) of the social path and the target location of the target member 106 may be determined. A geo-spatial index that determines a geographic proximity (e.g., associated with the location of the target member 106) of each node from the target member 106 may be generated (e.g., using the geo-spatialrelationship analysis module 114 ofFIG. 1 ). The target member 106 may be communicated with using the node of the social path based on the geographic proximity between each node and the target member 106. - The geo-
spatial repository 116 may include any number of locations. Themember repository 110 may include themembers 106A-N. The socialrelationship analysis module 112 may be configured to determine a social path (e.g., the social path may include nodes from themember repository 110 and links between the nodes) between any two of themembers 106A-N. - The geo-spatial
relationship analysis module 114 may be configured to determine a geo-spatial link (e.g., the geo-spatial link may include a proximity between a first of the set of locations associated with the node and a second of the set of locations associated with themembers 106A-N) between one of the nodes and the second member 106. - The
relationship management module 118 may be configured to determine the shortest path (e.g., using the social path and the geo-spatial link) between the first member 106 and the second member 106. The shortest path may include one or more social links and a geo-spatial link between themembers 106A-N (e.g., the first member 106 and the second member 106). The member management module 108 may be configured to obtain member data (e.g., may contain a location obtained using a global positioning system (GPS)) associated with each of the members. -
FIG. 2 is a schematic view of generating the geo-spatial index using a GPS coordinate, according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 2 illustrates geo-spatial coordinates (e.g., the geo-spatial coordinate X 200 and the geo-spatial coordinate Y 202), member(s) (e.g., themember 1 204, themember 2 206, themember 3 208, themember 4 210, themember 5 212, themember 6 214, themember 7 216 and themember 8 218), social link(s) (e.g., thesocial link 1 220, thesocial link 2 222, thesocial link 3 224, thesocial link 4 226, thesocial link 5 228 and thesocial link 6 230), and geo-spatial link(s) (e.g., the geo-spatial link 1 232 and the geo-spatial link 2 234), according to one embodiment. - The geo-spatial coordinates may be an ordered pair used to determine the locations associated with the members (e.g., the
members 106A-N illustrated inFIG. 1 ) on a two-dimensional plane and/or in a three-dimensional space. The member(s) illustrated inFIG. 2 may be persons, businesses and/or organizations associated with the specific geographic location. The social link may be a link or connection established between any two members (e.g., the members 106 ofFIG. 1 ) of thecommunity 104. The geo-spatial link may be a shortest path between the first node and the second member 106 (e.g., themember 1 204, themember 2 206, themember 3 208, themember 4 210, themember 5 212, themember 6 214, themember 7 216 and themember 8 218 illustrated inFIG. 2 ). - In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 2 , the location associated with the members of thecommunity 104 is determined using the geo-spatial coordinate X 200 and the geo-spatial coordinateY 202. The social path is formed between themember 1 204 (e.g., the first member) and themember 7 216 (e.g., the target member) using the nodes (e.g., themember 2 206, themember 3 208, themember 5 212, themember 6 214) and the links (e.g., the social links and the geo-spatial links) between the nodes. In one example embodiment, the members associated with the social path are represented as nodes in a graph. The geo-spatial links are formed between themember 3 208 and themember 6 214, and between themember 6 214 and themember 7 216. The shortest path between themember 1 204 and themember 7 216 may be determined using the social links and the geo-spatial links. Themember 1 204 communicates with thetarget member 7 216 using the shortest path formed through the nodes (e.g., themember 3 208 and themember 6 214) and the links (e.g., thesocial link 2 222, the geo-spatial link 1 232 and the geo-spatial link 2 234). - A social link (e.g., the social link 406 of
FIG. 4 ) may be established with the target member using the node (e.g., using therelationship management module 118 ofFIG. 1 ). The global positioning system (GPS) coordinate of the node may be obtained. The geo-spatial index may be generated using the GPS coordinate. The geographic proximity (e.g., may be associated with a location of the target member 106) may be displayed on a geo-spatial map. The geo-spatial link may include a proximity between a first of the set of locations associated with the one of the nodes and a second of the set of locations associated with the second member. - For example,
member 1 204 may try to contactmember 6 214.Member 1 204 may reachmember 6 214 using one of two series of social links. Specifically,member 1 204 may usesocial link 1 220 to reachmember 2 206,social link 3 224 to reachmember 3 208,social link 4 226 to reachmember 5 212, andsocial link 5 228 to reachmember 6 214. Alternatively,member 1 204 may bypassmember 2 206 entirely by usingsocial link 2 222 to directly reachmember 3 208. For example, the two paths outlined above include four and three degrees of separation betweenmember 1 204 andmember 6 214, respectively. However, as shown inFIG. 2 , a geo-spatial link (e.g., geo-spatial link 1 232) exists betweenmember 3 208 andmember 6 214. As a result,member 1 204 may reachmember 6 214 by using geo-spatial link 1 232 betweenmember 3 206 andmember 6 214. The geo-spatial link 1 232 may be based on the geographic proximity betweenmember 3 206 andmember 6 214. For example,member 3 208 andmember 6 214 may be located within a certain distance of one another, or reside in a common neighborhood.Member 1 204 may then contactmember 3 208 in order to reachmember 6 214 based on the geographic proximity ofmember 3 208 tomember 6 214. -
FIG. 3 is a user interface view 300 of thesocial network 102 ofFIG. 1 , according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 3 illustrates a user update module 302, amember search module 304, arelationship display module 306, and a geo-spatial tracker 308, according to one embodiment. - The user update module 302 may be configured to obtain changes to the member repository (e.g., the
member repository 110 ofFIG. 1 ) corresponding to changes in information associated with the members of the social path (e.g., themembers 106A-N ofFIG. 1 ). For example, the user update module 302 may be used to change a user's name, address, telephone number, email address, marital status, profile picture, etc. The user update module 302 may also allow profiles to be added and/or deleted. Themember search module 304 may search the location associated with themembers 106A-N based on a query (e.g., a first name, a last name, a location, etc.) requested by the user and/or display the search result associated with the query. Therelationship display module 306 may display one or more social links and any geo-spatial links between any twomembers 106A-N of the community. Therelationship display module 306 may also allow one member 106 to contact another member 106 (e.g., using the social links and/or geo-spatial link). The geo-spatial tracker 308 may display and/or update the geo-spatial link on a geo-spatial map. -
FIG. 4 is a diagrammatic representation of a social link, according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 4 illustrates aneighborhood 1 400, aneighborhood 2 402, aneighborhood 3 404, a social link 406, member(s) 408, 410, 412, 414 and 416, according to one embodiment. - The neighborhood(s) (e.g., the
neighborhood 1 400, 2 402 and 3 404) may correspond to a localized community (e.g., thecommunity 104 ofFIG. 1 ) located in a city, town, and/or suburb. The localized community may be defined using a radius around a location, and/or the localized community may correspond to a distinct area, such as a subdivision, district, etc. The neighborhood(s) may include members, residences, businesses, organizations, etc. The social link 406 may be a link or connection through which a member of one neighborhood (e.g., the member 408) communicates with a member of another neighborhood (e.g., the member 412). - The example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 4 displays aneighborhood 1 400, theneighborhood 2 402, and theneighborhood 3 404. The member 408 (e.g., Fred) and the member 412 (e.g., Betty) are located in theneighborhood 1 400. The member 416 (e.g., Wilma) is located in theneighborhood 2 402. The member 414 (e.g., Dino) is located in theneighborhood 3 404. The member 410 (e.g., Barney) is the common member to theneighborhoods 2 402 and 3 404. The member 408 (e.g., Fred) and the member 410 (e.g., Barney) are connected to each other through the social link 406. - For example,
Fred 408 may want to contactWilma 416. However,Wilma 416 may be more than a few social links away fromFred 408. As a result,Fred 408 may find contactingWilma 416 through the social links alone difficult and time-consuming. However,Fred 408 has a social link 406 toBarney 410.Barney 410 is also located in the same neighborhood (e.g., theneighborhood 2 402) asWilma 416. As a result,Fred 408 may askBarney 410 to contactWilma 416 on Fred's behalf, using Fred's social link 406 toBarney 410 andBarney 410's geographic proximity toWilma 416. Similarly,Fred 408 may contactDino 414 throughBarney 410, andBarney 410 may contactBetty 412 through the social link 406 and Fred's geographic proximity toBetty 412 in theneighborhood 1 400. In one example embodiment, a user (e.g., Barney 410) may belong to more than one neighborhood (e.g., theneighborhood 2 402 and theneighborhood 3 404). As a result, that user may be geo-spatially linked to multiple other users, even if the other users are not geo-spatially linked to one another. -

Theother members 106A-N can search for the target member 106 (e.g., the business 500C) based on the name, the type, the location, the profile, and/or the logo associated with the business 500C. -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart for obtaining geo-spatial links associated with a member (e.g., the member 106 ofFIG. 1 ), according to one embodiment. Inoperation 602, member data is obtained from a member repository (e.g. themember repository 110 ofFIG. 1 ). The member data may include a name, an address, a telephone number, age, etc. The member data may also be inputted by the member 106 and/or obtained from another source, such as a public directory. Inoperation 604, a location of the member 106 is determined based on the member data. For example, the location may be determined using the member's address. Inoperation 606, social links associated with the member 106 (e.g., a target member 106) are obtained. The social links may include personal relationships, business relationships, and/or other ties between the member 106 and the other members 106 of a social network (e.g., thesocial network 102 ofFIG. 1 ). - In
operation 608, the neighborhood of the member 106 is determined using the member repository (e.g., themember repository 110 ofFIG. 1 ) and the geo-spatial repository (e.g., the geo-spatial repository 116 ofFIG. 1 ). The neighborhood may be based on a geographic radius around the member 106 and/or or the neighborhood may correspond to an actual area of the city, town, locality etc. that the member 106 is located in. In one example embodiment, the member 106's location may not always correspond to the member 106's residence. For example, the member 106's location may be established using a global positioning system (GPS) tracker located in the member 106's mobile phone. Regardless of the method of determining the member 106's location, the location may be used to determine the geo-spatial links associated with the member 106 as described inoperation 610. -
FIG. 7 is a flow chart for contacting a target member (e.g., the member 106 ofFIG. 1 ) using at least one node, according to one embodiment. Inoperation 702, a location of the member 106 sought (e.g., the target member) is obtained from the geo-spatial repository 116. The geo-spatial repository 116 may contain the location data associated with the target member 106. The location may be represented using geo-positioning coordinates (e.g., latitude and a longitude. Inoperation 704, social paths to the target member 106 are determined. Multiple social paths may be formed between the first member 106 and the target member 106. Furthermore, each social path may include one or more nodes and/or social links between the first member 106 and the target member 106. Inoperation 706, nodes in the social paths are checked to determine the closest node existing in neighborhood of the target member 106. The neighborhood may correspond to a certain geographic area (e.g., location) around the residence of the target member 106. - In
operation 708, it is determined whether the next node is in the neighborhood of the target member 106 or not. For example, each node in the set of nodes is selected and a geographic proximity of each node with the target member 106 is determined. The geographic proximity may be associated with the locations of the node and the target member 106 (e.g., using the geo-spatialrelationship analysis module 114 ofFIG. 1 ). If any of the nodes is in the neighborhood of the target member 106, a member contact request may be sent to the node inoperation 710. - If the selected node is not in the neighborhood of the member 106, then
operation 712 is performed. Inoperation 712, it is determined whether there are nodes remaining in any of the social paths or not. If any nodes are remaining in the social paths, then the above operations may be repeated until a proximate node is obtained. Inoperation 714, the target member 106 is contacted directly by the member 106 if the proximate node located in the neighborhood of the target member 106 is not obtained. -

As described above, the network diagram 900 may include a number of social links between the members 106, as well as a number of geo-spatial links between the members 106. A member 106 may attempt to reach another member 106 using a combination of social links and geo-spatial links. -
FIG. 10 is auser interface view 1000 of themember search module 304 ofFIG. 3 , according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 10 illustrates aprofile block 1002, a search foroption 1004 and an information wanted/requiredoption 1006, according to one embodiment. - The
profile block 1002 may display content information (e.g., an address book, a profile, comments, etc.,) associated with a user (e.g., of thesocial network 102 ofFIG. 1 ). Theprofile block 1002 may also enable the user to update, modify and/or delete the content information. The search foroption 1004 may permit the user to search for the location associated with the member(s) 106 of the community (e.g., thecommunity 104 ofFIG. 1 ) and/or display results based on a search query requested by the user. The information wanted/requiredoption 1006 may display the information required from the user (e.g., submitted by other users). - In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 10 , theuser interface view 1000 displays a user profile (e.g., associated with the member 106 of thesocial network 102 ofFIG. 1 ). Theprofile block 1002 displays an edit profile option, an upload photos option, a write review block, a post comments option, a view comments block, an invite friends option, an add blog, an address book, a view new messages option, etc. For example, the user may use the options to submit and/or update changes to themember repository 110. The search foroption 1004 may enable the user to search for the members 106 through whom the social paths are formed with the target member 106. In addition, the search foroption 1004 may also allow the user to search for the closest neighbors located in the neighborhood of the target member 106. - The
user interface view 1000 includes the information wanted/requiredoption 1006, which displays information required and/or requested by other users for the user (e.g., Joe). For example, John may be a few social links away from Randy and may like to communicate with Randy. John may have some type of relationship (e.g., a business relationship, a personal relationship, and/or other ties, etc.) with Annie. As a result, John and Annie may be connected through a social link. Annie may not know Randy but she has knowledge that Joe knows Williams who knows Randy. So Annie may send a contact request to Joe that includes information (e.g., “John wants to communicate with Randy, inform Williams about this”), so that a social link is formed between Annie and Joe. - In addition, the user Joe may contact Randy (e.g., the target member 106) through Williams, conveying the message that John wants to communicate with Randy. Joe may find information about Williams using the search for
option 1004 based on name, email, and/or address data associated with Williams. Williams' location may be identified as being in the neighborhood of Randy (e.g., the target member), so that Williams can contact Randy directly on behalf of John (e.g., the first member). Therefore, a social path is formed between John and Randy through the members Annie, the user (e.g., Joe), and Williams, as illustrated in the example embodiment. -
FIG. 11 is an nth degree separation view, according to one embodiment. TM may be a target member 106 of the community (e.g., thecommunity 104 ofFIG. 1 ). A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, and/or U may be the other members (e.g., themembers 106A-N illustrated inFIG. 1 ) of the neighborhood network. Themembers 106A-N of thecommunity 104 may be separated from the target member TM of the neighborhood network by certain degrees of separation. The members A, B and C may be located proximate to the target member TM, so that they can directly communicate with the target member TM. - In addition, the members A, B, C may be deemed to be separated by one degree of separation from the target member TM. Also, the initial member may communicate with the target member TM using the users A, B and/or C based on the geographic proximity between each member and the target member TM. The members D, E, F, G, and H may be connected to the target member TM through no less than one other member and are deemed to be separated by two degree of separation from the target member TM. The members I, J, K, and L may be connected through no less than N−1 other members and are deemed to be separated by N degree of separation from the target member TM. The users M, N, O, may be connected through no less than N other members, thus forming a social path with the target member. The members P, Q, R S, T and U may be the members of the community 104 (e.g., and are not associated with the target member TM and the members of the social path).
- A location of the nth degree away member (a person, a business, and/or an organization, the member 106 of
FIG. 1 , etc.) may be determined, and/or a social path to the nth degree away member may be obtained (e.g., using the socialrelationship analysis module 112 ofFIG. 1 ). A geo-spatial association between a node (e.g., the target member TM) of the social path and the location may be determined. The target member TM may be contacted using the node of the social path based on the geo-spatial association. As a result, the geo-spatial association may shorten the social path between two members (e.g.,members 106A-N in thesocial network 102 ofFIG. 1 ). - A social link may be established with the nth degree away member using the node (e.g., using the
relationship management module 118 ofFIG. 1 ). A global positioning system (GPS) coordinate of the at least one node (e.g., a member of the community) may also be obtained. A geo-spatial index may be generated using the GPS coordinate. Furthermore, a geographic proximity may be displayed on the geo-spatial map (e.g., using therelationship display module 306 ofFIG. 3 ). -
FIG. 12 is a geo-spatial map view 1200 of themembers 106A-N of thesocial network 102, according to one embodiment. Particularly,FIG. 12 illustrates aninitial member 1202, other member(s) 1204, 1206, 1208, and 1212, and atarget member 1210 on a geo-spatial map, according to one embodiment. - The
initial member 1202 may be a member of the social community (e.g., thecommunity 104 ofFIG. 1 ) who wants to communicate with the target member 1210 (e.g., the target member TM ofFIG. 11 ). The member(s) 1204, 1206, 1208 and 1212 may be intermediate members through which social paths are formed between the initial 1202 member and thetarget member 1210 based on the geographic association between the members. In addition, themember 1208 may be located geographically proximate to thetarget member 1210. - In the example embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 12 , the geo-spatial map view 1200 may display a satellite view of a physical world showing the locations associated with the members (e.g., themembers 106A-N illustrated inFIG. 1 ). A member of a global neighborhood environment (e.g., thecommunity 104, thesocial network 102 ofFIG. 1 , etc.) may explore the geo-spatial map view 1200 to locate a geographical location of a target member 106 and the other members (e.g.,other members 106A-N illustrated inFIG. 1 ). The member 106 (e.g., a user of the social network 102) may navigate, zoom, explore and/or quickly find particular geographical locations of target members 106. This may help the member 106 to read the map and/or plot the route (e.g., the social path and/or the shortest path) between the initial member 106 and the target member 106 (e.g., connected through at least one node on the geo-spatial map). -
FIG. 13A is a process flow of contacting a target member of a community, according to one embodiment. Inoperation 1302, a target location of the target member (e.g., the member 106 ofFIG. 1 ) may be obtained (e.g., using the geo-spatialrelationship analysis module 114 ofFIG. 1 ). Inoperation 1304, a social path to the target member 106 may be obtained (e.g., using the socialrelationship analysis module 112 ofFIG. 1 ). Inoperation 1306, an association between a node location of a node of the social path and the target location of the target member 106 may be determined (e.g., using therelationship management module 118 ofFIG. 1 ). Inoperation 1308, a geo-spatial index that determines a geographic proximity each node is from the target member 106 may be generated (e.g., as illustrated inFIG. 2 ). Inoperation 1310, the target member 106 may be communicated with using the at least one node of the social path based on the geographic proximity between each node and the target member 106. -
FIG. 13B is a continuation of the process flow ofFIG. 13A , showing additional processes, according to one embodiment. Inoperation 1312, a social link may be established with the target member (e.g., the member 106 ofFIG. 1 ) using the node. Inoperation 1314, a global positioning system (e.g., GPS) coordinate of the node may be obtained. Inoperation 1316, the geo-spatial index may be generated using the GPS coordinate (e.g., using the geo-spatialrelationship analysis module 114 ofFIG. 1 ). Inoperation 1318, the geographic proximity may be displayed on a geo-spatial map (e.g., as illustrated inFIG. 12 ). - Although the present embodiments have been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the various embodiments. For example, the various devices, modules, analyzers, generators, etc. described herein may be enabled and operated using hardware circuitry (e.g., CMOS based logic circuitry), firmware, software and/or any combination of hardware, firmware, and/or software (e.g., embodied in a machine readable medium). For example, the various electrical structure and methods may be embodied using transistors, logic gates, and/or electrical circuits (e.g., application specific integrated (ASIC) circuitry, Digital Signal Processor (DSP) circuitry, etc.).
- For example, the member management module 108, the social
relationship analysis module 112, the geo-spatialrelationship analysis module 114, therelationship management module 118, the user update module 302, themember search module 304, therelationship display module 306 and the other modules ofFIGS. 1-13B may be enabled using a member management circuit, a social relationship analysis circuit, a geo-spatial relationship analysis circuit, a relationship management circuit, a user update circuit, a member search circuit, a relationship display circuit and other circuits using one or more of the technologies described herein. - In addition, it will be appreciated that the various operations, processes, and methods disclosed herein may be embodied in a machine-readable medium and/or a machine accessible medium compatible with a data processing system (e.g., a computer system), and may be performed in any order. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
