Definitions
- aspects and embodiments of the disclosure relate to content sharing platforms, and more specifically, to evaluating client device trust in a distributed computing system.
- Content delivery platforms connecting via the Internet allow users to connect to and share information with each other.
- Many content delivery platforms include a content sharing aspect that allows users to upload, view, and share content, such as video items, image items, audio items, and so on.
- Other users of the content delivery platform may comment on the shared content, discover new content, locate updates, share content, and otherwise interact with the provided content.
- the shared content may include content from professional content creators, e.g., movie clips, TV clips, and music video items, as well as content from amateur content creators, e.g., video blogging and short original video items.
- An aspect of the disclosure provides a method comprising: receiving, by a processing device of a content sharing platform, a request for desired content from a client device, the content being stored in a content delivery network (CDN); generating, based on data available to the content sharing platform, a partial trust metric associated with the client device, wherein the partial trust metric is to be used by a CDN server to make a decision regarding access to the desired content by the client device; generating a response to the content request, wherein the response comprises one or more resource locators for accessing the desired content in the CDN, and the partial trust metric; and sending the response to the client device to enable the client device to request the desired content from the CDN server using the one or more resource locators and the partial trust metric.
- CDN content delivery network
- a further aspect of the disclosure provides a system comprising: a memory; and a processing device, coupled to the memory, to: receive, by a processing device of a content sharing platform, a request for desired content from a client device, the content being stored in a content delivery network (CDN); generate, based on data available to the content sharing platform, a trust package associated with the client device, wherein the trust package is to be used by a CDN server to make a decision regarding access to the desired content by the client device; generate a response to the content request, wherein the response comprises one or more resource locators for accessing the desired content in the CDN, and the trust package; and send the response to the client device to enable the client device to request the desired content from the CDN server using the one or more resource locators and the trust package.
- CDN content delivery network
- a further aspect of the disclosure provides a computer program product (such as a tangible computer-readable medium or a software product which can be downloaded without necessarily being stored for a non-transitory way) comprising instructions that, responsive to execution by a processing device, cause the processing device to perform operations comprising a method according to any aspect or embodiment described herein.
- a computer program product such as a tangible computer-readable medium or a software product which can be downloaded without necessarily being stored for a non-transitory way
- instructions that, responsive to execution by a processing device, cause the processing device to perform operations comprising a method according to any aspect or embodiment described herein.
- FIG. 1 illustrates an example system architecture, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of operations for evaluating client device trust, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.
- FIG. 3 is another diagram of operations for evaluating client device trust, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.
- FIG. 4 depicts a flow diagram of a method for generating a partial trust metric, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.
- FIG. 5 depicts a flow diagram of a method for determining a client device trust status, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computer system, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
- a content sharing platform may offer content, such as video items, audio items, or gaming items, to users via client devices.
- a user may log into a user account associated with the content sharing platform to access the content sharing platform and upload and/or consume the content.
- the content sharing platform may use a content distribution network (CDN) (also referred to as a “content delivery network” herein) to store the content and provide it to client devices.
- CDN can include a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to provide high availability and high performance in the delivery of content. For example, server A of the CDN that in a same geographical vicinity as client device A can be selected to deliver content to client device A. Content delivered by server A can be delivered to client device A faster than another server, server B of CDN, that is not located in the same geographical vicinity as client device A.
- a user via a media player (e.g., a mobile application, a web browser, etc.) on a client device, can request content from a content sharing platform.
- the content sharing platform using an authorization service, can authorize the user account associated with the user to determine whether the user has permission to access the requested content. If the user account is authorized to access the content, the content sharing platform can generate one or more resource locators (e.g., uniform resource locators (URLs)) that can be used by the client device to obtain the requested content from a CDN.
- the content sharing platform can generate the URLs, send them to the client device, and the client device can request the desired content from the CDN using the URLs.
- URLs uniform resource locators
- a user can use an unauthorized media player (e.g., an overlay application, a third party media player, a modified media player, etc.) to access content from the CDN and perform unauthorized functions on the received content.
- the unauthorized media player can be capable of downloading the received content onto a local storage medium, a feature that can be prohibited by the content sharing platform.
- a user can deceive the content sharing platform and the CDN by requesting the URLs from the content sharing platform using an authorized media player, and then using the URLs to request the content from the CDN using an unauthorized media player.
- Such deception may be possible because, due to security reasons, a content sharing platform may desire not to share, with the CDN (which may be more susceptible to a security breach than highly-privileged core services of the content sharing platform), data relating to user account information, verification protocols, and the like, and therefore the CDN may not be able to accurately assess the trustworthiness of client devices sending requests for content.
- the CDN which may be more susceptible to a security breach than highly-privileged core services of the content sharing platform
- aspects and implementations of the present disclosure address these and other shortcomings of the existing technology by enabling a content sharing platform to generate a partial trust metric for use by the CDN to determine the trustworthiness (e.g., authenticity) of the client device.
- the content sharing platform responsive to receiving a request for content from the client device, can generate a partial trust metric for the client device.
- the partial trust metric can be any score, indicator, or other type of quantifiable measure used to indicate to the CDN the authenticity of the client device, the media player used by the client device, or the user account associated with the user.
- the partial trust metric can be created based on data available to the content sharing platform and can be used to indicate to the CDN the likelihood that the user, the media player, and/or the client device is authorized to access the requested content, as opposed to an unauthorized entity, such as those of a third party media player, a bot, a server farm, and so forth.
- the data used to create the partial trust metric can include factors associated with the client device, the user account, the media player, or any combination thereof.
- the factors can include a watch history of the user, whether the user previously viewed the content, whether the client device previously decrypted content successfully, whether the user is logged-in, whether the user has engaged or been suspected of engaging in unauthorized activity, the client device's IP address, an encryption log associated with the client device, and so forth.
- the content sharing platform can generate the partial trust metric by using a heuristic approach, a machine learning approach, or other approaches.
- the content sharing platform can then generate one or more resource locators (e.g., uniform resource locators (URLs)) to enable the client device to request the desired content from the CDN.
- the content sharing platform can append the resource locator(s) with the partial trust metric, and digitally sign the resulting response.
- the digital signature can be based on signed parameters (e.g., expiration parameter indicating when the use of the resource locator(s) and/or the partial trust metric should expire, bit rate parameter for delivering the requested content, an identifier of a playback event created for and associated with the content request, etc.), which are used to indicate to the CDN how the data is to be served.
- the client device can request the content from a CDN server using the resource locator(s) and the partial trust metric received from the content sharing platform.
- the CDN server can determine the client device trust status based on the partial trust metric.
- the client device trust status can be any type of indicator used by the CDN to determine whether to provide the requested content to the user.
- the CDN can use the partial trust metric and one or more additional factors identified by the CDN (based on information available to the CDN) to obtain a final trust metric, and compare the final trust metric to one or more threshold values to determine the client device trust status (e.g., high reliability, medium reliability, low reliability). Based on the comparison, the CDN can reduce or cap the resolution of the requested content (e.g., from high definition to standard definition), reduce or cap the frame rate, and so forth.
- the client device sends a separate request to a CDN server for each resource locator and includes the partial trust metric received from the content sharing platform in each of these requests. Based on the partial trust metric included in each request, the CDN server can ensure that all of the multiple requests for the desired content (e.g., multiple requests for portions of a particular video) are from a trustworthy media player, thereby protecting from malicious users that may use an authorized media player to obtain a first of portion of the desired content and then switch to an unauthorized player for the remainder of the desired content.
- the multiple requests for the desired content e.g., multiple requests for portions of a particular video
- the content sharing platform can provide a trust package that includes multiple characteristics indicating, for example, whether the user is logged in, a browser type used by the user to request the content, the geographic location of the client device, the IP address of the client device, and so forth.
- the client device can provide the trust package to the CDN server, which can then use the characteristics from the trust package (and in some embodiments information available to the CND server locally) to determine whether to provide the requested content to the user.
- aspects of the present disclosure result in technological advantages in improved performance of the media player of a client device, improved security for content stored by CDNs, improved security for user data, and improved security for the overall performance of the content sharing platform.
- the aspects of the present disclosure enable a content sharing platform and a CDN to verify the authenticity of the media player requesting content without subjecting a user to the latency associated with prolonged verification techniques.
- the technology disclosed herein enables the user to have a stable and uninterrupted viewing experience.
- aspects of the present disclosure enable a CDN to verify the user account and/or client device based on an opaque partial trust measure that does not expose the CDN (which may be susceptible to outside attacks) to information known to a highly secured core service of the content sharing platform that is used to generate the partial trust measure.
- the technology disclosed herein can include reducing the consumption of computational, memory, and bandwidth resources by the content sharing platform by allowing the CDN to perform authorization for the delivery of the requested content.
- Implementations of the present disclosure often reference videos for simplicity and brevity.
- teaching of the present disclosure are applied to media items generally and may be applied to various types of content, including for example, video, audio, text, images, program instructions, etc.

The method further includes generating, based on data available to the content sharing platform, a partial trust metric associated with the client device, wherein the partial trust metric is to be used by a CDN server to make a decision regarding access to the desired content by the client device. The method further includes generating a response to the content request, wherein the response comprises one or more resource locators for accessing the desired content in the CDN, and the partial trust metric. The method further includes sending the response to the client device to enable the client device to request the desired content from the CDN server using the resource locator(s) and the partial trust metric.
Description
- Aspects and embodiments of the disclosure relate to content sharing platforms, and more specifically, to evaluating client device trust in a distributed computing system.
- Content delivery platforms connecting via the Internet allow users to connect to and share information with each other. Many content delivery platforms include a content sharing aspect that allows users to upload, view, and share content, such as video items, image items, audio items, and so on. Other users of the content delivery platform may comment on the shared content, discover new content, locate updates, share content, and otherwise interact with the provided content. The shared content may include content from professional content creators, e.g., movie clips, TV clips, and music video items, as well as content from amateur content creators, e.g., video blogging and short original video items.
- An aspect of the disclosure provides a method comprising: receiving, by a processing device of a content sharing platform, a request for desired content from a client device, the content being stored in a content delivery network (CDN); generating, based on data available to the content sharing platform, a partial trust metric associated with the client device, wherein the partial trust metric is to be used by a CDN server to make a decision regarding access to the desired content by the client device; generating a response to the content request, wherein the response comprises one or more resource locators for accessing the desired content in the CDN, and the partial trust metric; and sending the response to the client device to enable the client device to request the desired content from the CDN server using the one or more resource locators and the partial trust metric.
- A further aspect of the disclosure provides a system comprising: a memory; and a processing device, coupled to the memory, to: receive, by a processing device of a content sharing platform, a request for desired content from a client device, the content being stored in a content delivery network (CDN); generate, based on data available to the content sharing platform, a trust package associated with the client device, wherein the trust package is to be used by a CDN server to make a decision regarding access to the desired content by the client device; generate a response to the content request, wherein the response comprises one or more resource locators for accessing the desired content in the CDN, and the trust package; and send the response to the client device to enable the client device to request the desired content from the CDN server using the one or more resource locators and the trust package.
- A further aspect of the disclosure provides a computer program product (such as a tangible computer-readable medium or a software product which can be downloaded without necessarily being stored for a non-transitory way) comprising instructions that, responsive to execution by a processing device, cause the processing device to perform operations comprising a method according to any aspect or embodiment described herein.
- Aspects and embodiments of the disclosure will be understood more fully from the detailed description given below and from the accompanying drawings of various aspects and embodiments of the disclosure, which, however, should not be taken to limit the disclosure to the specific aspects or embodiments, but are for explanation and understanding.

FIG. 2 is a diagram of operations for evaluating client device trust, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure. -
FIG. 3 is another diagram of operations for evaluating client device trust, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure. -
FIG. 4 depicts a flow diagram of a method for generating a partial trust metric, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure. -
FIG. 5 depicts a flow diagram of a method for determining a client device trust status, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure. -
FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computer system, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. - A content sharing platform (also referred to as a “content delivery platform” herein) may offer content, such as video items, audio items, or gaming items, to users via client devices. A user may log into a user account associated with the content sharing platform to access the content sharing platform and upload and/or consume the content. The content sharing platform may use a content distribution network (CDN) (also referred to as a “content delivery network” herein) to store the content and provide it to client devices. A CDN can include a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to provide high availability and high performance in the delivery of content. For example, server A of the CDN that in a same geographical vicinity as client device A can be selected to deliver content to client device A. Content delivered by server A can be delivered to client device A faster than another server, server B of CDN, that is not located in the same geographical vicinity as client device A.
- In some systems, a user, via a media player (e.g., a mobile application, a web browser, etc.) on a client device, can request content from a content sharing platform. The content sharing platform, using an authorization service, can authorize the user account associated with the user to determine whether the user has permission to access the requested content. If the user account is authorized to access the content, the content sharing platform can generate one or more resource locators (e.g., uniform resource locators (URLs)) that can be used by the client device to obtain the requested content from a CDN. For example, the content sharing platform can generate the URLs, send them to the client device, and the client device can request the desired content from the CDN using the URLs.
- However, in some instances, a user can use an unauthorized media player (e.g., an overlay application, a third party media player, a modified media player, etc.) to access content from the CDN and perform unauthorized functions on the received content. For example, the unauthorized media player can be capable of downloading the received content onto a local storage medium, a feature that can be prohibited by the content sharing platform. In other instances, a user can deceive the content sharing platform and the CDN by requesting the URLs from the content sharing platform using an authorized media player, and then using the URLs to request the content from the CDN using an unauthorized media player. Such deception may be possible because, due to security reasons, a content sharing platform may desire not to share, with the CDN (which may be more susceptible to a security breach than highly-privileged core services of the content sharing platform), data relating to user account information, verification protocols, and the like, and therefore the CDN may not be able to accurately assess the trustworthiness of client devices sending requests for content.
- Accordingly, in current systems, it is difficult to identify content requests from unauthorized media players. This can cause the content sharing platform and/or the CDN to mistakenly grant permission to the unauthorized media player to access the requested content, leading to the unauthorized media player performing unauthorized functions on the received content.
- Aspects and implementations of the present disclosure address these and other shortcomings of the existing technology by enabling a content sharing platform to generate a partial trust metric for use by the CDN to determine the trustworthiness (e.g., authenticity) of the client device. In an example embodiment, responsive to receiving a request for content from the client device, the content sharing platform can generate a partial trust metric for the client device. The partial trust metric can be any score, indicator, or other type of quantifiable measure used to indicate to the CDN the authenticity of the client device, the media player used by the client device, or the user account associated with the user. In particular, the partial trust metric can be created based on data available to the content sharing platform and can be used to indicate to the CDN the likelihood that the user, the media player, and/or the client device is authorized to access the requested content, as opposed to an unauthorized entity, such as those of a third party media player, a bot, a server farm, and so forth. The data used to create the partial trust metric can include factors associated with the client device, the user account, the media player, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the factors can include a watch history of the user, whether the user previously viewed the content, whether the client device previously decrypted content successfully, whether the user is logged-in, whether the user has engaged or been suspected of engaging in unauthorized activity, the client device's IP address, an encryption log associated with the client device, and so forth. In some embodiments, the content sharing platform can generate the partial trust metric by using a heuristic approach, a machine learning approach, or other approaches.
- The content sharing platform can then generate one or more resource locators (e.g., uniform resource locators (URLs)) to enable the client device to request the desired content from the CDN. The content sharing platform can append the resource locator(s) with the partial trust metric, and digitally sign the resulting response. The digital signature can be based on signed parameters (e.g., expiration parameter indicating when the use of the resource locator(s) and/or the partial trust metric should expire, bit rate parameter for delivering the requested content, an identifier of a playback event created for and associated with the content request, etc.), which are used to indicate to the CDN how the data is to be served. The client device can request the content from a CDN server using the resource locator(s) and the partial trust metric received from the content sharing platform.
- Responsive to receiving the request with the resource locators and the partial trust metric from the client device, the CDN server can determine the client device trust status based on the partial trust metric. The client device trust status can be any type of indicator used by the CDN to determine whether to provide the requested content to the user. In some embodiments, the CDN can use the partial trust metric and one or more additional factors identified by the CDN (based on information available to the CDN) to obtain a final trust metric, and compare the final trust metric to one or more threshold values to determine the client device trust status (e.g., high reliability, medium reliability, low reliability). Based on the comparison, the CDN can reduce or cap the resolution of the requested content (e.g., from high definition to standard definition), reduce or cap the frame rate, and so forth.
- In some embodiments, if the content sharing platform provides multiple resource locators for the desired content, the client device sends a separate request to a CDN server for each resource locator and includes the partial trust metric received from the content sharing platform in each of these requests. Based on the partial trust metric included in each request, the CDN server can ensure that all of the multiple requests for the desired content (e.g., multiple requests for portions of a particular video) are from a trustworthy media player, thereby protecting from malicious users that may use an authorized media player to obtain a first of portion of the desired content and then switch to an unauthorized player for the remainder of the desired content.
- In some embodiments, rather than (or an addition to) providing a partial trust metric to the client device, the content sharing platform can provide a trust package that includes multiple characteristics indicating, for example, whether the user is logged in, a browser type used by the user to request the content, the geographic location of the client device, the IP address of the client device, and so forth. When requesting content from the CDN server, the client device can provide the trust package to the CDN server, which can then use the characteristics from the trust package (and in some embodiments information available to the CND server locally) to determine whether to provide the requested content to the user.
- Aspects of the present disclosure result in technological advantages in improved performance of the media player of a client device, improved security for content stored by CDNs, improved security for user data, and improved security for the overall performance of the content sharing platform. In particular, the aspects of the present disclosure enable a content sharing platform and a CDN to verify the authenticity of the media player requesting content without subjecting a user to the latency associated with prolonged verification techniques. As such, the technology disclosed herein enables the user to have a stable and uninterrupted viewing experience. Further, aspects of the present disclosure enable a CDN to verify the user account and/or client device based on an opaque partial trust measure that does not expose the CDN (which may be susceptible to outside attacks) to information known to a highly secured core service of the content sharing platform that is used to generate the partial trust measure. Additionally, the technology disclosed herein can include reducing the consumption of computational, memory, and bandwidth resources by the content sharing platform by allowing the CDN to perform authorization for the delivery of the requested content.
- Implementations of the present disclosure often reference videos for simplicity and brevity. However, the teaching of the present disclosure are applied to media items generally and may be applied to various types of content, including for example, video, audio, text, images, program instructions, etc.

Themedia player 112 can also include an embedded media player (e.g., a Flash® player or an HTML5 player) that is embedded in a web page (e.g., a web page that may provide information about a product sold by an online merchant). In another example, themedia player 112 can be a standalone application (e.g., a mobile application, or native application) that allows users to playback digital media items (e.g., digital video items, digital images, electronic books, etc.). According to aspects of the present disclosure, themedia player 112 can be a content sharing platform application for users to record, edit, and/or upload content for sharing on the content sharing platform. As such, themedia players 112 can be provided to theclient devices 110A-110Z bycontent sharing platform 120.

content sharing platform 120. - The
content sharing platform 120 can include multiple channels (e.g., channels A through Z, of which only channel A is shown inFIG. 1 ). A channel can be data content available from a common source or data content having a common topic, theme, or substance. The data content can be digital content chosen by a user, digital content made available by a user, digital content uploaded by a user, digital content chosen by a content provider, digital content chosen by a broadcaster, etc. For example, a channel X can include videos Y and Z. A channel can be associated with an owner, who is a user that can perform actions on the channel. Different activities can be associated with the channel based on the owner's actions, such as the owner making digital content available on the channel, the owner selecting (e.g., liking) digital content associated with another channel, the owner commenting on digital content associated with another channel, etc. The activities associated with the channel can be collected into an activity feed for the channel. Users, other than the owner of the channel, can subscribe to one or more channels in which they are interested. The concept of “subscribing” may also be referred to as “liking”, “following”, “friending”, and so on. - Once a user subscribes to a channel, the user can be presented with information from the channel's activity feed. If a user subscribes to multiple channels, the activity feed for each channel to which the user is subscribed can be combined into a syndicated activity feed. Information from the syndicated activity feed can be presented to the user. Channels may have their own feeds. For example, when navigating to a home page of a channel on the content sharing platform, feed items produced by that channel may be shown on the channel home page. Users may have a syndicated feed, which is a feed including at least a subset of the content items from all of the channels to which the user is subscribed. Syndicated feeds may also include content items from channels that the user is not subscribed. For example,
content sharing platform 120 or other social networks can insert recommended content items into the user's syndicated feed, or may insert content items associated with a related connection of the user in the syndicated feed. - Each channel may include one or
more media items 122. Examples of amedia item 122 can include, and are not limited to, digital video, digital movies, digital photos, digital music, audio content, melodies, website content, social media updates, electronic books (ebooks), electronic magazines, digital newspapers, digital audio books, electronic journals, web blogs, real simple syndication (RSS) feeds, electronic comic books, software applications, etc. In some embodiments,media item 122 is also referred to as content or a content item. - For brevity and simplicity, rather than limitation, a video item, audio item, or gaming item are used as an example of a
media item 122 throughout this document. As used herein, “media,” media item,” “online media item,” “digital media,” “digital media item,” “content,” and “content item” can include an electronic file that can be executed or loaded using software, firmware or hardware configured to present the digital media item to an entity. In one embodiment,content sharing platform 120 may store themedia items 122 using thedata store 106. In another embodiment,content sharing platform 120 can store video items or fingerprints as electronic files in one or more formats usingdata store 106. - In some embodiments,
media items 122 are video items. A video item is a set of sequential video frames (e.g., image frames) representing a scene in motion. For example, a series of sequential video frames may be captured continuously or later reconstructed to produce animation. Video items may be presented in various formats including, but not limited to, analog, digital, two-dimensional and three-dimensional video. Further, video items may include movies, video clips or any set of animated images to be displayed in sequence. In addition, a video item may be stored as a video file that includes a video component and an audio component. The video component may refer to video data in a video coding format or image coding format (e.g., H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC), H.264 MPEG-4 Part 2, Graphic Interchange Format (GIF), WebP, etc.). The audio component may refer to audio data in an audio coding format (e.g., advanced audio coding (AAC), MP3, etc.). It may be noted GIF may be saved as an image file (e.g., .gif file) or saved as a series of images into an animated GIF (e.g., GIF89a format). It may be noted that H.264 may be a video coding format that is block-oriented motion-compensation-based video compression standard for recording, compression, or distribution of video content, for example. - In some embodiments, the media item can be streamed, such as in a live stream to one or more of
client devices 110A-110Z. It is be noted that “streamed” or “streaming” refers to a transmission or broadcast of content, such as a media item, where the received portions of the media item may be played back by a receiving device immediately upon receipt (within technological limitations) or while other portions of the media content are being delivered, and without the entire media item having been received by the receiving device. “Stream” may refer to content, such as a media item, that is streamed or streaming. A live-stream media item may refer to a live broadcast or transmission of a live event, where the media item is concurrently transmitted, at least in part, as the event occurs to a receiving device, and where the media item is not available in its entirety. - In some embodiments,
content sharing platform 120 can allow users to create, share, view or use playlists containing media items (e.g., playlist A-Z, containing media items 122). A playlist refers to a collection of media items that are configured to play one after another in a particular order without any user interaction. In some embodiments,content sharing platform 120 may maintain the playlist on behalf of a user. In some embodiments, the playlist feature of thecontent sharing platform 120 allows users to group their favorite media items together in a single location for playback. In embodiments,content sharing platform 120 may send a media item on a playlist toclient device 110 for playback or display. For example,media viewer 112 may be used to play the media items on a playlist in the order in which the media items are listed on the playlist. In another example, a user can transition between media items on a playlist. In yet another example, a user can wait for the next media item on the playlist to play or can select a particular media item in the playlist for playback. - In some embodiments, the user can access content on sharing
platform 120 through a user account. The user can access (e.g., log in to) the user account by providing user account information (e.g., username and password) via an application on client device 110 (e.g., media viewer 112). In some embodiments, the user account may be associated with a single user. In other embodiments, the user account can be a shared account (e.g., family account shared by multiple users) (also referred to as “shared user account” herein). The shared account can have multiple user profiles, each associated with a different user. The multiple users can login to the shared account using the same account information or different account information. In some embodiments, the multiple users of the shared account may be differentiated based on the different user profiles of the shared account. - In some embodiments, an authorizing data service 124 (also referred to as a “core data service” or “authorizing data source” herein) is a highly-secured service that has access to data pertaining to user accounts on the
content sharing platform 120 and that can use this data to decide whether to authorize a user account to obtain requested content. In some embodiments, authorizingdata service 124 can authorize a user account (e.g., client device associated with the user account) access to requested content, authorize delivery of the requested content to the client device, or both. Authorization of the user account to access the requested content can involve authorizing what content is accessed and who is permitted to access the content. Authorization of the delivery of the content can involve authorizing how the content is delivered. - In some embodiments, authorizing
data service 124 can use user account information to authorize the user account. In some embodiments, an authentication token associated withclient device 110 ormedia player 112 can be used to determine whether to authorize the user account and/or playback of requested content. - In some embodiments, authorizing
data service 124 is part ofcontent sharing platform 120. In other embodiments, authorizingdata service 124 can be an external service, such as a highly-secured authorizing service offered by a third-party. - As noted above, content distribution network (CDN) 130 can include one or more nodes, represented as
server machines 132A-132Z (generally referred to as “server machine(s) 132” or “server(s) 132” herein). In embodiments,content distribution network 130 includes a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of content. The network of servers are geographically distributed to provide high availability and high performance by distributing content or services based, in some instances, on proximity toclient devices 110. The closer a CDN server is to aclient device 110, the faster the content can be delivered to theclient device 110. - For example,
different server machines 132A-132Z can be distributed geographically within a particular country or across different countries. User A usingclient device 110A located in the Great Britain can request to obtain content hosted bycontent sharing platform 120. The request can be received by authorizingdata service 124 ofcontent sharing platform 120 and the user account associated with user A can be authorized to obtain the requested content. Subsequent to authorization,content sharing platform 120 can send a resource locator, such as a uniform resource locator (URL), to theclient device 110A. A resource locator can refer to a reference that specifies a location or address of a resource (e.g., content) on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving the resource. The resource locator can direct theclient device 110A to obtain the content from aserver machine 132 ofcontent distribution network 130 that is located geographically proximate toclient device 110A. For example, the resource locator can direct theclient device 110A to obtain the requested content from aparticular server machine 132 ofcontent distribution network 130 that is also located in Great Britain. In another example, another user B using client device 110B located in the west coast of the United States requests to obtain the same content as user A. The request can be received by authorizingdata service 124 ofcontent sharing platform 120 and the user account associated with user B can be authorized to obtain the requested content. Subsequent to authorization,content sharing platform 120 can send a resource locator to the client device 110B. The resource locator can direct the client device 110B to obtain the content from aserver machine 132 ofcontent distribution network 130 that is located geographically proximate to client device 110B. For example, the resource locator can direct the client device 110B to obtain the requested content from aserver machine 132 ofcontent distribution network 130 located at the west coast of the United States. - In some embodiments,
content distribution network 130 is part ofcontent sharing platform 120. In other embodiments, thecontent distribution network 130 is a third-party platform that provides CDN services tocontent sharing platform 120. In other embodiments, some ofcontent distribution network 130 can be operated bycontent sharing platform 120 and another part ofcontent distribution network 130 can be operated by a third-party. In embodiments,content distribution network 130 includes a data store, such asdata store 134.Data store 134 can be similar todata store 106. Data store can include data files 136 for content, such as media content.Data store 106 can also include one or morecryptographic keys 137, such as one or more public keys or one or more private keys. -
Authorization module 138 can be included inserver 132 ofCDN 130.Authorization module 138 can perform aspects of the disclosure described herein. For example,authorization module 138 can determine a client device trust status. The client device trust status can be any type of indicator used byCDN 130 to determine whether to release requested content to a user. As explained in more detail herein, the client device trust status can be determined based on a partial trust metric or a trust package. - In general, functions described in one embodiment as being performed by the
content sharing platform 120, and/orcontent distribution network 130 can also be performed on theclient devices 110A through 110Z in other embodiments, if appropriate. In addition, the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together. Thecontent sharing platform 120 orcontent distribution network 130 can also be accessed as a service provided to other systems or devices through appropriate application programming interfaces, and thus is not limited to use in websites. - Although embodiments of the disclosure are discussed in terms of content sharing platforms and promoting social network sharing of a content item on the
content sharing platform 120, embodiments may also be generally applied to any type of social network providing connections between users, or content delivery platform. Implementations of the disclosure are not limited to content sharing platforms that provide channel subscriptions to users. - Further to the descriptions above, a user may be provided with controls allowing the user to make an election as to both if and when systems, programs, or features described herein may enable collection of user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions, or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), and if the user is sent content or communications from a server. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over what information is collected about the user, how that information is used, and what information is provided to the user.

FIG. 2 is a diagram of operations for evaluating client device trust, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.System 200 may include similar components assystem architecture 100 ofFIG. 1 . It may be noted that components ofFIG. 1 may be used to help describeFIG. 2 . For purposes of illustration, rather than limitation, operations with respect tosystem 200 are described as performed by authorizingdata service 124 ofcontent sharing platform 120,server machine 132 ofcontent distribution network 130, orclient device 110 may be performed by any component thereof, unless otherwise described. The operations described with respect toFIG. 2 are shown to be performed sequentially for the sake of illustration, rather than limitation. It may be noted that the operations may be performed in any order and that any of the operations may be performed concurrently with one or more other operations. In some implementations, the same, different, fewer, or greater number of operations may be performed in any order. - At
operation 202, responsive to a user input for content,client device 110 sends a request to obtain content to authorizingdata service 124 ofcontent sharing platform 120. For example, a user ofclient device 110 can request to play a video item that is hosted bycontent sharing platform 120. In some embodiments, the user can use an application, such as a browser or native application, to request the content fromcontent sharing platform 120. The content may be stored on one or more nodes or servers of a content delivery network (one or more CDN servers 132). - In some embodiments, the request from
client device 110 to the authorizingdata service 124 can include the format of the data to be received. For instance, the request can include a format of the video item that is compatible with themedia viewer 112 at theclient device 110. In some embodiments, the request can include additional information (e.g., type, version, etc.) pertaining to themedia viewer 112 at which the content, such as a video item, is to be played back. - In some embodiments, the content request can include identifiers of the client device, or user account attempting to obtain the content. For example, the user request can identify a username and password associated with the user account requesting to obtain the content. In another example, the request can include a cookie that identifies the
client device 110 or application at the user device, which can be used to identify a particular user account. For example, a user can login to content sharingplatform 120 using user account information and, responsive tocontent sharing platform 120 authorizing the user account, thecontent sharing platform 120 can send a cookie touser device 120. In yet another example, the content request can include other data associated with the user or a user account, such as, for example, an internet protocol (IP) address associated with the client device. - At operation 204, authorizing
data service 124 ofcontent sharing platform 120 can generate a partial trust metric associated with the content request. The partial trust metric can be any score, indicator, or other type of quantifiable measure used to indicate toserver 132 the authenticity of the client device, the media player used by the client device, or the user account. In particular, the partial trust metric can be used to indicate toCDN server 132 the likelihood that the user, the media player, and/or the client device is trustworthy and should be authorized to access the requested content, as opposed to an unauthorized entity (e.g., an unauthorized media player, a bot, a server farm, and so forth). - The authorizing
data service 124 can generate the partial trust metric based on factors (e.g., data, signals, etc.) associated with client device 110 (or the user account,media player 112, or any combination thereof). One or more factors can be accessible by authorizingdata service 124, but not available toserver 132. In some embodiments, the factors can include a watch history of the user, whether the user viewed the content before, whether the client device previously decrypted content successfully, whether the user is logged-in, whether the user has engaged or been suspected of engaging in an authorized activity, the user's IP address, an encryption log associated with the user, and so forth. - In some embodiments, authorizing
data service 124 can generate the partial trust metric by using a heuristic approach. According to the heuristic approach, authorizingdata service 124 uses heuristic rules that involve assigning a weight and numerical value between 0 and 1 for each factor used in generating the partial trust metric, and combining the weighted factors to generate a partial trust metric. In one example, for the factor of whether the client device previously decrypted content successfully, a numerical value of 0 can be assigned if the user has not previously decrypted content successfully, or a numerical value of 1 can be assigned if the user has previously decrypted content successfully. In another example, for the factor of whether the client device previously decrypted content successfully, a numerical value of 0 can be assigned if the user has not previously decrypted content successfully, a numerical value of 0.5 can be assigned if the user has previously decrypted content successfully fewer than five times, and a numerical value of 1 can be assigned if the user has previously decrypted content successfully at least five times. Different scales and any score values can be used with each factor to determine the partial trust metric. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the partial trust metric can be a sum of each weighted factor, which can be normalized between 0 and 1. - In some embodiments, authorizing
data service 124 can generate the partial trust metric by using a machine learning approach. In the machine learning approach authorizingdata service 124 may use a trained partial trust predicting model, which can be a machine learning model corresponding to a model artifact that is created by a training engine using training data that includes training inputs and corresponding target outputs (i.e., indicated answers for respective training inputs). The training inputs can be based on historical data and include factors associated with various client devices previously requesting content from authorizingdata service 124 and/orCDN server 132. The target outputs can include indications of whether the client devices were authorized to obtain the requested content. In another implementation, the partial trust predicting model can be trained for a specific user based on training data associated with the user, and or the media player and/or the client device of the user. - At
operation 206, authorizingdata service 124 ofcontent sharing platform 120 can authorize the content request. To authorize the request, authorizingdata service 124 can determine that at least one of theclient device 110 or the user (or user account), is permitted to obtain the content. In some embodiments, authorizingdata service 124 can determine whether the partial trust metric satisfies (e.g., is greater than) an authorization threshold value. The authorization threshold value can be any value used to determine whetherclient device 110 should be authorized to receive content identifiers fromcontent sharing platform 120. Responsive to the partial trust metric satisfying the authorization threshold value, authorizingdata service 124 can authorize the content request. For example, responsive to the partial trust metric being greater than 0.2,client device 110 can be deemed authorized. - In some embodiments, determining whether to authorize the content request can be independent of the authorization threshold value. In one example, the content request can identify the account information of the user account requesting to obtain the content. For example, the account information can be encrypted in a cookie. In another example, the account information can be input by the user and provided in the request. In some embodiments, the account information, such as the username and password, can be authenticated by the authorizing
data service 124 by comparing the account information (e.g., received username and password) with a stored record of the account information. If the account information of the request matches the account information of the record, the authorizingdata service 124 can determine that the particular user account is authenticated, and the authorizingdata service 124 can authorize the content request and assign a predefined partial trust metric to the content request. - In some embodiments, responsive to the authorizing
data service 124 failing to authorize the content request and/or authenticateclient device 110, the content request can be denied by authorizingdata service 124. In some embodiments, if authorizingdata service 124 does not authorize the request to obtain the content, authorizingdata service 124 can send a message toclient device 110 indicating that authorization is not granted to obtain the requested content. - In some embodiments, responsive to the authorizing
data service 124 authorizing the request to obtain the content, the authorizingdata service 124 generates one or more resource locators (e.g., URLs) to authorize theclient device 110 to obtain the requested content fromCDN 130. In some embodiments, the resource locators can identify theCDN server 130 that is to deliver the requested content to theclient device 110. For example, the resource locators can include a hostname, which identifies the particular server (e.g., server 112A, server 112B, etc.) that can be accessed to obtain the requested content. In some embodiments, the authorizingdata service 124 can append the resource locator(s) with the partial trust metric, and can digitally sign the resulting response. The digital signature can be based on signed parameters (e.g., expiration parameter, bit rate parameter, playback event identifier, etc.) that can be used to indicate to CDN 130 which data is to be served and how the data is to be served. In some embodiments, the digital signature can be encrypted. - At operation 208, responsive to the user account being authorized, authorizing
data service 124 can send a response to the request for content (e.g., operation 202) toclient device 110. In some embodiments, the response can include the one or more resource locators that identifiesCDN server 132 that is to deliver the content to theclient device 110, and the partial trust metric. In some embodiments, the response can also include the digital signature. In some embodiments, the response can include one or more of a content identifier, a user account identifier and/or a playback event identifier associated with the content request. In some embodiments, the response can be a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response. - At operation 210,
client device 110 can request the content using the resource locator and the partial trust metric, appended with the digital signature. In some embodiments, the request can be sent toCDN server 132. In some embodiments,CDN server 132 can decrypt the digital signature using, for example, one or more cryptographic keys, public keys, private keys, etc. - At operation 212,
CDN server 132 can determine the client device trust status based on the partial trust metric. The client device trust status can be any type of indicator used byCDN server 132 to determine whether to release the requested content to the user. In some embodiments,CDN server 132 can compare the partial trust metric to one or more threshold values to determine the client device trust status. Based on the comparison,server 132 can reduce or cap the resolution of the requested content (e.g., 2160p, 1440p, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 540p, 360p, 240p, etc.), reduce or cap the frame rate (e.g., 24 frames per second (fps), 25fps, 30fps, 60fps, 120fps, etc.), throttle the data transmitted toclient device 110, and so forth. In one example, responsive toserver 132 determining that the partial trust metric is greater than a first threshold value (e.g., 0.5),server 132 can determine that the client device is trusted and provide the content in the format requested (e.g., standard definition, high definition, etc.). Responsive toserver 132 determining that the partial trust metric is less than the first threshold value (e.g., 0.5) but greater than a second threshold value (e.g., 0.2),server 132 can determine that the client device is questionable and release the content only in standard definition rather than high definition. Responsive toserver 132 determining that the partial trust metric is less than the second threshold value (e.g., 0.2),server 132 can determine that the client device is not to be trusted and reject the content request. - In some embodiments, based on the determined client device trust status,
CDN server 132 may requestclient device 110 to perform one or more additional functions prior toCDN server 132 releasing the requested content. The additional functions can include requesting a ReCaptcha verification, requesting the user ofclient device 110 to sign in, etc. For example, responsive toCDN server 132 determining that the partial trust metric is less than the first threshold value (e.g., 0.5) but greater than a second threshold value (e.g., 0.2),CDN server 132 can determine that the client device is questionable and request the user to sign into their user account. - In some embodiments,
CDN server 132 can combine the partial trust metric with one or more additional CDN associated factors to determine the client device trust status. The additional factors can be identified byCDN server 132 based on information available toCDN server 132. In particular, the additional factors can include any data relating toclient device 110, the user (user account), and/or the content request to CDN server 132 (at operation 210) that is determined byCDN server 132 based on the content request toCDN server 132 or other information available toCDN server 132 locally. For example, the additional factors (CDN determined factors) can include the IP address used to request the content, one or more cookies provided to CDN 130 with the content request, a client agent reported by the client device (e.g., a browser, a bot, a download manager, an app accessing the internet, etc.), the type of the requested content (e.g., popular, private, advertising, a paid video, etc.), the bitrate of the requested content, the amount of content requested in the request, and so forth. In some embodiments,CDN server 132 can determine the device trust status by raising or lowering the partial trust metric based on one or more of the CDN determined factors, then comparing the new trust metric to one or more threshold values. In an illustrative example, a suspicious IP address can result in lowering the partial trust metric by a value of 0.1. Thus, in response toclient device 110 being assigned a partial trust metric of 0.25, andCDN server 132 determining that the content request at operation 210 was received from a suspicious IP address,CDN server 132 can lower the partial trust metric by a value of 0.1, and compare the new trust metric of 0.15 to one or more threshold values to determine the client device trust status ofclient device 110. In some embodiments,CDN server 132 can combine the partial trust metric with one or more CDN determined factors using a heuristic approach, where each CDN determined factor and/or the partial trust metric can be assigned a weight, and weighted factors are combined with the weighted or unweighted partial trust metric to determine the client device trust status. In other embodiments,CDN server 132 can combine the partial trust metric with the one or more CDN determined factors using a machine learning approach. - At
operation 214, based on the client device trust status,CDN server 132 can respond to the content request with content associated with the resource locator(s). For example, the response can include the requested video item when the client device trust status indicates that the client device is trusted, or with the requested video item in a lower format than requested when the client device is questionable. -
FIG. 3 is a diagram of operations for evaluating client device trust, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.System 300 may include similar components assystem architecture 100 ofFIG. 1 . It may be noted that components ofFIG. 1 may be used to help describeFIG. 3 . For purposes of illustration, rather than limitation, operations with respect tosystem 300 are described as performed by authorizingdata service 124 ofcontent sharing platform 120,server machine 132 ofcontent distribution network 130, orclient device 110 may be performed by any component thereof, unless otherwise described. The operations described with respect toFIG. 3 are shown to be performed sequentially for the sake of illustration, rather than limitation. It may be noted that the operations may be performed in any order and that any of the operations may be performed concurrently with one or more other operations. In some implementations, the same, different, fewer, or greater number of operations may be performed in any order. - At
operation 302, responsive to a user input for content,client device 110 sends a request to obtain content to authorizingdata service 124 ofcontent sharing platform 120. For example, a user ofclient device 110 can request to play a video item that is hosted bycontent sharing platform 120. In some embodiments, the user can use an application, such as a browser or native application, to request the content fromcontent sharing platform 120. The content may be stored on one or more nodes or servers of a content delivery network (one or more CDN servers 132). - In some embodiments, the request from
client device 110 to the authorizingdata service 124 can include the format of the data to be received. For instance, the request can include a format of the video item that is compatible with themedia viewer 112 at theclient device 110. In some embodiments, the request can include additional information (e.g., type, version, etc.) pertaining to themedia viewer 112 at which the content, such as a video item, is to be played back. - In some embodiments, the content request can include identifiers of the client device, or user account attempting to obtain the content. For example, the user request can identify a username and password associated with the user account requesting to obtain the content. In another example, the request can include a cookie that identifies the
client device 110 or application at the user device, which can be used to identify a particular user account. For example, a user can login to content sharingplatform 120 using user account information and, responsive tocontent sharing platform 120 authorizing the user account, thecontent sharing platform 120 can send a cookie touser device 120. In yet another example, the content request can include other data associated with the user or a user account, such as, for example, an internet protocol (IP) address associated with the client device. - At
operation 304, authorizingdata service 124 ofcontent sharing platform 120 can generate a trust package associated with the content request. In some embodiments, the trust package can include data such as whether the user is logged in, a browser type used by the user to request the content, the geographic location of the user, the IP address of the user, and so forth. In some embodiments, the trust package can include instructions to theCDN server 132. The instructions can instructCDN server 132 to perform one or more functions in response to a condition (or criterion) being satisfied. The functions can include rejecting the content request, reducing or cap the resolution of the requested content, requesting a ReCaptcha verification, requesting the user ofclient device 110 to sign in, etc. The condition can be based on one or more of the content request to CDN server 132 (at operation 310, below) originating from a specified region or not originating from a specified region, the content request toCDN server 132 using or not using an IP address or an IP address of a specified subnet, the content request toCDN server 132 using or not using a specified browser, etc. For example, the instructions can indicate toCDN server 132 to reduce the resolution of the requested content if the content request toCDN server 132 does not originate from a browser of a particular type. - At
operation 306, authorizingdata service 124 ofcontent sharing platform 120 can authorize the content request. To authorize the request, authorizingdata service 124 can determine that at least one of theclient device 110 or the user (or user account), is permitted to obtain the content. In one example, the content request can identify the account information of the user account requesting to obtain the content. For example, the account information can be encrypted in a cookie. In another example, the account information can be input by the user and provided in the request. In some embodiments, the account information, such as the username and password, can be authenticated by the authorizingdata service 124 by comparing the account information (e.g., received username and password) with a stored record of the account information. If the account information of the request matches the account information of the record, the authorizingdata service 124 can determine that the particular user account is authenticated, and the authorizingdata service 124 can authorize the content request. - In some embodiments, responsive to the authorizing
data service 124 failing to authorize the content request and/or authenticateclient device 110, the content request can be denied by authorizingdata service 124. In some embodiments, if authorizingdata service 124 does not authorize the request to obtain the content, authorizingdata service 124 can send a message toclient device 110 indicating that authorization is not granted to obtain the requested content. - In some embodiments, responsive to the authorizing
data service 124 authorizing the request to obtain the content, the authorizingdata service 124 generates one or more resource locators (e.g., URLs) to authorize theclient device 110 to obtain the requested content fromCDN network 130. In some embodiments, the resource locators can identify the CDN server that is to deliver the requested content to theclient device 110. For example, the resource locators can include a hostname, which identifies the particular server (e.g., server 112A, server 112B, etc.) that can be accessed to obtain the requested content. In some embodiments, the authorizingdata service 124 can append the resource locator(s) with the trust package, and digitally sign the resulting response. The digital signature can be based on signed parameters (e.g., expiration parameter, bit rate parameter, playback event identifier parameter, etc.), which can be used to indicate toCDN server 132 which data is to be served and how the data is to be served. In some embodiments, the digital signature can be encrypted. - At operation 308, responsive to the user account being authorized, authorizing
data service 124 can send a response to the request for content (e.g., operation 302) toclient device 110. In some embodiments, the response can include the one or more resource locators that identifiesserver 132 of CDN 130 that is to deliver the content to theclient device 110. In some embodiments, the response also includes the trust package, and the digital signature. In some embodiments, the response can include one or more of a content identifier, a user account identifier and/or a playback event identifier associated with the content request. In some embodiments, the response can be a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response. - In some embodiments, authorizing
data service 124 can send the trust package to the identified CDN server(s) 132 instead including the trust package in the response toclient device 110. In some embodiments, the trust package is digitally signed using one or more signed parameters providing, for example, an expiration time for the trust package and/or a playback event identifier created for the content request. - At operation 310,
client device 110 can request the content using the resource locator and the trust package, appended with the digital signature. In some embodiments, the request can be sent toCDN server 132. In some embodiments,CDN server 132 can decrypt the digital signature using, for example, one or more cryptographic keys, public keys, private keys, etc. - At operation 312,
CDN server 132 can determine the client device trust status based on the trust package. The client device trust status can be any type of indicator used byCDN server 132 to determine whether to release the requested content to the user. In some embodiments,CDN server 132 can compare data from the trust package received at operation 310 (and/or received directly from authorizing data service 124) to data (e.g., CDN determined factors) obtained from the content request of operation 310. Based on the comparison (e.g., whetherserver 132 detects discrepancies in the comparison),server 132 can determine the client device trust status. In some embodiments, responsive to determining no discrepancies in the data obtained from the trust package and the data obtained from the content request of operation 310,CDN server 132 can assign a trusted status to the client device and release the requested content. In some embodiments, responsive to determining a discrepancy in the data obtained from the trust package and the data obtained from the content request of operation 310,CDN server 132 can assign an untrusted status or questionable status toclient device 110, and reject the content request or downgrade the playback quality of the request, respectively. For example, responsive toCDN server 132 determining that the client device requested the content from authorizingdata service 124 using a first type of browser, and requested the content fromserver 132 using a second type of browser,CDN server 132 can reduce the request content resolution of 1080p to 480p. - In some embodiments, responsive to determining a discrepancy in the data obtained from the trust package and the data obtained from the content request of operation 310,
CDN server 132 can requestclient device 110 to perform one or more additional functions prior toserver 132 releasing the requested content. The additional functions can include requesting a ReCaptcha verification, requesting the user ofclient device 110 to sign in, etc. For example, responsive toCDN server 132 determining that the client device requested the content from authorizingdata service 124 using a first IP address, and requested the content fromCDN server 132 using a different IP address,CDN server 132 can determine that the client device is questionable and request the user to sign into their user account. - At
operation 314, based on the client device trust status,CDN server 132 can respond to the content request with content associated with the resource locator(s). For example, the response can include the requested video item when the client device trust status indicates that the client device is trusted, or with the requested video item in a lower format than requested when the client device is questionable. - In some embodiments,
CDN server 132 can use any combination of the partial trust metric, the trust package, and/or the CDN determined factors to determine a client device trust status. For example, the authorizingdata service 124 can generate one or more resource locators to authorize theclient device 110 to obtain the requested content fromCDN 130. The authorizingdata service 124 can further append the resource locator(s) with the partial trust metric and the trust package, and send the resulting response toclient device 110, and in addition the authorizingdata service 124 can send the trust package toCDN server 132.CDN server 132 can then use the partial trust metric and the trust package to determine the client device trust status. -

The method is performed by processing logic that may include hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, some or all the operations ofmethod 400 may be performed by one or more components ofsystem 100 ofFIG. 1 . In other embodiments, one or more operations ofmethod 400 may be performed by an authorization module ofcontent distribution network 130 or an authorizingdata service 124, as described with respect toFIG. 1-2 . It may be noted that components described with respectFIG. 1-3 may be used to illustrate aspects ofFIG. 4 . - At
block 402 processinglogic implementing method 400 receives a request for content from a client device. - At
block 404, the processing logic generates, based on data available to the content sharing platform, a partial trust metric associated with the client device. In some embodiments, the partial trust metric is to be used by a CDN server to make a decision regarding access to the desired content by the client device, and can include a score to indicate to the CDN server a likelihood that the client device is trustworthy and should be authorized to access requested content. In some embodiments, the partial trust metric is generated based on one or more characteristics such as a watch history of a user associated with the client device, whether the user viewed the requested content before, whether the client device previously decrypted other content successfully, whether the user is logged-in, whether the user has engaged or been suspected of engaging in an unauthorized activity, the internet protocol (IP) address of the client device, or an encryption log associated with the user. The characteristics used to generate the partial trust metric may not be available to the CDN server. In some embodiments, the partial trust metric is generated using heuristic rules. In some embodiments, the partial trust metric is generated using a trained machine learning model. In some embodiments, the partial trust metric is encrypted for decryption by the CDN server. - At
block 406, the processing logic generates a response to the content request. The response can include one or more resource locators provided by the content sharing platform to authorize the client device to obtain the requested content. The response can also include the partial trust metric, and can be digitally signed. In some embodiments, the processing logic can reject the content request based on the partial trust metric. - At
block 408, the processing logic sends the response to the client device. The partial trust metric, but not any of the characteristics used to generated the metric, can be provided to the CDN server by the client device when requesting the desired content and can be used by the CDN server to determine whether to provide the requested content to the client device or downgrade the quality of the requested content. In some embodiments,method 400 can be used to generate a trust package, as discussed inFIG. 3 . -
FIG. 5 depicts a flow diagram of amethod 500 for determining a client device trust status, in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure. The method is performed by processing logic that may include hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processing device), or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, some or all the operations ofmethod 500 may be performed by one or more components ofsystem 100 ofFIG. 1 . In other embodiments, one or more operations ofmethod 500 may be performed by an authorization module ofCDN server 132 and/or an authorizingdata server 124 as described with respect toFIG. 1-3 . It may be noted that components described with respectFIG. 1-3 may be used to illustrate aspects ofFIG. 5 - At
block 502 processinglogic implementing method 500 receives a request for content from a client device. The request includes a resource locator provided by an authorizing data service to authorize a client device to obtain the requested content. The resource locator can be appended with a partial trust metric. - At
block 504, the processing logic determines the client device trust status based on the partial trust metric. The client device trust status can be any type of indicator used by the processing logic to determine whether to release the requested content to the user. In some embodiments, the processing logic can compare the partial trust metric to one or more threshold values to determine the client device trust status. Based on the comparison, the processing logic can reduce or cap the resolution of the requested content, reduce or cap the frame rate, throttle the data transmitted to the client device, and so forth. - At
block 506, responsive to the client device trust status indicating that the client device is authorized to receive the requested content, the processing logic provides playback of the content to the client device. For example, the processing logic can provide the video data associated with the resource locator. In some embodiments,method 500 can be used to determine client device trust status based on a trust package, as discussed inFIG. 3 . -
