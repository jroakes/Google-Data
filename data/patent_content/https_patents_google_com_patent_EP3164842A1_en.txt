Definitions
- This specification relates to online content presentation and, more particularly, to a system and method for suggesting creative types of online content items to online content providers.
- a computer-implemented method for generating creative type suggestions for an online content provider uses a computing device including a processor and a memory.
- the method includes training a first model with historical information including one or more of (i) serving performance of online advertisements and (ii) advertiser information.
- the method also includes computing a preliminary creative type suggestion using at least the first model.
- the method further includes modifyingthe preliminary creative type suggestion based at least in part on past suggestion performance to generate a final creative type suggestion.
- the method also includes presenting the final creative type suggestion to the online content provider.
- a computer system in another aspect, includes an output device, at least one memory, and one or more processors.
- the one or more processors are configured to train a first model with historical information including one or more of (i) serving performance of online advertisements and (2) advertiser information.
- the one or more processors are also configured to compute a preliminary creative type suggestion for an online content provider using at least the first model.
- the one or more processors are further configured to modifythe preliminary creative type suggestion based at least in part on past suggestion performance to generate a final creative type suggestion.
- the one or more processors are also configured to present the final creative type suggestion to the online content provider.
- non-transitory computer-readable storage media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon are provided.
- the computer-executable instructions When executed by at least one processor, the computer-executable instructions cause the processor to train a first model with historical information including one or more of (i) serving performance of online advertisements and (ii) advertiser information.
- the computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to compute a preliminary creative type suggestion for an online content provider using at least the first model.
- the computer-executable instructions further cause the processor to modifythe preliminary creative type suggestion based at least in part on past suggestion performance to generate a final creative type suggestion.
- the computer-executable instructions also cause the processor to present the final creative type suggestion to the online content provider.
- FIGS. 1-5 show example embodiments of the methods and systems described herein.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram showing an example networked environment for suggesting creative types of online content items to content providers.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a computing device used for suggesting creative types to a user as shown in FIG. 1.
- FIG. 3 is a diagram of an example suggestion system for providing creative type suggestions to a content provider.
- FIG. 4 is an example method for suggesting creative types for online content items to an advertiser.
- FIG. 5 shows an example configuration of a database within a computing device, along with other related computing components, that may be used to suggest creative types for online content items to an advertiser.
- Embodiments of the methods and systems described herein enable suggestion of ad types ("creative types") for providers of online content (e.g., online advertisers).
- ad types e.g., online advertisers
- some advertisers may not be aware of certain creative types, and thus may avoid some types that may be advantageous or that may outperform the creative types for which they are comfortable.
- the term "creative type" refers to an underlying format of an ad that dictates how the ad is constructed and displayed to users, such as a static image, custom HTML, interstitial, or rich media.
- This creative type suggestion system analyzes historical data from other advertisers ("historical advertisers") and, more particularly, the performance of the creative types for past advertisements (i.e., past impressions) to prepare a suggestion list of creative types for a "current advertiser.”
- the system creates (a) advertiser profiles for a pool of historical advertisers, one profile for each advertiser, and (b) serving performance data of past advertising campaigns associated with the historical advertisers.
- the advertiser profiles are generated from a combination of (1) the advertiser's advertising history (e.g., the particular creative types used, spending amounts, cost types, and placements) and (2) the advertiser's site information (e.g., business vertical(s) of the advertiser and advertising assets).
- the historical serving performance data identifies how each creative performed for that particular advertiser.
- the profile data and the serving performance data are used to train a learning model (“creative type model”) that can generate creative type suggestions for a current advertiser.
- the suggestion system uses the creative type model to generate an ordered list of suggested creative types for the current advertiser.
- the system generates this list from three factors, a frequency of "used type" factor, a performance factor, and a predefined type factor.
- the system uses a profile of the current advertiser as input to the model to generate the frequency of used type factor and the performance factor tailored to the current advertiser. These two factors thereby incorporate how often past advertisers (of similar profile) used certain creative types, as well as how well those creative types performed.
- the third factor is a human-defined factor representing what analysts would suggest to the current advertiser. These three factors are weighted together to generate the ordered list of suggested creative types for the current advertiser.
- This list of suggested creative types is then modified based on the performance of past suggestions.
- the system builds and maintains (i.e., regularly re -trains) a "suggestions performance model" that analyzes how past advertisers acted given the system's suggestions.
- This suggestions performance model incorporates both the profile of the past advertisers, as well as the "save ratio" (i.e., whether the given suggested creative type was actually implemented by the past suggested-advertiser).
- the suggestion system uses the suggestions performance model (i.e., the performance of past suggestions) to modify the current list of suggested creative types before presentation to the target advertiser.
- the methods and systems described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effects may be achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) training a first model with historical information including one or more of serving performance of online advertisers and advertiser information; (b) computing a preliminary creative type suggestion using at least the first model; (c) modifyingthe preliminary creative type suggestion based at least in part on past suggestion performance to generate a final creative type suggestion; (d) presenting the final creative type suggestion to the online advertiser; (e) generating, using the model, one or more of a frequency of use factor and a performance factor associated with creative types; (f) weighting two or more of a frequency of use factor, a performance factor, and a pre-defined type suggestion to generate the preliminary creative type suggestion; (g) modifying the suggestion values; (h) training a second model with the past suggestion performance including one or more of creative type suggestion performance data and advertiser information, wherein modifying the preliminary creative type suggestion
- the advertiser may continue to leverage known creative types because they are unaware of the availability, suitability, or performance benefits of other creative types.
- This suggestion system assists advertisers in adopting creative types in their advertising campaigns by providing appropriate creative type suggestions.
- Overall technical effects of this suggestions system include one or more of providing suggestions that are likely to be adopted by advertisers, providing suggestions that provide enhanced performance with similar advertisers, and adapting suggestions based on past suggestion results.

- computing device 200 is configured to train models and generate creative type suggestions for content providers 102 (shown in FIG. 1). In some embodiments, computing device 200 is similar to suggestion system 118 (shown in FIG. 1). Content providers 102 interact with computing device 200 through, for example, a GUI provided by CMS 106 for configuring ad campaigns and associated ad creatives.
- FIG. 3 is a diagram of an example suggestion system 300 for providing creative type suggestions to a content provider 102.
- suggestion system 300 may be similar to CMS 106 and/or suggestions system 118 (both shown in FIG. 1), may be implemented on computing device 200 (shown in FIG. 2), and may be implemented in networked environment 100 (shown in FIG. 1).
- Suggestion system 300 may be described as performing two main functions: (a) model building and (b) type suggestion using those models.
- suggestion system 300 performs both functions. In other embodiments, these two functions may be performed by different systems.
- suggestion system 300 constructs, or "learns", one or more creative type models 320 from historical advertiser data 310.
- historical advertiser data 310 may be stored in a database such as historical advertiser data 146 (shown in FIG. 1).
- Historical advertiser data includes serving performance data 312, site data 314, and campaign data 316.
- Site data 314 includes information about an advertiser's web site (e.g., the landing page associated with the advertiser's ads).
- site data 314 includes a business vertical for the advertiser (e.g., one or more grouping designations, categories, and/or sub-categories). This business vertical may be used to associate similar advertisers (e.g., merchants of similar products, or products in similar areas of use).
- Site data 314 may also include ad assets of the advertiser, headline and description text, logo and product images, phone and location information, and video content.
- Campaign data 316 includes information about the advertiser's past advertising campaigns.
- campaign data 316 includes spending data from past campaigns, the type of attention the campaign ad(s) were directed to (the targeting criteria, e.g., impressions, click-through' s, conversions), placement information (e.g., what kind of web sites were the ads directed toward), and previously used assets.
- the previously used assets are the ads/creatives actually developed and/or used in past advertising campaigns, and include associated information such as the creative type of the asset.
- Campaign data 316 may also include cost types, placements, and demographic targeting information.
- Serving performance data 312 includes information about past impressions served. Generally speaking, serving data 312 represents the results of past ad campaigns, and thus represents how the past campaigns and/or individual ads of the campaigns performed. More specifically, serving performance data 312 includes serving data of the assets referenced by campaign data 316 and, as such, represents the actual serving results of each asset. In the example embodiment, serving performance data 312 includes one or more of number of impressions, number of clicks, conversion ratio (e.g., the number of conversions divided by the number of clicks), and click through ratio (e.g., the number of clicks divided by the number of impressions).
- conversion ratio e.g., the number of conversions divided by the number of clicks
- click through ratio e.g., the number of clicks divided by the number of impressions
- suggestion system 300 builds an advertiser profile 318 for a plurality of advertisers. More specifically, each advertiser profile 318 is generated from the site data 314 and campaign data 316 associated with the advertiser. Suggestion system 300 builds creative type model 320 using both serving performance data 312 and the plurality of advertiser profiles 318. Model 320, in the example embodiment, is a logistic regression model learned (built) using the advertiser profiles 318 and serving performance data 312 as input variables or features. For each creative type, a model 320 is built to answer the query that, for the given advertiser's profile, whether it is suitable to use this type or not. Each creative is considered as a case. Each attribute of advertiser's profile 318 is a predictor variable.
- models 320 are composed of sets of rules. If advertiser's profile 318 fits a rule, then that rule will influence whether the related creative type should be suggested to the advertiser or not.
- a present content provider 302 e.g., advertiser
- CMS 106 interacts with CMS 106 to configure a new creative (e.g., advertisement) for future presentation to users (e.g., users 150, 152, and 154, shown in FIG. 1).
- suggestion system 300 generates or otherwise identifies a profile 372 for the present content provider 302.
- suggestion system 300 prompts content provider 302 for profile 372 information.
- suggestion system 300 identifies profile 372 information from historical advertiser data 310, or identifies profile 372 from advertiser profiles 318 (e.g., if the current content provider 302 is already registered as a previous advertiser).
- present content provider profile 372 includes at least one or more features used to build model 320 such as, for example, a business vertical for a product or service associated with the new creative, site data for a landing page associated with the new creative, spending data associated with the new creative, a cost type desired for the new creative, or a placement desired for the new creative.
- Suggestion system 300 applies present content provider profile 372 to creative type model 320 to generate creative type suggestions for content provider 302 and/or the present creative. More specifically, a type suggestion engine 330 applies profile 372 to model 320 to generate both a frequently used type suggestion 332 and a performance type suggestion 334. Further, suggestion engine 330 also uses profile 372 to generate a predefined type suggestion 336.
- Frequently used type suggestion 332 is an output from model 320 that ranks creative types by frequency of use for historical advertisers similar to content provider 302 (i.e., similar to profile 372). For example, and only considering a single factor of business vertical for sake of simplicity, presume content provider 302 is a shoe manufacturer (an example business vertical).
- Type suggestion engine 330 generates an ordered list of creative types used by past advertisers similar to content provider 302 (e.g., past shoe manufacturers' advertisements).
- Predefined type suggestion 336 represents a human component for creative type suggestion.
- Analysts for example, provide suggestion system 300 with creative type suggestions for various groups of content providers 302.
- analysts provide creative type suggestions based on business verticals.
- suggestion system 300 may include an ordered list of creative type suggestions for shoe manufacturers. This list may be generated based on years of personal experiences working with shoe manufacturers to create ads, or based on known limitations or preferences of that particular industry.
- predefined type suggestion 336 includes a set of weighted rules.
- the conditions are the subset of attributes of the advertiser's profile, and the outcome is a certain creative type (e.g., the condition is advertiser's destination URL is a mobile app download page, and the outcome is click- to-do wnload creative type).
- the weight of predefined type suggestion 336 can be set, for example, to MAX so that it has higher priority than suggestions 332 and 334.
- suggestions 332, 334, and 336 may include ordered lists of creative types. In other embodiments, suggestions 332, 334, and 336 may include individual values for each of a plurality of creative types representing a degree of the creative type for the given suggestion (e.g., a value for frequency of use for a particular creative type, or a value for the performance of a particular creative type).
- type suggestion engine 330 weights each of suggestions 332, 334, and 336 together to generate a preliminary creative type suggestion 340.
- each type suggestion engine 330 generates an aggregated suggestion score for each creative type.
- each individual suggestion 332, 334, and 336 is weighted equally (e.g., one third each) to generate the aggregate suggestion scores.
- each suggestion 332, 334, and 336 has an individual weight that may differ from the others and, as such, allow some to be more or less influential in generating aggregate suggestion scores.
- each model calculates the average weight for each creative type. The results are combined for the models by adding them together.
- Output of suggestion 336 (averaged) may be: [click-to-download: 1.0].
- click-to-download creative type represents the highest suggested type at this stage.
- Preliminary creative type suggestion 340 is an ordered list of creative types.
- type suggestion engine 330 may have determined that Creative Type #1 has the highest aggregate suggestion score based on the weighting of suggestions 332, 334, and 336, and Creative Type #2 has the second highest, and so on. As such, type suggestion engine 330 generates an ordered list of preliminary creative type suggestions 340.
- preliminary creative type suggestion 340 may be a subset of creative types (e.g., only the top 3 suggested creative types), or just the single most suggested creative type (e.g., the highest aggregate suggestion score).
- a creative readiness evaluator 350 performs additional post-processing analysis of the preliminary creative type suggestions 340. More specifically, suggestion system 300 analyzes and, in some embodiments, modifies preliminary creative type suggestions 340 based on the performance of past suggestions to generate a final creative type suggestion 360 for presentation to content provider 302.
- suggestion system 300 tracks these decisions as performance results 362.
- a successful suggestion (e.g., one that is adopted by the content provider) is referred to herein as a "save.”
- the term “save percentage” refers to a historical number of successful suggestions verses the number of total suggestions, which is one example of performance results 362.
- Suggestion system 300 uses these performance results 362 along with advertiser profiles 318 to build a suggestion results model 370.
- suggestion results model 370 is used to evaluate how well past suggestions (e.g., past final creative type suggestions 360) have been adopted. For example, if a particular creative type has been suggested in the past but has a very low adoption rate (e.g., a very low save percentage when suggesting that creative type), then that particular creative type may be a poor suggestion.
- suggestion system 300 modifies preliminary creative type suggestion 340 based on past suggestions (e.g., based on suggestion system performance results 362). More specifically, in the example embodiment, the inputs to suggestion results model 370 include the present content provider profile 372 (including assets set), the creative type suggestion 340, and the assets requested by the type, and the outputs are a modified suggestions list.
- the output of type suggestion engine 330 e.g., a preliminary creative type suggestion list 340
- creative readiness evaluator 350 modifies preliminary creative type suggestions 340 according to the output of suggestion results model 370 and generates final creative type suggestion 360 for presentation to content provider 302.
- the actions taken by content provider 302 in relation to final creative type suggestion 360 e.g., performance results 362 are tracked by suggestion system 300.
- these performance results 362 are incorporated into suggestion results model 370 on a periodic basis (e.g., weekly or monthly) to update suggestion results model 370 with recent results.
