Embodiment
The detailed description being described below is intended to the description as the various configurations to subject technology, without being intended to mean that the master
Topic technology is only capable of implementing in these configurations kind.Accompanying drawing is simultaneously herein incorporated and forms a part for the detailed description.The detailed description
Including in order to provide the detail to the thorough explanation of the subject technology.However, the subject technology is not limited to be explained herein
The detail stated and it can implement in the case of these no details.In some instances, in order to avoid obscuring
The concept of the subject technology, show in block form structure and component.
Some wed websites cause visitor's (for example, different user) can in response to different web contents (for example, video,
Article etc.) and comment is provided.Such comment can be public and can be checked by the user for accessing wed websites.Therefore, by
The comment that user provides can be checked by the other users for accessing the wed websites.However, in some instances, check web content
User may wish to (for example, the public comment made in response to other users) offer and be confined to specify in the range of groups of users
Comment.The other users that user in this example is not intended to outside limited to scope check these comments.
In with top view, the subject technology provides for holding place by web site in one implementation
(host) web content on webpage provides the widget (widget) for being confined to the comment of one group of user.According to an implementation
Example, " widget " is computer implemented module, and the module, which is adapted to be, to be entered with web service and with social networking service
Row communication is to receive the input from user, processing by inputting or being communicated with service the information that receives and will be through
The presentation of information of processing is to user." widget " is not necessarily a part for webpage, but can also be the web browser of user
Plug-in unit or extension etc..In some instances, webpage can provide one or more public comments.Public comment can be by net
The local form that page provides.However, webpage can not be in the social graph of locally-supported user and the user other users and one
Interaction (for example, session) between individual or multiple public comments.Therefore, widget enables content supplier or user with not
The form for destroying the existing implementation and manifestation mode of web content provides the comment for being confined to one group of user, and the web content is
Commented on through providing the one or more of the visitor from web site.In the manner, widget is allowed users in nothing
Offer is confined to other in the social graph of the user in the web content interacted of the locally-supported social graph with user of method
The session of user.Plug-in unit that widget can be disposed of in the web browser of user or extension or collected by content supplier
Into in webpage.Other implementations can be provided and still in the range of subject technology.Above-mentioned (for example,
From the social graph of user) one group of user include in some implementations unique user, groups of users, group set,
Or tissue.
To put up the comment that (post) is confined to one group of user, different options can be presented with should in widget to user
Comment is confined to the people of some group.For example, widget can provide selection by give define one of social networking service or
Multiple groups (for example, social circle), the given one or more of the social networking service organizing user in the social circle
Contact person.Social circle is represented based on reliability rating and relationship type etc. to one or more of social graph from user
Contact person divides group.Alternately, widget allows user to provide manually to be approved to check the comment that is confined to this group of user
The group of user.In one example, the subject technology will be limited to one group of user comment it is associated with accesses control list,
The accesses control list is defined based on selected groups of users checks the scope for being confined to the comment of one group of user.The access control
List management processed is confined to the authority of the comment of one group of user, and (wherein, authority definition can be commented being confined to one group of user
By the set of execution), including define the scope checked and be confined to the comment of one group of user.
In one example, the comment of one group of user is confined to by with incompatible with the public content provided in webpage
Form provides.More specifically, the public content in webpage does not provide the contact person to the user in the social graph of user
Access.For example, webpage is only possible to provide public comment between the user for being registered to the web site for holding the place webpage, and
Such public comment is not limited to be checked by the visitor of the webpage.In order to allow the contact person to the user in social graph
Access, by it is compatible from the social graph of user (with public comment) it is different in the form of to provide be confined to commenting for one group of user
By to allow the access of the contact person in the social graph to user.Therefore, subject technology is understood as providing user's
The introducing of social graph, to enable to can not locally allow the given of the access to the contact person in the social graph of user
The comment of webpage.Introducing in this context means the function that the social graph based on user is used according to one embodiment
Comment function to webpage is strengthened, and user will be merged in provide and comment with the information just as the social graph from user whereby
By in the webpage of function (for example, just as the social graph of user is by as the local function and information provided by web service
A seamless part) mode perceive reinforcement.In one embodiment, this can be realized by widget, and the widget is added
It is added to the first webpage (local page) and signal corps can be carried out with social networking service and therefrom receive service, so as in local
" realization " or " display " comments on function on webpage.In addition, contact person's in the social graph from user and/or user is any
Comment on and other viewers of the webpage are hidden, to ensure confidentiality of the comment to unintended viewer.
When another user checks the web content on webpage, subject technology (for example, widget) is according to accesses control list
Searching request is performed, to determine that the one or more that can be used for checking is confined to the comment of one group of user.For example, subject technology is held
Row is checked to judge that this checks whether user is included in and is confined to one group of user to the searching request of the available comment of web content
Comment corresponding accesses control list in.In one example, each comment can control list phase with (one or more)
Association.The comment for being confined to one group of user that can be used for checking based on accesses control list will be by with different visual detectors
The widget of (for example, chart, diagram etc.) is presented, to be distinguish between to one or more public comments.In addition, subject technology
Can (for example, based on one or more different criterions) perform different filtering techniques, be different from provided in webpage one or
Show and/or organize to multiple public comments to be confined to the comment of one group of user.
In addition, in some implementations, when user replys the existing comment for being confined to one group of user, the reply of addition
Top layer comment can be adopted as heir (for example, directly or indirectly being returned in the existing session of one group of user or a series of comments is confined to
The multiple initial comment for being confined to one group of user) accesses control list scope.In one example, this is implemented as to top
Layer comment " annotation " (for example, data structure, data field etc.), wherein reply be merely able to top layer comment on together can not be single
Solely checked.It is alternative or in combination, to be confined to one group of user comment reply by comprising the access control commented on top layer
The reference of list processed.In this way, reply and be provided in the annotation of its own, and arranged with top layer comment share and access control
Table.So, there is provided two parts of accesses control lists：Portion is in top layer comment, and portion is in reply.If however, top
Accesses control list in layer comment changes, and (one or more), which changes, will be delivered to reply.In some implementations,
User can lock the scope of comment.For example, the user for replying top layer comment may want to disable the model of the reply comment of user
The change enclosed.Therefore, if the scope of top layer comment changes (for example, from one group of user is confined to as public),
The scope then changed will not be applied to the reply of user, and the limited scope of opinion is judged in the reply for therefore remaining user.
In addition, in some implementations, the scope of top layer comment can be locked to disable the change of scope.
Fig. 1 conceptually illustrates graphic user interface (GUI) 100, and some that can realize subject technology wherein are matched somebody with somebody
Put.Shown in example as shown in Figure 1, the comment for being confined to one group of user is in response to be provided in the comment that the public can check
In the webpage provided by online social networking service.More specifically, GUI 100 can include being used to provide one or more

It is that people can be contact person in the social graph of user, e-mail contacts, the different user etc. of webpage.GUI 100 is also
Including the viewing area 110,120,130 and 140 corresponding with various comments.Such as, it is illustrated that 170 with viewing area 110 shown in
Public comment is associated.In some configurations kind, the whole of the webpage of the public comment to being provided by online social networking service is looked into
The person of seeing sees.In another example, public comment can be provided at by web site hold place online forum in, or with by
Article, video or other web contents that the web site provides are associated.
GUI 100 enables one or more users to submit the comment for being confined to one group of user in response to public comment.
As further shown, GUI 100 shows associated with the comment for being confined to one group of user shown in viewing area 172
Diagram 172.Create the user (for example, " edition owner ") for the initial comment for being confined to one group of user and can distribute and check and be confined to one group
The initial comment of user and the scope then commented on.The scope can include one or more other users, one or more
Individual other users include the group of the one or more users defined by online social networking service (for example, social circle).
In one example, the user as edition owner can change be confined to one group of user comment (for example, be confined to one group of user just
Begin comment and one or more reply) scope, can check the comment for being confined to one group of user to expand or further limit
User number.

Some configurations are by calling the program generation interacted by one or more interfaces with other called program codes
Code is implemented as software process, and these software process include one or more of environment API (API).It can wrap
The various functions for including the parameter of various species are called, message or other kinds of calling can via API caller and by
Switch between the code of calling.In addition, API can be provided using defined in API or in calling to caller code
The data type or classification realized in program code.
In some configurations, one or more API can be used.API is by program code components or nextport hardware component NextPort (" API
Realize component ") interface realized, it allows distinct program code components or nextport hardware component NextPort (" API Calls component ") to access and make
With one or more functions, method, program, data structure, class and/or by API realize component provide other service.
API allows developer (can be third party developer) use of API Calls component to realize that component provides by API
Dedicated functions.There can be an API Calls component or there can be component as more than one.API can be by calculating
System or program library are provided to support the source code interface from application request service.Operating system (OS) can have multiple API to permit
Perhaps one or more of application call these API run on the OS, and service (such as program library) can have it is multiple
API is to allow using one or more of the application call of the service these API.API can specify according to programming language, when
It can be explained or be compiled using programming language when being fabricated.
In some configurations, API realizes that component can provide the API of more than one, each providing not in these API
With the different views of aspect, these different aspects access the different aspect for the function that component realization is realized by API.For example, API
First group of function can be provided and can be presented to third party developer by realizing an API of component, and API realizes component
Another API can be hiding (not showing), and provide the subset of first group of function, while also provide another group of function,
Such as the test not included in first group of function and debugging routine.In other configurations, API realizes that component in itself can be via
Basic API calls one or more other assemblies, therefore is both API Calls component and API realizes component.
The API definition language that API Calls components uses when accessing and the specific features of component being realized using API and ginseng
Number.For example, API Calls component is one or more by (for example, being realized by function or method call) shown by API
API Calls call the specific features that component is realized with access API together, and via API Calls or call together with using these parameters transmission number
According to and control information.API realizes that component can pass through API return values in response to the API Calls from API Calls component.Although
The semanteme and result (for example, how to initiate API Calls and what API Calls do) of API definition API Calls, but API can not
Disclose the function how API Calls are completed to be specified by API Calls.Various API Calls are via calling (API Calls component) and API
Realize one or more API transmission between component.Transmit API Calls can include issue, initialization, initiate,
Call, receive, return or funcall and message are responded.In other words, transmission can describe API Calls component and API
Realize the action of component.API funcall or other call together with can send or receive one by parameter list or other structures
Individual or multiple parameters.Parameter can be constant, key, data structure, object, object class, variable, data type, pointer, array,
List or to function or method pointer or quote the data or other another way that will be transmitted via API.
In addition, data type or class can be provided by API and realize that component is realized by API.Therefore, API Calls component energy
Variable is enough declared and using pointer with the constant value of type or class as using or instantiating by the definition provided in API.
Generally, API can be used in accessing service or the data for realizing component offer by API, or for initializing by API
The operation of component offer or the performance of calculating are provided.By way of example, API realizes that component and API Calls component each may be used
Be in operating system, storehouse, device drives, API, application program or other modules one kind (it should be understood that API realize
Component and API Calls component can be the module of identical or different type each other).In some cases, API realizes that component can
Firmware, microcode or other hardware logics are presented as at least in part.In some configurations, API can allow client-side program
The service provided by software development kit (SDK) storehouse is provided.In some configurations, using or other client-side program can use
The API provided by application framework.In such arrangements, application or client-side program can be included to being provided by SDK and by API
The function of offer and the calling of method, or use data type and object defined in SDK and by API offers.At these
In configuration, application framework corresponding with the various events defined by framework can provide main event circulation for program.API allows
Event and response to event are specified using application framework.In some implementations, API Calls can be to application report
The ability and state of hardware device, including with such as input capability and state, fan-out capability and state, disposal ability, power shape
Related those of the aspect of state, storage capacity and state, communication capacity etc., and API can partly by firmware, microcode or
The low logical level run on a hardware component to other parts is realized.
API Calls component can be (for example, realizing component in same data handling system with API) local component or
(for example, realizing component in different pieces of information processing system with API) realizes that component is led to via network by API with API
The remote component of letter.It should be understood that API realizes that component can also be used as API Calls component (for example, can make API Calls
API that component shows is realized by different API), and API Calls component can also be presented to different API Calls components by realizing
API and realize component as API.
Multiple API Calls components that API can allow for being write with different programming languages realize that component is communicated with API
(therefore, API can include realizing the calling between component and API Calls component and the function of return for changing API).So
And API can rely on special program language to be realized.In one configuration, API Calls component can be called from different providers
API, such as, one group of API from OS providers and another group of API from plug-in unit provider and from another provider
Another group of API of (such as provider of software library) or another group of API founder.

In.As shown in Figure 7, API architecture 700 includes realizing that API 710 API realizes component 715 (for example, operating system, storehouse, setting
Standby driving, API, application program, software or other modules).API 710 specify one that API Calls component 705 can use or
Multiple functions, method, class, object, agreement, data structure, form and/or API realize other features of component.In an example
In, API 710 is able to access that the social graph of user (for example, to provide the other users in the social graph of user and user
Between interaction).API710 can specify at least one calling convention, and the calling convention specifies API to realize the function in component
How to receive parameter from API Calls component and how the function returns result to API Calls component.API Calls component 705
(for example, operating system, storehouse, device drives, API, application program, software or other modules) make API Calls by API 710
To access and using by API 710 is specifying, API realizes component 715 feature.API realizes that component 715 can be in response to API
Call and return to API Calls component 705 by the way that API 710 is near.
It will be appreciated that API realizes that component 715 can include not defining by API 710 and API Calls component
The 705 other functions that can not be accessed, method, class, data structure and/or other features.It should be understood that API Calls group
Part 705 can realize component 715 on same system with API, or can remotely be placed and by Web vector graphic API
710 access API realize component 715.Although Fig. 7 shows the single API Calls component 705 interacted with API 710, should
Understand, other API Calls components that can be write with the language (or same language) different from API Calls component 705
API 710 can be used.
API realizes that component 715, API 710 and API Calls component 705 can be stored in machine readable media, the machine
Device computer-readable recording medium includes the machine for being used for the storage information in the form of machine (for example, computer or other data handling systems) is readable
