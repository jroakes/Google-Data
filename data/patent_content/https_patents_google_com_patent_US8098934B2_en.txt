- FIG. 8B shows the results of a character recognition operation for the candidate text regions of FIG. 7A .
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example text recognition system 200 .
- the text recognition system 200 includes an image component 202 , an image preprocessing module 204 , a text detection component 206 , a text box enhancement component 208 , and character recognition component 210 .
- Image component 202 collects, stores, or otherwise manages one or more images for text recognition.
- Image component 202 can include one or more image databases or can retrieve images from a data store such as one or more remote image databases.
- the image component 202 can receive images for text recognition in realtime from a remote location, for example, as part of an image or video feed.
- the process of collecting and storing images can be automated or user driven.
- the images can be retrieved, for example, as a result of a user input selecting one or more images for use in the text recognition process.
- Image preprocessing component 204 provides an optional level of initial processing for the images provided by the image component 202 .
- the image preprocessing enhances the images prior to text detection by the text detection component 206 .
- the image preprocessing component 204 first analyzes each image to determine whether or not preprocessing of the image is necessary. Alternatively, every image is automatically preprocessed by the image preprocessing component 204 .
- Preprocessing is performed on an image, for example, when the image includes regions of low contrast.
- Photographic images for example, are subject to environmental conditions affecting image contrast such as changes in lighting conditions or shadows generated by physical objects. For example, a tree in the foreground of an image can cast a shadow over a portion of text, reducing contrast between the text and the surrounding features in the image.
- preprocessing is performed to correct image quality problems, for example, the presence of compression artefacts.
- Text detection component 206 detects candidate regions of an image that contains text or is likely to contain text. The text in the candidate text regions are then identified by character recognition component 210 .
- the text identifier component 206 includes a classifier 207 configured to detect the presence of text within an image. The classifier is trained to detect candidate text regions using feature detection. The candidate text regions detected by the text detection component 206 are further processed by the text box enhancement component 208 .
- Text box enhancement component 208 enhances the candidate text regions of the image detected by the text detection component 206 .
- the candidate text regions are enhanced to increase the accuracy of text identification by the character recognition component 210 .
- the candidate text regions are enhanced by performing a superresolution operation to generate a single superresolution image from a number of separate images. The superresolution process is described below.
- an inverse (or negative) version of each candidate text region is generated.
- the inverse version changes, for example, white text into black text in order to improve text identification using a character recognition application calibrated for recognizing dark text on a light background.
- Character recognition component 210 analyzes the enhanced candidate text box regions to identify and extract text.
- the character recognition component 210 applies a character recognition program (e.g., an optical character recognition (“OCR”) program) to identify alphanumeric characters within the text box regions and to extract the identified characters.
- Identified characters can be further processed, for example, to eliminate nonsense results generated by the character recognition program in an attempt to identify text from non-text features in a candidate text region.
- OCR optical character recognition
- FIG. 3 shows an example process 300 for recognizing text in an image.
- Process 300 can be initiated, for example, by a user or can be a component of an automated system for processing images.
- the first step in the text recognition process 300 is to receive one or more images (e.g., from the image component 202 ) (step 302 ).
- the images can be received from numerous sources including local storage on a single computer or multiple computing devices distributed across a network.
- the images can be retrieved from one or more, local or remote, image databases or can be collected in realtime for processing.
- the received images may have been captured, for example, using conventional digital cameras or video recording devices.
- the resulting captured images can include panoramic images, still images, or frames of digital video.
- the captured images can also be associated with three-dimensional ranging data as well as location information, which can be used in processing the images.
- An example image type is a panoramic image of a street scene.
- a single panoramic image can capture multiple street addresses (e.g., one city block, or a string of contiguous address locations on a street). Such panoramic pictures are taken, for example, using a panoramic camera or a regular camera equipped with a panoramic lens.
- a pushbroom panoramic image can be generated for a street scene by merging a sequence of discrete images collected, for example, from a moving camera.
- Location data can be associated with each image.
- the GPS coordinates at every point along a given panoramic image can be known or accurately calculated using an appropriate technique. For example, for a panoramic picture corresponding to a block from “100” to “200” on a given street, where the GPS location at either end of the block is known (e.g., based on GPS receiver data taken at the time of image capture), then the GPS coordinates can be calculated at every intermediate point using linear interpolation. Consequently, GPS coordinates can be determined for each corresponding location in the panoramic image.
- a set of GPS coordinates are known for each image, corresponding to the exact location where each image was captured. For example, if each image corresponds to one particular street address, then given a series of such image/GPS data pairs, exact GPS coordinates are known for each corresponding address location on that street.
- exact GPS coordinates of every image or vertical line in an image can be determined.
- a differential GPS antenna on a moving vehicle can be employed, along with wheel speed sensors, inertial measurement unit, and other sensors, which together allow a very accurate GPS coordinate to be computed for each image or portions of the image.
- the received images may need preprocessed in order to increase the probability of detecting text within the images.
- text in an image from a street scene can be located within a shadow (e.g., cast by a tree).
- the shadow results in a region of low contrast between the text and the surrounding image features.
- the low contrast increases the difficulty in distinguishing the text from background features surrounding the text.
- the image source can be considered. For example, images taken of a city street may have a higher need for preprocessing then other images taken, for example, within a store where environmental (e.g., lighting) conditions are more controlled. Similarly, high resolution images are less in need of preprocessing as compared to low resolution images.
- the source of the images can be used to determine the particular type of preprocessing to perform on an image. For example, an image encoded in a format having fewer artefacts (e.g., compression artefacts) may require less preprocessing.
- all images are automatically preprocessed (or not preprocessed at all) without the determination step 304 , for example, to expedite processing or because of known information regarding a particular set of images.
- Each designated image is preprocessed (e.g., using image preprocessing component 204 ) (step 306 ).
- a normalization process is performed on each image. Normalization of the image is performed to enhance the contrast in the image, in particular between the text and background in low-contrast regions of the image.
- One example normalization process is adaptive gray value normalization. In adaptive gray value normalization, a mean and variance for each pixel in the image is computed. The pixel values are mapped to new pixel values according to a predetermined mean and standard deviation value. A minimum standard deviation value can be selected to prevent contrast over enhancement in areas of the image having a low variance.
- FIG. 4A shows an example image 400 prior to normalization.
- the image 400 includes text 402 .
- the text 402 is located in a region of low contrast between the text 402 and the region surrounding the text 402 .
- FIG. 4B shows a normalized image 404 .
- the normalized image 404 represents the image 400 following the normalization process.
- the text 402 in the normalized image 404 has a greater contrast such that the text 402 is more easily discernable from the surrounding image.
- a high dynamic range process is performed (instead of, or in addition to, normalization) to preprocess the images.
- Multiple exposures of an image are used in the high dynamic range processes to create a high dynamic range image. For example, three exposures ranging from bright to medium to dark exposure can be captured by a camera. To create the high dynamic range image, the three exposures are composited to create a single image.
- the high dynamic range process also provides an image with enhanced contrast, including text regions, which increases the ability to distinguish the text from the surrounding background features.
- the images can also be processed to correct for various image distortions.
- the images can be processed to correct for perspective distortion. Text positioned on a plane that is not perpendicular to the camera is subject to perspective distortion, which can make text identification more difficult.
- Conventional perspective distortion correction techniques can be applied to the images during preprocessing.
- the images are processed for text detection (e.g., using text detection component 206 ) (step 308 ).
- text detection processing candidate text regions of the image are detected as possibly containing text.
- a classifier is used to detect the candidate text regions.
- An existing or new classifier is trained to identify features in an image that indicate, within some degree of confidence, the presence of text.
- a set of sample text and non-text patterns is used to train the classifier.
- the classifier is trained to distinguish between text and non-text image features based on the set of sample patterns. To increase the accuracy of the classifier, the set of sample patterns used to train the classifier corresponds to images similar to those to be examined.
- sample patterns derived from images of city street scenes are used when the classifier is being trained to identify candidate text regions in images showing city streets.
- Different training sets of text and non-text patters can be used when training the classifier to detect text in different types of images. For example, when using a classifier to detect text in images of consumer items located within a store, detect images cataloging museum object, or to detect text in another type of image collection (including personal image collections), different training sets of patterns are used so that the classifier is calibrated to identify text present in that type of image.
- the classifier distinguishes between text and non-text in images by analyzing features or combinations of features within the image. A number of different features types can be examined by the classifier for detecting text in the image. Typically, the image is divided into a number of smaller image sub-regions (e.g., squares of 16 ⁇ 16 pixels, rectangles of 40 ⁇ 20 pixels, disks having a 10 pixel radius, etc.), which are then individually processed for feature analysis.
- the sub-regions can overlap (e.g., by 5 pixels) to increase accuracy of the text detection. For example, two neighboring sub-regions can have 40% of pixels in common.
- Extracted features characterize different properties of the image such as line segment properties (e.g., the shape or orientation of line segments) as well as other features such as color or gradients.
- Table 1 shows a list of feature types which are used by the classifier in one implementation. The classifier is not limited to the features described below, which are illustrative. The results from analyzing one or more features in a particular image sub-region provide an indication as to whether or not the examined image sub-region contains text.
- Type 0 The horizontal derivative and its mean in a local, box-shaped surrounding are used as a feature.
- Type 1 The vertical derivative and its mean in a local, box-shaped surrounding are used as a feature.
- Type 2 The horizontal derivative and its variance in a local, box-shaped surrounding are used as a feature.
- Type 3 The vertical derivative and its variance in a local, box-shaped surrounding are used as a feature.
- Type 4 A joint 2-dimensional histogram over a box-shaped surrounding where dimension one is image intensity and dimension two is the gradient strength.
- Type 5 The distribution of canny edgels (edge elements found using a Canny edge detector) over four orientations in a local, box-shaped surrounding.
- Type 6 A 1-dimensional histogram of the gradient strength.
- Type 7 Corners A measure for strength of corners in a local box-shaped surrounding is used as a feature. Therefore, the minimum eigenvalue image computed by a corner detector (e.g., a Harris Corner operator or Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi operator, which detects corners using a local structure matrix) is used, and its local mean is computed as a feature.
- a corner detector e.g., a Harris Corner operator or Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi operator, which detects corners using a local structure matrix
- Type 8 The vertical and horizontal projection profiles in a box-shaped surrounding are used as a feature. Extract their variance (or the mean of their derivative).
- the classifier is run for each image sub-region and according to the feature analysis a text/no text determination is made for each image sub-region. Adjacent image sub-regions with detected text are combined to form candidate text regions for the image.
- the classifier is calibrated to identify features corresponding to text within a particular text size range. If the classifier is trained to detect text of a particular size, the input image is scaled across a range of steps. The classifier performs text detection at each scaled step searching for text at the trained height. Consequently, a set of scaled images are created for each image (i.e., a pyramid of scaled images) such that the classifier is run multiple times for each image in order to detect differently sized text.
- the results for adjacent scale steps can be used to eliminate false positive candidate text regions.
- the amount of scaling for each step is chosen so that the same candidate text region is detected at more than one step level in the image set (i.e., a stable text region).
- the scale step is selected such that the classifier is capable of detecting text at adjacent scale steps. If text is not identified at adjacent scale step, the detection at only one step size is likely a false positive result. Consequently, false positives in the text detection can be reduced by requiring a candidate text region to appear in at least two adjacent scale steps.
- a minimum size requirement is applied to detected candidate text regions (e.g., the collection of adjacent image regions where the classifier detected text).
- the minimum size requirement allows for small candidate text regions providing false positive results to the text detector to be eliminated. However, if the minimum size requirement is set too large some valid text will not be detected (false negative results).
- FIG. 5A shows one example of detected candidate text regions for an image 500 where the classifier has a first minimum size requirement for detected candidate text regions.
- Image 500 shows a street scene including a building entrance. Within image 500 are a number of detected candidate text regions 502 and 504 . The detected candidate text regions represent areas of the image that the classifier determined as potentially having text. As shown in FIG. 5A , the image 500 includes candidate text region 502 , which includes the building number “155” above the door of the building. Image 500 also includes candidate text regions 504 representing false positive region's identified as having text.
- the number of false positive candidate text regions can be reduced by increasing the minimum size requirement for candidate text regions detected by the classifier. However, increasing the minimum size can also lead to failure in detecting text (i.e., an increased probability of false negatives).
- FIG. 5B shows an example of the detected candidate text regions for the same image 500 when a larger minimum size requirement is used for detecting candidate text regions. In image 500 , fewer candidate text regions 506 have been detected by the classifier. However, the building number “155” is smaller than the minimum candidate text region size and therefore has not been detected. Thus, a particular minimum size requirement for candidate text regions should be selected to minimize false negative results without excessive false positives.
- three-dimensional range data associated with an image is used to eliminate false positive candidate text regions.
- range sensors can be used to gather three-dimensional range data for each captured image.
- the range data can be provided by range sensors such as laser range sensors (e.g., laser detection and ranging (“LIDAR”) devices) or stereo-based sensors (i.e., stereoscopic imaging devices) located in proximity to the image capturing device.
- LIDAR laser detection and ranging
- stereo-based sensors i.e., stereoscopic imaging devices located in proximity to the image capturing device.
- the three-dimensional range data provides information regarding the distance from the camera position to points in the image. For example, the distance from the camera to a building door or the distance to a foreground object such as a tree or signpost.
- planar regions include, for example, building facades where text is often located.
- the planar map is then compared with the candidate text regions detected by the classifier. Because text lies substantially in a single plane, candidate text regions that are not planar can be eliminated as non-text. Consequently, non-planar candidate text regions are eliminated from further processing, reducing the number of false positive text results. Furthermore, by constraining candidate text regions to planar regions, for example, to planar regions perpendicular to a camera position, other constraints can be relaxed such as the minimum size requirement for candidate text regions.
- the three-dimensional range data is used to focus the candidate text regions to particular types of text of interest.
- particular types of text in the image can be targeted such as building names or street signs.
- the distance provided by the three-dimensional range data can be used to indicate different types of image data such that distance based text detection criteria can be defined. If the camera and rang sensing equipment maintains substantially a same distance from the building facades as it traverses a path down a street, then the three-dimensional range information can be used to locate candidate text regions of satisfying particular distance based criteria.
- building identifiers e.g., name, address number
- the candidate text regions outside of a predetermined range criteria are eliminated (e.g., removing foreground objects).
- a shorter range value is used to eliminate background candidate text regions.
- Output from the text detection process can be provided in several formats.
- the detected candidate text regions are outlined within the image, as shown in FIG. 5A . Highlighting or other visual cues can be used to distinguish the detected candidate text regions from the rest of the image. Additionally, the coordinates to each candidate text region can be recorded to identify the candidate text regions for subsequent processing as discussed below. Alternatively, a mask is generated for the image such that only the detected text candidates are visible for further processing.
- Image text can be small, blurred, have various distortions, or suffer from different artifacts, making character recognition difficult.
- operations are performed to enhance the detected candidate text regions to improve the identification and extraction of text within the candidate text regions (e.g., using the text box enhancement component 208 ) (step 310 ).
- image enhancement is provided by performing a superresolution process on each candidate text region within the image.
- the superresolution process uses multiple images of a scene.
- Each image includes a version of a candidate text region representing the same text from the scene (e.g., several images of a scene from slightly different perspectives).
- images are generated with slight variability due to the change in camera position.
- a high speed camera taking images as a machine e.g., a motorized vehicle
- the high speed camera can therefore capture a sequence of images slightly offset from each previous image according to the motion of the camera.
- the resolution of the candidate text region can be improved using the superresolution process.
- a candidate text region that is partially obstructed from one camera position may reveal the obstructed text from a different camera position (e.g., text partially obscured by a tree branch from one camera position may be clear from another).
- FIG. 6 is an example process 600 for generating a superresolution image that provides an enhanced candidate text region.
- a number of frames or consecutive images are extracted (step 602 ). The number of extracted images depends on the capture rate of the camera as well as the number of images. Typically, a greater number of images leads to a higher quality superresolution result.
- FIG. 7A shows a set of similar images extracted for superresolution. Specifically, FIG. 7A shows a collection 700 of slightly different images 702 , 704 , 706 , 708 , and 710 , each image including the same street sign for the street “LYTTON”.
- the candidate text regions are scaled up, or supersampled, to a high resolution image (step 606 ).
- the high resolution scaling is performed using bicubic splines; however, other scaling techniques can be used.
- FIG. 7B shows a scaled up version 712 of the text.
- FIG. 7C shows the supersampled text aligned to a high-resolution grid 714 .
- the scaled up text from each image is aligned to the high-resolution grid such that the pixels of each image match (step 610 ).
- block matching e.g., hierarchical block matching
- an interpolation process can be performed in order to fill in any remaining grid pixels.
- the resulting aligned pixels are then combined to produce the superresolution image (step 612 ).
- combining the pixels can include taking the median value of each pixel for each image in the grid and combining the pixel values to produce the resultant superresolution image.
- FIG. 7D shows a final superresolution image 716 , which provides an enhanced image version over the scaled image 712 shown in FIG. 7B .
- the images are corrected for perspective distortion.
- a text sign can be positioned at an angle relative to the camera, such that perspective distortion can interfere with the alignment of the images where the position of the camera has changed between images.
- Three-dimensional range data can also be used to align the images for performing the superresolution process.
- the three-dimensional range data can identify a planar region at a particular distance from the camera.
- a candidate text region can also be identified at the same location.
- Range and movement information can be used to determine the processing necessary to properly align the images. For example, if the motion is small and the range is large, the motion can be approximated to a simple translation. However, if the text is close or the motion is large, more complex processing can be necessary. Additionally, the number of images used for superresolution processing can be adjusted depending on the range of the text and the motion of the camera (e.g., use more images when the text is close or motion is great in order to compensate for the additional processing required).
- additional normalization or image enhancement processes are performed or images can be upscaled without the multiple images necessary for generating a superresolution image.
- a character recognition process is performed on the enhanced candidate text regions (e.g., using character recognition component 210 ) (step 312 ).
- the character recognition process is performed using an available character recognition application, for example, an optical character recognition (“OCR”) application.
- OCR optical character recognition
- a character recognition application is built specifically to identify text in images.
- the character recognition component is provided with two versions of each enhanced candidate text region.
- the first version is the enhanced candidate text region as generated above.
- the second version of the enhanced candidate text region is an inverted version. Since character recognition applications are typically designed to identify black text on a white background, providing an inverted version as well as the original version compensates for the use of white text in the candidate text regions (e.g., white lettering on a dark background).
- FIG. 8A shows an image 800 including detected candidate text regions 802 a - f .
- FIG. 8B shows corresponding character recognition results 804 for the candidate text regions 802 a - f .
- each of the detected candidate text region 802 a - f is shown with the superresolution result and the supersampled result.
- the text identified from each candidate text region by the character recognition process is displayed.
- candidate text region 802 a ( FIG. 8A ) is shown with a simplified example superresolution version 806 and scaled up version 808 ( FIG. 8B ).
- the two versions are provided as a comparison between the enhancement provided by the superresolution process and simply scaling the candidate text region.
- the superresolution version 812 is also shown for the candidate text region 802 e .
- Candidate text region 802 e is the candidate text region that includes the building number “115”.
- the character recognition program provided the correct result 814 from the superresolution version 812 .
- False text results are also identified, for example, the character recognition result 810 shows identified text from the candidate text region 802 a as “00000”.
- results can be filtered to remove nonsense results such as result 816 and non-word result 818 (“bifill”).
- the character recognition process is constrained according to values in a database.
- Database assisted character recognition is disclosed in commonly-owned co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/305,694 filed on Dec. 16, 2005, and entitled “Database Assisted OCR for Street Scenes,” which is hereby incorporated by reference.
- the character recognition is constrained by particular business names within a database. For instance, the character recognition process constrained to look for McDonalds, Fry's Electronics, H&R Block, and Pizza Hut, within the images.
- the character recognition process can alternatively be constrained, for example, by identifying the type of store or stores within a target address range known for the image, for example, based on a directory listing (e.g., “yellow pages” listing) for that address range (e.g., “bars and restaurants” or “flowers”).
- text related to a particular subject category can be obtained, for example, by accessing web sites of stores in that category and adjusting the language model used for character recognition, accordingly.
- the constrained character recognition search is carried out using a template matching technique. For instance, suppose that one of the candidate words being searched for in an image is “155” (i.e., the building address number). In this case, a number of bitmap renditions of “155” are generated at various scales and using various fonts. Then, image-based template matching techniques can be used to compare the candidate text region with these various renditions.
- a template matching technique For instance, suppose that one of the candidate words being searched for in an image is “155” (i.e., the building address number). In this case, a number of bitmap renditions of “155” are generated at various scales and using various fonts. Then, image-based template matching techniques can be used to compare the candidate text region with these various renditions.
- the character recognition is constrained by using a “digits only” lexicon or language pack. This limits the search to street numbers only (or other numeric patterns), but because of the constraint introduced, greater accuracy is achieved.
- the image can be binarized using, for example, the Niblack approach (e.g., Wayne Niblack, An Introduction to Image Processing, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1986, pp. 115-116, which is herein incorporated in its entirety by reference), and then running a commercial character recognition application (e.g., Abbyy FineReader with a digits-only lexicon). Other such image processing techniques can be used as well.
- the results of the text recognition can be indexed.
- the extracted image text is associated with the image, such that the image is identified and retrieved according to the indexed image text.
- Searching, mapping, or other applications can be used, for example, to provide particular images to a user according to the results of particular user searching criteria.
- the extracted text results from text recognition of images derived from street scenes is indexed and associated with a mapping application.
- a user of the mapping application can search for a location, for example, by business name, address, store hours, or other keywords.
- the mapping application can retrieve images matching the user's search. For example, a user enters a search for a McDonald's in a particular city or near a particular address. The mapping application generates a map to the McDonald's as well as presents an image of the McDonald's. The McDonald's image is retrieved using the indexed text from the image identifying the McDonald's and location information associated with the image, which identifies the location of the particular McDonald's in the image.
- the mapping application since the images are associated with location data, the mapping application also provides images of businesses located nearby a searched location, as well as identifying the locations of the businesses on a map. For example a user searching for a particular location or business is provided with search results as well as additional results associated with the location or business. Images of the destination location as well as the associated results are presented to the user. Other information retrieved from the particular images can optionally be presented to the user as well. For example, business hours extracted from the image can be shown.
- images of similar business as a searched for business can be presented to the user as alternatives.
- a search for a business of one type can result in images being presented of nearby businesses according to the indexed image text results, providing the user with additional options.
- advertisements are presented along with the presented image.
- an advertisement can be presented for the business identified in the image.
- one or more advertisements can be presented for alternative businesses.
- the advertisement can be for one or more products associated with the business in the presented image, user search terms, or according to other criteria.
- indexing can be applied to other image sets.
- a store e.g., a grocery store or hardware store
- Images of items within the store are captured, for example, using a small motorized vehicle or robot.
- the aisles of the store are traversed and images of products are captured in a similar manner as discussed above.
- location information is associated with each image.
- Text is extracted from the product images.
- extracted text can be filtered using a product name database in order to focus character recognition results on product names.
- An application for searching stores provides a user with location information for desired products. For example, a user inputs a search for a product, for example, by product name, category, or other search criteria. Matching results are presented to the user including location information for each matching product within the store. Consequently, the user can quickly navigate the store to locate and obtain the desired product. Additionally, in another implementation, a number of stores are indexed such that a user searching for a particular product can be provided with the nearest store carrying the desired product in addition to the product's location within the store.
- an image set associated with one or more museums is indexed.
- text associated with exhibits, artefacts, and other displays is often displayed. Images of museum items including the associated text displays are captured as discussed above with respect to indexing a store. As with the store example, location information is associated with each captured image. The text is extracted from the images. Consequently, an application for searching museums provides a user with location information for the various exhibits, artefacts, and other displays in the museum. The user can search for a particular object or use keywords to identify objects associated with an area of interest (e.g., impressionist painting, Greek statues). Alternatively, the user can browse a the museum to learn about the various objects.
- an area of interest e.g., impressionist painting, Greek statues
- Extracted image text can be stored for use an in image search application.
- Image search applications are used to retrieve and present images for users, for example, according to one or more search terms.
- Each image is associated with keyword search terms, for example, derived from an image caption, image metadata, text within a predefined proximity of the image, or manual input.
- image search application can include the text extracted from within the images to identify keywords associated with the image.
- the text-within the image itself can be used as a search parameter.
- a search can be initiated by a user providing one or more search terms to the search application.
- the search terms can be associated with one or more particular keywords. Images associated with the keywords are retrieved and presented to the user.
- a particular weighting is be applied to image text. For example, matches to image text can be given greater (or smaller) weight in the search results over text within a caption or otherwise associated with the image, which can be misleading.
- image text can be used to filter search results to eliminate particular images from a search result according to one or more predefined keywords (e.g., to reduce the retrieval of inappropriate images, spam filtering, etc.).
- One or more visual identifiers can be associated with the presented images. For example, the text within the images corresponding to the user's search can be highlighted or visually identified in some other manner (e.g., by underlining, etc.).
- the image is presented along with one or more advertisements.
- the advertisements can be selected based on the content of one or more search terms provided by the user.
