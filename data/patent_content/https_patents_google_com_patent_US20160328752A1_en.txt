Definitions
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources.
- a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction.
- content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content.
- a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- a method includes: identifying a repository of content, the repository including a plurality of content items, each indexed by a hashtag that is associated with a respective content item; receiving a search query from an entity associated with a brand, the query including one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand; retrieving content from the repository based on the search query; presenting the content to the entity and receiving a selection of one or more content items from the presented content for inclusion in a campaign; and creating a campaign including generating one or more creatives based on the selection for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign.
- a computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions.
- the instructions when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: identify a repository of content, the repository including a plurality of content items, each indexed by a hashtag that is associated with a respective content item; receive a search query from an entity associated with a brand, the query including one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand; retrieve content from the repository based on the search query; present the content to the entity and receiving a selection of one or more content items from the presented content for inclusion in a campaign; and create a campaign including generating one or more creatives based on the selection for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign.
- a system includes one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions.
- the instructions when executed, cause the one or more processors to: identify a repository of content, the repository including a plurality of content items, each indexed by a hashtag that is associated with a respective content item; receive a search query from an entity associated with a brand, the query including one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand; retrieve content from the repository based on the search query; present the content to the entity and receiving a selection of one or more content items from the presented content for inclusion in a campaign; and create a campaign including generating one or more creatives based on the selection for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign.
- Identifying the repository can include gathering content from plural, different content sources that are associated with hashtags and storing the content in the repository. Gathering the content can include gathering content from at least two different social networks. Gathering content can include gathering metadata related to an engagement metric associated with a specific content item and storing the metadata along with the content in the repository. The metadata can include one or more of a number of affinity designations, or number of publications or re-publications of the specific content item. Presenting can include presenting the metadata for each content item presented. Gathering content can include integrating a portion of an application that generates the creative in one or more networks or applications that are the source of the content.
- the search query can include only a hashtag and retrieving can include retrieving top ranked content from the repository that is associated with the hashtag.
- the search query can include a hashtag and a category and retrieving can include retrieving top ranked content from the repository that are associated with the hashtag and the category.
- the category can be a type of content item.
- Presenting the content can include presenting top ranked content from the repository based on one or more measures of popularity.
- Generating the one or more creatives can include generating one creative from the selection and content received from the entity.
- the content received from the entity can be an identification of a landing page to be associated with the creative.
- the content received can be textual content to include along with the selection in the creative.
- the selection can include two content items and generating the one or more creative can include generating two different creatives from the selection each including one of the two content items.
- the search query does not include a hashtag retrieving content from the repository based on the search query can include identifying one or more hashtags that are related to the search query and retrieving top ranked content from the repository that is associated with the one or more hashtags.
- An entity can use, for example in association with an advertising campaign, creative content generated by users who have an affinity towards the entity.
- Content for a campaign can be automatically created for an entity using far less input from the entity as compared to the entity creating content from scratch.
- Content that is presented in association with a campaign can be selected from a set of content items that are most popular among customers of the entity associated with the campaign.

- FIG. 4 illustrates an example content gallery user interface.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- Hashtags provide a ready means for grouping content, so as to enable ease of location of content that includes the tagged material.
- a repository of content including, for example a plurality of content items each grouped or indexed by a hashtag can be identified.
- a hashtag refers to a word or phrase that is prefixed with a non-alphabetic symbol (such as the # symbol).
- a hashtag can be used to index content, such as content that includes or is otherwise associated with the hashtag.
- a hashtag can be included in or with content used in one or a plurality of social networking environments.
- a search query including one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand can be received from an entity associated with a brand.
- Content that is grouped or otherwise associated with a hashtag derived from the contents of the query can be retrieved from the repository based on the search query and presented to the entity.
- a selection of one or more of the presented content items can be received and a campaign can be created for the entity, including the generating of one or more creatives based on the selected content for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server. For situations in which user-generated content (e.g., content associated with a hashtag) is used, such use may only be performed with content to which the user has given consent of such use:
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content to a user.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 , publishers 109 , a content management system 110 , a first social server system 111 , and a second social server system 112 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 , and publishers 109 .
- the content management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the content providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content providers are possible. While only two social servers systems are shown, more are possible.
- Each social server system as presented represents a social environment that may include plural servers for supporting interactions, content delivery and other services in association with a single social service.
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, tablet computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), televisions, set top boxes, personal digital assistants and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .

- the first social server system 111 and the second social server system 112 each provide a social presence for users in the environment 100 .
- the first social server system 111 and the second social server system 112 can be associated with their own respective social application (e.g., a social application 120 and a social application 122 ).
- the social application 120 and the social application 122 can allow a user of a user device 106 to share information in a respective social network.
- the social application 120 and the social application 122 can each be associated with a social networking website that users can use, for example, to identify friends and social groups (e.g., circles), send and receive email, post messages and multi-media (e.g. photos, video, audio), track social events, provide updates and so on.
- friends and social groups e.g., circles
- post messages e.g., posts, posts, posts and multi-media
- multi-media e.g. photos, video, audio
- track social events provide updates and so on.
- a user of a user device 106 can use the social application 120 or the social application 122 to post an update for the user in a social context, such update enabling content to be distributed to one or more other users in the social network.
- one or both of the first social server system 111 or the second social server 112 can, in response to the update, provide the update to one or more subscribers that the user has authorized to receive the update.
- subscribers may be subscribed to an activity stream associated with the user, and may be enabled to view the update in the user's activity, stream.
- An activity stream can be used to present recent updates posted by one or more users in the social network.
- the user can, for example, authorize a content provider 108 and/or the content management system 110 to receive the update.
- the update can be, for example, a comment by the user on content exposed to the user (e.g., in association with the social application 120 or the social application 122 ), such as a content item posted to their activity stream or to another user's activity stream, or some other content.
- the update can be a comment posted by the user on a blog.
- the update can be a designation that the user likes or dislikes certain content. The user can, for example, designate that they like or dislike a content item posted to their activity stream or to another user's activity stream, or some other content.
- An update can also be of the form of another type of interaction with a content item in a user's activity stream, such as a designation to share or re-publish the content item.
- Content included in or referenced as part of an update can include a hashtag.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a publisher 109 , which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .

- the resources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, videos, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- User devices 106 can also submit search queries 117 to the search system 115 over the network 102 .
- the search system 115 can, for example, access the indexed cache 116 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 117 .
- the search system 115 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 115 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 117 , and includes a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page.
- the data representing the resource 105 or the search results 118 can also include data specifying a portion of the resource 105 or search results 118 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots or impressions.
- An example slot is an advertisement slot.
- the publisher 109 of a resource 105 can specify (e.g., using a publisher account management interface associated with the content management system 110 ) one or more hashtags to use as selection criteria for determining which content can be shown in a slot on a resource 105 associated with the publisher 109 .
- the content management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with the resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots or impressions that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results 118 .
- a reference e.g., URL
- a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- keywords and/or hashtags associated with a requested resource 105 or a search query 117 for which search results 118 are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource 105 or search query 117 .
- An identifier e.g., cookie
- associated with the user device 106 can be received with the request for content.
- the content management system 110 can select (e.g., from a content items data store 119 ) content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request.
- One or more selected content items can be provided to the user device 106 in association with providing an associated resource 105 or search results 118 .
- the provided content item(s) can be presented on the user device 106 , in one or more respective slots.
- the content management system 110 can, for example, select a content item having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot.
- content items having selection criteria e.g., keywords, hashtags
- content items having selection criteria e.g., keywords, hashtags
- the content management system 110 can identify a content item in the content items datastore 119 that is associated with a hashtag or keyword that matches a hashtag or keyword included in a user profile associated with the requesting user device 106 .
- the identified content item can be selected by the content management system 110 and provided to the requesting user device 106 .
- the content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction.
- a content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns.
- the account management user interfaces can be made available to the content provider 108 , for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device.
- a content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters 113 which define a content campaign.
- the content campaign can be created and activated for the content provider 108 according to the parameters 113 specified by the content provider 108 .
- the campaign parameters 113 can be stored in a campaign database 114 .
- Campaign parameters 113 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria.
- Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and/or one or more selection terms.
- the selection terms can be used in evaluating when to serve content items in response to received requests for content.
- the selection terms can include, for example, one or more keywords and/or hashtags.
- a content provider 108 may be, for example, an entity that is associated with a brand.
- the content management system 110 can provide tools for entities to create campaigns that promote a brand by using content that has been created and tagged by users as being associated with, for example, a brand-related hashtag.
- the content management system 110 can gather content (e.g., text content, image content, video content) from plural, different content sources that are associated with hashtags, store the gathered content in a hashtagged content repository 124 , and, in some implementations, index the stored content by hashtags.
- the content management system 110 can, for example, gather content from one or both of the first social server system 111 and the second social server system 112 .
- the content management system 110 can gather only user-generated content to which users have explicitly granted access.
- a content provider 108 may run a brand promotion and may encourage users to post or submit content related to the brand promotion.
- a shoe company can run a campaign centered around a #born2run hashtag and may encourage users to post running photos and other content and tag such content with the #born2run hashtag.
- User posts and submissions can be, for example, used as entry into a sweepstakes or other contest. The users can agree to use of content associated with a particular hashtag as part of submitting a post associated with the hashtag
- the content management system 110 can provide a user interface in which the entity can provide a search query for searching for content in the hashtagged content repository 124 .
- the search query can include, for example, one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand. Other input is possible.
- the content management system 110 can retrieve content from the hashtagged content repository 124 based on the search query and present the retrieved content to the entity.

- the content management system 110 can automatically create a campaign for the entity, including the automatic generation of one or more creatives based on the selected content for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign. Automatic creation of campaigns based on hashtagged content is discussed in more detail below.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example system 200 for providing content.
- a user of a first user device 202 posts a message 204 to an activity stream associated with a first social network and with the user of the first user device 202 .
- the message 204 is presented on a web page 205 and includes a hashtag 206 and an image 208 .
- the message 204 can be sent to a first social network server 210 (e.g., as a social post 212 ).
- the message 204 including the hashtag 206 and the image 208 , can be stored in a repository 214 and distributed to users of the first social network that are associated with the user of the user device 202 .
- the hashtag 206 may be associated, for example, with an XYZ Shoes shoe manufacturer (e.g., the hashtag 206 may be promoted by the XYZ Shoes manufacturer in content campaigns and one or more of the content campaigns may encourage customers of XYZ Shoes to create and promote content and tag such content using the hashtag 206 ).
- a user can, for example, register with the XYZ Shoes entity (e.g., by entering a sweepstakes or other contests). As part of registering with the XYZ Shoes entity, the user can agree to use of content that they tag with a hashtag associated with the XYZ Shoes entity.
- the hashtag 206 can be used as an index for the social post 212 that is stored in the repository 214 .
- the repository 214 may be indexed and searchable by hashtags.
- the repository 214 can include metadata for each stored content item, such as a number of affinity designations (e.g., “likes”), or number of publications or re-publications of the content item. Other forms of metadata are possible.
- the XYZ Shoes manufacturer may provide a social page on the first social network and/or on a second, different social network.
- a social page 216 associated with the second social network is presented on a second user device 218 .
- the social page 216 can be configured to allow users to post messages to the social page 216 .
- the social page 216 includes a message 220 that encourages users to post messages and images related to running.
- the social page 216 can explain that content that a user posts to the social page 216 may be used by the XYZ Shoes manufacturer and can allow the user to agree to such use.
- the social page 216 includes a post 222 (e.g., a post posted by a user of the user device 218 ) that includes an image 224 and a text comment 226 .
- the text comment 226 includes the same #born2run hashtag as the message 204 .
- the post 222 can be sent to a second social network server 228 (e.g., as a social post 230 ).
- the post 230 including the comment 226 and the image 224 , can be stored in a repository 232 and distributed to users of the second social network that are associated with the user of the user device 218 .

- the content server 240 can store the gathered content in a hashtagged content repository 242 and index the stored content by particular hashtags. For example, both the image 208 and the image 224 can be stored in the hashtagged content repository 242 in association with the #born2run hashtag.
- User-generated content stored in the hashtagged content repository 242 is content for which users have given consent for use.
- a user associated with the XYZ Shoes manufacturer can view a content gallery user interface 250 on a content sponsor user device 252 .
- the campaign administrator can, for example, use the content gallery user interface 250 to search for content associated with a hashtag, content category, or brand. For instance, the content gallery user interface 250 displays content items 254 and 256 that had previously been posted by users and associated with the #born2run hashtag.
- the campaign administrator can select one or more of the presented content items (e.g., the content item 254 is shown as selected).
- the content server 240 can receive a content selection 258 from the content sponsor user device 252 .
- the content server 240 can automatically create a campaign for the content sponsor based on the content selection 258 .
- the content server 240 can generate a creative based on the content selection 258 and can associate the creative with a new or existing campaign and designate the creative for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign.
- the selection criteria for the campaign can include, for example, the hashtag 206 and/or one or more selection keywords that are determined to be related to the hashtag 206 .
- Data for the campaign and the creative can be stored in a campaign repository 260 , as illustrated by example stored campaign data 262 and a creative 264 .
- Textual portions of the creative 264 can be automatically determined and/or provided by the content sponsor.
- textual content can be automatically determined from a landing page associated with the content sponsor.
- a landing page associated with the content sponsor can be associated with the creative 264 such that the landing page is presented when the creative 264 is presented to a user and the user selects the creative 264 .
- a content sponsor can edit or customize automatically generated text.
- the creative 264 includes the hashtag #born2run, automatically generated creatives are not required to include a hashtag.
- the content server 240 can serve content included in the campaign in response to received requests for content.

Abstract
Methods, systems and apparatus include computer programs encoded on a computer-readable storage medium for creating a campaign. A method includes: identifying a repository of content, the repository including a plurality of content items, each indexed by a hashtag that is associated with a respective content item; receiving a search query from an entity associated with a brand, the query including one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand; retrieving content from the repository based on the search query; presenting the content to the entity and receiving a selection of one or more content items from the presented content for inclusion in a campaign; arid creating a campaign including generating one or more creatives based on the selection for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign.
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for creating a campaign. A method includes: identifying a repository of content, the repository including a plurality of content items, each indexed by a hashtag that is associated with a respective content item; receiving a search query from an entity associated with a brand, the query including one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand; retrieving content from the repository based on the search query; presenting the content to the entity and receiving a selection of one or more content items from the presented content for inclusion in a campaign; and creating a campaign including generating one or more creatives based on the selection for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products. A computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: identify a repository of content, the repository including a plurality of content items, each indexed by a hashtag that is associated with a respective content item; receive a search query from an entity associated with a brand, the query including one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand; retrieve content from the repository based on the search query; present the content to the entity and receiving a selection of one or more content items from the presented content for inclusion in a campaign; and create a campaign including generating one or more creatives based on the selection for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems. A system includes one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: identify a repository of content, the repository including a plurality of content items, each indexed by a hashtag that is associated with a respective content item; receive a search query from an entity associated with a brand, the query including one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand; retrieve content from the repository based on the search query; present the content to the entity and receiving a selection of one or more content items from the presented content for inclusion in a campaign; and create a campaign including generating one or more creatives based on the selection for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. Identifying the repository can include gathering content from plural, different content sources that are associated with hashtags and storing the content in the repository. Gathering the content can include gathering content from at least two different social networks. Gathering content can include gathering metadata related to an engagement metric associated with a specific content item and storing the metadata along with the content in the repository. The metadata can include one or more of a number of affinity designations, or number of publications or re-publications of the specific content item. Presenting can include presenting the metadata for each content item presented. Gathering content can include integrating a portion of an application that generates the creative in one or more networks or applications that are the source of the content. The search query can include only a hashtag and retrieving can include retrieving top ranked content from the repository that is associated with the hashtag. The search query can include a hashtag and a category and retrieving can include retrieving top ranked content from the repository that are associated with the hashtag and the category. The category can be a type of content item. Presenting the content can include presenting top ranked content from the repository based on one or more measures of popularity. Generating the one or more creatives can include generating one creative from the selection and content received from the entity. The content received from the entity can be an identification of a landing page to be associated with the creative. The content received can be textual content to include along with the selection in the creative. The selection can include two content items and generating the one or more creative can include generating two different creatives from the selection each including one of the two content items. When the search query does not include a hashtag retrieving content from the repository based on the search query can include identifying one or more hashtags that are related to the search query and retrieving top ranked content from the repository that is associated with the one or more hashtags. Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. An entity can use, for example in association with an advertising campaign, creative content generated by users who have an affinity towards the entity. Content for a campaign can be automatically created for an entity using far less input from the entity as compared to the entity creating content from scratch. Content that is presented in association with a campaign can be selected from a set of content items that are most popular among customers of the entity associated with the campaign.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- Hashtags provide a ready means for grouping content, so as to enable ease of location of content that includes the tagged material. A repository of content including, for example a plurality of content items each grouped or indexed by a hashtag can be identified. A hashtag, as used herein, refers to a word or phrase that is prefixed with a non-alphabetic symbol (such as the # symbol). In some implementations, a hashtag can be used to index content, such as content that includes or is otherwise associated with the hashtag. For example, a hashtag can be included in or with content used in one or a plurality of social networking environments. In some implementation, a search query including one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand can be received from an entity associated with a brand. Content that is grouped or otherwise associated with a hashtag derived from the contents of the query can be retrieved from the repository based on the search query and presented to the entity. A selection of one or more of the presented content items can be received and a campaign can be created for the entity, including the generating of one or more creatives based on the selected content for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server. For situations in which user-generated content (e.g., content associated with a hashtag) is used, such use may only be performed with content to which the user has given consent of such use:
-
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for providing content to a user. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106,content providers 108,publishers 109, acontent management system 110, a firstsocial server system 111, and a secondsocial server system 112. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106,content providers 108, andpublishers 109. Thecontent management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Thecontent providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content providers are possible. While only two social servers systems are shown, more are possible. Each social server system as presented represents a social environment that may include plural servers for supporting interactions, content delivery and other services in association with a single social service. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, tablet computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), televisions, set top boxes, personal digital assistants and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The web browser can interact with various types of web applications, such as a game, a map application, or an e-mail application, to name a few examples. - The first
social server system 111 and the secondsocial server system 112 allow users to interact with other users within a social framework. The firstsocial server system 111 and the secondsocial server system 112 each provide a social presence for users in theenvironment 100. For example, the firstsocial server system 111 and the secondsocial server system 112 can be associated with their own respective social application (e.g., asocial application 120 and a social application 122). Thesocial application 120 and thesocial application 122 can allow a user of auser device 106 to share information in a respective social network. For example, thesocial application 120 and thesocial application 122 can each be associated with a social networking website that users can use, for example, to identify friends and social groups (e.g., circles), send and receive email, post messages and multi-media (e.g. photos, video, audio), track social events, provide updates and so on. - A user of a
user device 106 can use thesocial application 120 or thesocial application 122 to post an update for the user in a social context, such update enabling content to be distributed to one or more other users in the social network. In some implementations, one or both of the firstsocial server system 111 or the secondsocial server 112 can, in response to the update, provide the update to one or more subscribers that the user has authorized to receive the update. For example, subscribers may be subscribed to an activity stream associated with the user, and may be enabled to view the update in the user's activity, stream. An activity stream can be used to present recent updates posted by one or more users in the social network. The user can, for example, authorize acontent provider 108 and/or thecontent management system 110 to receive the update. - The update can be, for example, a comment by the user on content exposed to the user (e.g., in association with the
social application 120 or the social application 122), such as a content item posted to their activity stream or to another user's activity stream, or some other content. As another example, the update can be a comment posted by the user on a blog. As yet another example, the update can be a designation that the user likes or dislikes certain content. The user can, for example, designate that they like or dislike a content item posted to their activity stream or to another user's activity stream, or some other content. An update can also be of the form of another type of interaction with a content item in a user's activity stream, such as a designation to share or re-publish the content item. Content included in or referenced as part of an update can include a hashtag. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. Anexample website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by apublisher 109, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105.Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few. Theresources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, videos, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106.User devices 106 can also submitsearch queries 117 to thesearch system 115 over thenetwork 102. In response to asearch query 117, thesearch system 115 can, for example, access the indexedcache 116 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to thesearch query 117. Thesearch system 115 identifies theresources 105 in the form ofsearch results 118 and returns the search results 118 to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. Asearch result 118 is data generated by thesearch system 115 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to aparticular search query 117, and includes a link to theresource 105. Anexample search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - The data representing the
resource 105 or the search results 118 can also include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 orsearch results 118 or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots or impressions. An example slot is an advertisement slot. In some implementations, thepublisher 109 of aresource 105 can specify (e.g., using a publisher account management interface associated with the content management system 110) one or more hashtags to use as selection criteria for determining which content can be shown in a slot on aresource 105 associated with thepublisher 109. - When a
resource 105 orsearch results 118 are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results 118. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots or impressions that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results 118. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to theresource 105 orsearch results 118 for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Similarly, keywords and/or hashtags associated with a requestedresource 105 or asearch query 117 for which searchresults 118 are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to theresource 105 orsearch query 117. An identifier (e.g., cookie) associated with theuser device 106 can be received with the request for content. - Based, for example, on data included in the request for content, the
content management system 110 can select (e.g., from a content items data store 119) content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request. One or more selected content items can be provided to theuser device 106 in association with providing an associatedresource 105 or search results 118. The provided content item(s) can be presented on theuser device 106, in one or more respective slots. - The
content management system 110 can, for example, select a content item having characteristics matching the characteristics of a given slot. As another example, content items having selection criteria (e.g., keywords, hashtags) that match input or hashtags, in thesearch query 117, or content or hashtags included in the search results 118 may be selected as eligible content items by thecontent management system 110. As yet another example, thecontent management system 110 can identify a content item in the content items datastore 119 that is associated with a hashtag or keyword that matches a hashtag or keyword included in a user profile associated with the requestinguser device 106. The identified content item can be selected by thecontent management system 110 and provided to the requestinguser device 106. In some implementations, thecontent management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction. - A
content provider 108 or content sponsor can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to thecontent provider 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally at a content provider's client device. - A
content provider 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, providecampaign parameters 113 which define a content campaign. The content campaign can be created and activated for thecontent provider 108 according to theparameters 113 specified by thecontent provider 108. Thecampaign parameters 113 can be stored in acampaign database 114.Campaign parameters 113 can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria. Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and/or one or more selection terms. The selection terms can be used in evaluating when to serve content items in response to received requests for content. The selection terms, can include, for example, one or more keywords and/or hashtags. - A
content provider 108 may be, for example, an entity that is associated with a brand. Thecontent management system 110 can provide tools for entities to create campaigns that promote a brand by using content that has been created and tagged by users as being associated with, for example, a brand-related hashtag. Thecontent management system 110 can gather content (e.g., text content, image content, video content) from plural, different content sources that are associated with hashtags, store the gathered content in ahashtagged content repository 124, and, in some implementations, index the stored content by hashtags. Thecontent management system 110 can, for example, gather content from one or both of the firstsocial server system 111 and the secondsocial server system 112. - When gathering user-generated content, the
content management system 110 can gather only user-generated content to which users have explicitly granted access. For example, acontent provider 108 may run a brand promotion and may encourage users to post or submit content related to the brand promotion. For example, a shoe company can run a campaign centered around a #born2run hashtag and may encourage users to post running photos and other content and tag such content with the #born2run hashtag. User posts and submissions can be, for example, used as entry into a sweepstakes or other contest. The users can agree to use of content associated with a particular hashtag as part of submitting a post associated with the hashtag - The
content management system 110 can provide a user interface in which the entity can provide a search query for searching for content in thehashtagged content repository 124. The search query can include, for example, one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand. Other input is possible. Thecontent management system 110 can retrieve content from thehashtagged content repository 124 based on the search query and present the retrieved content to the entity. The entity can select one or more of the presented content items and the selection can be received by thecontent management system 110. Thecontent management system 110 can automatically create a campaign for the entity, including the automatic generation of one or more creatives based on the selected content for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign. Automatic creation of campaigns based on hashtagged content is discussed in more detail below. -
FIG. 2 illustrates anexample system 200 for providing content. A user of afirst user device 202 posts amessage 204 to an activity stream associated with a first social network and with the user of thefirst user device 202. Themessage 204 is presented on aweb page 205 and includes ahashtag 206 and animage 208. Themessage 204 can be sent to a first social network server 210 (e.g., as a social post 212). Themessage 204, including thehashtag 206 and theimage 208, can be stored in arepository 214 and distributed to users of the first social network that are associated with the user of theuser device 202. Thehashtag 206 may be associated, for example, with an XYZ Shoes shoe manufacturer (e.g., thehashtag 206 may be promoted by the XYZ Shoes manufacturer in content campaigns and one or more of the content campaigns may encourage customers of XYZ Shoes to create and promote content and tag such content using the hashtag 206). A user can, for example, register with the XYZ Shoes entity (e.g., by entering a sweepstakes or other contests). As part of registering with the XYZ Shoes entity, the user can agree to use of content that they tag with a hashtag associated with the XYZ Shoes entity. In some implementations, thehashtag 206 can be used as an index for thesocial post 212 that is stored in therepository 214. For example, therepository 214 may be indexed and searchable by hashtags. Therepository 214 can include metadata for each stored content item, such as a number of affinity designations (e.g., “likes”), or number of publications or re-publications of the content item. Other forms of metadata are possible. - The XYZ Shoes manufacturer may provide a social page on the first social network and/or on a second, different social network. For example, a
social page 216 associated with the second social network is presented on asecond user device 218. Thesocial page 216 can be configured to allow users to post messages to thesocial page 216. For example, thesocial page 216 includes a message 220 that encourages users to post messages and images related to running. Thesocial page 216 can explain that content that a user posts to thesocial page 216 may be used by the XYZ Shoes manufacturer and can allow the user to agree to such use. Thesocial page 216 includes a post 222 (e.g., a post posted by a user of the user device 218) that includes animage 224 and atext comment 226. Thetext comment 226 includes the same #born2run hashtag as themessage 204. The post 222 can be sent to a second social network server 228 (e.g., as a social post 230). Thepost 230, including thecomment 226 and theimage 224, can be stored in arepository 232 and distributed to users of the second social network that are associated with the user of theuser device 218. - A content server 240 (or another server or system) can gather content from the first social network (e.g., from the
repository 214 and/or the first social network server 210), the second social network (e.g., from therepository 232 and/or the second social network server 228), and/or from other content sources that include or present content that is associated with hashtags. In some implementations, thecontent server 240 can store the gathered content in ahashtagged content repository 242 and index the stored content by particular hashtags. For example, both theimage 208 and theimage 224 can be stored in thehashtagged content repository 242 in association with the #born2run hashtag. User-generated content stored in thehashtagged content repository 242 is content for which users have given consent for use. - A user (e.g. campaign administrator) associated with the XYZ Shoes manufacturer can view a content
gallery user interface 250 on a contentsponsor user device 252. The campaign administrator can, for example, use the contentgallery user interface 250 to search for content associated with a hashtag, content category, or brand. For instance, the contentgallery user interface 250displays content items - The campaign administrator can select one or more of the presented content items (e.g., the
content item 254 is shown as selected). In response to the selection, thecontent server 240 can receive acontent selection 258 from the contentsponsor user device 252. Thecontent server 240 can automatically create a campaign for the content sponsor based on thecontent selection 258. For example, thecontent server 240 can generate a creative based on thecontent selection 258 and can associate the creative with a new or existing campaign and designate the creative for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign. The selection criteria for the campaign can include, for example, thehashtag 206 and/or one or more selection keywords that are determined to be related to thehashtag 206. Data for the campaign and the creative can be stored in acampaign repository 260, as illustrated by example storedcampaign data 262 and a creative 264. - Textual portions of the creative 264 can be automatically determined and/or provided by the content sponsor. For example, textual content can be automatically determined from a landing page associated with the content sponsor. A landing page associated with the content sponsor can be associated with the creative 264 such that the landing page is presented when the creative 264 is presented to a user and the user selects the creative 264. In some implementations, a content sponsor can edit or customize automatically generated text. Although the creative 264 includes the hashtag #born2run, automatically generated creatives are not required to include a hashtag.
- After creation of the campaign, the
content server 240 can serve content included in the campaign in response to received requests for content. For example, aweb page 270 presented on a user device 272 includes a content slot 274. Theweb page 270 can be configured to send a content request 276 for the content slot 274 to thecontent server 240. Thecontent server 240 can select the creative 264 in response to the content request 276 and provide the creative 264 to the user device 272 for presentation in the content slot 274, as illustrated by a displayed creative 278. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for creating a campaign. Theprocess 300 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 or thecontent server 240 described above with respect toFIG. 2 . - A repository of content is identified (302), the repository including a plurality of content items, each indexed or grouped by a hashtag that is associated with a respective content item. The repository can include content that has been gathered from plural, different content sources. For example, the repository can include content gathered from at least two different social networks. The gathering of content can include gathering and subsequent integration with the content retrieved from one or more different content sources. The content can include textual content, image content, video content, and other types of content. User-generated content stored in the repository is content for which users have given consent for user.
- The repository can include metadata for some or all stored content items. For example, metadata related to an engagement metric associated with a respective content item can be stored in the repository. For example, metadata for a content item can include one or more of a number of affinity designations, or number of publications or re-publications of the content item, a number of users who are associated with (e.g., follow) the creator of the content item, and other types of metadata. Engagement-related metadata can be aggregated from different sources for a content item. For example, a first social network can use a first type of affinity designation (e.g., a “like”), and a second social network can use a second different type of affinity designation (e.g., a “plus one”). The metadata for a content item can include a sum (e.g., weighted sum or such function) of the first type of affinity designation and the second type of affinity designation.
- A search query is received from an entity, such as an entity associated with a brand (304), the query including one or more of a hashtag, category, or brand. The search query can be received, for example, from a user interface. For example,
FIG. 4 illustrates an example contentgallery user interface 400. The entity (e.g., content sponsor) can enter a search query using acontrol 402 and can submit the search query using acontrol 404. The category can indicate, for example, a media type, such as image, text, video, particular types of images (.jpg, .png), etc. The search query can include other criteria, such as a content item maximum size in bytes, a content item display size range or maximum, a date range of content creation, or a minimum engagement metric, to name a few examples. - Referring again to
FIG. 3 , content is retrieved from the repository based on the search query (306). For example, content that is indexed by a hashtag that matches a hashtag included in or derived from the search query can be identified in and retrieved from the repository. For instance, when thecontrol 404 is selected, content that is indexed by the hashtag #born2run (e.g., the #born2run hashtag entered in the control 402) can be retrieved from the repository. As another example, content that is indexed by a hashtag that is related to a category, brand, or concept included in the search query can be retrieved from the repository. For instance, a search query of “XYZ Shoes” may be determined to match hashtags of #born2run, #running, and #runningShoes. In some implementations, when the search query includes only a hashtag, top ranked content from the repository that is associated with the hashtag can be retrieved. In some implementations, when the search query includes a hashtag and a category, top ranked content from the repository that are associated with the hashtag and the category can be retrieved. In some implementations, when the search query does not include a hashtag, one or more hashtags that are related to the search query can be identified and top ranked content from the repository that is associated with the one or more hashtags can be retrieved. - The content is presented to the entity (308). For example, the content can be presented to the entity in a user interface. For example, as shown in
FIG. 4 , content items 406-416 are presented in the contentgallery user interface 400. The content items can be presented, for example, according to popularity ranking. Accordingly, the entity can view content that has been most linked or associated by customers to the entity brand or domain of expertise of the entity. The contentgallery user interface 400 can allow the entity to scroll to see content items other than those initially displayed. As shown in thecontent item 416, engagement metrics and/or a date of content creation, and/or other metadata can be presented along with the content item. As shown by amessage 418, a number of content items matching the query can be presented. - Referring again to
FIG. 3 , a selection of one or more content items is received from the presented content for inclusion in a campaign (310). For example, the selection can be received from a user interface. For instance, in the example ofFIG. 4 , a selection of thecontent item 412 can be received. - A campaign is created, including generating one or more creatives based on the selection for distribution based on selection criteria associated with the campaign (512). For example, one or more creatives can be automatically generated that each include a selected content item. The creatives can also include automatically generated text, such as text retrieved from a landing page associated with the entity. The entity can also provide text or other types of content to include in a creative. The entity can customize auto-generated text. In some implementations, the entity approves the creatives before the creatives are included in the campaign.
