- Various network-based search applications allow a user to enter search terms and receive a list of search results. Such applications commonly use ranking algorithms to ensure that the search results are relevant to the user's query. For example, some systems rank such results based on reliability and safety of the search result, location of the user and search result, etc. These services may also provide business listings in response to a particular search query.
- the business listing search results, or data identifying a business, its contact information, web site address, and other associated content, may be displayed on a map such that a user may easily identify which businesses are located within a particular area.
- some businesses may employ methods to include multiple listings in different geographic locations where the business does not actually exist. The customer may be defrauded by contacting an entity believed to be at a particular location only to learn later that the business is actually operating from a completely different location. Such fraudulent marketing tactics are commonly referred to as “map spam”.
- aspects of the invention relate generally to identifying a likelihood that a map listing is spam by referencing identifying information associated with the listing. Due to the large number of map listings in a data store, patterns emerge between different map listings. The patterns may be used to determine whether received input associated with a map listing is likely spam or is a legitimate map listing edit. The determination is made in real time such that a term associated with the map listing that has not previously been encountered may be recorded and made available instantly to identify other, correlated terms.
- pair-wise correlations are used to generate a pattern of heuristics that identifies a hierarchy of which pairs of map listing terms most commonly appear together.
- a likelihood that the map listing associated with the user input is a legitimate listing increases for those pairs of key words that occur together in a map listing, and the likelihood decreases for each key word that occurs with other, non-key words. The value more accurately reflects the likelihood that the map listing is legitimate as more edits are received. If the map listing is determined to be likely spam, the map listing is removed from a group of searchable map listings such that the spam listing will not be provided as a result in response to a search.
- a computer-implemented method includes receiving user input associated with a listing of a group of searchable listings. Each listing includes identifying information. Using a processor, a plurality of different key words is identified in the identifying information of the listing, and a value is determined that corresponds to a likelihood that the listing is not a spam listing. The value is determined using selected pairs of the different key words. In the event that the value does not exceed a threshold, the listing is removed from the group of searchable listings such that the listing is not provided as a result in response to a search.
- a computer-implemented method includes receiving user input associated with a map listing of a group of searchable map listings. Each map listing includes identifying information. Using a processor, a plurality of different key words is identified in the identifying information of the map listing, and a value is determined that corresponds to a likelihood that the map listing is not a spam listing. In the event that at least one key word pair is present in the map listing, the value is increased by an amount that is proportional to the number of different key word pairs that is present in the listing. In the event that the value does not exceed a threshold, the map listing is removed from the group of searchable map listings.

- Data 134 of server 110 may include map listing data 136 .
- the map listing data 136 may include map location data that identifies specific location information. Typically, the location of any listing is identified by address. However, the listing may be identified in other ways such as by latitude and longitude coordinates.
- the map listing data 136 may also include a title for the listing and other identifying information such as a physical address, a telephone number, and a website address.
- the map listing data 136 may also include category information such that each listing may be grouped according to its category. Such groupings are helpful considering the large number of map listings that may exist. In one example, the map listings may be grouped based on a type of industry or business. The industry may be broadly defined (e.g., food suppliers, educational institutions, health services, etc.) or narrowly defined (e.g., restaurants, grocery stores, daycare centers, secondary schools, dentists, mental health therapists, etc.)
- FIG. 3 demonstrates a process 300 of identifying a likelihood that a map listing is spam.
- Map listings are provided by multitudes of users.
- the user When a map listing is entered into a data store of geographic information, the user includes identifying data in addition to information that identifies the location of the listing on a map.
- the information submitted by the user may include the title of the map listing, a physical address of the map listing, a telephone number, and a website address.
- the user may also identify one or more categories under which the map listing may be classified.
- the user can submit any information to identify the map listing. However, some users may purposely submit inaccurate information in an attempt to increase the number of impressions of their map listing in response to a search.
- the data store of map listings generally includes this type of information for each map listing. However, some map listings may include additional information (e.g., the addresses of additional locations), while some map listings may not include all of this information (e.g., no website address).
- map listings in the data store Due to the large number of map listings in the data store, certain patterns emerge between different map listings. These patterns may be used to determine whether a newly received user input associated with a map listing is likely spam or is a legitimate map listing edit. The determination is made in real-time such that a term associated with the map listing that has not previously been encountered may be recorded and made available instantly to identify other, correlated terms. Since the determination can be made in real-time, there is no requirement to access previously logged data to make the determination.
- the process 300 begins when user input that is associated with a map listing is received (step 310 ).
- the user input may seek to add a map listing to a database of map listings, modify an existing map listing, or delete a map listing from the database of map listings.
- a user action that seeks to add, modify or delete a map listing is referred to as an “edit”.
- the map listing corresponding to the input is separated into key words (step 320 ).
- the key words may include specific words that comprise the title of the map listing. Additional key words may correspond to the map listing's category, telephone number, physical address, website address, or any other terms that may be used to identify the map listing.
- the following terms may be identified as key words: “Mama's”, “Little”, “Restaurant”, “123 Main St.”, “(123)456-7890”, “mamaslittlerestaurant.com”, “food”, “hotel”, “food delivery”, “restaurant”, “Italian restaurant”, “pizza”, and “pizza delivery”.
- Each instance of a key word causes a corresponding counter to be incremented (step 330 ).
- Some counters may be associated with terms included in a title, some counters may be associated with the physical address, some counters may be associated with telephone numbers, some counters may be associated with website addresses, and some counters may be associated with categories.
- the exemplary key words identified above may be used to illustrate the incrementing of the counters.
- One counter associated with a title may be incremented due to the occurrence of “TITLE: ma's”
- another counter associated with a title may be incremented due to the occurrence of “TITLE: little”
- still another counter associated with a title may be incremented due to the occurrence of “TITLE: restaurant”.
- counters associated with categories may each be incremented individually due to the occurrences of “CATEGORY: food”, “CATEGORY: food delivery”, “CATEGORY: restaurant”, “CATEGORY: dining restaurant”, “CATEGORY: pizza”, and “CATEGORY: pizza delivery”.
- one counter may have been incremented for each occurrence of “TITLE: restaurant” that appears in a title for a map listing such that the associated count value is equal to 1000.
- a counter may have been incremented for each occurrence of “CATEGORY: restaurant” that appears in a category for a map listing such that the associated count value is equal to 2000.
- the category count is higher than the title count since just about every legitimate restaurant listing would include “restaurant” as a category, but not every restaurant includes the term “restaurant” in its title.
- key word pairs are identified for the map listing (step 340 ).
- a key word pair may be the correlation of any key word with any other key word.
- Example key word pairs may include: “TITLE: ma's-TITLE: little”, “TITLE: restaurant-CATEGORY: pizza delivery”, “CATEGORY: hotel-TITLE: restaurant”, “CATEGORY: restaurant-TITLE: restaurant”, “ADDRESS: 123 Main St.-CATEGORY: food”, “CATEGORY: facility-PHONE NUMBER: (123)456-7890”, and “WEBSITE: maslittlerestaurant.com-CATEGORY: pizza”. It is understood that any key word pair combination from the map listing may be used.
- Each instance of a key word pair causes a corresponding counter to be incremented (step 350 ). Similar to the individual key word counters described above, additional key word pair counters are provided to count the different combinations of key word pairs.
- one key word pair counter may have been incremented for each occurrence of “CATEGORY: restaurant-TITLE: restaurant” that appears in a map listing such that the associated counter value is equal to 23.
- a key word pair counter may have been incremented for each occurrence of “CATEGORY: hotel-CATEGORY: restaurant” that appears in a map listing such that the associated count value is equal to 10.
- the count is higher for the key word pair of “CATEGORY: restaurant-TITLE: restaurant” than for the key word pair of for “CATEGORY: hotel-CATEGORY: restaurant” because more map listings in the “restaurant” category include “restaurant” in the title than map listings in the “restaurant” category that are also included in a “hotel” category.
- These pair-wise correlations are used to generate a pattern of heuristics that identifies a set of which pairs of map listing terms most commonly appear together. These are represented best in the form of a table as follows. Here a particular row entry is a field:value pair and for each column, we have a different field2:value pair and the cell contains the count and rate. Count and rate would be stored for both approval and denial. Note that due to the sparse nature, those cells with Count:0 and rate:0 is not stored to save space.
- human interaction may affect the likelihood that the map listing is considered spam.
- a moderator may be assigned to approve edits to map listings. If a map listing is approved by the moderator, an approval count for that map listing is incremented. Accordingly, counters for each key word and counters for each key word pair may also be incremented for that map listing. Similarly, if a map listing is rejected by the moderator, an approval count for that map listing is decremented. The moderator may select the key word or key word pairs upon which the rejection was based such that only these counters are decremented and any other counters are not changed.
- the map listing associated with the user input is a legitimate listing (step 360 ).
- the likelihood increases for those pairs of key words that occur together in a map listing, and the likelihood decreases for each key word that occurs with other, non-key words. As legitimate edits are received to the map listings the value is increased, and as “spammy” edits are received to the map listings the value is decreased. Accordingly, the value more accurately reflects the likelihood that the map listing is legitimate as more edits are received.
- a typical model of possible categories and corresponding likelihood values for “restaurant” that appears in a title of a map listing is provided in the following confidence list.
- the likelihood values are generated using different methods.
- the likelihood values are generated based on a difference between a likelihood of a word being part of a legitimate listing and a likelihood of a word not being part of a legitimate listing.
- the likelihood values are generated based on velocity thresholds of a pairwise correlation. The determinism that a word is likely to be part of a legitimate listing is made using manually tuned thresholds. From time to time, we evaluate which threshold gives us highest accuracy on a hold out data. At the end of such a tuning exercise, the likelihood limit could be say 1000 for counts and say 100 for velocities. Looking at the high confidence categories below, we can say all of them indicate a legitimate listing as they are all above the threshold value of 100.
- G 2 ⁇ ⁇ ij ⁇ ⁇ O ij ⁇ ln ⁇ ( O ij E ij )
- O the observed frequency in a cell, which is either the count or velocity of the pair of tokens in two fields (“Category:hotel:Title:restaurant”)
- E the expected frequency of the null-hypothesis, which is the total count or total frequency of each token in the pair (“Category:hotel”, “Title:restaurant”).
- the threshold value is 1000. If the likelihood value is less than the threshold value, the map listing is likely spam and processing continues to step 380 .
- the map listing is removed from a group of searchable map listings such that the spam listing will not be provided as a result in response to a search.
- step 390 A determination is made whether more edits are made to the map listings (step 390 ). In the event that more edits are made to the map listings, processing continues to step 310 ; otherwise processing is terminated.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a pair of exemplary screen shots 400 that may be viewed by a user operating a client device that is executing the algorithm to perform the process 300 .
- the screen shot 400 depicts a map of several different business listings.
- a top portion of FIG. 4 illustrates a variety of different map listings submitted by a user and provided on a map. Each map listing is identified by a capital letter.
- the map listing that corresponds to “A” is determined to be an illegitimate listing after repeated edits are made to the listing. Accordingly, this map listing is removed from a group of searchable map listings such that the listing will not be provided as a result in response to a search (see lower portion of FIG. 4 ).
- a likelihood that a map listing is spam is determined by referencing identifying information associated with the listing. Patterns emerge between different map listings that may be used to determine whether received input associated with a map listing is likely spam. The determination is made in real-time such that a term associated with the map listing that has not previously been encountered may be recorded and made available instantly to identify other, correlated terms. These pair-wise correlations are used to generate a pattern of heuristics that identifies a hierarchy of which pairs of map listing terms most commonly appear together. The likelihood that the map listing associated with the user input is a legitimate listing increases for those pairs of key words that occur together in a map listing, and the likelihood decreases for each key word that occurs with other, non-key words.
- the value more accurately reflects the likelihood that the map listing is legitimate as more edits are received. If the map listing is determined to be likely spam, the map listing is removed from a group of searchable map listings such that the spam listing will not be provided as a result in response to a search.

where,
where, O is the observed frequency in a cell, which is either the count or velocity of the pair of tokens in two fields (“Category:hotel:Title:restaurant”), and E is the expected frequency of the null-hypothesis, which is the total count or total frequency of each token in the pair (“Category:hotel”, “Title:restaurant”). We compute G for good and bad and compute the relative likelihood by subtracting their squares. This gives negative scores for spam edits based on counts as well as velocities.
