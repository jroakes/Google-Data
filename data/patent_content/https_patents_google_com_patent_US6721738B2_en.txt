Definitions
- This invention relates to security mechanisms for electronic and other devices and in particular to a security mechanism for computers, firearms, cellular telephones, and the like which can be activated and deactivated simply by moving the device correctly according to a preselected “motion password”.
- PINs personal identification numbers
- PINs personal identification numbers
- passwords and PINs do not adequately protect against theft of computers, especially portable computers (e.g., laptops and personal data assistants) and other portable electronic devices (e.g., cellular telephones) which, when stolen, can still often be used by bypassing or deciphering the password or PIN.
- portable computers e.g., laptops and personal data assistants
- other portable electronic devices e.g., cellular telephones
- standard password and PIN protection schemes typically require that the electronic device be powered on in order to enter the password or PIN.
- a chip set integratable with a device such as a laptop computer and which includes an accelerometer, a processor, and a memory
- the database of the memory includes a set of coordinate values corresponding to authorized movement of the computer (a “motion password”) and the accelerometer, in combination with the processor, actively detects whether the user has moved the computer according to the motion password and, in response, either arms or disarms the security subsystem and/or an alarm accordingly.
- This invention features a motion password control system comprising a motion sensor responsive to motion of a device and providing a signal corresponding to movement of the device; a database including stored data values corresponding to predetermined motion of the device; and an electronic circuit, responsive to the motion sensor, configured to compare the motion sensor signal with the stored database values, and, in response, to provide an output signal for performing at least one action of a preselected set of actions when the comparison reveals that the device has moved in a way which corresponds to the stored data values.
- the database includes data corresponding to a set of discrete orientations of the device and the electronic circuit further includes a timer and means for determining whether any movement of the device matches the set of orientations within predetermined time periods.
- the database includes motion data indicative of an authorized path of movement.
- the motion sensor is typically an accelerometer
- the database may be resident in a memory device such as a programmable read only memory
- the electronic circuit may be embodied in a microcontroller.
- the device may be a computer, cellular telephone, firearm, or other valuable or electronically controllable item.
- the system further includes an audible alarm subsystem responsive to the output signal of the electronic circuit.
- the audible alarm subsystem typically includes an audible alarm and means for arming and disarming the audible alarm subsystem in response to the output signal and means for activating the audible alarm when the audible alarm subsystem is armed and movement of the device does not match the database values.
- the device may also include an electronic access locking subsystem and one preselected action is to change the state of the electronic access locking subsystem. If the device is a firearm with a firing locking mechanism, one of the predetermined set of actions is to change the state of the firing locking mechanism.
- the electronic circuit may further be configured to prompt a user of the device to enter a motion password and to store the entered movement data values in the database.
- This invention also features a method of controlling a device.
- the method includes sensing movement of the device, storing, in a database, values corresponding to predetermined motions of the device, comparing any motion of the device with the stored database values and, in response, providing an output signal for performing at least one action of a preselected set of actions when the comparison reveals that the device has moved in a way which corresponds to the stored data values.
- the database typically includes data corresponding to a set of discrete orientations and the method then further includes determining whether any movement of the device matches the set of orientations within predetermined time periods.
- the database includes motion data indicative of an authorized path of movement.
- the method may further include arming and disarming the audible alarm subsystem in response to the output signal and activating the audible alarm when the audible alarm subsystem system is armed and any movement of the device does not match the database values.
- the method may further include allowing access when the movement of the device matches the database values. If the device is a firearm with a trigger locking mechanism, one of the predetermined set of actions is typically disarming the trigger locking mechanism. The method may also include prompting a user of the device to enter a motion password and storing the movement data values in the database.

- Motion password control system 10 may be integrated as a chip set attached to or otherwise integrated with device 12 which may be an electronic device such as a laptop computer, a personal data assistant, a cellular telephone, or the like, or even other devices subject to theft and/or misuse such as a firearm as discussed infra.
- device 12 may be an electronic device such as a laptop computer, a personal data assistant, a cellular telephone, or the like, or even other devices subject to theft and/or misuse such as a firearm as discussed infra.
- the chip set includes accelerometer 14 or some other type of motion sensor responsive to movement of device 12 and which provides a signal corresponding to the movement of device 12 to processor or microcontroller 16 (or any other equivalent electronic circuitry).
- memory 18 Stored in memory 18 , which may be a EPROM, is a database of values (“the motion password”) corresponding to predetermined motions or orientations of device 12 .
- processor 16 accesses the database of memory 18 and then one of two things happens: either the movement of device 12 corresponds to the values stored as the motion password; or the movement of device 12 does not correspond to the values stored as the motion password.
- the device is either “armed”, step 30 , FIG. 2 or disarmed which means a theft detection subsystem is either activated or not and/or a password based security subsystem is activated or not.
- a theft detection subsystem is either activated or not and/or a password based security subsystem is activated or not.
- an alarm will be triggered.
- the security system is armed and the device is moved without entering the motion password, the status quo will be maintained, i.e., the security system will remain armed and, for example, access to the computer's operating system and/or files will be denied.
- chip set 10 FIG. 1 outputs a signal to security subsystem 20 to activate or deactivate it depending on whether first the motion password is entered and second the current state of security subsystem 20 .
- Security subsystem may be integral with device 12 and/or integral with chip set 10 .
- microprocessor 16 If security subsystem 20 is armed, step 30 , FIG. 2, microprocessor 16 , FIG. 1 reads all accelerometer values step 32 , FIG. 2 and compares, step 34 , those values to the values stored in database 30 of EEPROM 18 , FIG. 1 .
- step 36 If a match is found, step 36 , FIG. 2, security subsystem 23 , FIG. 1 is disarmed, step 38 , FIG. 2 . Access to the files and/or operating system of the computer is now allowed and/or an alarm will not sound if the computer is moved.
- security subsystem 20 FIG. 1 is not armed or activated, the user can change its state by entering the motion password to prevent access to the computer and/or to cause an alarm to sound thereafter if the computer is moved in a way that does not correspond to the motion password.
- step 42 the accelerometer values are read, step 42 , FIG. 2, a comparison with the database values is made, step 44 , and if a match is found, step 46 the device is armed, step 48 .
- the owner of laptop computer 70 decides that the motion password is a tilt downward 45° to the left, FIG. 4, a tilt downward to the right 45°, FIG. 5, and another 45° tilt downward to the left, FIG. 6 and these three orientations are stored as data by processor 16 in memory 18 , FIG. 1 as authorized movement positions. Then, with the system activated by entering the motion password, the owner leaves the laptop computer on a desk, in a conference room, or on a table or seat in an airport and processor 16 in conjunction with accelerometer 14 continuously monitors all motion of laptop computer 70 , step 30 , FIG. 2 and compares any motion data to the data stored in memory 18 , FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 1 compares these motions to the database values, finds that they match within some predetermined tolerance level, (and within a predetermined time as discussed below) and disarms or deactivates security subsystem 20 , FIG. 1 and/or any corresponding theft detection subsystem.
- One such theft detection subsystem is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/572,801 filed May 17, 2000 and owned by the applicant hereof. That disclosure is hereby incorporated herein.
- the user is then allowed access to the files and programs operating on laptop computer 70 , FIG. 1 and/or can move the computer without sounding an alarm.
- any security mechanism associated with the laptop computer is not deactivated thereby preventing access to the authorized user's files and computer programs.
- system 10 includes, typically as part of processor 16 , a clock or timer 50 , FIG. 7 .
- any given “Motion Password” consists of N discreet physical orientations, n represents the Motion Password physical orientation index that is currently being searched for (i.e. for a 3-part Motion Password and there are three possible orientation indices; n can be 1, 2, or 3. If the current accelerometer values match the Motion Password database values for the current index n, those values must remain matched for duration T in order for the orientation to be considered a valid matching Motion Password orientation.
- ClockVal is the output of the clock (i.e. the current time).
- SearchInterval is the amount of time that a Motion Password orientation with index n greater than 1 will be searched for before the index n is reset to 1.
- the Motion Password search algorithm begins by setting the index n of the Motion Password orientation that is being searched for to 1, step 52 .
- Microprocessor 16 compares the outputs of Accelerometer 14 with the values at index 1 of EEPROM 18 . If the values do not match, step 53 is repeated. If the values match, microprocessor 16 determines if the accelerometer 14 values remain matching for duration T, step 54 . If the values do not remain matching for duration T, then step 53 is performed. If the values do remain matching for duration T, the n is incremented by 1, step 55 .
- step 60 If ClockVal is less than TimeOut(n) in step 60 , then Microprocessor 16 compares the outputs of Accelerometer 14 with the values at index n of EEPROM 18 , step 62 . If the values do not match, step 60 is performed. If the values in step 62 match, then Microprocessor 16 determines if the Accelerometer 14 values remain matching for duration T, step 64 . If the values do not remain matching for duration T then step 60 is performed. If values do remain matching then step 55 is performed.
- step 66 may also be used in conjunction with other types of electronic devices, for example, a television remote control device which must be moved in accordance with a preselected motion password before certain television stations can be chosen.
- a television remote control device which must be moved in accordance with a preselected motion password before certain television stations can be chosen.
- simply moving a cellular telephone in accordance with one motion password causes the cellular telephone to dial one preselected telephone number while moving the cellular telephone in accordance with a different motion password causes the cellular telephone to automatically dial a different preselected number.
- the cellular telephone can be “locked” and “unlocked” by entering the motion password.
- laptop computer 82 includes both the motion password control system 10 of the subject invention and access control subsystem 80 which is programmed to either deny access to the operating system, the files, and/or the programs of laptop computer 82 and/or renders laptop computer 82 unusable in some other way.
- the motion password is to slide laptop computer 82 forward in the direction shown by arrow 84 , to the left in the direction shown by arrow 86 , rearward in the direction 88 and backward to its original position to the right as shown by arrow 90 . If, however, an unauthorized user simply lifts laptop computer 82 upward as shown by arrow 94 in FIG. 9, microprocessor 16 , FIG.
- the sliding motions, See FIG. 8, and/or angular orientations, See FIGS. 3-6, can be discreet or continuous depending on the specific design.
- the motion password control system of the subject invention is not limited to portable electronic equipment, however.
- system 10 is integrated with firearm 100 which also includes electronically controlled firing lock subsystem 102 and/or audible alarm 104 .
- firearm 100 By moving the barrel of firearm 100 in accordance with the motion password stored in the database of EPROM 18 , FIG. 1, first upward as shown by arrow 106 , then downward as shown by arrow 108 , and then forward as shown by arrow 110 , processor 16 then, and only then, deactivates alarm 104 and deactivates electronic firing lock 102 . Any other movement of firearm 100 other than as shown by arrows 106 , 108 , and 110 results in processor 16 , FIG. 1, activating alarm 104 and processor 16 , FIG.
- System 10 can also be used in conjunction with other valuable items and other electronic components. In the simplest example, any movement of the item other than in accordance with the motion password once the security mechanism is activated by entry of the motion password causes an alarm to sound.
- Passwords are stored in the data base of EPROM 18 , FIG. 1, by configuring processor 16 to activate a password menu, step 120 , FIG. 11 displayed on the screen of the electronic device which incorporates control system 10 , FIG. 1 .
- the user is then prompted to “enter the password”, step 122 by orienting electronic device three different ways as shown in FIGS. 3-6 or by continuously moving the electronic device as shown in FIG. 8 and processor 16 , FIG. 1 reads the output of the accelerometer, step 124 , FIG. 11 and stores those accelerometer values, step 126 , in the database as shown at 128 of EPROM 18 , FIG. 1 .
- the set of actions which can be taken when the motion password is “entered” can be to activate or deactivate a password based security subsystem, activate or deactivate a theft detection subsystem, or to initiate any function normally activated by programming choosing a new selection or some other input device or subsystem.
- step 122 there is a time delay of several seconds after prompting the user to enter the motion password in step 122 to allow the user to select a orientation or position while the computer is on a desk and to then have a reasonable delay for positioning the computer into the desired orientation.
- audio feedback may also be provided to the user to inform her when she has reached each orientation of the motion password.
- FIG. 1 is a laptop computer with a security system
- the present invention is used to control whether the security system is armed or disarmed.
- the motion password algorithm is executed by a microprocessor (such as a Microchip PIC16C63A).
- the output pins of a motion sensor (such as an Analog Devices, Inc.'s ADXL202 accelerometer) are connected to the general purpose input pins of the microcontroller and the microcontroller performs the motion password analysis described herein in conjunction with a database of sensor values that are stored on a suitable memory device (such as a Microchip 24LC64 EEPROM chip).
- a suitable memory device such as a Microchip 24LC64 EEPROM chip
- any given Motion Password consists of N discreet physical orientations, n represents the Motion Password physical orientation index that is currently being searched for (i.e. for a 3-part Motion Password, and the are three possible orientation indices; n can be 1, 2, or 3. If the current accelerometer values match the Motion Password database values for the current index n, those values must remain matched for duration T in order for the orientation to be considered a valid matching Motion Password orientation.
- ClockVal is the output of the clock (i.e. the current time).
- SearchInterval is the amount of time that a Motion Password orientation with index n greater than 1 will be searched for before the index n greater than 1 will be searched for before the index n is reset to 1.
- MpFailures is the number of sequential partially completed motion passwords. This number may be indicative of someone trying to “break in” another person's Motion Password.
- FailureLimit is the maximum number of allowable sequential partially completed Motion Passwords, beyond which the system is considered stolen or in danger.
- the Motion Password search algorithm begins by setting the counter for number of sequential partially-completed Motion Passwords, MpFailures, equal to zero, step 130 .
- the index n of the Motion Password orientation that is being searched for 1, step 132 .
- microprocessor 16 compares the outputs of accelerometer 14 which the values at index 1 of EEPROM 18 . If the values do not match, step 134 is repeated. If the values match, Microprocessor 16 determines if the accelerometer 14 values remain matching for duration T, step 136 . If the values do not remain matching for duration T, then step 134 is performed. If the values do remain matching for duration T, then n is incremented by 1, step 138 .
- step 144 the current time ClockVal is compared with the timeout for the current index n, TimeOut(n). If ClockVal is less than TimeOut(n) in step 144 , then Microprocessor 16 compares the outputs of accelerometer 14 with the values at index n of EEPROM 18 , step 148 . If the values do not match, step 144 is performed.
- step 156 If the value of MpFailures is greater than the maximum number of allowable sequential partially-completed Motion Password, step 156 , then the system is considered in danger and appropriate actions are taken, step 158 . If the result of step 156 is negative, then step 132 is performed next.
