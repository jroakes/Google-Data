Definitions
- the present invention relates to the field of automated information retrieval in the context of document characterization and classification.
- the present invention relates to a system and associated method for classifying semi-structured data maintained in systems that are linked together over an associated network such as the Internet.
- this invention pertains to a computer software product for dynamically categorizing and classifying documents by taking advantage of both textual information as well as latent information embedded in the structure or schema of the documents, in order to classify their contents with a high degree of precision.
- This invention incorporates a structured vector model, and relies on a document classifier that assumes a structured vector model.
- the World Wide Web is comprised of an expansive network of interconnected computers upon which businesses, governments, groups, and individuals throughout the world maintain inter-linked computer files known as web pages.
- the phenomenal growth of the WWW has led to the proliferation of data in semi-structured formats such as HTML and XML.
- An accurate classifier is an essential component of building a semi-structured database system.
- Net directories provide a hierarchical classification of documents based on a manual classification of Web page materials and data.
- Search engines use a keyword-based search methodology to return to the user a set of pages that contain a given keyword or words. Both search tools suffer from significant limitations. Net directories are precise but are very limited in scope and expensive to maintain, primarily because of the requirement for human effort to build and maintain them. Search engines are more capable of covering the expanse of the Web but suffer from low precision and in their current embodiments, are reaching their logical limits. Search engines may provide to the user a null return or, conversely, a multitude of responses, the majority of which are irrelevant.
- Probabilistic classifiers use the joint probabilities of words and categories to estimate the probability of a document falling in a given category. These are the so-called term-based classifiers.
- Neural networks have been applied to text categorization. Decision tree algorithms have been adapted for data mining purposes.
- Web documents are extremely diverse in content, structure, style and format, partly because of their diverse authorship. Many of the techniques that have been developed are only effective on documents with homogeneous corpora. 2. A significant fraction of Web documents are hypertext documents, often divided into pages that are connected by hyperlinks. Documents used for most existing Information Retrieval (IR) studies are self-contained and cannot deal with the links. 3. Most popular web document formats such as HTML or XML are semi-structured, implying either an explicit or implicit, though not fixed, schema. Previous Information Retrieval (IR) efforts have focused on flat (unstructured) documents. The markups and formatting cues in the document can mislead the classifiers; removing or ignoring them means that only part of the original information is available for classification.
- IR Information Retrieval
- semi-structured data are data that do not have a fixed schema.
- Semi-structured data however, have a schema, either implicit or explicit, but do not have to conform to a fixed schema.
- semi-structure documents are text files that contain semi-structured data. Examples include documents in HTML and XML and, thus, represent a large fraction of the documents on the Web.
- the classifier can evaluate for both and non-local data information to better categorize a document.
- the system can dynamically and accurately classify documents with an implicit or explicit schema by taking advantage of the term-frequency and term distribution information inherent in the document.
- the system further uses a structured vector model that allows like terms to be grouped together and dissimilar terms to be segregated based on their frequency and distribution within the sub-vectors of the structure vector, thus achieving context sensitivity.
- the final decision for assigning the class of a document is based on a mathematical comparison of the similarity of the terms in the structured vector to those of the various class models.
- the classifier of the present invention is capable of both learning and testing.
- the classifier develops models for classes with information it develops from the composite information gleaned from numerous training documents. Specifically, it develops a structured vector model for each training document. Then, within a given class of documents it adds and then normalizes the occurrences of terms.
- the classifier further employs a feature selection technique to differentiate between good discriminators and noise and to discard noise terms on the basis of the structure the terms appear. It additionally employs a feature selection technique that determines the relative importance of sections of textual information.
- XML documents differ from typical text documents in the following respects:
- Each element of an XML document is tagged.
- the tags are usually nested, making the XML documents hierarchical in nature.
- Any element of an XML document can be referred to by any other element, thus requiring the documents to be modeled as directed graphs. Under some circumstances, a special case of a directed graph, a tree, can be used, particularly for purposes of exposition.
- the hierarchical structure can be understood in the context of the analogy to a book.
- a book consists of many chapters, which, in turn, consist of many sections formed of many sentences, which, in turn, consist of many words.
- a word belongs to a sentence that contains the word, thus to the section that contains the sentence, the chapter that contains the section and, ultimately, to the book at its highest level.
- a term (or equivalently a leaf or text) belongs to its antecedents.
- the leaf belongs to its parent, its grandparent and all higher ancestors, ultimately belonging to the document or root.
- the structure of the model is based on the following observation: Terms from the same XML element have to be grouped together to be treated in the same way, and to be differentiated from terms in other XML elements. The primary reason is that terms in one substructure may have a distribution that is different from another substructure or different distribution of terms from the overall document. By taking into account the structural information the classifier can achieve a context sensitivity that flat (unstructured) document models cannot achieve.
- the algorithm used by the classifier may be summarized by the following process:
- the semi-structured document classifier of the present invention provides several features and advantages, among which are the following:
- tag augmentation uses a process known as tag augmentation to encode the tagging and nesting of elements in a semi-structured document. It explicitly groups like structure elements of terms together and, further, segregates dissimilar terms. 7. It bases its final decision on the topics of the document on both the term frequency and term distribution information and structure of the document as described above. 8. It achieves the benefits enumerated for a structured model and the speed of a flat vector model by taking advantage of the equivalence of tag augmentation and the structured vector model. 9. It incorporates context-sensitive term selection in its learning algorithm in the context of document structure. Term selection is performed for each sub-structure of document. That is, it differentiates between significant terms and noise per structure basis instead of the entire document. 10. It relies on a well-defined, robust probability function to make a final determination the class of a document. The classifier is the first to incorporate both textual and structural features into the statistical model or class determination.
- classifier that takes advantages of the hierarchical nature of documents exemplified by those in XML (extensible Markup Language), or any other language whose structure is hierarchical in nature and includes tags with each element.
- XML extensible Markup Language
- the classifier presented herein uses the inherent structure of XML or other semi-structured documents to provide high quality semantic clues that may not be otherwise taken advantage of by term-based classification schemes.
- the classifier further relies on a robust statistical model and a structure-based context-sensitive feature for better classification

- XML tags can be used to create hyperlinks to other web documents.
- FIG. 1 portrays the overall environment in which a classifier (classification system) 10 for semi-structured documents according to the present invention may be used.
- the classifier 10 includes a software or computer program product which is typically embedded within, or installed on a host server 15 .
- the classifier 10 can be saved on a suitable storage medium such as a diskette, a CD, a hard drive, or like devices. While the classifier 10 will be described in connection with the WWW, the classifier 10 can be used with a stand-alone database of terms that may have been derived from the WWW and/or other sources.
- the cloud-like communication network 20 is comprised of communication lines and switches connecting servers such as servers 25 , 27 , to gateways such as gateway 30 .
- the servers 25 , 27 and the gateway 30 provide the communication access to the WWW Internet.
- Users, such as remote Internet users are represented by a variety of computers such as computers 35 , 37 , 39 , and can query the host server 15 for the desired information.
- the host server 15 is connected to the network 20 via a communications link such as a telephone, cable, or satellite link.
- the servers 25 , 27 can be connected via high speed Internet network lines 44 , 46 to other computers and gateways.
- the servers 25 , 27 provide access to stored information such as hypertext or web documents indicated generally at 50 , 55 , and 60 .
- the hypertext documents 50 , 55 , 60 most likely include embedded hypertext link to other locally stored pages, and hypertext links 70 , 72 , 74 , 76 to other webs sites or documents 55 , 60 that are stored by various web servers such as the server 27 .
- FIG. 2 illustrates a high-level architecture showing the classifier 10 used in the context of an Internet environment.
- the classifier 10 resides between the user and the semi-structured documents available for search on the WWW 20 . Documents judged to fall into a given category by the classifier will be made available to the user for their perusal and possible use.
- a user uses a browser or a user interface (UI) 140 to enter a search query that is transmitted to a search service provider 100 .
- the search service provider 100 accesses the classifier 10 .
- the classifier automatically searches the semi-structured documents on the WWW 20 .
- the search results will be sent to the user via the search service provider 100 .
- the search results may include a list of URLs and associated brief abstracts describing the nature of the resources found.
- a document may be considered a collection of words or terms. From a classification standpoint, certain terms are considered to be significant and comprise by a vector that contains a component/dimension for each significant term. These are represented by bins W 1 through Wn in FIG. 3 . In this exemplary case, bin W 1 contains the number 12 , indicating that the term associated with bin W 1 appeared 12 times in the document. Similarly, the term associated with bin W 4 failed to appear in the document.
- the information available from the vector may be also represented by a histogram.
- the classifier searches the text of a document.
- the number in each bin indicates the number of occurrences of a particular word in that document.
- This vector because of its lack of structure, is indifferent to the meaning or context of the word. Reciting a previous example, the word “course” in the phases “golf course” and “of course” would not be segregated nor differentiated despite differences in meaning and context.
- the classifier 10 for semi-structured documents creates and relies on a structured vector model 200 that allows the classifier 10 to exploit structured information with text content embedded between the structural markups of XML documents.
- a hierarchical document is represented by a structured vector.
- the vector developed by the classifier 10 is divided into a tree of sub-vectors, labeled as 1 , 2 and 3 .
- the sub-vectors may be subdivided into a plurality of sub-sub-vectors, labeled 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 .
- Hierarchical levels continue downward until the leaves (childless elements) are reached.
- leaves correspond to pure text.
- the vector of the structured vector model 200 of the present invention includes the sub-vectors of the children elements.
- a sub-vector includes the sub-sub-vectors of its children elements.
- the classifier is able to take into account the term frequency and distribution at each hierarchical level and, thus, achieve a contextual sensitivity heretofore unavailable.
- the document 300 represented by the structured vector 200 of FIG. 4 may be alternatively represented by a vector using mathematical notation. Specifically, the document of FIG. 4 may be written as a compilation of all the sub-vectors:
- e d ( 0 , 0 ) ⁇ e d ( 1 , 0 ), e d ( 1 , 1 ), . . . , e d ( 1 , m d ( i )>,
- the path from the root to the node e d (i,j) is unique, as each node has only one parent node.
- p d (i,j) uniquely determines the location of the corresponding element's location in the document.
- each text term in the XML document can be computed by augmenting the tags of the structure elements it belongs to.
- the term “course” in the education element in the following XML document yields “resume.education.course”, and the one in the hobby element yields “resume.hobby.course”.
- Terms in the same element share the same path, whereas the same term in different elements have different paths. Thus, it is possible to consider two terms as having different meanings while they have similar spelling.
- FIG. 5 depicts the classifier 10 and the classification process based on the structured vector model 200 of the present invention.
- a document 300 is presented to the classifier 10 in order to determine its class.
- the structural and textual information in the document 300 is used to form the structure vector model 200 of the document.
- the classifier 10 is now able to characterize the term frequency and distribution of the document in question and compare it to that of the known classes of documents, labeled Class 1 through Class N, in FIG. 5 .
- the classifier 10 of the present invention extends beyond the uppermost level of the tree of FIG. 4 .
- the classifier 10 is able to gain added precision by continuing its analysis on the sub-vectors and sub-sub-vectors (and further sub-levels until it reaches the level that comprises only text terms) of the structured vector model 200 .
- the classifier 10 weights the significance of terms in the sub-vectors and sub-sub-vectors.
- FIG. 6 is a representation of the training and testing phases used by the classifier 10 .
- the classifier 10 In order for the classifier 10 to work optimally, it needs to be “trained” to recognize documents of a given class. As illustrated, the classifier 10 is given a large number of documents 350 . Some of these documents 352 have known class labels, and other documents 354 are without class labels. Those documents 352 with known class labels are fed into a training module 375 so that the classifier 10 learns the term frequency and distribution characteristics of the documents 352 of a given class.
- the documents 354 without class labels are entered in a testing module (also referred to herein as classification module) 385 which classifies the documents 354 .
- the classifier 10 attempts to classify the documents based on the data of the training documents. In particular, once the term frequency and distribution data for all levels of the vector are available and weightings have been assigned, the classifier 10 relies on a robust statistical model 200 to assign a class to the specific document 300 to be classified.
- the class 400 assigned is the one that maximizes the following a posteriori class probability Pr[c
- d,F k ]: Pr [ c ⁇ ⁇ d , F k ] ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( c ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ t ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ p d ⁇ ⁇ ( i , j ) , t ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ d ⁇ F k ⁇ ⁇ ( e d ⁇ ⁇ ( i , j ) ) ⁇ f ⁇ ⁇ ( c , p d ⁇ ⁇ ( i , j ) , t ) n ⁇ ( d , p d ⁇ ⁇ ( i , j ) , t ) ⁇ c ′ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( c ′ ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ t ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ p p ⁇
- FIG. 7 introduces the details of the training module 375 (FIG. 6) of the classifier 10 in the form of a flow chart.
- the training module 375 there are three elements: a vectorization sub-module 405 , a sorting sub-module 410 , and a modeling sub-module 415 .
- the flexibility of the training module 375 allows the relative locations of the sorting module 410 and the vectorization sub-module 405 to be interchanged. For illustration purpose, the vectorization sub-module 405 and its function will be described first.
- the training process begins by introducing a large number of documents 352 with known class labels into the classifier 10 .
- the classifier 10 For each document 352 , the classifier 10 creates a structured vector, in particular, extracting textual and structural information from the document 352 and constructing a directed graph containing the information. This process is known as vectorization.
- the classifier 10 calculates the frequency and distribution of terms.
- the sorting sub-module 410 sorts the documents 352 by classes, i.e., it classifies the documents 352 .
- the modeling sub-module 415 is invoked. This sub-module 415 is responsible for gathering the statistical information that will be used to classify documents 354 of unknown class. The statistics are calculated by combining all the documents of a given type together in a meaningful fashion. In particular, the modeling sub-module 415 combines the individual vectors in the class by adding them together and normalizing the result. Term frequencies may be normalized at any level from the uppermost (document level) to the lowest sub-vector.
- Modeling may be likened to summation.
- Each word in the highest-level vector, as in FIG. 4, is assigned a specific bin in a particular order corresponding to the order of the lexicon of the class.
- the lexicon thus, defines the order and kinds of words that are used to characterize a document 300 .
- From the vectors of all training documents 352 in a class the sum is calculated.
- the sum vector is then normalized by the number of documents 352 .
- the process is repeated until a statistical model 200 exists for each class of documents 352 . It is upon the basis of these statistical models 200 that classes 400 are assigned to documents 354 of previously undetermined classes.
- FIG. 8 provides a specific example of the operation of the vectorization sub-module 405 of FIG. 7 operating on a document 352 with an XML format.
- the vectorization sub-module 405 begins its function by parsing the document 352 to crate a parse tree of the document 352 .
- This parser can be an available semi-parser or an XML parser, such as “XML Parser for Java (http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com).” From the parsed tree, the vectorization sub-module 405 continues its function by creating a structured document vector shown in FIG. 8 .
- Sub-vectors are represented by Experience, Skills and Education. Each of these sub-vectors is underpinned by sub-sub-vectors (or grandchild vectors). As a specific example, Research Assistant and Industry Experience report to the sub-vector Experience. Sub-sub-vectors Technical and Other are children of the sub-vector Skills and grand-children of the vector Resume.
- the classifier 10 is now able to process the information contained in the structured vector. It begins by inspecting the terms in the document 352 . The first time a term is encountered at the sub or sub-sub-vector level the classifier 10 propagates the occurrence back to the parents of the term and all vectors in that path are updated. In particular, the count on the bin corresponding to that term is incremented. Counts are merged at the higher levels but at the lower levels the counts are separately maintained. The counts that are maintained on the lower levels are the keys to accurate and precise classification of semi-structured documents.
Abstract
Description
1. | Web documents are extremely diverse in content, structure, style |
and format, partly because of their diverse authorship. Many | |
of the techniques that have been developed are only effective on | |
documents with homogeneous corpora. | |
2. | A significant fraction of Web documents are hypertext documents, |
often divided into pages that are connected by hyperlinks. | |
Documents used for most existing Information Retrieval (IR) | |
studies are self-contained and cannot deal with the links. | |
3. | Most popular web document formats such as HTML or XML are |
semi-structured, implying either an explicit or implicit, | |
though not fixed, schema. Previous Information Retrieval (IR) | |
efforts have focused on flat (unstructured) documents. The | |
markups and formatting cues in the document can mislead the | |
classifiers; removing or ignoring them means that only part | |
of the original information is available for classification. | |
1. | Each element of an XML document is tagged. |
2. | The tags are usually nested, making the XML documents |
hierarchical in nature. | |
3. | Any element of an XML document can be referred to by |
any other element, thus requiring the documents to be | |
modeled as directed graphs. Under some circumstances, | |
a special case of a directed graph, a tree, can be used, | |
particularly for purposes of exposition. | |
1. | For each term, augment the term by the tags of the elements |
at various levels of the paths. | |
2. | Compute the F score of each augmented term. The F score |
measures the term's ability to separate classis as a ration | |
of inter-class to intra-class variation. | |
3. | Order the terms by decreasing order of F score and pick the |
first k terms from the sequence of terms from each structure | |
(i.e., the terms with same prefix after term augmentation). | |
K is a given threshold. | |
4. | Select document structure elements of which the average F |
value of terms is greater than the given threshold q. | |
5. | For classification of semi-structured documents, the class |
is chosen that has the most similar terms distribution to | |
the term distribution of the test document. The term | |
distribution is the distribution of augmented terms. | |
1. | It generates and uses a structure known as a structured |
vector model that contains sub-vectors corresponding to | |
the elements within the document. | |
2. | Unlike previous classifiers, a term is treated |
differently if it belongs to a different sub-vector. | |
Terms belonging to a different sub-vector are treated | |
differently, receiving different weightings. Thus, | |
it achieves a context sensitivity that leads to | |
significant improvements over text-based classifiers. | |
3. | It takes into account the term frequency and distribution |
within a document as a whole but also within the | |
sub-structures of the document. | |
4. | It is able to utilize information latent in document |
structures. | |
5. | It considers the document as a tree with a hierarchy |
of terms rather than a simple collection of terms. | |
6. | It uses a process known as tag augmentation to encode |
the tagging and nesting of elements in a semi-structured | |
document. It explicitly groups like structure elements | |
of terms together and, further, segregates dissimilar terms. | |
7. | It bases its final decision on the topics of the document |
on both the term frequency and term distribution | |
information and structure of the document as described above. | |
8. | It achieves the benefits enumerated for a structured model |
and the speed of a flat vector model by taking advantage of | |
the equivalence of tag augmentation and the structured vector | |
model. | |
9. | It incorporates context-sensitive term selection in its |
learning algorithm in the context of document structure. | |
Term selection is performed for each sub-structure of | |
document. That is, it differentiates between significant | |
terms and noise per structure basis instead of the entire | |
document. | |
10. | It relies on a well-defined, robust probability function |
to make a final determination the class of a document. | |
The classifier is the first to incorporate both textual | |
and structural features into the statistical model or | |
class determination. | |
