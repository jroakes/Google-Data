Definitions
- Computers have become widely adopted for various applications, for both personal and corporate uses. Some computers operate as stand-alone data processing equipment, with perhaps a peripheral such as a printer and a display device. Although useful for many purposes, additional features and benefits may be achieved if multiple computers are networked together to share information and resources.
- a computer network may be formed by connecting two or more computing devices with an information channel.
- One type of network is a local area network (LAN).
- LAN local area network
- a second type of network is a wide area network (WAN).
- WAN wide area network
- a prime example of a WAN is the Internet.
- WANs such as the Internet allow many computer devices to communicate messages and share information.
- LANs When multiple LANs are interoperable with one or more WANs, opportunities for computing devices to communicate and share information greatly expand.
- a web browser is typically configured to enable the user to access web sites on the Internet or the World Wide Web. Web browsers allow users to easily send and receive messages over a network in packets of information. Such packets of information may include the address of a search engine website, such as www.dogpile.com, for example.
- a data center may provide processing, storage, and support functions that improve performance or enhance the utility of the Internet.
- Data centers may also be deployed in other contexts. Financial institutions, for example, may employ one or more data centers to store financial account and transaction information.
- a data center may provide data processing and storage capacity.
- a data center may be connected to a network, and may receive and respond to various requests from the network to retrieve, process, or store data.
- data centers typically support high-speed data transfer and routing capabilities. To meet future network demands, data center capacity may continue to expand.

- a rack containing a modular array of rack-mountable processing units may be referred to as a server.
- Interconnecting multiple servers can form a data center.
- a data center can provide data processing and storage capacity. These functions can be distributed across the multiple servers. The distribution can be such that the computational requirements for a particular function can be distributed among multiple processing units located in multiple servers in an effort to distribute the computational load as well as the processing circuit loads among multiple servers within a data center. This can be referred to as load balancing.
- computational load on servers in a data center can be determined based on an amount of electrical power consumed by the server.
- the measured power consumption for the servers can be used to determine which servers are handling more processing, which in turn, can be used to shift processing tasks among the servers.
- One implementation for measuring a processing circuit load may include the measurement of the power dissipated across a resistor shunt in series with the output of a back-up battery for a server.
- the back-up battery can supply a DC voltage to the server's components when power output from a primary power source is intentionally or unintentionally interrupted.
- the voltage drop across the resistor shunt in series with the battery can be measured. Knowing the value of the resistor and the voltage drop across the resistor, the current through the resistor shunt can be determined. For example, using a derivative of Ohms law, the power dissipated across the resistor shunt can be determined which indicates the processing circuit load.
- the server's power can be switched back from the back-up battery to the primary power source.

- the measured power output by the battery can be used to determine the power output of the AC-DC Converter 170 .
- the power output by the battery 185 may approximate power output by a source or conduit of the AC mains input voltage (e.g. AC-DC converter) because the load is the same.
- the measured power outputs can be used to derive statistical information about the power output of a power source or the power consumption of an electrical load (such as the motherboard 120 ). For example, periodic connection of the battery circuit 180 to the motherboard 120 permits measurements of the power consumption of the motherboard 120 at various points in time, where the measurements can be used to determine the average as well as the maximum and minimum power consumption of the motherboard 120 over a time period.
- the exemplary data center 105 of FIG. 1 includes a number of racks 125 A, 1258 , 125 C that contain a number of the trays 110 .
- Each rack 125 may have an independent power usage value for each tray 110 in the rack. This value can be used to determine or control load balancing between trays 110 within or between racks.
- the circuitry on a motherboard for example, motherboard 120 , can be used to execute various software algorithms, which may be stored in the memory 165 . The execution of the algorithms can involve the use of varying degrees of processing power by the processor 160 . For example, a more complex algorithm can require more processing power resulting in increased power usage for the tray 110 , which includes the motherboard 120 .
- each tray 110 of a rack can be aggregated to provide a total power usage value for the rack.
- the total power usage values can be used, for example, to determine or control load balancing between racks.
- the power usage for each rack, 125 A, 125 B, and 125 C can be aggregated to provide the total amount of power being used by the data center 105 . In certain implementations, this value can be used to determine or control load balancing between data centers.

- the AC-to-DC converter 170 may regulate the DC voltage 172 to a static set point.
- the set point may be dynamically determined. In some of the static and dynamic implementations, the set point may be based on a characteristic of the battery 185 .
- the AC-to-DC converter 170 may maintain voltage regulation on the DC bus 175 when the AC input voltage signal is in a normal range.
- a normal range for a typical sinusoidal AC signal may be specified in various ways.
- one or more thresholds may be specified between about 80 V and 500 V for line frequencies that may be between about 40 Hz and 1000 Hz, such as around 50 Hz, 60 Hz, 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, 500 Hz, . . . , and up to about 1000 Hz or more.
- a fault may be identified if the AC peak input voltage falls below a first threshold of 90 V in any half cycle, or if the r.m.s.
- fault conditions may include, without limitation, blackouts, brownouts, voltage sags, surges, instabilities related to switchgear operation, or other electrical transient associated with the AC mains.
- a fault condition may cause or potentially cause improper operation of a processing unit in the DC load, for example, if the AC-to-DC converter 170 is unable to maintain adequate regulation of the voltage on the DC bus 175 , or to supply sufficient current to operate the DC loads serviced by the DC bus 175 .
- a detection circuit may send a signal indicative of this condition.
- the battery circuit 180 may be configured so that the motherboard 120 can continue to operate substantially without interruption.
- the battery 185 may continue to provide operating power to the circuits on the motherboard 115 until the battery 185 substantially discharges.
- the battery circuit 180 may include circuitry capable of controlling the charging or discharging the battery across the DC bus 175 in various operating modes. An example battery circuit is described in further detail with reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B .
- control circuitry may also disconnect the regulated DC voltage 172 from the DC bus 175 . This effectively connects battery power to the DC bus 175 . This may be performed when testing the power consumption of a connected electrical load (e.g., the motherboard 120 ).
- control circuitry includes a controller 195 that uses switch 190 to disconnect the DC voltage 172 from the DC bus 175 .
- the electrical load is then effectively connected to the battery 185 . This may be done based on a signal initiated by a timer set for a predetermined delay, which can be stored in memory 165 .
- the controller 195 can modify the predetermined delay if the controller receives a command to update the delay time from an external host (e.g. remote computer 150 ).
- the controller 195 can receive commands from an external host to disconnect the DC voltage 172 via switch 190 , which connects the electrical load to the battery 185 for power measurements.
- an operator using remote computer 150 may input a command that is transmitted to the control circuitry on the tray 110 .
- this command can be transmitted through a network to a tray, where it can be communicated to the control circuitry using a system management bus (SMBus) on the tray.
- SMBs system management bus
- the command can specify that the tray 110 in rack 125 A is to enter a battery backup mode, which includes the disconnection of the DC voltage 172 via switch 190 , effectively connecting the electrical load to the battery 185 .
- the command can also include instructions to perform a power measurement and to send the results of the measurement to the remote computer 150 using network 145 .
- the result of the power measurement can be stored in memory on the remote computer 150 .
- the measurement value can be used to manage the power usage of, for example, the tray 110 , the rack 125 A, or the data center 105 .
- the measurement value can be compared with a predetermined threshold level to determine if the power consumption of the tray 110 is nominal, below nominal, or excessive. If the power consumption of the tray is determined to be excessive, for example, the remote computer 150 may redistribute the processing load from that tray to another tray in the rack 125 A (or in another rack).
- the results of power measurements for several trays can be stored in memory on a single tray within the rack.
- a controller e.g., the controller 195
- the tray having the stored measurements can receive commands from an external host to send the measurements for the multiple trays to, for example, the remote computer 150 using network 145 .
- the remote computer 150 can use the results to manage the power usage of individual trays or the rack.
- the individual power measurements for each tray can be compared to a predetermined threshold level stored at the remote computer 150 to determine if the tray's power consumption is above or below a nominal level.
- the remote computer can then redistribute processing load from a tray, for example, that is operating at above the nominal level to a tray that is operating below the nominal level.
- a tray can initiate the distribution of processing load by transmitting a request to the remote computer 150 to redistribute the processing load among the trays.
- a controller e.g., controller 195
- a tray e.g., tray 110
- the controller 195 can compare the measurement values for that tray to one or more threshold values associated with the tray. If the measurement values indicate, for example, that the motherboard 120 is consuming excessive energy, the controller 195 can transmit a message to the remote controller requesting that some of the processing load currently being handled by the tray be offloaded to different trays.
- a tray can request that other trays accept excess processing load without relying on the remote computer 150 for redistribution of the processing load among the trays. For example, after comparing the measurement values to the threshold values, the controller 195 can transmit messages to different trays (within or outside of the rack that includes the tray) that request that the other trays accept processing requests currently being handled by the tray.
- the other trays can respond by accepting the entire request for processing or by accepting a portion of the processing load.
- a tray that receives a request to handle additional processing tasks can use its own stored power measurements to determine how many additional processing tasks it can accept before exceeding stored processing threshold values.
- a controller on a tray can disconnect the output of the AC/DC converter 170 from the DC bus 175 by sending a control signal to the switch 190 .
- this causes the switch 190 to transition from a closed position to an open position, which transitions the tray to run on battery power.
- the measurement of the processing circuit load can be performed by taking the measurement of the power dissipated across a resistor shunt that is in series with a battery bus which supplies the voltage provided by the battery 185 to the DC bus 175 .
- the controller 195 can send a command to open the switch 190 .
- the current through the resistor shunt can be determined using Ohms law if the value of the resistor and the voltage drop across the resistor are known. Once all or a part of the values are known, the power dissipated across the resistor shunt can be determined, which indicates the processing circuit load. Once the measurement is complete, the controller 195 can cause the switch 190 to close, which connects the DC voltage 172 back to the processing circuit.
- the use of the previously described implementations to measure the processing circuit load may avoid using additional power from the non-battery DC voltage source.
- the measurement of the processing circuit load can be performed by taking the measurement of the power dissipated across a resistor shunt that can be located in series with the output of the AC-DC converter 170 . Power may be continuously dissipated across the resistor shunt during normal operation of a tray, which may result in additional power costs being incurred by the data center 105 .
- An alternate implementation for measuring a processing circuit load may include the placement of a Hall Effect sensor in series with the output of the AC-to-DC converter 170 or the battery.
- the previously described implementations may have the advantage of providing periodic, or recurring, information about the state of the battery.
- the battery 185 can provide power to the DC bus 175 .
- circuitry can be implemented that determines the state of the battery by determining its voltage value, for example, as well as how much power it can provide to the processing circuit. These measurements can be performed along with the measurement of the processing circuit load.

- the alternative power supply 254 can include power supplied from an alternative AC power source (an AC power source different from the AC power source that supplies AC power to the primary power supply 252 ).
- the alternative power supply 254 can include an AC-DC converter and other circuitry to produce a single DC voltage for output 262 .
- the output 262 of the alternative power supply 254 can be connected to DC bus 264 .
- the alternative power supply 254 can have an output that is compatible with the output of the primary power supply 252 (e.g., both the alternative and primary power supply output 3.5 V DC). Once connected, the alternative power supply 254 can provide the power to the DC load 256 via the switch 258 .
- the output 260 of primary power supply 252 can be input to switch 258 , and the switch 258 can connect the output 260 of the primary power supply 252 to the DC bus 264 , which can deliver DC power to DC load 256 .
- switch 258 can disconnect the output 260 of primary power supply 252 from the DC bus 264 and connect the output 262 of the alternative power supply 254 so that the latter supplies the power for the DC load 256 on the DC bus 264 .
- Controller 270 can control switch 268 .
- the controller 270 can receive commands from an external source (not shown) to open or close the switch 268 , which effectively connects the output 260 or the output 262 to the DC bus 264 , respectively.

- Measurement circuitry 266 , resistor shunt 268 , and the controller 270 can be used to measure the power consumption of the DC load 256 by, for example, measuring the current on the DC bus 264 that connects the alternative power supply 254 to the DC load 256 .
- the measured power output by the alternative power supply 254 can be used to determine the power output of the primary power supply 252 . This determination can occur as the DC load 256 is the same load for both the alternative power supply 254 and the primary power supply 252 .
- these measurements can occur at various points in time when the power consumption of the DC load 256 may vary allowing for the collection of statistical information related to the power consumption of the DC load 256 .
- the statistical information may be used to manage system processing loads, as described with reference to FIG. 1 .
- the voltage drop across the resistor shunt 268 can be determined by measurement circuitry 266 . As was described with reference to FIG. 1 , using Ohms law, and knowing the value of the resistor shunt 268 , as well as the voltage drop across it, the current through the resistor shunt 268 can be calculated. Therefore, the power dissipated across the resistor shunt 268 can be determined, which indicates the processing circuit load. Details of how the measurements are made and how the values are calculated are described later in the document with reference to FIGS. 2B , 3 A and 3 B.
- the controller 270 may disconnect the primary power supply 252 from the DC bus 264 and connect the alternative power supply in the former's stead. This may be performed when testing the power consumption of the DC load 256 .
- the controller 270 can then control measurement circuitry 266 , which can perform the measurements needed to determine the power consumption of the DC load 256 . Once the measurement is performed, the controller 270 can receive a command to use switch 258 to reconnect the primary power supply 252 to the DC bus 264 .
- the measurements taken and the calculations performed by the measurement circuitry 266 will be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 2B .
- FIG. 2B shows an example schematic of a tray 110 in additional detail.

- the primary power supply 252 may include power supplied from electric utility 130 , as shown with reference to FIG. 1 , as AC voltage input to the AC-DC converter 170 on AC bus 225 .
- the UPS 115 includes a charge/discharge control circuit 205 in series connection with the battery 185 , which is also in series with resistor shunt 210 .
- a measurement circuit 215 is included on the UPS for measurement of voltage drops across the resistor shunt 210 . In certain implementations, this measurement can be used to determine the power used by electrical loads (e.g., DC loads 220 ).
- the exemplary UPS further includes the controller 195 in operative connection with a non-volatile memory (NVM) 230 .
- the controller 195 can control the measurement circuitry 215 based upon values contained in the NVM 230 .
- the measurement circuitry 215 can be integrated into the controller 195 , although it is shown separately in FIG.
- the series connected battery 185 , resistor shunt 210 , and charge/discharge control circuit 205 are connected to the DC bus 175 . Responsive to a signal to switch to battery power, the circuit 205 can operatively connect the battery 185 across the DC bus 175 to permit the battery to discharge to the DC load 220 through the resistive shunt 210 .
- the circuit 205 may selectively permit charging current to flow from the DC bus 175 to charge the battery 185 .
- switch 190 Responsive to a signal to measure the power used by DC load 220 , switch 190 is switched, for example, from a closed position to an open position. This disconnects the DC voltage from the AC-DC converter 170 to the DC bus 175 leaving the battery 185 connected to the DC bus 175 .
- the measurement circuit 215 measures a voltage drop value across resistor shunt 210 also in response to the signal. The voltage drop value can be returned to the controller 195 . The controller 195 may then generate a signal that closes switch 190 and reconnects the DC voltage to the DC bus.

- the signal to measure the power used by DC load 220 can be generated on a recurrent basis.
- the point in time when the signal is generated can be a predetermined value for example, that can be stored in the NVM 230 .
- the duration of the measurement can also be a value stored in NVM 230 .
- These values may be stored during manufacturing time, upon first use, or dynamically updated during operation of the tray 110 .
- the tray 110 may be set up to measure the power consumption of DC load 230 for 30 seconds every hour at a certain minute during the hour (i.e. 5 minutes past the hour).
- each tray in a rack can be set up to measure the power consumption of its DC load at a particular point in time that differs from the other trays in the rack.
- tray 1 can perform the power consumption measurement at five minutes past the hour
- tray 2 can perform the measurement at ten minutes past the hour
- staggering the measurements means only a predetermined number of trays are switched to battery voltage at one time. This can minimize down time that may occur if there are problems with a battery on a tray. For example, if a battery is not fully charged it may not supply sufficient voltage to the DC bus to operate the DC load on that tray. Therefore, the tray may not operate during the time that the battery is connected to the DC bus.

- the ideal switch 330 ( FIG. 3A ) for discharging the battery is implemented as a back-to-back MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) switch configured to block current in both directions when in a non-conductive state.
- the switch 330 opens and closes in response to a control signal 335 that may be generated, for example, by the controller 195 ( FIG. 2B ), for example.
- the switches 325 , 330 may include Schottky diodes, insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), or other semiconductor or electro-mechanical switches (e.g., relays).
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 400 for calculating the power consumption of the tray 110 .
- the method 400 starts by waiting for a command to switch from a primary source to an alternative source.
- the controller 195 can issue a command to the switch 190 to instruct the switch 190 to open and disconnect the DC voltage 172 from the DC bus 175 , in step 402 .
- a primary power source is switched out for a secondary, or alternative power source.

- the result can be used, along with other power consumption calculation results for other trays in a rack (e.g., tray 110 in rack 125 a ), to determine the total power consumption of a rack.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 500 for calculating the power consumption of trays in racks in a data center in a sequential order.
- the method 500 starts by setting the value of the current motherboard being measured, n, equal to one, in step 502 .
- This value is an indicator of which motherboard on which tray in which rack is to be measured.
- This number for example, can be an index into a table of motherboard serial numbers stored in memory on a particular tray in a specific rack in the data center 105 . This table can also be stored, in another example, in memory on the remote computer 150 .
- the amount of time between load power consumption measurements is set equal to a value, ⁇ t, in step 504 .
- ⁇ t the amount of time between motherboard power consumption measurements
- ⁇ t can be a value contained in the NVM 230 . This value can be read from the NVM 203 by controller 195 .
- a timer, t is set equal to the time between motherboard measurements, ⁇ t, in step 506 .
- motherboard power consumption measurements can be taken every 30 seconds (e.g., ⁇ t equal to 30 seconds). Therefore, ⁇ t can be equal to 30 seconds and the timer, t, will be set equal to 30 seconds.
- the time between motherboard power consumption measurements can be determined based on the duration of the measurement. For example, if it takes 15 seconds to perform a motherboard power consumption measurement, selecting ⁇ t equal to 30 seconds can assure that one motherboard power consumption measurement is performed at a time.
- the method 500 waits until the timer, t, expires, in step 508 .
- an alternative power source is switched in and used in a power consumption measurement for a load.
- the controller 195 can generate a command to switch 190 to command it to open, disconnecting the DC voltage 172 from the DC bus 175 for the motherboard selected.
- a load power consumption measurement is then performed, in step 512 , as was described with reference to FIG. 4 .
- a command is generated to switch back to the primary power source for load number “n.”
- the controller 195 can generate a command for the switch 190 to close. This will connect the DC voltage 172 back to the DC bus 175 .
- the identifier for the current load (e.g., a motherboard) being measured is incremented by one, in step 516 , indexing to the next load to be measured.
- this motherboard can be, for example, the next motherboard placed in the rack below the motherboard just measured.
- this motherboard can be any motherboard located in any rack in the data center.
- step 518 a check is made to determine if all loads (e.g., motherboards in the racks in the data center) have been measured for power consumption. If this is true, in step 518 , the methods 500 ends. If this is not the case, the method 500 continues from step 506 by setting the timer, t, equal to the time between motherboard measurements, ⁇ t. In some implementations, the method 500 does not end after step 518 , but is repeated indefinitely.
- loads e.g., motherboards in the racks in the data center
- the method 500 can be started at a predetermined time of day. This predetermined time can be a value stored in the NVM 230 and read by the controller 195 for use in controlling the measurement circuitry 215 .
- the method 500 can start at 12:00 am. Therefore, at 12:00 am, the controller can initiate method 500 to start a power consumption measurement process.
- Each tray in the racks of the data center can have a unique start measurement time stored in its NVM (e.g., NVM 230 ). The unique start time of method 500 for each tray may ensure that only one motherboard power consumption measurement will be taken at a time.
- multiple, but not all, trays in the data center are associated with substantially similar power measurement start times. Power measurements for all the trays in a data center can then be accomplished in a shorter period of time than possible when measuring the power of each tray individually.
- the method 500 can be started by a command received from the remote computer 150 , for example.
- a specific tray in a rack in the data center can be responsible for receiving this command and initiating the start of the method 500 .
- Each tray in the racks of the data center can also have a unique start time stored in its NVM (e.g., NVM 230 ) as in the previously described implementation.

- each tray in a rack can include a value (e.g., a serial number), which can be used to seed a random number generator.
- the random number generator can be used to generate a random delay parameter. This delay parameter can be used to set the time when a power consumption measurement can be taken for the motherboard included on that tray.
- a serial number for a tray or a component on the tray can seed a random delay generator included in the controller 195 , for example.
- the output of the random delay generator can be a time value used to specify when the controller 195 should switch to battery power.
- the controller 195 can command the switch 190 to disconnect the DC voltage 172 from the DC bus 175 . In this state, the battery 185 effectively provides voltage to the DC bus 175 .
- the power consumption of the DC load 220 can then be measured, as described with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the method 600 starts by determining the random delay parameter, in step 602 .
- a timer is set equal to this random time delay value in step 604 . If the timer has expired, in step 606 , the controller 195 generates a command to, for example, open the switch 190 .
- a command is generated that switches out a primary power source for an alternative power source. For example, when the switch 190 is opened, the DC voltage 172 is disconnected from the DC bus 175 . The battery 185 then effectively provides voltage to the DC bus 175 .
- a load power consumption measurement is taken, in step 610 , as was described with reference to FIG. 4 .
- a command is generated to switch back to the primary power source. For example, the controller 195 generates a command to the switch 190 to close. This connects the DC voltage 172 onto the DC bus 175 .
