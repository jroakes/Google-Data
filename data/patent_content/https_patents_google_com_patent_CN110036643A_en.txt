Fig. 2 is used according to the example of the live stream similarity detection module of the realization of the disclosure.System 200 is shown directly
Broadcast stream similarity detection module 140, detection media item 201 and reference medium item 202.System 200 may include and refer to Fig. 1 institute
The similar feature of system architecture 100 of description.It is noted that the feature of Fig. 1 may be used herein to help to describe Fig. 2.It can
It is sent with noticing that detection media item 201 and reference medium item 202 all can serve as the live streams of similar events.With reference to matchmaker
Body item 202 can be sent by the owner of media item.Detection media item 201 can be sent by the user other than the owner.
It is further noted that the initial lookup of detection media item 201 can be immediately performed, after receiving section to detect detection media
The similarity of item 201 and received reference medium item before or while detecting media item 201.Independent segment 203 can be executed
(P1-Pn) one or more a part searched as initial lookup.It is further noted that can be held after delay periods
Row one or more assisted lookup, with detection detection media item 201 and the received reference medium item after detecting media item 201
202 similarity.Each section 203 (P1-Pn) of one or more lookups can be executed as one or more assisted lookups
A part.
Detection media item 201 is shown as including section 203 (for example, P1 to Pn) (also referred to as " detection section ").Reference medium
Item 202 is shown as including section 204 (for example, R1 to Rn) (also referred to as " reference field ").It is noted that detection media item 201
Or reference medium item 202 may include any amount of section.Section can be a part of media item.In some implementations, Duan Ke
To include the continuous part of media item, stamp and ending time stamp at the beginning of having with other section of difference.In some realizations
In, section can be the non-overlap part of media item.For example, time shaft 205 is shown between 1 minute (min) since time " 0 "
Every.The section 203 of detection media item 201 each can be 1 minute long.P1 can have time started stamp (0:00 minutes) and terminate
Timestamp (1:00 minutes), P2 can have time started stamp (1:00 minutes) and ending time stamp (2:00 minutes), and P3 can be with
With time started stamp (2:00 minutes) and ending time stamp (3:00 minutes).It is noted that providing the section of 1 minute length is
For illustrative and not limiting purpose.In other implementations, section can be any length and can also change in length.It can
To notice in multiple realizations, section can keep relatively small, so that executing the computing cost searched also keeps very little.Phase
As, in some implementations, before taking remedial action, it is found that two or more detection sections are similar with corresponding reference field
(for example, rather than big section of only one).In some implementations, detection media item 201 and 202 phase of reference medium item are being determined
Like before, it is found that two or more detection sections are similar with corresponding reference field.
System 200 is also shown before reference medium item 202 by the received detection media item 201 of system 200.Some
In realization, received media item can also be used as live stream and be sent or be broadcast to user equipment before other media items, with
For being consumed before other media items.It is noted that each of detection media item 201 section is also in reference medium item 202
Be received before corresponding section (for example, two minutes reception P1 before rl, and two minutes reception P3 before R3).It can infuse
It anticipates and arrives, when the section of media item is uploaded to system 200, section can also be sent via system 200 as live stream, and from upper
It is sent from the time of biography section using insignificant delay as live stream.It is further noted that uploading conduct when an event occurs
The section for the media item that live stream uploads, and be therefore for example incorporated as live stream upload about 1 minute time interval is inscribed
Media item 1 minute section.It is noted that as described herein, live stream similarity detection module 140 can with by media item

As described above, the received detection media item before reference medium item 202 (for example, media item that the owner uploads)
201 (for example, media items that user uploads) can be in the challenge detected referring now to similarity.For example, when system 200 receives spy
When surveying the section P1 of media item 201, live stream similarity detection module 140 can execute initial lookup and receive in system 200
The lookup of section P1 is executed after section P1.Since reference medium item 202 reaches system 200 not yet, so live stream similarity is examined
May not be detected by surveying module 140 by similar with section P1 section, because not yet receiving the corresponding segment R1 of reference medium item 202 simultaneously
And it cannot detect similarity.
In some implementations, similarity detection module 140 may include fingerprint generator 210, delay cell 212, fingerprint
Similarity-rough set device 214, similarity score polymerizer 216, similarity threshold comparator 218 and remedial action unit 220.One
During kind is realized, before reference medium item 202, detection media item 201 is received by live stream similarity detection module 140.One
In a little realizations, detects media item 201 or reference medium item 202 is sent as the live stream of similar events.
In one implementation, fingerprint generator 210 is to detect particular segment (for example, the section P1) generation one of media item 201
Or multiple fingerprints.It is noted that fingerprint used herein may refer to one or more fingerprints, unless otherwise indicated.
In one implementation, once receiving the frame of enough detection media items 201 to constitute section (for example, detection media
201 1 minute section) and generated the correspondence fingerprint of this section, then live stream similarity detection module 140 can by via
The fingerprint for indicating section P1 (also referred to as " fingerprint P1 " or " detection fingerprint P1 ") is transmitted to the execution pair of fingerprint similarity-rough set device 214
Initial lookup is initiated in the lookup of section (for example, section P1).Fingerprint similarity-rough set device 214 receive fingerprint P1 and by fingerprint P1 with
One or more fingerprints of received one or more reference medium items are compared before or while the section P1 of detection media item 201
Compared with.It can be stored in data and store one or more reference fingerprints in 206.In this example, due to not yet receiving with reference to matchmaker
The corresponding segment R1 of body item 202, therefore live stream similarity detection module 140 may can not find reference similar with fingerprint P1 and refer to
Line.
In some implementations, fingerprint similarity-rough set device 214 can produce similarity value.Similarity value can be allocated to
It detects the section of media item and indicates particular probe section value whether similar with the reference field of any reference medium item.For example, similar
Angle value can be integer (being " 0 " for non-similar section for example, being " 1 " for similar section).In another example, similar
Angle value can reflect the time span for being found particular probe section similar with reference field.For example, can be by 1 minute similarity
Value, which is distributed to, is found 1 minute similar with reference field detection section.It in another example, can be by 2 minutes similarity values
It distributes to and is found 2 minutes similar with reference field detection sections, etc..Similarity value " 0 " can be distributed to and not find and join
Examine the similar detection section of section.In this example, similarity is not found for fingerprint P1, and similarity value " 0 " can be distributed.
There is provided above-mentioned similarity value is for the purpose illustrated and noted limit.Similarity value can be expressed in any number of ways.
It is noted that fingerprint generator can bypass delay cell in executing some realizations in initial lookup
212.It can be executed after the section (for example, section P1) that system 200 receives detection media item 201 with insignificant delay initial
It searches.It can be in subsequent assisted lookup (for example, to detect the received reference medium item 202 after detecting media item 201
Similarity) in realize delay cell 212.In multiple realizations, fingerprint generator 210 can also will refer to while initial lookup
Line is transmitted to delay cell 212, and delay cell 212 can be waited before executing one or more assisted lookups it is scheduled
Delay periods.
In one implementation, can by detect media item 201 fingerprint P1 and reference fingerprint comparison result (for example,
Similarity value) it is sent to similarity score polymerizer 216.Similarity score polymerizer 216 can be by the received similarity value of institute
The similarity value of the detection media item 201 of previous receipt is aggregated to generate the similarity score of detection media item 201.Similarity
Score value can be allocated to detection media item and indicate particular probe media item value whether similar with any reference medium item.?
In this example, current similarity value " 0 " is the first similarity value, and similarity value polymerize with similarity score it is similar to generate
It spends score value " 0+0=0 ".It is noted that similarity value can be polymerize in many ways, such as by weighting one or more phases
Like angle value or use other functions.In order to illustrate rather than limit, can be by the way that new similarity value be added to existing similarity
Score value polymerize similarity value.
In one implementation, live stream similarity detection module 140 can will with detection media item 201 it is associated similar
Degree score value is transmitted to similarity threshold comparator 218, by similarity score and the one or more that is for example defined by administrator
Similarity threshold is compared.It is greater than or equal to one or more similarity thresholds in response to similarity score, live stream is similar
Degree detection module 140 can pass it to remedial action unit 220 to initiate remedial action appropriate.In this example,
Similarity score " 0 " is no more than any similarity threshold, and does not take remedial action to detection media item 201.
In some implementations, it if not determining the similarity of the fingerprint of fingerprint P1 and any reference medium item, is broadcast live
Similarity detection module 140 can terminate initial lookup (for example, the lookup for not executing P2-Pn).In other implementations, if do not had
There is the similarity of the fingerprint of determining fingerprint P1 and any reference medium item, then live stream similarity detection module 140 can wait
Delay periods are to initiate the assisted lookup of fingerprint P1 (for example, being similar to the received reference after detecting media item 201 with detection
The detection media item 201 of media item 202).In other implementations, if live stream similarity detection module 140 determines fingerprint P1
Similarity between reference fingerprint, then live stream similarity detection module 140 can be continued to execute just by following manner
Begin to search: one or more extra segment P2 to Pn for detecting media item 201 execute similar operations as described above, with detection
Before the reference medium item 202 or simultaneously similarity of received reference medium item 202.In other implementations, if directly
The similarity between the determining fingerprint P1 of stream similarity detection module 140 and reference fingerprint is broadcast, then live stream similarity detects mould
Block 140 can continue initial lookup by following manner: as described above for one or more execution of the section P2 into Pn
Similar operations (for example, before terminating initial lookup, continue to execute at least some non-similar (or continuous non-similar) detection sections
Initial lookup).It is noted that searched and to detect fingerprint P1 similar or dissimilar to reference fingerprint in response to executing, it can
To execute a variety of response combinations.
In this example, reference medium item 202 is delayed by 2 minutes, and is executed just by using the section 203 of detection media
Begin search live stream similarity detection module 140 can not will detection media item 201 be detected as it is similar to reference medium item 202.
It is noted that before detecting media item 201 or simultaneously receiving in other examples of reference medium item 202, phase is broadcast live
Similarity of the operation detection of initial lookup described above between two media items can be used like degree detection module 140.
In some implementations, live stream similarity detection module 140 can execute one or more after delay periods
Assisted lookup.Delay periods can be system (for example, system 200) and receive the particular segment of media item and execute the lookup of particular segment
Between period.For example, 3 minutes delay periods can indicate to receive a section P1 (for example, on time shaft 205 in system 200
The 1st minute at) after, system 200 can execute section P1 after 3 minutes (for example, on time shaft 205 at the 4th minute)
Lookup.Similarly, 3 minutes delay periods can indicate to receive a section P2 (for example, on time shaft 205 in system 200
At 2nd minute) after, system 200 (for example, on time shaft 205 the 5th minute at) can execute section P2 after 3 minutes
