Definitions
- This disclosure relates to information retrieval.
- Content items e.g., advertisements
- the query can include one or more search terms
- the search engine can identify and rank the content items based on the search terms, e.g., keywords, in the query and on one or more parameters associated with the content item.
- a user that submitted the query cannot determine whether the advertisements that are displayed are actually relevant to the user's query. For example, the user may have performed the query to identify a phone to potentially purchase. While an advertisement related to the phone may be identified, the advertisement may not contain enough information for the user to decide if the phone is one that performs the functions the user is interested in using. Additional information, e.g., videos, can thus be presented with the advertisement. The presentation of such additional information, however, can degrade the user experience if the presentation of the additional information causes the advertising space to be cluttered and/or does not provide the user with the choice of receiving such additional information.
- a query including one or more keywords is received, and a content item relevant to the one or more keywords is identified.
- a video is selected from one or more videos associated with the content item. Display data and video selection data are provided to a device.
- a query including one or more keywords is received, and a content item relevant to the one or more keywords is identified, wherein the content item is associated with videos.
- Relevancy measures are calculated for the videos based on the one or more keywords, metadata associated with the videos, and quality scores associated with the videos, and a video is selected based on the relevancy measures.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online content delivery system.
- Fig. 2 is a block diagram of an example system that selects videos using relevancy measures and quality scores.
- Fig. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process for identifying advertisements and videos associated with the advertisements in response to a query.
- Fig. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process for calculating quality scores based on signals.
- Fig. 5 is a flow diagram of an example process for selecting a video from a group of one or more videos associated with the advertisement based on the one or more keywords.
- Fig. 6 is another flow diagram of an example process for selecting a video from a group of one or more videos associated with the advertisement based on the one or more keywords.
- Fig. 7 is another flow diagram of an example process for identifying advertisements and videos associated with the advertisements in response to a query.
- Fig. 8 is a flow diagram of an example process for calculating relevancy measures for the videos based on the one or more keywords.
- Fig. 9 is a schematic diagram of an example computer system that can be utilized to implement the systems and methods described herein.
- Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an example online content delivery (e.g., advertising) system 100.
- the system 100 provides sponsored content in response to, for example, a query.
- the sponsored content can be in the form of advertising or advertisements ("ads").
- advertisements advertising or advertisements
- the system is described with reference to providing advertisements, the system 100 can provide other forms of content, including other forms of sponsored content.
- a computer network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects the advertisers 102, an advertisement system 104, publishers 106, and users devices 108.
- the one or more advertisers 102 can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track advertisement ("ad") information in the advertisement system 104.
- the advertisements may be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, advertisements combining one of more of any of such components, etc.
- the advertisements may also include embedded information, such as links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more publishers 106 may submit requests for advertisements to the system 104.
- the system 104 responds by sending advertisements (e.g., when an associated publication is rendered) to the requesting publisher 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network- distributed content). As discussed above, while reference is made to advertisements, other content items can be provided by the system 104.
- advertisements e.g., when an associated publication is rendered
- the publisher's web properties e.g., websites and other network- distributed content.
- Other entities such as user devices 108 and the advertisers 102, can provide usage information to the system 104, such as, for example, whether a click-through related to an advertisement has occurred, whether a conversion has occurred, or whether some other defined event has occurred.
- usage information can be processed to measure performance metrics, such as click- through rates, conversion rates, etc.
- a click-through can occur, for example, when a user of a user device 108 selects or "clicks" on an advertisement.
- the click-through rate can be a performance metric that is obtained by dividing the number of users that clicked on the advertisement or a link associated with the advertisement by the number of times the advertisement was delivered. For example, if an advertisement is delivered 100 times, and three persons clicked on the advertisement, then the click-through rate for that advertisement is 3%.
- a click-through rate can also be associated with a video advertisement.
- a "conversion" occurs when a user, for example, consummates a transaction related to a previously served advertisement. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's Web page and consummates a purchase there before leaving that Web page. Alternatively, a conversion may be defined as a user being shown an advertisement, and making a purchase on the advertiser's Web page within a predetermined time (e.g., seven days).
- a conversion may be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Website, viewing at least a certain number of Web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Website or Web page, registering on a Website, dialing a telephone number, sending a product inquiry, etc.
- a conversion rate can be defined as the ratio of the number of conversions to the number of impressions of the advertisement (i.e., the number of times an advertisement is rendered) or the ratio of the number of conversions to the number of selections (or the number of some other earlier event).
- usage information and/or performance metrics can also be used.
- the usage information and/or performance metrics can, for example, be revenue related or non-revenue related.
- the performance metrics can be parsed according to time, e.g., the performance of a particular content item may be determined to be very high on weekends, moderate on weekday evenings, but very low on weekday mornings and afternoons.
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served.
- the system 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- One example of a publisher 106 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- the content server may submit a request for advertisements to an advertisement server in the system 104, or embed code in the rendered page for the user device 108 to execute and retrieve the ads.
- the advertisement request may include a number of advertisements desired.
- the advertisement request may also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a pointer to the content by way of a uniform resource locator ("URL"), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page or other content document
- URL uniform resource locator
- category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- the content server can combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104.
- a user device 108 executing a browser can combine the requested content with the advertisement.
- This combined content and advertisements can be sent/presented to the user that requested the content.
- the content server can transmit information about the advertisements back to the advertisement server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- a search service can receive queries for search results. In response, the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- An exemplary search service is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine," Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Patent No. 6,285,999..
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search service can submit a request for advertisements to the system 104.
- the request may include a number of advertisements desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the advertisements, etc. In some implementations, the number of desired advertisements will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for advertisements may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo- location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or "docIDs"), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval ("IR") scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104. This combined information can then be forwarded to the user devices 108 that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the advertisements, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and neutral search results.
- the search service can transmit information about the advertisement and when, where, and/or how the advertisement was to be rendered back to the system 104.
- the advertising system 104 can serve publishers 106 such as content servers and search services.
- the system 104 permits serving of advertisements targeted to content (e.g., documents) served by content servers or in response to search queries provided by users.
- a network may include an advertisement server serving targeted advertisements in response to requests from a search service with advertisement spots for sale.
- the advertisement system 104 may serve advertisements that include a video associated with the advertisements.
- the video associated with an advertisement may be displayed on the user device 108 when the associated advertisement is displayed.
- the advertisement can be associated with more than one video, and the video that is the most relevant to a query used to search for the advertisement as well as the most beneficial to the user, is shown to the user.
- the video can, for example, be selected based on a relevancy measure between the video and keywords used in the search query as well as a quality score associated with the video.
- Fig. 2 is a block diagram of an example system 200 that selectively displays a video with an advertisement.
- the video can be selected from a group of videos based on quality scores associated with the videos as well as relevancy measures between the keywords used in a search query and the metadata associated with the videos.
- the system 200 can, for example, be implemented in the advertisement system 104 utilizing one or more computing devices that include memory devices storing processing instructions and processing devices for executing the processing instructions.
- An example computing system is shown and described with reference to Fig. 9. Other implementations, however, can also be used.
- the system 200 can include an ad server 202 that serves advertisements 204 to a client device 206.
- the ad server 202 can serve advertisements provided by the advertisers 102 as part of, or in coordination with, the advertisement system 104.
- the advertisements may be served over the network 110 and displayed on a client device 206.
- Example client devices 206 e.g., user device 108, can include a laptop, home computer, PDA, cell phone, set top box, game console, portable electronic device, etc.
- the ad server 202 can serve videos 208, e.g., 208a or 208b, to the client device 206.
- the videos 208 may correspond to the advertisements 204 that are identified by the ad server 202 in response to a query.
- the advertisements 204 may be advertisements for potato peelers offered by one or more online merchants that sell potato peelers
- the videos 208 associated with the advertisements 204 may be videos on how to use the potato peelers to peel potatoes as well as videos related to using the potato peelers to peel apples.
- the advertisements 204 and the videos 208 may be stored in a data store 210 that stores information for advertisements that the ad server 202 can serve.
- the ad server 202 can provide the advertisement 204.
- the advertisement 204 may be an advertisement for a local home goods store.
- the advertisement 204 can be displayed on the client device 206 as the result of a search for potato peelers (e.g., using a search query "potato peeler") entered in the user's browser.
- the system 200 can also select a video from a group of one or more videos 208 associated with the advertisement 204 for display on the client device 206.
- the system 200 can select a video based on a relevancy measure, quality score, or some other measure of relevance or performance.
- the video 208 can be a video 208 that other users often played, as demonstrated by a high quality score associated with the video 208.
- the quality refers to a performance measure that can be based on user interactions.
- a quality can be a score as measured by CTR, conversion rate, length of play, etc.
- the quality score can, for example, be based on the length of the video watched and/or number of times the video was viewed.
- an ad server 202 can receive a query including one or more keywords 212 from a client device 206.
- the ad server 202 can identify an advertisement 204 based on the one or more keywords 212.
- the ad server 202 can, for example, identify the advertisement 204 by comparing the keywords 212 with all advertisements, or a list of keyword associated with the advertisements, to identify the most relevant advertisement 204.
- the system 200 can allow an advertiser to specify videos 208 related to the advertisement 204 of the advertiser that may be displayed with that advertiser's advertisements.
- the advertiser 102 can provide videos 208 to the system 200 to display with the advertisements 204.
- the videos 208 can, for example, be stored in a data store 210.
- a video still of one of the videos 208 associated with the advertisements 204 as specified by the advertiser 102 and/or a video element such as a plusbox can be displayed.
- the video is not displayed initially.
- the plusbox indicates a video is available.
- the system 200 can return the selected video 208 associated with the advertisement 204.
- the display can show the video still of the video 208 associated with the advertisement 204.
- the video element can include a video still image of the video 208 or a thumbnail image of the video.
- the ad server 202 can evaluate one or more signals associated with each of the videos 208.
- the signals can, for example, be associated with the user interactions in response to the video element or the video 208 once the video is displayed.
- the signals can be associated with actions taken by users when the video element or video 208 was previously shown to them. For example, whether the video element such as a video still of the video 208 was clicked on, or the video 208 was muted, played, etc., can be a signal.
- Each of the signals can be associated with signal scores.
- the signal scores can represent the weight of the signal in determining the quality scores. In some implementations, the scores can summed or processed in some cumulative manner.
- the following table is an example of the rates associated with each signal:
- each click on the video element can be used to calculate the click-through rate associated with the video 208.
- a click on the video element can, for example, be treated as a positive signal.
- Each click on the video element can, for example, be associated with a click score of "1.”
- a click rate can be defined as the ratio of the number of clicks to the number of impressions of the video (i.e., the number of times a video is rendered).
- the user can play the video 208 by either clicking on a video element associated with the video 208 or selecting a play button associated with the video 208. Playing a video 208 can, for example, be treated as a positive signal.
- the ad server 202 can determine the length of the video 208 played. The length of the video 208 can be proportional to the signal score. For example, a video 208 played in full can be associated with a score of "10.” If only half of the video 208 is played, the signal score is "5,” etc.
- a play rate can be defined as the ratio of the length of the video played to the number of impressions of the video.
- pausing or muting audio associated with the video 208 can be treated as negative signals.
- a pause can, for example, be associated with a score of "-1.”
- Muting a video 208 can, for example, also be associated with a signal score of "-1.”
- the pause rate can be defined as the ratio of the number of times the video 208 is paused to the number of impressions of the video.
- the mute rate can be defined as the ratio of the number of times the video 208 is muted to the number of impressions of the video.
- covering the video 208 with another browser window in the case where the video 208 is displayed in a browser can also be treated as a negative signal. For example, suppose a user selects a video 208 to play. Subsequently, while the video 208 is playing, the user moves another browser window on top of the video 208 so the video 208 is partially or completely hidden. Each time a video 208 is partially or entirely covered by another object, such as for example, another browser window, the video 208 is can be associated with a signal score of "-1."
- the block rate can be defined as the ratio of the number of times the video 208 is blocked to the number of impressions of the video.
- the video 208 is can be associated with a feature such as a checkout, where the user can purchase the item described in the video. Clicking on the checkout button can also be treated as a positive signal. Specifically, clicking on the checkout button can be associated with the conversion rate of the video 208. The conversion rate, can for example, be one of the signals. For example, each time a click on the video 208 leads to a conversion, the video 208 can be associated with positive signal score, e.g., "3.”
- the ad server 202 can evaluate the signals associated with the videos 208 and calculate a quality score for each of the videos 208.
- the quality score can be based on one or more of the signals. For example, the quality score can take into account whether a positive signal or a negative signal is associated with the video 208.
- the ad server 202 can use the quality score of the videos 208 as well as a relevancy score calculated for each of the videos 208 in determining which video 208 to display to the user.
- the relevancy measure can, for example, be based on the relevancy of the keywords 212 with the video 208.
- an advertiser can provide metadata associated with each of the videos 208.
- the metadata can describe the subject matter of the specific video 208. For example, if the video 208 is associated with potato peelers, the advertiser can provide as the metadata "potato, peeler, vegetable, cut," etc.
- the ad server 202 can calculate the relevancy measure by comparing the keywords 212 with the metadata associated with the videos 208. For example, the ad server 202 can compare the keywords 212 with the metadata provided by the advertiser associated with the video 208. The ad server 202 can determine the relevancy measure by determining, for example, how many of the keywords match the metadata associated with the video 208. For example, for each match between a keyword and metadata, the relevancy measure can be increased. Each match can be further scaled by a feature weight of the metadata, e.g., if the keyword matches metadata describing a business vertical to which the video relates, the match may be scaled by a first scaling factor.
- the match may be scaled by a first scaling factor, and the second scaling factor can be greater than the first scaling factor.
- scaling factors can be stored as feature vectors, and each keyword match can be stored in a relevancy vector. The overall relevancy of the video to the keyword(s) can be obtained by a dot product of the feature vector and the relevancy vector.
- the ad server 202 can calculate the relevancy measure by comparing the keywords 212 with audio associated with the video 208. For example, the ad server 202 can extract the audio associated with the videos 208 and then compare the audio with the keywords 212. The audio and the keywords 212 can be compared, and based on the comparison and how much of the audio matches the keywords 212, the ad server 202 can calculate the relevancy measure.
- the ad server 202 can select one of the videos 208 based on the quality scores and relevancy measures.
- the ad server 202 can calculate a final score by combining the quality scores and the relevancy measures. For example, the ad server 202 can use the formula Quality score * Relevancy measure to determine the Final Score and select the video 208 based on the highest Final Score.
- Advertisement 204 is associated with two videos.
- Video 1 is a video describing how to use the potato peeler to peel potatoes and is associated with the metadata "potato peeler peel.”
- Video 2 is a video describing how to use the potato peeler to peel apples and is associated with the metadata "peeler peel apple" as provided by the advertiser associated with the advertisement 204.
- the following table describes the signals associated with each video, as well as the rates of each signal.
- the ad server 202 can calculate the quality score of each video by adding each of the individual signal scores.
- the ad server 202 can also calculate the relevancy measure based on comparing the keywords "using potato peelers to peel potatoes" with the metadata of Video 1 "potato peeler peel,” and the metadata of Video 2 "peeler peel apple.”
- the ad server 202 can, for example, determine which video is associated with metadata that matches with a higher number of keywords.
- the ad server 202 can, for example, assign a value for each keyword that matches the metadata. For example, Video 1 's metadata matches the key words “potato,” “peeler,” and “peel.” Video 2's metadata matches the keywords “peeler” and “peel.” Therefore, Video 1 is associated with a relevancy measure of "3" because three of the keywords match the metadata associated with video 1.
- Video 2 is associated with the relevancy measure of "2" because two of the keywords match the metadata associated with Video 2.
- the ad server 202 can then calculate a final score by, for example, multiplying the quality score by the relevancy measure of each video 208. Therefore, the final scores can be calculated as follows:
- the ad server 202 can then select the video 208 with the highest final score as the video 208 to display with the advertisement.
- the ad server 202 can select Video 1 because Video 1 's final score of ".06" is higher than Video 2's final score of ".02."
- the video 208 can be associated with a "label" that describes the video element.
- a label is a selectable element that includes a textual description or some other indicator of an action associated with the selection of the label. For example, the label can recite "watch video.”
- the ad server 202 can associate different labels with the videos 208 and determine which label performs better.
- a video 208 with "watch video” as the label may get more clicks and more views than the same video 208 with "PLAY ME!” as the label.
- the ad server 202 can evaluate the performance of the labels associated with each video 208 and select the best performing label to show with the selected video 208.
- the video 208 can be associated with a thumbnail image.
- the thumbnail can be a selected still from the video 208.
- the thumbnail could be a different image that is related to the subject matter of the video 208.
- the video about the potato peelers can be associated with an image of an actual potato peeler.
- the ad server 202 can associate different thumbnail images with the videos and determine which thumbnail image performs the best. For example, the performance can be measured according to the click-through rate of the video 208. Therefore, if a video is clicked, the performance of the thumbnail image can increase.
- the ad server 202 can evaluate the performance of each of the thumbnail images associated with each video and select the best performing thumbnail to show with the selected video.
- a client device 206 can send a query including one or more keywords to ad server 202.
- the ad server 202 can use the keywords to find an advertisement from a data store 210.
- the ad server 202 can determine whether videos 208 are associated with the advertisement.
- the ad server 202 can compare the keywords with the metadata associated with the videos 208, for example, and calculate a relevancy measure between the keywords and each of the videos 208.
- the ad server 202 can then calculate a quality score for each of the videos 208 and select one of the videos based on the relevancy measure and the quality score.
- the ad server 202 can then send the advertisement and the video 208 to the client device 206.
- the client device 206 can display the advertisement and a video element associated with the video 208 to display the video.
- Fig. 3 is a flow diagram of an example 300 process for identifying advertisements and videos associated with the advertisements in response to a query.
- the process 300 can, for example, be implemented in a system such as the system 200 of Fig. 2.
- Stage 302 receives from a client device a query including one or more keywords.
- the query may be a search query, such as "potato peelers,” that the user enters on a browser on the client device 206 and which is transmitted over a network to the ad server 202.
- Stage 304 identifies an advertisement relevant to the one or more keywords.
- the ad server 202 can identify an advertisement relevant to the one or more keywords.
- the advertisement can, for example, be an advertisement for a local home goods store that sells potato peelers.
- Stage 306 selects a video from one or more videos associated with the advertisement.
- the selection can, for example, based on the one or more keywords.
- the ad server 202 can select a video from one or more videos associated with the advertisement, the selection based on the one or more keywords.
- the video can, for example, include a video on how to use a potato peeler that can be purchased at the home goods store.
- the ad server 202 can, in one implementation, generate display data for displaying the advertisement at the client device 206, and also generate video selection data for displaying the video proximate to the advertisement at the client device.
- the ad server 202 can generate video selection data for displaying the video of how to use the potato peeler proximate to the home goods store advertisement at the client device 206.
- Stage 308 provides the display data and the video selection data to the client device.
- the ad server 202 can provide the display data and the video selection data to the client device 206.
- Fig. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for calculating quality scores based on signals.
- the process 400 can, for example, be implemented in a system such as the system 200 of Fig. 2.
