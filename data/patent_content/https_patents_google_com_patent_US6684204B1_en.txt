Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to searching a network and particularly to searching a network which includes documents that have a plurality of tags.
- FIG. 1 represents a flowchart of how an Internet user performs a conventional web search.
- the Internet user accesses a web search engine, via step 10 .
- the Internet user enters a search term(s) into the web search engine, via step 12 .
- the web search engine then identifies the web pages that contain the search term(s), via step 14 .
- the web pages containing the search term(s) are listed by the search engine, via step 16 .
- FIG. 2 shows a typical web search results list.
- the search term(s) 20 appears on multiple web pages of the “www.pinemountainlake.com” 22 and “www.pmlr.com” 24 web sites. Even with enhanced bandwidth and greater network speeds, wading through hundreds of these “hits” to move to the next interesting web site is inefficient, cumbersome and annoying. An Internet user may actually lose patience after viewing dozens of pages of results with redundant information and terminate his search prematurely missing the relevant page buried deep down in the list.
- SGML Standard Generalized Markup Language
- XML extensible Markup Language
- HTML Hypertext Markup Language
- FIG. 3 shows a typical XML document.
- An XML document is a sequence of tags. Data along with the associated tag is referred to as an element. For example, a book has a title, an author, a publisher, and a price.
- FIG. 4 accordingly illustrates the tag structure associated with a book entitled “Presenting XML”.
- tag elements must match, e.g. each ⁇ ADDRESS> must have a matching ⁇ /ADDRESS>, and must nest properly.
- An XML Document that has matching and properly nested tags is called well-formed.
- the elements in XML loosely correspond to objects in object oriented or object-relational databases.
- a ⁇ PERSON> . . . ⁇ /PERSON> would correspond to an object of type class PERSON ⁇ . . . ⁇ .
- Nested XML elements correspond to an object's fields, e.g., ⁇ NAME>, ⁇ PHONE> and ⁇ ADDRESS> elements in ⁇ PERSON> would correspond to the name, phone, and address fields of a PERSON object.
- DTDs Document Type Definitions
- FIG. 5 shows a typical DTD schema. While DTDs are similar to schemas in object-oriented or object-relational databases, they are less restrictive and permit more variation in the data. For example, DTDs can specify that some fields are optional and that others may occur multiple times, and DTDs do not require that the type of a reference be specified.
- the present invention addresses such a need.
- a method and system for conducting a search on a network has a plurality of sites.
- One or more of the sites has a plurality of documents wherein at least one of the documents comprises a plurality of tags.
- the method and system comprises identifying at least one of the plurality of tags, receiving a query, parsing the query, and matching the parsed query with at least one of the plurality of tags of the at least one of the plurality of documents.
- FIG. 1 shows a flowchart of a conventional web search.
- FIG. 2 shows a typical web search results list.
- FIG. 3 shows a typical XML document.
- FIG. 4 illustrates the tag structure associated with a book entitled “Presenting XML”.
- FIG. 5 shows a typical DTD schema.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example of an overall environment in which the method and system in accordance with the present invention may be used.
- FIG. 7 is an illustration of the system in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 8 shows an example of a hash table index.
- FIG. 9 shows an example of a tree index.
- FIG. 10 is a flowchart of the operation in accordance with the present invention.
- FIG. 11 is a flowchart of how the present invention performs a context search.
- FIG. 12 is a flowchart of how the present invention performs a comparative search.
- the present invention provides a method and system for conducting a search on a network.
- the following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements.
- the present invention has been described in the context of being used with the Internet, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the present system can be used in conjunction with any type of networking system while remaining within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the generic principles herein may be applied to other embodiments. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example of an overall environment in which the method and system in accordance with the present invention may be used.
- This environment includes a network 50 , such as the Internet, that is connected to a plurality of computers 52 , each of the plurality of computers including a display device for displaying information.
- a plurality of information servers 54 that provide information to the network 50 .
- the present invention is disclosed in the context of a preferred embodiment.
- the preferred embodiment of the present invention provides for a search engine for extracting data from XML documents.
- context and comparative searches can be effectively accomplished in an XML document-oriented environment.
- the search engine in accordance with the present invention is provided to the computers 52 via the network 50 utilizing a universal programming language.
- a universal programming language is JAVA.
- JAVA is a programming language designed primarily for writing software on Internet Web Sites that are downloadable over the Internet to a consumer computer.
- a small application called an applet
- each discipline within the networking industry should preferably set up its own standardized DTD structure. From art to e-commerce to zoology, disciplines should preferably agree on the appropriate structures for their various documents. Already mathematicians, chemists, genealogists and real-estate brokers have set up standard formats for their documents.
- Metadata is information about information.
- Structural metadata refers to tags within the document. For example, an ⁇ author> tag tells us that the data within the tag will be an author's name. However, this might be the author of a book described in the document the author of a movie review, and so on. This metadata can also be searched, if the indexing application can recognize and store it correctly.
- the indexes should preferably store the entire hierarchy, so that a searcher can specify the right tag ever when the tag names are reused in a structure.
- a job-listing document might have a ⁇ location> tag for the company headquarters, a different ⁇ location> tag for the job site, and yet another ⁇ location> tag for the headhunter's office. Obviously, these are very different and should be searched separately.
- FIG. 7 is an illustration of the system in accordance with the present invention.
- the shaded areas of the FIGURE show the input, the output, and the data structures used in the search engine, while the non-shaded areas show software components of the system.
- Two main activities that the search engine carries out are query processing and indexing. Accordingly, the system comprises a query processing portion 102 , a query interpreter 106 , and an indexing portion 108 .
- the query processing portion 102 comprises an XML Query Language (XQL) Query 103 , an XQL parser 104 , and an XQL tree 105 .
- the XQL Query 103 is the string representation of the query entered by the user.
- the XQL parser 104 is used to convert a string representation of an XQL query into a XQL tree 105 data structure.
- the XQL tree 105 is the internal representation of XQL queries.
- the indexing portion 108 comprises a DTD file 109 , XML documents 110 , an XML4J parser 111 , parsed DTD 112 , DOM 113 , and indexer 114 , a hash table index 115 and a tree index 116 .
- the DTD file 109 is the file that contains the Document Type Definition.
- XML documents 110 represent one or more XML files.
- the XML4J parser 111 is used to obtain a DOM representation of an XML file 110 and parse the DTD file 109 .
- Parsed DTD 112 is the parsed form of DTD produced by the XML4J parser 111 .
- DOM 113 is the Document Model Object representation of the various XML files used by the search engine.
- the indexer 114 is used to create two indices for each XML file 110 , a hash-table index 115 and a tree index 116 .
- the hash-table index 115 and the tree index 116 are the two indices used to access DOM elements in a DOM representation of an XML document. Both the hash-table and the tree index have pointers to XML elements present in the DOM representation. These pointers can be used to quickly access the result elements that correspond to a user-entered XQL query.
- FIG. 8 shows an example of a hash table index 115
- FIG. 9 shows an example of a tree index 116 .
- the hash table index 115 contains the names of tags that occur in an XML document.
- the value of the hash-table index 115 contains an array of pointers. These pointers point to the DOM elements corresponding to the tag name in the hash-table index 115 .
- the tree index 116 as shown in FIG. 9, reflects the basic structure of the XML document and the Document Type Definition (DTD) associated with that XML document.
- DTD Document Type Definition
- the hash table index 115 doesn't maintain the context of the tag elements whereas the tree index 116 does maintain the context of the tag elements.
- the tree index 116 “recognizes” the different context of the two elements and indexes each of the two area code elements 150 , 160 accordingly.
- the query interpreter 106 takes the XQL tree 105 , the hash-table index 115 , the tree index 116 , and the DOM representation of XML files as input and produces results 107 in the form of XML fragments.
- the query interpreter 106 uses the tree index 116 to obtain desired DOM elements.
- the hash-table index 115 is used.
- the results 107 are the DOM elements that match the elements provided in the XQL query 103 .
- FIG. 10 is a flowchart of the operation in accordance with the present invention.
- the method begins by parsing at least one of a plurality of documents, via step 200 .
- these documents are XML documents that comprise a plurality of tags and this step involves the use of the XML4J parser that parses the XML document into a DOM 113 and parsed DTD 112 .
- the plurality of documents is indexed, via step 202 .
- Steps 200 and 202 are preferably done to identify the plurality of tags present in each XML document.
- a query is then received, via step 204 .
- the query comprises a standardized XML-Query Language.
- the query is parsed into a parse tree, via step 206 .
- the query is then matched with at least one of the plurality of tags of the at least one of the plurality of documents, via step 208 .
- This matching step preferably comprises the query interpreter matching the query 103 with the DOM elements 113 that conform to the path expression and the predicate expression given in the query 103 .
- the present invention facilitates context sensitive searches as well as comparative searches.
- Context sensitive searches focus on the context of a particular search string. For example, searching for “Albert Einstein” in a typical search engine will bring up colleges named after him, university lectures mentioning him, links to sites about him, solar folklore pages, pages of quotations, biographies of his colleagues, and so on.
- a web searcher can specify the context of the Albert Einstein search, i.e. the web searcher can specifically search for pages containing Albert Einstein as an author. The result of this context search will be pages that refer to Albert Einstein as an author.
- FIG. 11 is a flowchart of how the present invention performs a context search.
- the search engine parses and indexes the XML documents on the network, via step 300 .
- the query “Find all documents authored by Albert Einstein” is received, via step 302 .
- the query is then parsed into an XQL tree, via step 304 .
- the XQL tree is matched with all XML documents comprising an ⁇ author> tag associated with the term “Albert Einstein”, via step 306 .
- the subsequent result of this search is a listing of documents comprising information only related to Albert Einstein as an author.
- the present invention also facilitates comparative searches. Comparative searches a involve the comparison of information from different areas of the network. For example, if a web searcher wants to find the cheapest book titled “An Introduction to XML”. The search engine in accordance with the present invention will search the network for all ⁇ title> tags comprising “An Introduction to XML”. The search engine will then access the ⁇ price> tag for each of the associated ⁇ title> tags and list the prices of each of the books entitled “An Introduction to XML”.
- FIG. 12 is a flowchart of how the present invention performs a comparative search.
- the search engine parses and indexes the XML documents on the network, via step 400 .
- the query “Find all the lowest price of the book titled ‘An Introduction to XML’” is received, via step 402 .
- the query is then parsed into a XQL tree, via step 404 .
- the XQL tree is then matched with all the documents wherein the ⁇ title> tag is associated with the term “An Introduction to XML”, via step 406 .
- the ⁇ price> tag(s) associated with each ⁇ title> tag located in step 406 are compared and the lowest price is displayed, via step 408 .
- the extraction of information from networks comprising XML documents is done in a more precise fashion. Accordingly, once the XML format becomes more standardized, the present invention can be effectively utilized to improve web searches and get fewer and more relevant results.
