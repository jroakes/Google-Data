- a statement that a component can be “configured to” perform an operation can be understood to mean that the component requires no structural alterations, but merely needs to be placed into an operational state (e.g., be provided with electrical power, have an underlying operating system running, etc.) in order to perform the operation.
- an operational state e.g., be provided with electrical power, have an underlying operating system running, etc.
- An information retrieval platform can be an electronic system configured to receive, from a user, a request that represents one or more characteristics of an informational need of the user.
- the information retrieval platform can be configured to produce a web-based interface to be transmitted to a user device of the user to facilitate receipt of the request.
- the web-based interface can be presented on the user device and can include a text box into which the user can enter the request as a query.
- the information retrieval platform can be configured to provide a response to the query.
- the response can include one or more data objects, from a collection of data objects, relevant to the informational need.
- a data object can be a particular way of organizing data so that the data can be used efficiently.
- Determining that a data object is relevant to the informational need can involve interpreting a relationship between the data object and the informational need. Accordingly, the information retrieval platform typically can perform operations to measure a degree of the relationship, or the relevancy, between the data object and the informational need.
- the response can be presented on the web-based interface as graphical control elements (e.g., icons) associated with the one or more data objects. Frequently, the response can include a large number of data objects. (For example, the Word Wide Web has over 4.7 billion pages and Google PlayTM has over two million applications.) For at least this reason, the information retrieval platform usually can rank the data objects according to degrees of relevancy and can present the data objects according to their ranks.
- the information retrieval platform can be configured to generate a cluster of data objects.
- a cluster can be a set of data objects grouped in such a way that data objects in the same cluster are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to data objects in other clusters.
- the response to the query can be presented on the web-based interface as data objects organized into clusters.
- the information retrieval platform can be configured to operate in conjunction with a digital distribution platform so that the data objects are for applications.
- the web-based interface can be used as a home page for the digital distribution platform.
- the home page can include a predetermined set of applications organized into predetermined clusters.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an example of a user device 102 and an information retrieval platform 104 in which a web-based interface 106 is used as a home page for a digital distribution platform.
- the user device 102 can be configured to present the web-based interface 106 .
- the web-based interface 106 can include a text box 108 into which a user can enter a query.
- the information retrieval platform 104 can be configured to operate in conjunction with the digital distribution platform (not illustrated).
- the information retrieval platform 104 can be configured to generate a cluster of applications. For example, the information retrieval platform 104 can generate a “games” cluster 110 , a “movies” cluster 112 , a “music” cluster 114 , and a “books” cluster 116 .
- the “games” cluster 110 can include, for example, applications “a1” through “p1” each of which is related to games.
- the “movies” cluster 112 can include, for example, applications “a2” through “p2” each of which is related to movies.
- the “music” cluster 114 can include, for example, applications “a3” through “p3” each of which is related to music.
- the “books” cluster 116 can include, for example, applications “a4” through “p4” each of which is related to books.
- the web-based interface 106 can be used as the home page for the digital distribution platform.
- the home page can include a predetermined set of applications organized into predetermined clusters.
- the web-based interface 106 can present graphical control elements (e.g., icons) associated with some of the applications in the “games” cluster 110 , the “movies” cluster 112 , the “music” cluster 114 , and the “books” cluster 116 that were predetermined to be included in the home page.
- the information retrieval platform 104 can rank the applications, presented on the web-based interface 106 , according to pre-determined degrees of relevancy.
- the web-based interface 106 can present applications “b1”, “i1”, “f1”, and “m1” from the “games” cluster 110 , applications “j2”, “g2”, “c2”, and “e2” from the “movies” cluster 112 , applications “k3”, “d3”, “l3”, and “p3” from the “music” cluster 114 , and applications “h4”, “n4”, “a4”, and “o4” from the “books” cluster 116 .
- FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating an example of the user device 102 and the information retrieval platform 104 in which the web-based interface 106 is used to facilitate a query.
- the information retrieval platform 104 can be configured to provide a response to the query entered into the text box 108 of the web-based interface 106 .
- the response can include one or more applications relevant to an informational need represented by the query.
- the response can be presented on the web-based interface 106 as applications organized into clusters and ranked according to degrees of relevancy.
- the web-based interface 106 can present graphical control elements (e.g., icons) associated with some of the applications in the “games” cluster 110 , the “movies” cluster 112 , the “music” cluster 114 , and the “books” cluster 116 that were provided in response to the query.
- the information retrieval platform 104 can rank the applications, presented on the web-based interface 106 , according to pre-determined degrees of relevancy.
- the web-based interface 106 can present applications “c1”, “j1”, “g1”, and “m1” from the “games” cluster 110 , applications “k2”, “h2”, “c2”, and “f2” from the “movies” cluster 112 , applications “ 13 ”, “e3”, “m3”, and “p3” from the “music” cluster 114 , and applications “i4”, “o4”, “a4”, and “p4” from the “books” cluster 116 .
- the digital distribution platform can include a large number of applications (for example, Google PlayTM has over two million applications) and (2) only a limited number of applications can be presented on the web-based interface 106 , determining that an application is relevant to the informational need based strictly on a measure of a degree of relevancy can have an unintended consequence of producing a response that includes applications having a small degree of variety from one another.
- Such a response can fail to fully capture an intent of the user who entered the query. For example, if: (1) the user entered a query for “job search book” and (2) “What Color Is Your Parachute?” is the job search book with largest degree of relevancy, then a response in which (with reference to the web-based interface 106 illustrated in FIG.
- application “i4” is the 2016 edition of “What Color Is Your Parachute?”
- application “o4” is the 1998 edition of “What Color Is Your Parachute?”
- application “a4” is the 1984 edition of “What Color Is Your Parachute?”
- application “p4” is the 1970 edition of “What Color Is Your Parachute?”
- a query for “job search book” can indicate that the user is interested in the topic of “job search” and (2) the applications presented on the web-based interface 106 in response to the query (“e1”, “j1”, “g1”, “m1”, “k2”, “h2”, “c2”, “f2”, “l3”, “e3”, “m3”, “p3”, “i4”, “o4”, “a4”, and “p4” illustrated in FIG.
- the applications presented on the web-based interface 106 used as the home page for the digital distribution platform may be directed to topics that are very different from the topics that are of interest to the user.
- a personalized selection of applications can be produced, based on a history of one or more queries associated with a user account of a user, for presentation on a web-based interface.
- the disclosed production of the personalized selection of applications is rooted in information retrieval technology to overcome a problem specifically arising from: (1) producing a response to a query based strictly on a measure of a degree of relevancy between an application and an informational need represented by the query and (2) failing to include other techniques to determine topics that are of interest to the user.
- the disclosed production of the personalized selection of applications can present applications directed to topics that are of interest to the user, the disclosed production of the personalized selection of applications can preclude, in some instances, a need for the user to enter a query. Such preclusion of a need to enter a query can free bandwidth between the user device 102 and the information retrieval platform 104 to convey information other than the query and a response to the query.
- the disclosed production of the personalized selection of applications can be realized using a natural language process, a semantic-search process, a word embedding process, a formal concept analysis process, the like, or any combination thereof.
- a natural language process can refer to a technique to interact with a computer system using a natural human language.
- a semantic-search process can refer to a technique to improve an understanding of: (1) an intent of a user who enters a query, (2) a contextual meaning of a term as it appears in a searchable dataspace, (3) the like, or (4) any combination thereof.
- a word embedding process can refer to a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in which one or more words are mapped from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers in a low-dimensional space relative to a size of the vocabulary (i.e., a number of dimensions of the vectors can be less than a number of words included in the vocabulary).
- a number of dimensions of the vectors can be less than a number of words included in the vocabulary.
- Dimensions of the vector can represent various aspects of the particular one or more words.
- the aspects can include: (1) a number of occurrences of the particular one or more words in documents in a collection of documents, (2) other words and their displacements from the particular one or more words in a context of a phrase, (3) the like, or (4) any combination of the foregoing.
- a formal analysis concept process can refer to a technique for deriving a concept hierarchy or formal ontology from a collection of data objects and their properties.
- a concept in a hierarchy can represent a set of data objects that share same values for
- a first vector which can represent one or more first words from a first query associated with the user account of the user, can be produced through a word embedding process.
- the first query can be a free-form text query.
- a second vector can be obtained.
- the second vector can be retrieved from a knowledge base.
- the knowledge base can include the Knowledge Graph (developed and maintained by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.).

- a second query can be transmitted to a digital distribution platform in response to the first determination.
- the second query can include the one or more first words (from the first query) and the one or more second words (derived from the second vector).
- a response to a query with two sets of one or more words can be more likely to include applications having a large degree of variety from one another than a response to a query with only one set of the two sets of one or more words.
- a response to the second query can be received from the digital distribution platform.
- the response to the second query can include an identification of a first application available for distribution by the digital distribution platform.
- a second determination can be made of an existence of a relationship between the first application and a second application available for distribution by the digital distribution platform.
- the relationship can be based on: (1) an action performed on a user device associated with the user account and that involves the first application and the second application, (2) a same topic associated with the first application and the second application, (3) the like, or (4) any combination thereof.
- a cluster of applications can be generated in response to the second determination.
- the cluster of applications can include the first application and the second application. (A cluster with two applications can have a greater degree of variety than a cluster with only one of the two applications.)
- the personalized selection of applications can be produced, based on information about the cluster of applications, for presentation on the web-based interface for the user account associated with the first query.

- the first query can be a free-form text query.
- the first query can include one or more first words.
- the one or more first words can be “learn”, “about”, and “music”.
- a modified first query can be produced by the processor.
- the modified first query can be produced, for example, by: (1) changing a specific tense of a first specific word of the one or more first words (e.g., changing from “learning” to “learn”), (2) changing a specific grammatical number of a second specific word of the one or more first words (e.g., changing from “people” to “person”), (3) removing a stop word from the first query, (4) the like, or (5) any combination thereof.

FIG. 17 illustrates an example computing device suitable for implementing aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter. - As used herein, a statement that a component can be “configured to” perform an operation can be understood to mean that the component requires no structural alterations, but merely needs to be placed into an operational state (e.g., be provided with electrical power, have an underlying operating system running, etc.) in order to perform the operation.
- An information retrieval platform can be an electronic system configured to receive, from a user, a request that represents one or more characteristics of an informational need of the user. The information retrieval platform can be configured to produce a web-based interface to be transmitted to a user device of the user to facilitate receipt of the request. The web-based interface can be presented on the user device and can include a text box into which the user can enter the request as a query. The information retrieval platform can be configured to provide a response to the query. The response can include one or more data objects, from a collection of data objects, relevant to the informational need. A data object can be a particular way of organizing data so that the data can be used efficiently. Determining that a data object is relevant to the informational need can involve interpreting a relationship between the data object and the informational need. Accordingly, the information retrieval platform typically can perform operations to measure a degree of the relationship, or the relevancy, between the data object and the informational need. The response can be presented on the web-based interface as graphical control elements (e.g., icons) associated with the one or more data objects. Frequently, the response can include a large number of data objects. (For example, the Word Wide Web has over 4.7 billion pages and Google Play™ has over two million applications.) For at least this reason, the information retrieval platform usually can rank the data objects according to degrees of relevancy and can present the data objects according to their ranks.
- The information retrieval platform can be configured to generate a cluster of data objects. A cluster can be a set of data objects grouped in such a way that data objects in the same cluster are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to data objects in other clusters. The response to the query can be presented on the web-based interface as data objects organized into clusters. The information retrieval platform can be configured to operate in conjunction with a digital distribution platform so that the data objects are for applications. The web-based interface can be used as a home page for the digital distribution platform. The home page can include a predetermined set of applications organized into predetermined clusters.

FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an example of auser device 102 and aninformation retrieval platform 104 in which a web-basedinterface 106 is used as a home page for a digital distribution platform. Theuser device 102 can be configured to present the web-basedinterface 106. The web-basedinterface 106 can include atext box 108 into which a user can enter a query. Theinformation retrieval platform 104 can be configured to operate in conjunction with the digital distribution platform (not illustrated). Theinformation retrieval platform 104 can be configured to generate a cluster of applications. For example, theinformation retrieval platform 104 can generate a “games”cluster 110, a “movies”cluster 112, a “music”cluster 114, and a “books”cluster 116. The “games”cluster 110 can include, for example, applications “a1” through “p1” each of which is related to games. The “movies”cluster 112 can include, for example, applications “a2” through “p2” each of which is related to movies. The “music”cluster 114 can include, for example, applications “a3” through “p3” each of which is related to music. The “books”cluster 116 can include, for example, applications “a4” through “p4” each of which is related to books. - The web-based
interface 106 can be used as the home page for the digital distribution platform. The home page can include a predetermined set of applications organized into predetermined clusters. For example, the web-basedinterface 106 can present graphical control elements (e.g., icons) associated with some of the applications in the “games”cluster 110, the “movies”cluster 112, the “music”cluster 114, and the “books”cluster 116 that were predetermined to be included in the home page. Theinformation retrieval platform 104 can rank the applications, presented on the web-basedinterface 106, according to pre-determined degrees of relevancy. For example, the web-basedinterface 106 can present applications “b1”, “i1”, “f1”, and “m1” from the “games”cluster 110, applications “j2”, “g2”, “c2”, and “e2” from the “movies”cluster 112, applications “k3”, “d3”, “l3”, and “p3” from the “music”cluster 114, and applications “h4”, “n4”, “a4”, and “o4” from the “books”cluster 116. -
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating an example of theuser device 102 and theinformation retrieval platform 104 in which the web-basedinterface 106 is used to facilitate a query. Theinformation retrieval platform 104 can be configured to provide a response to the query entered into thetext box 108 of the web-basedinterface 106. The response can include one or more applications relevant to an informational need represented by the query. The response can be presented on the web-basedinterface 106 as applications organized into clusters and ranked according to degrees of relevancy. For example, the web-basedinterface 106 can present graphical control elements (e.g., icons) associated with some of the applications in the “games”cluster 110, the “movies”cluster 112, the “music”cluster 114, and the “books”cluster 116 that were provided in response to the query. Theinformation retrieval platform 104 can rank the applications, presented on the web-basedinterface 106, according to pre-determined degrees of relevancy. For example, the web-basedinterface 106 can present applications “c1”, “j1”, “g1”, and “m1” from the “games”cluster 110, applications “k2”, “h2”, “c2”, and “f2” from the “movies”cluster 112, applications “13”, “e3”, “m3”, and “p3” from the “music”cluster 114, and applications “i4”, “o4”, “a4”, and “p4” from the “books”cluster 116. - However, because: (1) the digital distribution platform can include a large number of applications (for example, Google Play™ has over two million applications) and (2) only a limited number of applications can be presented on the web-based
interface 106, determining that an application is relevant to the informational need based strictly on a measure of a degree of relevancy can have an unintended consequence of producing a response that includes applications having a small degree of variety from one another. Such a response can fail to fully capture an intent of the user who entered the query. For example, if: (1) the user entered a query for “job search book” and (2) “What Color Is Your Parachute?” is the job search book with largest degree of relevancy, then a response in which (with reference to the web-basedinterface 106 illustrated inFIG. 2 ) application “i4” is the 2016 edition of “What Color Is Your Parachute?”, application “o4” is the 1998 edition of “What Color Is Your Parachute?”, application “a4” is the 1984 edition of “What Color Is Your Parachute?”, and application “p4” is the 1970 edition of “What Color Is Your Parachute?” would likely fail to fully capture the intent of the user who entered the query to find a variety of books related to “job search”. Although this is an extreme example, it highlights the problem of producing a response to a query based strictly on a measure of a degree of relevancy between an application and an informational need represented by the query. - Additionally, because: (1) a query for “job search book” can indicate that the user is interested in the topic of “job search” and (2) the applications presented on the web-based interface 106 in response to the query (“e1”, “j1”, “g1”, “m1”, “k2”, “h2”, “c2”, “f2”, “l3”, “e3”, “m3”, “p3”, “i4”, “o4”, “a4”, and “p4” illustrated in
FIG. 2 ) can be substantially different from the applications presented on the web-based interface 106 used as the home page for the digital distribution platform (“b1”, “i1”, “f1”, “m1”, “j2”, “g2”, “c2”, “e2”, “k3”, “d3”, “l3”, “p3”, “h4”, “n4”, “a4”, and “o4” illustrated inFIG. 1 ), the applications presented on the web-based interface 106 used as the home page for the digital distribution platform may be directed to topics that are very different from the topics that are of interest to the user. - In contrast, according to the disclosed subject matter, a personalized selection of applications can be produced, based on a history of one or more queries associated with a user account of a user, for presentation on a web-based interface. The disclosed production of the personalized selection of applications is rooted in information retrieval technology to overcome a problem specifically arising from: (1) producing a response to a query based strictly on a measure of a degree of relevancy between an application and an informational need represented by the query and (2) failing to include other techniques to determine topics that are of interest to the user. Advantageously, because the disclosed production of the personalized selection of applications can present applications directed to topics that are of interest to the user, the disclosed production of the personalized selection of applications can preclude, in some instances, a need for the user to enter a query. Such preclusion of a need to enter a query can free bandwidth between the
user device 102 and theinformation retrieval platform 104 to convey information other than the query and a response to the query. - The disclosed production of the personalized selection of applications can be realized using a natural language process, a semantic-search process, a word embedding process, a formal concept analysis process, the like, or any combination thereof. A natural language process can refer to a technique to interact with a computer system using a natural human language. A semantic-search process can refer to a technique to improve an understanding of: (1) an intent of a user who enters a query, (2) a contextual meaning of a term as it appears in a searchable dataspace, (3) the like, or (4) any combination thereof. A word embedding process can refer to a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques in which one or more words are mapped from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers in a low-dimensional space relative to a size of the vocabulary (i.e., a number of dimensions of the vectors can be less than a number of words included in the vocabulary). (For example, the Oxford English Dictionary has a vocabulary of more than 200,000 words.) Dimensions of the vector can represent various aspects of the particular one or more words. For example, the aspects can include: (1) a number of occurrences of the particular one or more words in documents in a collection of documents, (2) other words and their displacements from the particular one or more words in a context of a phrase, (3) the like, or (4) any combination of the foregoing. A formal analysis concept process can refer to a technique for deriving a concept hierarchy or formal ontology from a collection of data objects and their properties. A concept in a hierarchy can represent a set of data objects that share same values for a specific set of the properties.
- According to the disclosed subject matter, a first vector, which can represent one or more first words from a first query associated with the user account of the user, can be produced through a word embedding process. The first query can be a free-form text query. A second vector can be obtained. For example, the second vector can be retrieved from a knowledge base. For example, the knowledge base can include the Knowledge Graph (developed and maintained by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.). The Knowledge Graph is a knowledge base used to enhance search results of a search engine with semantic-search information. A first determination can be made that a measure of similarity between the first vector and the second vector is greater than a threshold. The second vector can represent one or more second words. A second query can be transmitted to a digital distribution platform in response to the first determination. The second query can include the one or more first words (from the first query) and the one or more second words (derived from the second vector). (A response to a query with two sets of one or more words can be more likely to include applications having a large degree of variety from one another than a response to a query with only one set of the two sets of one or more words.) A response to the second query can be received from the digital distribution platform. The response to the second query can include an identification of a first application available for distribution by the digital distribution platform. A second determination can be made of an existence of a relationship between the first application and a second application available for distribution by the digital distribution platform. For example, the relationship can be based on: (1) an action performed on a user device associated with the user account and that involves the first application and the second application, (2) a same topic associated with the first application and the second application, (3) the like, or (4) any combination thereof. A cluster of applications can be generated in response to the second determination. The cluster of applications can include the first application and the second application. (A cluster with two applications can have a greater degree of variety than a cluster with only one of the two applications.) The personalized selection of applications can be produced, based on information about the cluster of applications, for presentation on the web-based interface for the user account associated with the first query.

information retrieval platform 104, thedigital distribution platform 302, and theapplication host platform 306 can be a computer-implemented platform configured to automatically perform some or all of the functions disclosed herein. Theinformation retrieval platform 104 can be, for example, a combination of hardware architecture, operating system, runtime libraries, and/or computer software or code object to support an information retrieval system. In an implementation, theinformation retrieval platform 104 can be configured specifically to support information retrieval operations. Thedigital distribution platform 302 can be, for example, a combination of hardware architecture, operating system, runtime libraries, and/or computer software or code object to support a digital distribution system. In an implementation, thedigital distribution platform 302 can be configured specifically to support digital distribution operations. Theapplication host platform 306 can be, for example, a combination of hardware architecture, operating system, runtime libraries, and/or computer software or code object to support an application host system. In an implementation, theapplication host platform 306 can be configured specifically to support application host operations. Alternatively, theinformation retrieval platform 104 and thedigital distribution platform 302 can be combined in aplatform 310. Alternatively, theinformation retrieval platform 104, thedigital distribution platform 302, and theknowledge base 304 can be combined in aplatform 312. - In general, the
user device 102 can be, for example, any suitable electronic client device, such as a smartphone, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a netbook, a tablet computer, a web portal, a digital video recorder, a video game console, an e-book reader, etc. Theuser device 102 can be associated with one or more users.

FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating examples of data objects for applications, of a collection of data objects 400, in an implementation of thedigital distribution platform 302. Each data object can be associated with a corresponding application. For example, each of the data objects can include a graphical representation A, web-interface position metadata B, and an attribute field G (e.g., keywords). The graphical representation A can be, for example, a picture (or another type of illustration) to be used for an icon (or another graphical control element) for the corresponding application on the web-basedinterface 106. The web-interface position metadata B can be used, for example, to determine a rank of the corresponding application associated with the data object and to determine a position of the icon (or the other graphical control element) on the web-basedinterface 106. The web-interface position metadata B can include, for example, a popularity field C, a revenue field D, an evaluation score field E, and a user activity field F. The popularity field C can include a value for a measure of a popularity of the corresponding application with respect to other applications available for distribution by thedigital distribution platform 302. The revenue field D can include a value for a measure of a number of sales of the corresponding application. This value can represent total sales of the corresponding application, sales of the corresponding application as a percentage of sales of a group of applications, or the like. The evaluation score field E can include a value that represents an aggregate score of evaluations of the corresponding application. These evaluations can be performed by users of the corresponding application, developers of applications, critics, the like, or any combination thereof. The user activity field F can include a value for a measure of activities involving the corresponding application. These activities can include downloads, opens, updates, deletions, the like, or any combination thereof.

FIGS. 6A and 6B are a flow diagram illustrating an example of amethod 600 for producing the personalized selection of applications for presentation on the web-based interface according to the disclosed subject matter. In themethod 600, at anoptional operation 602, a first query can be retrieved, by a processor, from a digital distribution platform. The processor can be, for example, a processor of an information retrieval platform (e.g., the information retrieval platform 104). The digital distribution platform can be, for example, thedigital distribution platform 302. For example, with reference toFIG. 5 and for descriptive purposes herein, the first query can be the query for “learn about music” from therecord 512. The first query can be a free-form text query. The first query can include one or more first words. For example, the one or more first words can be “learn”, “about”, and “music”. - Returning to
FIG. 6A , at anoptional operation 604, a modified first query can be produced by the processor. The modified first query can be produced, for example, by: (1) changing a specific tense of a first specific word of the one or more first words (e.g., changing from “learning” to “learn”), (2) changing a specific grammatical number of a second specific word of the one or more first words (e.g., changing from “people” to “person”), (3) removing a stop word from the first query, (4) the like, or (5) any combination thereof. The stop word can be a word that can be removed, in conjunction with a natural language process, from a first collection of words to produce a second collection of words. The stop word can be a common word in a language. For example, the stop word can be a short function word such as “the,” “is,” “at,” “which,” “on,” “about,” or the like. The stop word can be included, for example, on a stop list. A request for information, from an information retrieval system, that uses the second collection of words can provide a response with information that is more relevant to an intent of the request than a request for information that uses the first collection of words. For example, with reference toFIG. 5 and for descriptive purposes herein, the modified first query can be “learn music” in which the stop word “about” was removed from the first query. - Returning to
FIG. 6A , at anoptional operation 606, the processor can determine that a number of occurrences, in the digital distribution platform, of the modified first query is greater than a first threshold. For example, the first threshold can be one. For example, with reference toFIG. 5 and for descriptive purposes herein, the processor can determine that the modified first query, “learn music”, occurs two times in the digital distribution platform (e.g., first, in therecord 512 in which the stop word “about” was removed from the query “learn about music”, and second, in therecord 518 in which the tense of “learning” was changed to “learn” in the query “learning music”). The processor can determine that two is greater than one (e.g., the first threshold). In this manner, themethod 600 can determine that the modified first query “learn music” is a relatively popular modified query. - Returning to
FIG. 6A , at anoperation 608, a first vector can be produced, by the processor, through a word embedding process. The first vector can represent the one or more first words. The word embedding process can include, for example: (1) a neural network process, (2) a process to reduce dimensions of a word co-occurrence matrix, (2) a process that uses a probabilistic model, (4) a process to represent the one or more first words in terms of a context in which the one or more first words are used, (5) the like, or (6) any combination thereof. A dimension of the first vector can include, for example: (1) a number of occurrences of the one or more first words in documents in a collection of documents, (2) another word and a displacement of the other word from one of the one or more first words in a context of a phrase, (3) the like, or (4) any combination thereof. -
FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating an example of avector 700, produced through a word embedding process, in which dimensions can represent a number of occurrences of a particular word in documents in a collection of documents. Thevector 700 can be referred to as a document occurrence vector. For example, as illustrated inFIG. 7 for descriptive purposes herein, the particular word can be “learn”, the collection of documents can include twelve documents, and thevector 700 can have twelve dimensions. Each dimension of thevector 700 can be associated with a corresponding document. The value for a dimension of thevector 700 can be a number of occurrences of the particular word in the corresponding document. For example, in thevector 700, the value for each of dimensions “Doc3”, “Doc4”, “Doc5”, “Doc6”, “Doc8”, “Doc10”, and “Doc12” is zero; the value for each of dimensions “Doc1”, “Doc2”, “Doc9”, and “Doc11” is one; and the value for the dimension “Doc7” is seven. -
FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating an example of avector 800, produced through a word embedding process, in which dimensions can represent other words and their displacement from a particular word in a context of a phrase. Thevector 800 can be referred to as a word context vector. For example, as illustrated inFIG. 8 for descriptive purposes herein, the particular word can be “learn”, the phrase can be “it is fun to learn to play music”, and thevector 800 can have twelve dimensions. In the phrase “it is fun to learn to play music”, the word “it” can be displaced four words before the particular word “learn” (−4), the word “is” can be displaced three words before the particular word “learn” (−3), the word “fun” can be displaced two words before the particular word “learn”, the word “to” can be displaced both: (1) one word before the particular word “learn” (−1) and (2) one word after the particular word “learn” (+1), the word “play” can be displaced two words after the particular word “learn”, and the word “music” can be displaced three words after the particular word “learn”. - Therefore, in the
vector 800, the value for the dimension “fun, −2” can be one, the value for the dimension “fun, −1” can be zero, the value for the dimension “is, −3” can be one, the value for the dimension “it, −4” can be one, the value for the dimension “music, +2” can be zero, the value for the dimension “music, +3” can be one, the value for the dimension “play, +2” can be one, the value for the dimension “play, +3” can be zero, the value for the dimension “to, −2” can be zero, the value for the dimension “to, −1” can be one, the value for the dimension “to, +1” can be one, and the value for the dimension “to, +2” can be zero. -
FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating an example of avector 900, produced through a word embedding process, which can be an aggregate of vectors for words included in the one or more first words. For example, as illustrated inFIG. 9 for descriptive purposes herein, thevector 900 for “learn music” can be an aggregate of thevector 902 for “learn” and thevector 904 for “music”. The aggregate can be, for example, a dimension by dimension aggregation. The aggregate can be, for example, an average. For example, in thevector 900, the value of the first dimension can be 2, an average of 1 and 3; the value of the second dimension can be 0.5, an average of 1 and 0; the value of the third dimension can be 0.5, an average of 0 and 1; the value of the fourth dimension can be 0, an average of 0 and 0; the value of the fifth dimension can be 0, an average of 0 and 0; the value of the sixth dimension can be 0, an average of 0 and 0; the value of the seventh dimension can be 6, an average of 7 and 5; the value of the eighth dimension can be 0, an average of 0 and 0; the value of the ninth dimension can be 1, an average of 1 and 1; the value of the tenth dimension can be 0, an average of 0 and 0; the value of the eleventh dimension can be 1, an average of 1 and 1; and the value of the twelfth dimension can be 1, an average of 0 and 2. - One of skill in the art in light of the description herein understands other dimensions that can be used for the first vector besides the dimensions illustrated in
FIGS. 7 through 9 . - Returning to
FIG. 6A , at anoptional operation 610, the processor can retrieve, from a knowledge base, a second vector. The second vector can represent one or more second words. For example, the one or more second words can be “play”, “guitar”, or both. For example, a knowledge base can be a technology used to store complex structured and unstructured information used by a computer system. The knowledge base can include, for example, the Knowledge Graph (developed and maintained by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.). - At an
operation 612, a second query can be transmitted, from the processor to the digital distribution platform, in response to a first determination. The second query can include the one or more first words (from the first query) and the one or more second words (derived from the second vector). (A response to a query with two sets of one or more words can be more likely to include applications having a large degree of variety from one another than a response to a query with only one set of the two sets of one or more words.) For, example, the second query can include “learn” and “music” (from the first query) and “play” and “guitar” (derived from the second vector). - The first determination can be that a measure of similarity between the first vector and a second vector is greater than a second threshold. The measure of similarity can include, for example: (1) a cosine similarity between the first vector and the second vector, (2) a product of the first vector multiplied by a weight, (3) the like, or (4) any combination thereof. A value of the weight can be determined, for example, by: (1) a part of speech of one of the one or more the first words (e.g., noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, or interjection), (2) a number of occurrences of the first word in documents in a collection of documents, (3) the like, or (4) any combination thereof.
-
FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating an example of some documents in the collection of documents referenced in the description ofFIG. 7 . For example, as illustrated inFIG. 10 for descriptive purposes herein, “Doc1” can be a document that states “learn guitar music”, “Doc2” can be a document that states “learn plano music”, “Doc3” can be a document that states “play guitar songs”, and “Doc4” can be a document that states “play plano songs”. -
FIG. 11 is a diagram illustrating an example of a determination of similarity between document occurrence vectors. With reference toFIGS. 10 and 11 and for descriptive purposes herein, for the “learn” vector, the value for each of dimensions “Doc1” and “Doc2” is one, and the value for each of dimensions “Doc3” and “Doc4” is zero; for the “music” vector, the value for each of dimensions “Doc1” and “Doc2” is one, and the value for each of dimensions “Doc3” and “Doc4” is zero; for the “play” vector, the value for each of dimensions “Doc1” and “Doc2” is zero, and the value for each of dimensions “Doc3” and “Doc4” is one; and for the “songs” vector, the value for each of dimensions “Doc1” and “Doc2” is zero, and the value for each of dimensions “Doc3” and “Doc4” is one. From this, a determination can be made that the document “Doc1” (“learn guitar music”) can be similar to the document “Doc2” (“learn plano music”); and a determination can be made that the document “Doc3” (“play guitar songs”) can be similar to the document “Doc4” (“play plano songs”). -
FIG. 12 is a diagram illustrating an example of a determination of similarity between word context vectors. With reference toFIGS. 10 and 12 and for descriptive purposes herein, for the “learn” vector, the value for each of dimensions “guitar, −1”, “learn, −2”, “play, −2”, “plano, −1”, and “songs, +2” is zero, the value for each of dimensions “guitar, +1” and “plano, +1” is one, and the value for the dimension “music, +2” is two; for the “music” vector, the value for each of dimensions “guitar, +1”, “play, −2”, “plano, +1”, “music, +2”, and “songs, +2” is zero, the value for each of dimensions “guitar, −1” and “plano, −1” is one, and the value for the dimension “learn, −2” is two; for the “play” vector, the value for each of dimensions “guitar, −1”, “learn, −2”, “play, −2”, “plano, −1”, and “music, −2” is zero, the value for each of dimensions “guitar, +1” and “plano, +1” is one, and the value for the dimension “songs, +2” is two; and for the “songs” vector, the value for each of dimensions “guitar, +1”, “learn, −2”, “plano, +1”, “music, +2”, and “songs, +2” is zero, the value for each of dimensions “guitar, −1” and “plano, −1” is one, and the value for dimension “play, −2” is two. From this, a determination can be made that “learn” can be similar to “play”; and a determination can be made that “music” can be similar to “songs”. - One of skill in the art in light of the description herein understands other techniques that can be used to make a determination of similarity between vectors besides the techniques illustrated in
FIGS. 11 and 12 . - Returning to
FIG. 6A , at anoperation 614, a response to the second query can be received, from the digital distribution platform, by the processor. The response to the second query can include an identification of a first application. The first application can be available for distribution by the digital distribution platform. For example, the first application can be Learn Guitar Music. - At an
optional operation 616, information about a second application can be retrieved, by the processor, from the digital distribution platform. The second application can be available for distribution by the digital distribution platform. For example, the information about the second application can be used by the processor to perform theoperation 618 illustrated inFIG. 6B . - In
FIG. 6B , at theoperation 618, a cluster of applications can be generated by the processor in response to a second determination. The cluster of applications can include the first application and the second application. The second determination can be of an existence of a relationship between the first application and the second application. The existence of the relationship can include, for example: (1) an indication that the first application was opened on a user device, associated with a user account associated with the first query, at a first time, and the second application was opened on the user device at a second time; (2) an indication that the first application was installed on the user device at a third time, and the second application was installed on the user device at a fourth time; (3) an indication that the first application and the second application are related to a same topic; (4) the like; or (5) any combination thereof. Optionally, the first time can be different from the second time, and the first time and the second time can be within a first duration of time. Optionally, the third time can be different from the fourth time, and the third time and the fourth time can be within a second duration of time. - For example, with reference to
FIG. 5 and for descriptive purposes herein, if the first application is Learn Guitar Music and the first duration of time is fifteen minutes, then because: (1) the application Learn Guitar Music was opened on a user device associated with a user account for Darla at 14:59 on Sep. 22, 2016 (and assuming that the first query was entered by the user account for Darla), (2) the application Maps was opened on the user device at 15:06 on Sep. 22, 2016, and (3) the duration of time between 14:59 and 15:06 is less than fifteen minutes, a relationship can exist between the application Learn Guitar Music and the application Maps. Therefore, the application Maps can be included in the cluster of applications (for Darla) with the application Learn Guitar Music. - For example, with reference to
FIG. 5 and for descriptive purposes herein, if the first application is Learn Guitar Music and the second duration of time is one hour, then because: (1) the application Learn Guitar Music was installed on a user device associated with a user account for Brad at 10:31 on Sep. 22, 2016, (2) the application How to Make a Guitar was installed on the user device at 11:18 on Sep. 22, 2016, and (3) the duration of time between 14:59 and 11:18 is less than one hour, a relationship can exist between the application Learn Guitar Music and the application How to Make a Guitar. Therefore, the application How to Make a Guitar can be included in the cluster of applications (for Brad) with the application Learn Guitar Music. - For example, with reference to
FIG. 5 and for descriptive purposes herein, if the first application is Learn Guitar Music, then because the application Learn Guitar Music and the application Getting Started on the Guitar are related to a same topic, a relationship can exist between the application Learn Guitar Music and the application Getting Started on the Guitar. Therefore, the application Getting Started on the Guitar can be included in the cluster of applications for any user account in which the cluster of applications includes Learn Guitar Music. - For example, with reference to
FIG. 5 and for descriptive purposes herein, note that because: (1) the application Learn Guitar Music was opened on the user device associated with the user account for Darla at 14:59 on Sep. 22, 2016 (and assuming that the first query was entered by the user account for Darla), (2) the application Getting Started on the Guitar was opened on the user device at 15:24 on Sep. 22, 2016, and (3) the duration of time between 14:59 and 15:24 is greater than fifteen minutes, the relationship (for Darla) between the application Learn Guitar Music and the application Getting Started on the Guitar may not be based on a difference in time between when the two applications are opened. - Therefore, the cluster of applications for Darla can include the application Learn Guitar Music, the application Maps, and the application Getting Started on the Guitar; the cluster of applications for Brad can include the application Learn Guitar Music, the application How to Make a Guitar, and the application Getting Started on the Guitar.
- Returning to
FIG. 6B , at anoptional operation 620, information from data objects can be retrieved, by the processor, from the digital distribution platform. For example, the information from the data objects can be used by the processor to perform theoperation 622 illustrated inFIG. 6B . - At the
optional operation 622, a concept of data objects for applications available for distribution by the digital distribution platform (i.e., a concept) can be determined, by the processor, through a formal concept analysis process. The concept can include a set of data objects from a population of data objects. The set of data objects can be defined by a set of specific words included in an attribute field of each data object in the set of data objects. - For example, with reference to
FIG. 4 and for descriptive purposes herein, if the set of specific words included in the attribute field G (e.g., keywords) is the set of words “learn” and “music”, then the concept can include the data objects for the application Learning to Sing Music, the application Singing Made Easy, the application Basic Singing, the application Beginning Guitar, the application Learn Guitar Music, the application Getting Started on the Guitar, the application Beginning Instruments, and the application Accompanying Plano. - Optionally, the concept can include a merger of a first concept and a second concept. (For example, several concepts may be determined though performance of the
operation 622.) The merger can be produced by merging the first concept and the second concept.FIG. 13 is a flow diagram illustrating an example of amethod 622 for merging a first concept and a second concept according to the disclosed subject matter. In themethod 622, at anoperation 1302, a first quotient can be calculated. The first quotient can be a number of words included in a set of specific words included in an attribute field of each data object included in both the first concept and the second concept divided by a number of words included in a set of specific words included in the attribute field of the each data object included in the first concept. - For example, with reference to
FIG. 4 and for descriptive purposes herein, if: (1) the set of specific words included in the attribute field G (e.g., keywords) is the set of words “learn”, “music”, and “sing” (e.g., the first concept includes the data objects for the application Learning to Sing Music, the application Singing Made Easy, the application Basic Singing, and the application Accompanying Plano) (i.e., three words), (2) the set of specific words included in the attribute field G (e.g., keywords) is the set of words “learn”, “music”, “play”, and “guitar” (e.g., the second concept includes the data objects for the application the application Beginning Guitar, the application Learn Guitar Music, the application Getting Started on the Guitar, and the application Beginning Instruments), (3) the set of specific words included in the attribute field G (e.g., keywords) is the set of words “learn” and “music” (e.g., the words included in the set of specific words included in the attribute field G (e.g., keywords) of each data object included in both the first concept and the second concept) (i.e., two words), then the first quotient can be 2/3. - Returning to
FIG. 13 , at anoperation 1304, a second quotient can be calculated. The second quotient can be the number of words included in the set of specific words included in the attribute field of the each data object included in both the first concept and the second concept divided by a number of words included in a set of specific words included in the attribute field of the each data object included in the second concept. - For example, with reference to
FIG. 4 and for descriptive purposes herein, if: (1) the set of specific words included in the attribute field G (e.g., keywords) is the set of words “learn”, “music”, “play”, and “guitar” (e.g., the second concept includes the data objects for the application the application Beginning Guitar, the application Learn Guitar Music, the application Getting Started on the Guitar, and the application Beginning Instruments) (i.e., four words), (2) the set of specific words included in the attribute field G (e.g., keywords) is the set of words “learn”, “music”, and “sing” (e.g., the first concept includes the data objects for the application Learning to Sing Music, the application Singing Made Easy, the application Basic Singing, and the application Accompanying Plano), (3) the set of specific words included in the attribute field G (e.g., keywords) is the set of words “learn” and “music” (e.g., the words included in the set of specific words included in the attribute field G (e.g., keywords) of each data object included in both the first concept and the second concept) (i.e., two words), then the second quotient can be 2/4. - Returning to
FIG. 13 , at anoperation 1306, the merger can be produced in response to a third determination. The third determination can be that at least one of the first quotient or the second quotient is greater than or equal to a third threshold. For example, if the third threshold is 0.5, then each of the first quotient (2/3) and the second quotient (2/4) is greater than or equal to the third threshold (0.5). Therefore, the merger of the first concept and the second concept can be produced. - Returning to
FIG. 6B , at anoptional operation 624, the cluster of applications can be modified, by the processor and in response to a fourth determination, to include the applications associated with the data objects included in the concept. The fourth determination can be that a word, of the set of specific words, matches at least one of the one or more first words or the one or more second words. - For example, with reference to
FIG. 4 and for descriptive purposes herein, if: (1) the set of specific words included in the attribute field G (e.g., keywords) is the set of words “learn” and “music” and (2) the first word is “learn” and the second word is “play” (alternatively or additionally, if the other first word is “music” and the one or more second words is “sing” and “guitar”), then a word of the set of specific words matches at least one of the first word or the second word and the cluster of applications can be modified to include the applications associated with the data objects included in the concept. - Therefore, the cluster of applications for Darla can include the application Learn Guitar Music, the application Maps, the application Getting Started on the Guitar, the application Learning to Sing Music, the application Singing Made Easy, the application Basic Singing, the application Beginning Guitar, the application Beginning Instruments, and the application Accompanying Plano; the cluster of applications for Brad can include the application Learn Guitar Music, the application How to Make a Guitar, the application Getting Started on the Guitar, the application Learning to Sing Music, the application Singing Made Easy, the application Basic Singing, the application Beginning Guitar, the application Getting Started on the Guitar, the application Beginning Instruments, and the application Accompanying Plano.
- Returning to
FIG. 6B , at anoperation 626, the personalized selection of applications for presentation on the web-based interface for the user account associated with the first query can be produced by the processor based on information about the cluster of applications. -
FIG. 14 is a diagram illustrating an example of theuser device 102 and theinformation retrieval platform 104 in which the personalized selection ofapplications 1402 for presentation on the web-basedinterface 106 is produced according to the disclosed subject matter. Theinformation retrieval platform 104 can be configured to generate the cluster of applications. For example, theinformation retrieval platform 104 can generate the “games”cluster 110, the “movies”cluster 112, the “music”cluster 114, and the “books”cluster 116. The “games”cluster 110 can include, for example, the applications “a1” through “p1” each of which is related to games. The “movies”cluster 112 can include, for example, the applications “a2” through “p2” each of which is related to movies. The “music”cluster 114 can include, for example, the applications “a3” through “p3” each of which is related to music. The “books”cluster 116 can include, for example, the applications “a4” through “p4” each of which is related to books. - Additionally, the
information retrieval platform 104 can be configured to generate the cluster of applications for the user account associated with the first query. For example, theinformation retrieval platform 104 can generate the “Brad's interests” cluster 1402 (based on the first query having been entered by the user account associated with Brad) and the “Darla's interests” cluster 1404 (based on the first query having been entered by the used account associated with Darla). The “Brad's interests”cluster 1402 can include, for example, modified data objects associated with those applications, from the “games”cluster 110, the “movies”cluster 112, the “music”cluster 114, and the “books”cluster 116, determined to be related to the topics that are of interest to Brad. For example, the “Brad's interests”cluster 1402 can include a modified data object “j4”' (for the application Learn Guitar Music) from the “books”cluster 116, a modified data object “f4′” (for the application - How to Make a Guitar) from the “books”
cluster 116, a modified data object “n1”' (for the application Getting Started on the Guitar) from the “games”cluster 110, and a modified data object “f3”' (for the application Learning to Sing Music) from the “music”cluster 114. Likewise, the “Darla's interests” 1404 can include, for example, modified data objects associated with those applications, from the “games”cluster 110, the “movies”cluster 112, the “music”cluster 114, and the “books”cluster 116, determined to be related to the topics that are of interest to Darla. For example, the “Darla's interests”cluster 1404 can include a modified data object “j4″” (for the application Learn Guitar Music) from the “books”cluster 116, a modified data object “c4″” (for the application Maps) from the “books”cluster 116, a modified data object “n1″” (for the application Getting Started on the Guitar) from the “games”cluster 110, and a modified data object “12″” (for the application Singing Made Easy) from the “movies”cluster 112. - The
user device 102 illustrated inFIG. 14 can be associated with the user account for Brad. Theuser device 102 can be configured to present the personalized selection of applications 1406 (associated with the “Brad's interest” cluster 1402) on the web-basedinterface 106. Theinformation retrieval platform 104 can rank the applications, presented on the web-basedinterface 106, according to a combination of pre-determined degrees of relevancy and information about the topics that are of interest to Brad. For example, the web-basedinterface 106 can present the applications “k3”, “d3”, “l3”, and “p3” from the “music”cluster 114, the applications “j4”, “f4”, “n1”, and “f3” from the “Brad's interests”cluster 1402, the applications “b1”, “i1”, “f1”, and “m1” from the “games”cluster 110, and the applications “h4”, “n4”, “a4”, and “o4” from the “books”cluster 116. In an aspect, the personalized selection ofapplications 1406 can include a sufficient number of applications that the personalized selection ofapplications 1406 can occupy substantially all of an area of the web-basedinterface 106. In an aspect, themethod 600 can be performed in one or more iterations. - Because the applications presented on the web-based
interface 106 can include the personalized selection ofapplications 1406, the applications presented on the web-basedinterface 106 may be directed to topics of interest to Brad. Because the applications presented on the web-basedinterface 106 may be directed to topics of interest to Brad, the web-basedinterface 106 with the personalized selection ofapplications 1406 can preclude, in some instances, a need for Brad to enter a query. Such preclusion of a need to enter a query can free bandwidth between theuser device 102 and theinformation retrieval platform 104 to convey information other than the query and a response to the query. -
FIG. 15 is a diagram illustrating examples of records in an implementation of a personalized selection of applicationscross reference database 1500 of thedigital distribution platform 302 according to the disclosed subject matter. For example, each of the records can include afield 1502 for a user-specific data object, afield 1504 for a corresponding data object, afield 1506 for an identification of a user account related to the data object, and afield 1508 for user-specific metadata. The personalized selection of applicationscross reference database 1500 can include, for descriptive purposes herein, arecord 1510 for the data object “j4” related to the user account for Brad, arecord 1512 for the data object “f4” related to the user account for Brad, arecord 1514 for the data object “n1” related to the user account for Brad, arecord 1516 for the data object “f3” related to the user account for Brad, arecord 1518 for the data object “j4” related to the user account for Darla, arecord 1520 for the data object “c4” related to the user account for Darla, arecord 1522 for the data object “n1” related to the user account for Darla, and arecord 1524 for the data object “l2” related to the user account for Darla. For the user account for Brad, the application j4 can be a topic of frequent queries so that the application j4 can become a seed application of the “Brad's interests”cluster 1402, the applications f4 and n1 can be added to the “Brad's interests”cluster 1402 based on determinations of relationships with the application j4, and the application f3 can be added to the “Brad's interests”cluster 1402 as a result of a formal concept analysis process. Likewise, for the user account for Darla, the application j4 can be a topic of frequent queries so that the application j4 can become a seed application of the “Darla's interests”cluster 1404, the applications c4 and n1 can be added to the “Darla's interests”cluster 1404 based on determinations of relationships with the application j4, and the application l2 can be added to the “Darla's interests”cluster 1404 as a result of a formal concept analysis process. -
FIG. 16 is a block diagram illustrating an example of asystem 1600 for producing a personalized selection of applications for presentation on a web-based interface according to the disclosed subject matter. In an aspect, thesystem 1600 can be an information retrieval platform (e.g., the information retrieval platform 104). Thesystem 1600 can include, for example, aprocessor 1602,communications circuitry 1604, amemory 1606, and abus 1608. Thecommunications circuitry 1604 can be configured to provide communications between thesystem 1600 and devices external to thesystem 1600. Theprocessor 1602 can include any processing circuit operative to control an operation of thesystem 1600. Thecommunications circuitry 1604 can be configured to provide communications via a packet switched network, a cellular network, a satellite network, an optical network, a telephone link, the like, or any combination thereof. Thecommunications circuitry 1604 can be configured to provide communications in a wired or a wireless manner. Thecommunications circuitry 1604 can be configured to perform simultaneously several communications operations using different networks. Thememory 1606 can include one or more storage media. For example, thememory 1606 can include at least one of a hard-drive, a solid state drive, optical drive, floppy disk, flash memory, read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), cache memory, a Fibre Channel network, a storage area network (SAN), or any combination thereof. Thebus 1608 can be coupled to theprocessor 1602, thecommunications circuitry 1604, and thememory 1606, and can be configured to facilitate communications among these components. Other devices and components (not illustrated) can also be included in thesystem 1600. - The
processor 1602 can be configured to produce, through a word embedding process, a first vector. The first vector can represent one or more first words, the one or more first words can be from a first query. The first query can be a free-form text query. The word embedding process can include, for example: (1) a neural network process, (2) a process to reduce dimensions of a word co-occurrence matrix, (2) a process that uses a probabilistic model, (4) a process to represent the one or more first words in terms of a context in which the one or more first words are used, (5) the like, or (6) any combination thereof. A dimension of the first vector can include, for example: (1) a number of occurrences of the one or more first words in documents in a collection of documents, (2) another word and a displacement of the other word from one of the one or more first words in a context of a phrase, (3) the like, or (4) any combination thereof. - The
processor 1602 can be configured to determine that a measure of similarity between the first vector and a second vector is greater than a first threshold. The second vector can represent one or more second words. The measure of similarity can include, for example: (1) a cosine similarity between the first vector and the second vector, (2) a product of the first vector multiplied by a weight, (3) the like, or (4) any combination thereof. A value of the weight can be determined, for example, by: (1) a part of speech of one of the one or more the first words (e.g., noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, or interjection), (2) a number of occurrences of the first word in documents in a collection of documents, (3) the like, or (4) any combination thereof. - The
processor 1602 can be configured to determine an existence of a relationship between a first application and a second application. The first application and the second application can be available for distribution by thedigital distribution platform 302. - The
processor 1602 can be configured to generate, in response to a first determination, a cluster of applications, the cluster of applications including the first application and the second application. The first determination can be of the existence of the relationship. The existence of the relationship can include, for example: (1) an indication that the first application was opened on a user device, associated with a user account associated with the first query, at a first time, and the second application was opened on the user device at a second time; (2) an indication that the first application was installed on the user device at a third time, and the second application was installed on the user device at a fourth time; (3) an indication that the first application and the second application are related to a same topic; (4) the like; or (5) any combination thereof. Optionally, the first time can be different from the second time, and the first time and the second time can be within a first duration of time. Optionally, the third time can be different from the fourth time, and the third time and the fourth time can be within a second duration of time. - The
processor 1602 can be configured to produce, based on information about the cluster of applications, the personalized selection of applications for presentation on the web-based interface for a user account associated with the first query. - The
communications circuitry 1604 can be configured to transmit, to thedigital distribution platform 302 and in response to a second determination, a second query. The second query can include the one or more first words (from the first query) and the one or more second words (derived from the second vector). The second determination can be that the measure of similarity is greater than the first threshold. - The
communication circuitry 1604 can be configured to receive, from thedigital distribution platform 302, a response to the second query. The response to the second query can include an identification of the first application. - The
memory 1606 can be configured to store the one or more first words, the first vector, the first query, the one or more second words, the second vector, the second query, the measure of similarity, the first threshold, the response to the second query, and the information about the cluster of applications. - Optionally, the
processor 1602 can be further configured to retrieve the first query from thedigital distribution platform 302. - Optionally, the
processor 1602 can be further configured to produce a modified first query by: (1) changing a specific tense of a first specific word of the one or more first words, (2) changing a specific grammatical number of a second specific word of the one or more first words, (3) removing a stop word from the first query, (4) the like, or (5) any combination thereof. Optionally, theprocessor 1602 can be further configured to determine that a number of occurrences, in the digital distribution platform, of the modified first query is greater than a second threshold. - Optionally, the
processor 1602 can be further configured to retrieve the second vector from a knowledge base. For example, a knowledge base can be a technology used to store complex structured and unstructured information used by a computer system. The knowledge base can include, for example, the Knowledge Graph (developed and maintained by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.). - Optionally, the
processor 1602 can be further configured to retrieve information about the second application from thedigital distribution platform 302. - Optionally, the
processor 1602 can be further configured to determine, through a formal concept analysis process, a concept of data objects for applications available for distribution by the digital distribution platform. The concept can include a set of data objects from a population of data objects. The set of data objects can be defined by a set of specific words included in an attribute field of each data object in the set of data objects. - Optionally, the
processor 1602 can be further configured to retrieve, from thedigital distribution platform 302, information from the data objects. - Optionally, the concept can include a merger of a first concept and a second concept.
- For example, the
processor 1602 can be further configured to produce the merger by: (1) calculating a first quotient of a number of words included in a set of specific words included in an attribute field of each data object included in both the first concept and the second concept divided by a number of words included in a set of specific words included in the attribute field of the each data object included in the first concept, (2) calculating a second quotient of the number of words included in the set of specific words included in the attribute field of the each data object included in both the first concept and the second concept divided by a number of words included in a set of specific words included in the attribute field of the each data object included in the second concept, and (3) producing, in response to a third determination, the merger. The third determination can be that at least one of the first quotient or the second quotient is greater than or equal to a third threshold. - Optionally, the
processor 1602 can be further configured to modify, in response to a fourth determination, the cluster of applications to include the applications associated with the data objects included in the concept. The fourth determination can be that a word, of the set of specific words, matches at least one of the at least one first word or the at least one second word. - In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a system as disclosed herein.
- Aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in and used with a variety of component and network architectures.

Aspects also can be realized in the form of computer program code, for example, whether stored in a storage medium, loaded into and/or executed by a computer, or transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via electromagnetic radiation, such that when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing aspects of the disclosed subject matter. When implemented on a general-purpose microprocessor, the computer program code segments configure the microprocessor to create specific logic circuits.
- In some configurations, a set of computer-readable instructions stored on a computer-readable storage medium can be implemented by a general-purpose processor, which can transform the general-purpose processor or a device containing the general-purpose processor into a special-purpose device configured to implement or carry out the instructions. Aspects can be implemented using hardware that can include a processor, such as a general purpose microprocessor and/or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that embodies all or part of the techniques according to aspects of the disclosed subject matter in hardware and/or firmware. The processor can be coupled to memory, such as RAM, ROM, flash memory, a hard disk or any other device capable of storing electronic information. The memory can store instructions adapted to be executed by the processor to perform the techniques according to aspects of the disclosed subject matter.
- The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific aspects. However, the illustrative discussions above are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit aspects of the disclosed subject matter to the precise forms disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The aspects were chosen and described in order to explain the principles of aspects of the disclosed subject matter and their practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to utilize those aspects as well as various aspects with various modifications as may be suited to the particular use contemplated.
