Definitions
- This invention relates to the use of pseudo-inverses and truncated pseudo-inverses of linear transformations to create time progressions received by Multi-Carrier Modulation (MCM) receivers, in particular in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) receivers, including but not limited to, IEEE 802.11 compliant receivers and transceivers, as well as their use to determine availability of service for one or more MCM communications protocols.
- MCM Multi-Carrier Modulation
- OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex
- FIG. 1 depicts a prior art receiver of a Multi-Carrier Modulated (MCM) signal.
- MCM Multi-Carrier Modulated
- the MCM signal is sensed by antenna element 100 and fed 102 to module 110 .
- Module 110 contains a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) 114 and possibly some form of switch diagrammatically depicted as 116 which collectively feed 112 down converter 120 .
- LNA Low Noise Amplifier
- the transmitted frequency may use any of several frequency bands, 900 MHz, 2-2.5 GHz and 5-6 GHz, being commonly used transmission bands.
- Down converter 120 generates a down converted version of the sensed signal, which is fed 122 to Variable Gain Amplifier 124 , which generates an amplified, converter signal which is fed 126 to Band Pass Filter 130 .
- Band Pass Filter 130 removes undesirable noise components introduced by the down conversion and amplification, generating a filtered intermediate frequency signal 132 .
- the filtered intermediate frequency signal 132 is coherently split into two coherent intermediate frequency signals 134 and 136 .
- Intermediate frequency signal 134 is presented to mixer 160 and intermediate frequency signal 136 is presented to mixer 170 .
- Local Oscillator (LO) 140 generates a stable reference signal 142 which is split into two coherent reference signals 144 and 146 .
- Reference signal 144 is presented to mixer 160 .
- Reference signal 146 is presented to phase offset 150 , which generates a phase offset reference signal 152 which is presented to mixer 170 .
- Phase offset 150 imparts the equivalent of a phase shift of 90 degrees onto phase offset reference signal 152 with respect to reference signal 146 .
- Mixer 160 uses intermediate frequency signal 134 and reference signal 144 to create a first intermediate frequency component signal 162 in a frequency range compatible with A/D converter 190 .
- Mixer 170 uses intermediate frequency signal 136 and phase offset reference signal 152 to create a second intermediate frequency component signal 172 in a frequency range compatible with A/D converter 210 .
- Signals 162 and 172 may include undesirable frequency components requiring further filtering before presentation to A/D converters 190 and 210 , respectively, but these filters have not been shown in the interests of clarity.
- first and second intermediate frequency component signals 162 and 172 contain signals in a frequency range under 100 MHz, in many cases on the order of 1-20 MHz.
- the maximum frequency range is often known as the intermediate frequency and determines the band pass frequency range of band pass filter 130 .
- A/D converters 190 and 210 respectively generate first sample data stream 192 and second sample data stream 212 .
- the sampling rate is usually a multiple of the intermediate frequency, which by the Nyquist theorem is theoretically 2, and often in practice at least 2.5.
- the sampled data streams 192 and 212 also known as the I and Q sample streams, are sent to digital processor 250 . In many situations, they are merged, buffered 260 , then conveyed 262 across a communication network 270 , and delivered 272 to processing engine 280 .
- sample sizes of the A/D converters vary for specific applications, but may be any of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 or more bits per sample. These digitized samples are often packed into a computer format of 8, 16, or 32 bits.
- Processing engine 280 will often place these merged digitized samples into at least one sample input buffer 300 residing in memory 290 .
- Memory 290 is accessibly coupled 282 to processing engine 280 .
- processing engine 280 will often utilize a heuristic mechanism to determine whether the sampled channel sensed by antenna 100 , and processed by the above discussed mechanism is active, generating a Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) flag 310 .
- CCA Clear Channel Assessment
- A/D converters 190 and 210 usually sample their respective input signals at the same rate, in fact most often sampling those signals using a carefully constructed clocking scheme controlling clocking skew between them.
- One or more clocks may control the timing of processing engine 280 .
- One clock may be operating above 100 MHz, and perhaps operating at much higher rates, such as 240 MHz or higher.
- Processing engine 280 may transfer the merged data samples from temporary buffer 260 based upon the triggering of an interrupt, in some cases using a Direct Memory Access (DMA) mechanism (not shown).
- the DMA mechanism may operate across network 270 to transfer the digitized input samples to sample inputs 300 residing in memory 290 .
- memory 290 may include both volatile and non-volatile memory components.
- One or more program counters may control the operations of processing engine 280 .
- Processing engine 280 fetches one instruction for each of the program counters to control the operations of processing engine 280 . Note that a single program counter would be compatible with a Single Instruction processing engine, whereas multiple program counters would be compatible with a Multiple Instruction processing engine.
- processing engine 280 may be controlled by a collection of states, such as the one-hot state machines often found in FPGA-based designs.
- a program step will refer to at least an instruction or processor control state providing the controls necessary to execute one or more steps of the inventive method.
- a program system as used herein will refer to the collection of program steps implementing an embodiment of the inventive method.
- Inverse linear transform 340 approximates the inverse of a non-singular linear transform which was used to create a signal progression. That signal progression transports across the physical transport layer(s) of the communication protocol to create the transported version of the signal progression received as the sample list in buffer 260 and subsequently found in sample inputs 300 .
- MCM refers to the communication of a data stream by dividing that data stream into multiple parallel sub-streams, each having a lower bit rate, and then concurrently modulating these sub-streams with separate sub-carriers.
- the separate carriers may or may not be isolated from each other.
- Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) protocols including AMPS and GSM, use frequency bins separated by guard bands as the sub-carriers as in FIG. 2 A.
- FDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access
- AMPS and GSM use frequency bins separated by guard bands as the sub-carriers as in FIG. 2 A.
- Such MCM protocols require steep bandpass filters that completely separate the sub-carriers.
- Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing uses densely spaced sub-carriers and overlapping spectra as shown in FIG. 2B , eliminating the need for steep bandpass filters. OFDM sub-carriers are, by construction, mutually orthogonal within the protocol specified sampling window. In many cases, both the transmitter and receiver employ complementary Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transforms (IFFT) to transmit and receive the data sub-streams.
- FFT Fast Fourier Transforms
- IFFT Inverse Fast Fourier Transforms
- OFDM has been studied for use, in conjunction with Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum techniques, to create CDMA-OFDM protocols as shown in FIG. 2 C.
- the transmitter would first apply a Walsh-Hadamard transform to the multiple data sub-streams to create multiple spread data sub-streams.
- the multiple spread data sub-streams would then be transformed by an IFFT to create an intermediate frequency modulated signal, which is then up-converted to the transmission frequency band.
- the receiver would down convert 120 (and filter 130 ) the amplified antenna reception 112 to create a received intermediate frequency 132 as discussed in FIG. 1 above.
- This received intermediate frequency signal 132 would be split ( 143 and 136 ) and mixed ( 160 and 170 , respectively) with a local reference 144 and a phase offset version of the reference 152 , which would be sampled by A/D converters 190 and 210 , respectively.
- the output of A/D converters 190 and 210 are the I and Q sample streams as discussed above.
- OFDM protocol research has lead to the specification and deployment of communications protocols in a variety of application areas including, but not limited to, Digital Video Broadcast, Digital Audio Broadcast, and wireless data networks.
- H 1 [0] (1)
- H 2 ⁇ N [ H N H N H N H N _ ] ( 4 )
- the H matrices use an alphabet of two symbols, 0 and 1. In such an alphabet, the complement of 0 is 1 and the complement of 1 is 0.
- the over bar marks in formulae (2) to (4) refer to taking the component-wise complement of each element of the matrix involved under the bar.
- Formula (1) depicts the H 1 matrix, which is a 1 by 1 matrix.
- Formula (2) depicts H 2 , the 2 by 2 matrix generated as shown from H 1 .
- Formula (3) depicts H 4 , the 4 by 4 matrix generated as shown from H 2 .
- Formula (4) depicts H 2N the 2N by 2N matrix generated from H N , where N is a power of two.
- G 1 [ ⁇ 1] (5)
- G 2 ⁇ N [ G N G N G N G N _ ] ( 8 )
- G matrices use an equivalent alphabet of two symbols, ⁇ 1 and 1, for which the complement of ⁇ 1 is 1 and the complement of 1 is ⁇ 1.
- the over bar marks in formulae (6) to (8) refer to taking the component-wise complement of each element of the matrix involved under the bar.
- the IS-95 communications protocol defines 64 logical channels encoded by G 64 .
- the H matrices are often used for pedagogical purposes or as part of a process leading to the G matrices, providing a more accessible relationship with the standard definitions of bits.
- bit represents an alphabet possessing two symbols. Multiple bits are the concatenation of single bits, preferably representing a single alphabet.
- the prior art also includes Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coding, which is a powerful extension of the linear transform coding discussed to this point.
- DWT Discrete Wavelet Transform
- Formula (9) shows a matrix A with m rows and an unlimited number of columns.
- A is defined as a wavelet matrix of rank m if formulae (10) and (11) are satisfied by the components of A, a s k .
- These components usually belong to an algebraic sub-field of the complex numbers, such as rational complex numbers, real numbers, rational real numbers, or the complex numbers themselves. To simplify the discussion, the components of A will be assumed to be complex numbers.
- the over bar of formula (11) refers to taking the complex conjugate of the expression under that bar.
- a l [ a l * m 0 a l * m + 1 0 ⁇ a l * m + m - 1 0 a l * m 1 a l * m + 1 1 ⁇ a l * m + m - 1 1 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ a l * m + 1 m - 1 1 ⁇ a l * m + 1 m - 1 ⁇ a l * m + 1 m - 1 ⁇ a l * m + m - 1 m - 1 ] ( 12 )
- A (. . . A ⁇ 1 A 0 A 1 . . . ) (13)
- Formula (12) defines a sub-block matrix A I of matrix A containing the columns of A from I*m to I*m+m ⁇ 1.
- Formula (13) shows a second way of looking at A as an arbitrary long vector with entries A I .
- a I is the first non-zero component and A N2 is the last non-zero component.
- g N 2 ⁇ N 1 +1.
- Any DWT is equivalent to a matrix A, which has m rows and m*g columns, where m is called the rank and g is the genus of the transform.
- Each DWT transform is further characterized by an m*m characteristic Haar matrix which equals A(1). When g is one, the transform has a square matrix equal to its Haar characteristic matrix.
- the vector a 0 is often called the scaling vector, low pass filter, or scaling filter.
- the vectors a s for 0 ⁇ s ⁇ m are often called wavelet vectors, high-pass filters, or wavelet filters.
- Formula (10) states that the sum of the components of the scaling vector is m, whereas for each wavelet vector, the sum of components is zero.
- the rank m of a transform corresponds to the sampling rate and to the number of bands in an m-band filter bank implementation. If a filter has rank m, then it samples the signal m times per unit time. When m is infinite, the sampling is continuous and the filter is analog.
- the genus g of the transform represents the number of symbols or signaling intervals over which the filter operates.
- m*g equals the number of taps in each sub band filter. Note that if g is infinite, the filter has infinite duration and is not practicable.
- Increasing the rank of m corresponds to increasing the spectral resolution whereas increasing the genus of a transform corresponds to increasing the overlap of successive transform windows.
- Walsh-Hadamard matrices are a special case of Hadamard matrices.
- Hadamard matrices are square matrices of rank m containing components whose values are either +1 or ⁇ 1.
- a Hadamard matrix may be an n*n matrix of rank m, where m is less than n.
- Linear transforms are well known to have matrices associated with them. When the linear transform is non-singular, its matrix is non-singular, has non-zero determinant and possesses an inverse, which is also non-singular with non-zero determinant.
- a further problem occurs when a linear transform goes from an N dimensional space to an M dimensional space, where N and M are distinct. Again, there is a matrix associated with the transform, but the transform cannot be non-singular.
- R(A) will refer to the range of the linear transform for the associated matrix A and N(A) will refer to the null space of the linear transform for the associated matrix A.
- the addition of two vector spaces over the same field (which will usually be C, the complex numbers) is the vector space including exactly all linear combinations of the vectors of the two vector spaces. Note that much of this discussion is applicable to vector spaces over algebraic fields in general and in specific, almost always to algebraic sub-fields of the complex numbers including the rational real numbers, real numbers, and rational complex numbers, as well as the complex numbers. The discussion from hereon will focus on vector spaces over the complex number field for convenience and is not intended to restrict the scope of the claims herein.
- the conjugate transpose of a matrix A will be denoted herein as A* and will include components for a given row and column which are complex conjugates of the component of the column and row of A.
- a matrix G of n rows and m columns of n*m complex number components is called herein an (i,j,k)-inverse of A if G satisfies the ith, jth and kth Penrose conditions:
- This type of inverse is denoted (1)-inverse and is called the Equation Solving Inverse.
- Each (1,2)-inverse defines complementary subspaces for N(A) as well as R(A).
- P and Q are complementary to N(A) and R(A)
- This type of inverse will be called a prescribed range/null space inverse.
- Two vector subspaces of a vector space will be referred to as complementary if the only element they have in common is the origin, and if linear combinations of vectors from these two subspaces cover the whole vector space.
- This type of inverse will be called a least squares inverse.
- the norm of a vector b is formed as the square root of the product b and b*. Note that the product of b and b* is a non-negative real number.
- a ⁇ 1,2,3,4 ⁇ contains exactly one element, denoted as A + herein.
- a ⁇ is the (R(A*), N(A*))-inverse for A.
- a + is known elsewhere as the Moore-Penrose Inverse.
- the E matrix includes the positive eigenvalues of the matrix of the square roots of A*A.
- a + V*E + U*, can be shown to provide a well defined pseudo-inverse varying continuously with A regarding suitably chosen matrix norms (pages 247-262 of Campbell and Meyer, matrix norms are defined and discussed on pages 210-213). This definition is often taken as the standard for these reasons.
- the Drazin inverse and group inverse have at least these properties.
- Drazin inverse of a square matrix A associated with linear transformation A from C n to C n There are two ways to define the Drazin inverse of a square matrix A associated with linear transformation A from C n to C n .
- a 1 A restricted to R(A k ).
- x u+v belong to C n , where u belongs to R(A k ) and v belongs to N(A k ).
- a D is the Drazin inverse of linear transformation A. This definition is known as the Functional Definition of the Drazin inverse.
- a D is called the Group Inverse of A and is often denoted by A # .
- Modern radio receivers such as depicted in FIG. 1 often face situations where the active reception channels to be decoded are a subset of all the channels supported by the protocol. Note that these channels are the received version of signals transmitted after being linear transformed by any of a number of matrices. These transform matrices may or may not be square matrices. They may not be invertible, even if they are square matrices.
- FIG. 2D depicts an example emitted power spectrum requirement for transmitted OFDM signals as found in FIG. 120 of the IEEE 802.11a protocol specification.
- the transmitted spectrum shall have a 0 dBr (dB relative to the maximum spectral density of the signal) bandwidth not exceeding 18 MHz, ⁇ 20 dBr at 11 MHz frequency offset, ⁇ 28 dBr at 20 MHz frequency offset and ⁇ 40 dBr at 30 MHz frequency offset and above.
- the transmitted spectral density of the transmitted signal shall fall within the spectral mask, as shown in FIG. 120 .
- the measurements shall be made using a 100 kHz resolution bandwidth and a 30 kHz video bandwidth.” (17.3.9.2 Transmit spectrum mask page 28 of the IEEE Standard 802.11a-1999 document)
- What is needed is a method of specifying the use of DSP resources based upon inverses of these matrices, which may not necessarily be square matrices, and which may be singular matrices even when they are square matrices. What is further needed is a way to determine the type of inverse of these matrices, as well as calculate the matrix inverse type, most useful for the specific radio reception problem.
- IS-95 employs a physical transport layer made of either a single or pair of physical channels reusing the AMPs physical channels.
- An IS-95 physical channel takes up 41 contiguous AMPs physical channels.
- a single IS-95 physical channel is implemented, it is surrounded by a guard band of 9 AMPs physical channels on either side in the frequency domain.
- the pair of IS-95 physical channels are immediately adjacent to each other, with 9 AMPs physical channels on either side of the pair of IS-95 physical channels.
- Many communications protocols involve a collection of communication channels collectively forming the dimensions of a finite dimensional vector space, of which, at any point in time, only a subset of those channels or dimensions must be received.
- the encoding of messages onto these channels is a time progression in the actively used dimensions of the vector space.
- Examples of this include the OFDM protocol IEEE 802.11a, where there are always at least 12 of the 64 frequency bins unused in generating the time domain sequence which is transmitted.
- Another example is the GSM cellular telephone protocol, which uses a limited number of time slots and frequency bins to communicate necessary systems control and timing information to any transceiver in its service area for the initiation of a phone call in the service area of a base station.
- GSM cellular telephone protocol which uses a limited number of time slots and frequency bins to communicate necessary systems control and timing information to any transceiver in its service area for the initiation of a phone call in the service area of a base station.
- IS-95 reserves certain logical channels, which are dimensions in the Walsh-Hadamard matrix-derived vector space for similar communication of necessary systems control and timing information to user transceivers attempting phone call initiation in the service area of a base station.
- the invention utilizes a truncated version of the pseudo-inverse for the actively used portion of the transform to process received sample lists into at least one signal parameter.
- the actively used portion of the transform may not be all that the external transmitter is sending, but preferably is the actively used portion that the receiver wishes to receive.
- the inverse of the actively used portion of the transform is a pseudo-inverse, and the invention may employ distinct forms of pseudo-inverses even for the same communications protocol.
- the truncated version of the pseudo-inverse may generate a result including at least some of the active channels.
- the truncated version of the pseudo-inverse may also generate exactly the active, subspace results.
- the invention may use a truncated version of the actively used portion of the transform augmented by at least one signal which will be cancelled in the receiver to process received sample lists into at least one signal parameter.

- Certain preferred embodiments of the invention support the reception of OFDM signals compliant with the IEEE 802.11a standard by processing a received sample list using a truncated pseudo-inverse of the trimmed matrix associated with the 64 point FFT (and/or DFT). It is further preferable to use at least two truncated pseudo-inverses of the trimmed square matrix, i.e. rectangular matrix associated with a trimmed FFT and/or DFT, the first excludes 12 null channel-frequency bins and the second excludes 52 null channel-frequency bins. The first is used during the data portion of a transmission and the second is used during reception of a transmission header.
- NT can be pre-computed and stored.

- the CCA_flag is set to busy whenever the first energy estimate exceeds the second energy estimate multiplied by a threshold. Note that at least some of the minimal frequency bin samples may in effect integrate more than one of the frequency bins specified by the standard.

- the truncated pseudo-inverse contains a third truncated pseudo-inverse and a fourth truncated pseudo-inverse.
- the result of applying third and fourth truncated pseudo-inverses aids in determining whether there is service support for the first wireless protocol and second wireless protocol sharing the frequency window, respectively. This minimizes latency in determining which communications protocols are locally supported.

- the denominator is a normalizing quantity (that has the dimension of energy like the numerator).
- Frequency-domain signal “a” is transformed by the IFFT to produce time-domain signal x (TX)
- the constrained DFT matrix was generated as follows using Matlab: if M is the 64 ⁇ 52 DFT matrix obtained by truncating the full 64 ⁇ 64 matrix associated with IFFT and U is the 64-element column vector associated with the undesired interferer to be removed then the constrained DFT matrix to be used in the receiver is given by:
- the residual FOM is due to the presence of AWGN, whose contribution cannot be eliminated by either the constrained DFT or by the FFT.
- the constrained DFT cancels only those signals that are a linear combination of the vectors spanning the subspace U.
- FIG. 12 depicts simulation results comparing FFT to truncated DFT with a one vector constrained subspace processing sample lists for a 64-QAM modulation scheme such as IEEE 802.11a employs across a channel exhibiting AWGN with one known interferer.

- RMS Root Mean Square
- the horizontal axis represents the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in decibels (dB).
- the simulation results indicate that the immunity to AWGN deteriorates as the dimension of the constraining subspace increases. There is a tradeoff between immunity to AWGN and the number of interferers (or to be more precise the dimension of the constraining subspace U) that can be cancelled.
- the simulation results show a penalty of a low SNR the larger the dimension of the constraint subspace.
