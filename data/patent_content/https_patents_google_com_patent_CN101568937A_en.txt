Embodiment
Although present invention is described with reference to the illustrative embodiment that is used for application-specific, should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to this herein.Use other modifications, application and the embodiment in the scope of the invention and the present invention will have other neighborhoods of important use of those skilled in the art will recognize that of instruction provided herein.
Introduce
Embodiment described herein is with reference to the transaction between client and supplier.As described herein, the client can be enterprise, consumer or one group of enterprise and/or consumer.The supplier offers the client with product.Technician institute as relevant neighborhood is conspicuous, and product is not limited to physical goods.On the contrary, product also can comprise the combination of service or commodity and service.In addition, the supplier also can provide product stream.For example, the client can be the retailer, and the supplier can be the Internet advertisement server.In such embodiments, Advertisement Server can be puted up propaganda (promote) retailer's advertisement on continuous (for example, continuous and/or regular) basis.Among another example, the client can be the retailer, and the supplier can be broadcasting or video ads server.Among such embodiment, Advertisement Server can come delivering advertisements based on retailer's order.Alternatively or additionally, the supplier can provide the retailer to be sold to consumer's article.Usually, the supplier determines suitable charging arrangement, and the supplier provides product to present the bill by this charging arrangement to it, and finally receives the payment that it provides product.
In the different charge of describing is arranged, the definition cash pledge require and charge predictable as the client can with resource and the measurement of credit that the supplier provides be useful.The cash pledge that is used for the different charge arrangement requires to be meant before required product is offered the client fund that must deposit to the supplier.The predictability that the predictable supplier of being meant who charges presents the bill to the client is (from client's angle) how.
The increase that the cash pledge of arranging along with chargeing requires, before the income that realizes product, increasing customer resources is assigned to this product.On the contrary, along with the reduction that cash pledge requires, the supplier provides more credit, and the loss that is associated with the client that can not pay has increased.
Along with the predictable increase of chargeing, the client benefits from and can carry out better budget to the product that is provided.Yet the predictable of charging also causes the bigger risk of supplier, because there was not suitable control to limit the client before presenting the bill to the client, so the client may spend the expense that can bear above them.
Yet, should be noted that the supplier is interested on the availability that increases resource for the client.At first, Resource Availability may influence the decision-making that the client makes decision between the competition supplier.In addition, the Resource Availability of increase also may cause the increase of client to product demand, has produced additional income to the supplier thus.So in making decision between charge arranging, the supplier must weigh the potentiality of the income that increases with respect to the risk of bearing.
Among payment in advance charges arrangement, before the supplier begins required product is provided, require the client to deposit the fund of some.When the supplier sent required product, the quantity of client's cash pledge also reduced.When in case cash pledge uses up fully (or arriving other predetermined minimum value), the supplier client is presented the bill or notify the client its need payment.Before client's cash pledge turned back to predeterminated level, the supplier no longer began to provide required product.Fig. 1 illustrates Figure 100 of the account balance under payment in advance charges arrangement according to an embodiment of the invention.
Fig. 1 illustrates the time period 102,104 and 106, represents from T respectively
0To T
1, from T
1To T
2, and from T
2To T
3Time period.Waveform 110,112 and 114 is represented the account balance of client on time period 102,104 and 106 respectively.As defined here, account balance is meant that the client owes supplier's fund.So as shown in Figure 1, the client always has and is equal to or less than 0 account balance because payment in advance charge arrange among, the client is forced to deposit funds.
As shown in Figure 1, the client is in time T
0Has account balance 108.The cash pledge of account balance 108 representatives can be before the supplier begins to provide needed product stream, the minimum cash pledge of requirement.Shown in waveform 110, (be time T at the last of time period 102
1), client's cash pledge uses up fully, and the supplier presents the bill to the client, makes account balance reach remaining sum 108 once more.As shown in Figure 1, such processing generally repeats on time period 104 and 106.
Still as shown in Figure 1, there is a great difference the time period 102,104 and 106.So the client can not predict when the supplier presents the bill to it.In addition, the client also must have cash pledge at the supplier place before receiving product stream.So prepaid system is the system that the restriction customer goes up available resources.In addition, because before any product is provided, must be to supplier's deposit funds, so in prepaid system, the supplier does not provide credit, and the client must bear the burden of the availability of funds of minimizing.
Among limited credit or back payment charging arrangement, in case client's account balance (being the number that the client owes the supplier) reaches or near (within preset range) credit line, then the supplier just presents the bill to this client.This credit line can remain unchanged or change in time.
Fig. 2 illustrates Figure 200 of the account balance under back payment charging or limited credit charging arrangement according to an embodiment of the invention.Fig. 2 illustrates time period 204 and 206, represents from T respectively
0To T
1And from T
1To T
3Time period.Among arrangement is chargeed in the back payment,, just the client is presented the bill in case the customer account remaining sum reaches credit line.Relative with payment in advance charging arrangement described above is that the account balance in arrangement is chargeed in the back payment is always more than or equal to 0.Fig. 2 also illustrates credit line 202 and account balance 210,212 and 214.As shown in Figure 2, credit line 202 becomes remaining sum 212, also Zhongdao remaining sum 214 from remaining sum 210 in time.
Along with client's account balance increase, in time T
1, reach account balance 210.Owing to credit line 202 is set to account balance 210, so the client is presented the bill at this point.In time T
1Account balance is provided after the payment, and the client begins to expand the account balance to the supplier once more.In time T
2, credit line 202 is increased to account balance 212, makes the client can be increased to greater than at T
1Remaining sum to its account balance of presenting the bill 210.In time T
3, credit line 202 reduces to account balance 214.Because the client is in time T
3Account balance greater than remaining sum 214, so in time T
3The client is presented the bill.
From client's angle, though from credit line 202 with the time that changes, still from credit line 202 with the account balance that is converted to, credit line 202 all is unpredictalbe.Be similar to the payment in advance charging and arrange, the client does not know when the supplier needs payment so.Yet different with payment in advance charging arrangement, before the supplier provided required product, the client was not assigned to the fund of product.So because fund is taken away from the client after required product is provided, payment is chargeed and is arranged to make the client that more availability of funds be arranged after the institute.
From supplier's angle, the back payment is chargeed and is arranged the credit risk with respect to the payment in advance charging is arranged to cause offering the client to increase.By giving the client just received product before product is paid the bill ability, the supplier has been provided by the more risk that the client will not pay the bill to the product that is provided.Yet the supplier is by changing credit line according to the risk that is associated with the client, thereby defines the risk of oneself, will not give suspicious risk client like this and have an opportunity to reach than this client and can bear the higher remaining sum of payment.
Payment in advance can be chargeed and arrange to be considered as the particular example of limited credit, or wherein credit line is set to 0 back payment charging arrangement.This payment in advance charge arrange among, contain demand in order to ensure the number of depositing to the supplier to product, the supplier usually places budget with the part of deposit funds, this budget is used to solve the unexpected heavy demand that arrives.If budget does not use up, then budget can be taken in client's the next cash pledge.Among substituting payment in advance embodiment, unexpected to the situation of heavy demand in, the supplier can provide limited credit to the client alternatively.
Among the end of term, charging was arranged, the supplier provided credit line to the client, and can present the bill to the client on the prediction time.For example, the supplier can provide credit line to the client, and (for example, one month) provides product in the foreseeable time period therein, and presents the bill time period foot couple client.
Fig. 3 illustrates the exemplary diagram 300 that end of term charging is arranged.Figure 30 0 illustrates the time period 302,304 and 306, represents from T respectively
0To T
1, from T
1To T
2, and from T
2To T
3Time period.In an embodiment, the supplier is in time T
1, T
2And T
3The client is presented the bill.Among another embodiment, the time period 302,304 and 306 is equal substantially.In time T
1, the client is accumulated to account balance 308 and therefore it is presented the bill.In time T
2, the client is billed to account balance 310 and therefore it is presented the bill.As shown in Figure 3, account balance 310 is basically greater than account balance 308.So when account balance presents the bill to the client if not influencing, and the client can only predict based on the time of distance charging last time when the supplier will present the bill to the product that is provided.
The end of term charges and arranges to offer the Resource Availability of client's higher degree.The end of term charges and arranges not require client's appointment fund before being provided product, and the time when supplier will present the bill to the client is predictable fully.
Yet among the end of term, charging was arranged, the supplier provided higher relatively credit number.In addition, because the supplier is receiving that the client provides product before paying the bill, so the client may not know the accurate remaining sum of account or how many expenses it will be required to pay in the charging end of term.
So payment in advance, back payment and the end of term relate to offer the charging arrangement of client's different credit numbers, therefore, the supplier has born the risk of varying number.In payment in advance charges arrangement, the supplier will provide seldom or not provide credit to the client.In arrangement was chargeed in the back payment, the supplier provided the credit of limited number to the client, and can change this restriction in time unpredictablely.Among charge arranging in the end of term, the supplier offers the not limited credit of client potentially, and presents the bill the foot couple client that can predict the time period.
With client's regular trading among, the supplier generally determines to use a kind of in arranging of three kinds of different charges described above, and with this client's All Activity in keep this arrangement.Yet, among the embodiment of Miao Shuing,, also billing parameter is upgraded herein along with the change of condition.
The experience of chargeing comprises influences various billing parameters mutual between client and the supplier.Billing parameter comprises, such as but not limited to, offer client's credit line, frequency, cost of marketing and the restriction of unsettled order of charging (for example, is used for broadcasting or video ads, as will be described further).In an embodiment, based on the credit risk that is associated with the client, the billing parameter of the experience of chargeing is upgraded.
As described above, the client can be one group of consumer and/or enterprise and single consumer or enterprise.More specifically, if the member of one group of consumer and/or enterprise has co-related risks, then this group consumer and/or enterprise are considered the client.In other words, the risk that is associated with client's member can be indicated the risk that is associated with client's other members or client's integral body.In assessment and risk that many members' client is associated, so, can come calculation risk based on observation to client's integral body and each separate member.So, can set up single credit accounts to this client, and need not set up independently account each member.For example, on behalf of a plurality of enterprises, single contact person can the payment that the supplier makes is responsible for.In this case, owing to be used for the contact person's of one of enterprise another contact person's risk of risk indication enterprise, so should a plurality of enterprises poly-ly organize single client.
Can determine the risk that is associated with the client by using traditional credit inspection.Yet to carry out the credit inspection often be expensive and be inefficent in time to the client.When the client is undertaken when mutual by the Internet and supplier, this especially is a problem, because the automatic request of credit inspection typically is not an option.In addition, the risk that is associated with the client is dynamically updated to cause the delay and the expense of adding.
Alternatively, can come definite risk that is associated with the client by supplier oneself.Such supplier can be to observing such as following, such as but not limited to, the existence of the comparison between the long-term and short-term to product needs, the payment of guarantee form, the net present value (NPV) of the product that offer the client future and client's payment history.If the recent demand to product has dynamic change, then this can to indicate the client be to be high risk astatically and therefore.The existing of the payment of guarantee form (that is, if client's delay in payment or not payment, the then form of payment that can obtain of supplier) reduced the risk that is associated with this client.The example of the payment of guarantee form includes but not limited to credit card, bank account and closing balance.Client's payment history is about the speed of client to supplier's bill payment.Along with the delay between bill and actual delivery increases, the risk that is associated with this client has also increased.
Risk assessment can be automatically, makes regularly the various criterions that are used to assess risk are observed.Additionally or alternatively, risk assessment can be based on incident.For example, if the client has issued the new projects that will be sold to the consumer, then can carry out risk assessment based on incident.Generally speaking, a lot of dissimilar incidents can be used to trigger risk assessment, include but not limited to and microcosmic and/or the relevant incident of macroeconomy incident.For example, the incident that triggers risk assessment can be specific to the client (for example, issue commercial report, movement of stock prices, bankruptcy case etc.), specific to client's industry (for example, indicate the economic data of industrial achievement) and/or specific to general economy (for example, stock index, government's economic data etc.).Technician institute as relevant neighborhood is conspicuous, can use software, firmware, hardware or its to make up and partially or completely implement risk assessment.
The possibility of result of risk assessment causes the renewal of the billing parameter in the charging experience between supplier and client.For example, can upgrade cost of marketing based on the result of risk assessment.Among the adjustment cost of marketing, it is expensive more still to the also more profitable product of supplier to give believable (for example, low-risk) client access manufacturing.Such product supposition is that the client is needed.The right to enjoyment of expensive commodity is limited to high risk client, because they can not pay to product more, the commodity of relatively low cost this can cause the supplier to lose increase.For example, as relevant neighborhood the technician was to be understood that, when concluding the business with believable retailer, Advertisement Server can allow cooperative advertising, video ads and/or print advertisements, and they have higher cost of marketing with respect to the online advertisement with low sales cost.
The credit line that the supplier is desirable to provide to the client can increase or reduce based on the assessment risk that is associated with this client.Can adjust the frequency of interim charging (ad hocbilling) based on risk assessment.For the excessive risk client, can increase the charging frequency and avoid loss with the protection supplier.According to embodiments of the invention, the element that pay in pre-payment, back and end of term charging is arranged can make up to form the experience of chargeing flexibly.With reference to Fig. 4 the operation of flexible charging experience is described.
Fig. 4 illustrate when client and supplier with flexible charging when always making business, the exemplary plot 400 of client's account balance.Figure 40 0 comprises credit line 402, time period 404,406,408 and 410 and waveform 412.Waveform 412 is waveforms of representing client's account balance.With reference to client wherein is that retailer and supplier are that the embodiment of Internet advertisement server describes the flexible charging experience.Yet, technician institute as relevant neighborhood is conspicuous, such charging experience can be implemented in other neighborhoods, in described other neighborhoods, the supplier offers the client with product stream, such as medicine is offered the pharmacy, gasoline offers airline etc.Among the embodiment of Fig. 4, to the risk that is associated with the retailer regularly and/or cause the change of billing parameter based on the result of the assessment of incident.
During the time period 404, retailer's charging experience has been showed and roughly similarly pre-payment behavior of the described prepaid accounting arrangement of reference Fig. 1.In an embodiment, the retailer is newer relatively for Advertisement Server, and does not obtain the credit of Advertisement Server.Alternatively, Advertisement Server may be appointed as the retailer and have higher relatively credit risk.As described above, the pre-payment arrangement relates to provides seldom or does not provide credit to the retailer.As shown in Figure 4, credit line 402 is 0 substantially on the time period 404, and the indication Advertisement Server does not offer the retailer with credit.During the time period 404, Advertisement Server is also assessed the credit risk that is associated with the retailer.The most last in the time period 404, broadcasting server determines that the retailer should obtain credit and increase.
So in the time period 406, retailer's charging experience presents the behavior of part payment expense, the paying of part back.Like this,, then can present the bill, but also can allow the positive account balance of its accumulation the retailer in case account balance reaches 0.As shown in Figure 4, credit line 402 began to increase on the time period 406, and the indication Advertisement Server offers retailer's credit.Yet even authorized the retailer credit, the charging experience in the time 406 still may present certain pre-payment behavior.For example, similar with the pre-payment arrangement, in time T
1The retailer is presented the bill, make account balance become negative (that is, number is greater than account balance) once more.
Alternatively, even in time T
1The retailer is not presented the bill especially, the provisional payment that the ratio account balance that the retailer made is bigger also can cause negative remaining sum.Can before reaching credit line, account balance make such payment.Such payment offers retailer's when pay the bill and pay the bill about this retailer what dirigibility, because before next due for payment, negative remaining sum has effectively been expanded time span (identical if every other parameter keeps).Although do not specify in Fig. 4, during each different time sections 404,408 and 410 of experience of chargeing, the retailer can carry out provisional payment with similar fashion.
The most last in the time period 406, the Advertisement Server decision offers the retailer with the credit of accelerating.So in the time period 408, the experience of chargeing presents the back and pays or limited credit charging behavior.When each account balance reaches credit line 402, the retailer is presented the bill.In addition, credit line 402 increased in the whole time period 406, and the indication Advertisement Server offers the retailer by the credit of will accelerate and changed billing parameter.Must dullly rise during the time period 406 although Fig. 4 illustrates credit line 402, the credit line 202 that credit line 402 also can be similar in Fig. 2 changes unpredictablely, and still has the trend that must increase.
In the beginning of time period 410, retailer's charging experience presents end of term behavior.As shown in Figure 4, Advertisement Server is in the foreseeable time, and for example the most last at every month presented the bill to the retailer.Yet the charging experience during the time period is 410 is not to charge as the described simple end of term of reference Fig. 3 to arrange.Different with end of term charging arrangement, the charging experience in the time period 410 still comprises credit line 402.Along with the time period 410 continues forward, credit line 402 increases.So along with the time continues forward and risk assessment indication client is believable, then credit line 402 increases, and therefore the degree of correlation reduces, and the experience of chargeing is chargeed near the pure end of term more and is arranged.Along with the reduction of retailer's credit risk, be used for the end of term charge experience during length also may increase.
The embodiment of Fig. 4 illustrates and works as a retailer and Advertisement Server account balance of retailer during the different transformation of experience in it charges experience.The experience of chargeing changes the corresponding to charging experience with the retailer that relative higher credit is arranged at Advertisement Server into from presenting with the corresponding to behavior of the retailer who has seldom or have no credit.Additionally or alternatively, as described above, except credit line, Advertisement Server also can upgrade the billing parameter of the experience of chargeing gradually.For example, in the time period 404, Advertisement Server can reduce the needed minimum cash pledge of the advertisement of distributing the retailer.In addition, in fringe time section 406 (that is, part payment takes, part back paying part), Advertisement Server can be adjusted the speed that credit line 402 increases.So, flexible charging experience illustrated in fig. 4 can be considered as the change gradually to the experience parameter of chargeing between retailer and the Advertisement Server that risk assessment causes.
As relevant neighborhood the technician was to be understood that, also can use regular risk assessment to reduce gradually and present the risk that high risk client is associated.Fig. 9 illustrate when client and supplier with flexible charging when always making business, the exemplary plot 900 of client's account balance, the credit that wherein is associated with the client reduces.Illustrated as account balance 902, the experience of chargeing presents end of term behavior at first.At one time, credit line 904 increases gradually.Yet in time T, the client begins to present excessive risk.Therefore, the value of credit line in this example begins to reduce.As shown in Figure 9, along with credit line reduces, the experience of chargeing also may change.For example, charging experience can change back paying behavior into from end of term behavior.
Get back to Fig. 4, the risk with reference to the described flexible charging experience of Fig. 4 is managed the supplier offers the positive experience of client simultaneously.Also other forms of risk management can be used as substituting or adding with reference to the described flexible charging experience of Fig. 4.In the risk management of these forms some have been described among Fig. 5.With reference to client wherein is that retailer and supplier are that the embodiment of Internet advertisement server has described Fig. 5.Yet the technician of relevant neighborhood will recognize that under prerequisite without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention this explanation can be applied to other clients/provider and arrange.
Fig. 5 illustrates exemplary plot 500, and the account balance as advertising service management retailer during with risk that retailer's transaction is associated is described.As shown in Figure 5, May 1 retailer is presented the bill with regard to account balance 504.Account balance 504 is lower than credit line 516.Yet between May 1 and June 1, client's account balance reaches or near the limit of credit line 516.In response, Advertisement Server is carried out non-periodic or provisional payment request.As shown in Figure 5, replace waiting until the end of metering period, in case account balance reaches credit line 516, then Advertisement Server is presented the bill to the retailer always.If the payment of guarantee form is available, the then outstanding remaining sum of the payment collection of supplier's collateral warranty form or its part are so account balance reduces.As shown in Figure 5, as the result of provisional statement of account, account balance reduces to the account balance that is lower than credit line 516, and the risk of not paying the bill to Advertisement Server has reduced.In an embodiment, this limit equals credit line.In another embodiment, limit be lower than credit line a little, reduce to allow charge.In this embodiment, between limit and credit line, there is the grace period, in the grace period, can continues to distribute, carry out provisional payment to allow automatic credit card retry and/or request client.
June 1,, account balance 502 is presented the bill to the retailer in foreseeable mode.Between June 1 and July 1, retailer's account balance reaches credit line 516 once more.Yet in this example, when Advertisement Server was attempted interim the charging, the payment of guarantee form was disabled, so that retailer's account balance does not have is less.In response, Advertisement Server can be suppressed retailer's advertisement.In compacting retailer's advertisement, Advertisement Server reduces the speed of the advertisement of distributing the retailer.As shown in Figure 5, the slope of waveform 510 (i.e. account balance before reaching the credit limit limit) illustrates that greater than the slope of waveform 512 (promptly reaching credit limit limit after account balance) speed of the advertisement of distributing the retailer has reduced.In the time period 508, keep compacting to retailer's advertisement.After the time period 508, retailer's account balance reaches certain level 513.At that point, Advertisement Server stops the serve ads for the retailer fully.As shown in Figure 5, the slope of waveform 514 is 0 substantially, and the indication Advertisement Server has stopped distributing retailer's advertisement.
Suppressing in this way and/or stopping display ads allowing Advertisement Server to minimize owing to the potential any extraneous risk of not paying the bill and being caused to adding advertisements.Compacting and/or stop to show that also the message that the client has been surpassed credit line sends to the client, and encourage the client to come payment of balance to recover demonstration to advertisement.
In an embodiment, advertisement is broadcasting and/or video ads rather than Internet advertisement.By broadcasting and/or video ads, in order to move, the client places an order (being also referred to as agreement) and pays advertisement.In case following good order, provider just can not suppress the actual motion of advertisement again.Then, provider has accepted risk, because receiving advertisement from advertisement publishers in the affirmation (for example, passing through specimen page) that moves before, can not present the bill to the client.This delay can be significant.So if the risk that is associated with the client begins to increase, the supplier can suppress can be for the order of client's use, rather than the actual displayed of advertisement.
In case the risk that is associated with the client reduces, and can discharge compacting, if perhaps supplying products has stopped fully, then can restart.When the client satisfied than before necessarily required institute strict more require the time, can produce the risk reduction.For example, can require the client that the payment of additional guarantee form is provided.In another example, can require the client under charging experience strict more before the situation that the credit risk than the client increases, to operate.
So, in the embodiment of Fig. 5, reaching credit line and mean the limit action, it causes the immediate response from Advertisement Server.Alternatively, can be by adopting at flexible charging illustrated in fig. 4 through always avoiding the dynamic change in this experience of chargeing.In this embodiment, the charging that can be updated in more progressively between retailer and the Advertisement Server is experienced.For example, as shown in Figure 5, and compare during other charge, the retailer to the demand of advertisement between May 1 and June 1, increase faster.After the quick growth on observing this demand, Advertisement Server can correspondingly upgrade one or more billing parameters.For example, Advertisement Server can earlier begin to suppress this retailer's advertisement.In such a case, even before reaching credit line, also can suppress to retailer's advertisement.Advertisement Server also can reduce credit line and/or carry out provisional statement of account.Alternatively, if the increase of account balance corresponding to the increase of retailer's state, then for example Advertisement Server can increase credit line.
On the contrary, if Advertisement Server is observed the metering period of more relatively number of times, wherein the retailer keeps relative stability to the demand of advertisement, and/or make more low-risk other that indication is associated with the retailer and observe, then Advertisement Server can increase credit line, minimizing or cancellation provisional statement of account and/or the minimizing compacting to retailer's advertisement.
So,, can real-time update charge and experience although the risk that is associated with the client is used regularly or based on the assessment of incident.In such charging experience, so allow the client to build one's credit effectively at the supplier place.In addition, (increase credit limit, reduce the frequency of charging etc.) when the renewal billing parameter helps the client, then the client may tend to spend on this product more.So the experience of chargeing flexibly allows the supplier to select those to enjoy favourable billing parameter for the client who oneself produces maximum incomes, maximizes the income from believable client thus.And by adjusting billing parameter, the supplier can manage the risk that is associated with comparatively insincere client.
In addition, adjusting billing parameter can be based on client's expectation.For example, even risk assessment indication credit line may increase, the client also can determine it not have essential fund that this increase is budgeted.In such a case, the supplier can stipulate credit line, makes the increase of credit line be no more than the specified restriction of client.
Fig. 6 illustrates the computer implemented system 600 that is used to manage supplier's risk exposure according to an embodiment of the invention and product is offered the client.System 600 comprises customer risk assessment and regulation engine 602, and it comprises client's module 604, credit block 606 and the experience module 608 of chargeing.Client's module 604 is couple to account database 610 and accounting engine 612.The experience of chargeing module 608 is couple to accounting engine 612 and supplying products engine 614.Supplying products engine 614 is couple to product database 616.Credit block 606 is couple to credit line counter 618 and customer interface 620.Customer interface 620 is couple to product database 616.Come the operation of descriptive system 600 with reference to Fig. 7.
As relevant neighborhood the technician was to be understood that, each element of system 600 can be embodied as server or be embodied as hardware, software, firmware or its combination in any.Can be by using other elements that each element of system 600 are couple to system 600 such as the telecommunication network of the Internet.For example, customer risk assessment and regulation engine 602 conceptually are shown in and are comprised client's module 604, credit block 606 in the individual unit and the experience module 608 of chargeing.Yet, can be with customer risk assessment and regulation engine 602, client's module 604, credit block 606 and charge and experience in the module 608 each and be embodied as the server that separates and be coupled in together via the Internet or other communication networks.Additionally or alternatively, other elements such as account data piece 610 and accounting engine 612 can be embodied as the server that separates, and be coupled in together via the Internet or other communication networks.
The illustrative methods 700 of the risk exposure that is used to manage the supplier is provided as shown in Figure 7.Technician institute as relevant neighborhood is conspicuous, can carry out such method automatically by using hardware, software, firmware or its combination in any.With reference to client wherein is that retailer and supplier are that the embodiment of Internet advertisement server comes describing method 700, but as described above, such method can be applied to other sights.Come describing method 700 with reference to Fig. 6, but be not subject to this aspect.
In step 704, can billing parameter be set to the retailer.As described above, billing parameter can comprise credit line.In an embodiment, begin and credit line to be set to 0, make credit not to be offered the retailer.For example, in the system 600 of Fig. 6, credit block 606 can be provided with credit line based on the credit line that is calculated by credit line counter 618.In another embodiment, Advertisement Server can be provided with the cost of commodity, makes product that higher or lower cost of marketing be arranged.For example, the experience of chargeing module 608 can be by reducing the set of retailer's advertisement via supplying products engine 614, thereby low cost of marketing is set.The experience of chargeing module 608 can be by increasing set or video ads and/or print advertisements be provided via supplying products engine 614, thereby increase cost of marketing.
In step 706, the credit risk that is associated with this retailer is assessed.Can be regularly and/or based on incident come credit risk is assessed.In an embodiment, the risk that is associated with the retailer based on among following the review one of at least: the retailer to the demand of product, retailer to the cost of Advertisement Server and retailer payment history to Advertisement Server.The generation of incident can comprise, such as but not limited to, monetization, from retailer's order, after the preset time section statement do not pay the bill or payment in part and all credit risk surpass the certain portions of giving of credit line.For example, in the system 600 of Fig. 6, customer risk assessment/regulation engine 602 can use 606 pairs of risks that are associated with the retailer of credit block to assess.As described above, in an embodiment, can assess the credit risk that is associated with the retailer based on multiple criterion, described standard such as but not limited to, to the existence of the payment of the comparison between the long-term and short term need of advertisement, guarantee form, retailer's payment history.
In step 708, determine whether to change one or more billing parameters.In an embodiment, in response to the credit risk of in step 706, being assessed, can change one or more billing parameters.As described above, billing parameter can comprise: credit line, charging frequency and cost of marketing.In an embodiment, Advertisement Server is ready that the credit line that offers the retailer can increase in response to the risk of the reduction that is associated with the retailer.Alternatively, Advertisement Server is ready that the credit line that offers the retailer can reduce in response to the risk of the increase that is associated with the retailer.In the system 600 of Fig. 6, the experience of chargeing module 608 can determine whether to change one or more billing parameters.In an embodiment, charging experience module 608 can determine to change the frequency of credit line and/or charging.
In step 710, can change the experience self of chargeing.In an embodiment, the experience of change chargeing can comprise the experience of chargeing is changed into the charging experience with higher credit line from the experience with low credit line.For example, the experience of change chargeing can comprise: from the prepaid accounting experience change into part payment expense part postpaid accounting experience, with limited credit charge experience change into the end of term charge experience, increase be used for the end of term charge experience during length or increase be used for the charge credit line of experience of limited credit.
Alternatively, change is chargeed to experience and can be comprised that the experience of chargeing is changed into the charging that has than low credit line from the experience with higher credit line to be experienced.For example, change is chargeed to experience and can be comprised that taking part postpaid accounting experience from part payment changes into prepaid accounting experience, and the experience of perhaps will chargeing in the end of term is changed into the limited credit charging and experienced.
Fig. 4 is illustrated as reference, in another embodiment, charging experience module 608 can further be changed into the experience of the charging between retailer and the Internet advertisement server from the charging experience that presents the behavior that is similar to the prepaid accounting arrangement and present the partly experience of back paying behavior of part payment expense.
As shown in Figure 7, if the billing parameter or the experience of chargeing need to change, method 700 turns back to step 704.According to this, billing parameter can match with definite maintenance of step 708 and 710.For example, when the experience of chargeing changes, can be provided with credit line more higher or lower than initial credit amount.For example, in the system 600 of Fig. 6, the more new height that the credit line that credit block 606 can the retailer is set to and the change of the experience module 608 determined chargings experience of chargeing matches.In addition, customer interface 620 can be used to ask the approval of retailer to the billing parameter change, such as the increase of credit line.The credit line of Que Dinging is higher than among the embodiment of the credit line that the retailer asks therein, credit line can be defined as the credit line that the retailer asks.In addition, can control cost of marketing.In such embodiments, the billing parameter based on changing in step 708 can merchandise cost be set to high or low.Supplying products engine 614 can change can be for the cost of marketing of retailer's use.For example, supplying products engine 614 can make cooperative advertising, video ads and/or print advertisements can with or limit its availability.
