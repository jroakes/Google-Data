- intelligence component 210 may employ learned associations between user selections of creators, search criteria, and creator profiles to enhance matching of the creator profiles with appropriate clients.
- intelligence component 210 can examine the entirety or a subset of data to which it is granted access in order to provide for reasoning about user engagement with an advertisement.
- Intelligence component 210 can be granted access to any suitable information associated with system 200 (and additional system described herein), including profile information, search criteria, user selections in response to searches, business transaction information between creators and clients, as well as accessible extrinsic information such as information related to user interest in video content of a creator and/or a creator's channel.
- Intelligence component can further employ extrinsic information related to current events and extrinsic information related to social media networks.
- Intelligence component 210 can perform inferences to identify a specific context or action, or to generate a probability distribution over states, for example.
- the inferences can be probabilistic - that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events.
- An inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher- level events from a set of events or data. Such inference can result in construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.
- Various classification can be employed for composing higher- level events from a set of events or data. Such inference can result in construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.
- Such classification can employ a probabilistic or statistical- based analysis (e.g. , factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed.
- a support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data.
- Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g. , naive Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed.
- the intelligence component can generate information for a user profile by providing a user with multiple questions that relate to the user's needs and abilities.
- the intelligence component 210 can further infer information to provide to profile component 110 based on a user's answers to the questions.
- the intelligence component can dynamically infer appropriate questions to ask a user based on answers to previously asked questions.
- the intelligence component can employ machine learning techniques to automatically build comprehensive profiles for users that include the necessary language and metadata for identification of the profiles by the search component in response to search criteria.
- System 300 can include a review component 310 that receives a rating information for a video creator and associates the rating information with the video creator's profile.
- rating information can relate to various characteristics of a creator and/or the creator's channel.
- the rating information can relate to a quality of the creator's videos, the quality of the creator's channel, the popularity of a creator's videos, the popularity of a creator's channel, or the popularity of a creator's channel with respect to a certain audience.
- Rating information can further relate to the level of professionalism of a creator, a level of reliability of the creator, a number of positive reviews, or a number of negative reviews. Further, rating information can provide a general rating score for a creator that can encompass a plurality of the above factors.
- the review component can also employ a mechanism to ensure rating information is up to date and is not representative of past statistics. For example, the review component 310 may update ratings and reviews of a creator on a daily basis, a weekly basis, a monthly basis, and etc.
- Review component 310 can employ a variety of techniques to receive rating information for a creator.
