Abstract
An aging compensation method and a computing device configured for aging compensation are disclosed. The aging compensation can minimize or eliminate aging of OLED displays having regions of different pixel density. Each area of the OLED display may be divided into a plurality of partitions including one or more pixels, and an aging factor may be calculated for the partitions. The extreme aging factor may be determined from the extreme partition exhibiting the highest aging. Other partitions having aging factors significantly different from the extreme aging factor can be adjusted so that the pixels in the adjusted partition can be driven to emit similar light at powers similar to the extreme partition. Aging compensation may be performed for each region, and transition regions may be created between regions to minimize light artifacts after aging compensation.
Description
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to flat panel displays, and more particularly, to an aging compensation method for an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display.
Background
OLED displays include pixels that emit light when responsive to an applied current. Each pixel may include an electroluminescent layer (e.g., an organic thin film) disposed between an anode and a cathode. One or both of the electrodes may be transparent to allow light generated by the electroluminescent layer to propagate from the electroluminescent layer through the electrode(s). The pixels of the OLED may be addressed using Thin Film Transistors (TFTs) that may be controlled by a driver integrated circuit (i.e., a driver IC) such that each pixel receives (i.e., is driven by) a current of an intensity specified by the pixel level. For example, the intensity may be a level selected from a range of possible pixel levels (e.g., 0-255). To represent a color image, a separate color channel (e.g., red, green, blue) may be assigned to each pixel.
For various reasons, OLED displays may be more popular than other display technologies. For example, OLED displays can be made thinner and more efficient than other display technologies. Because each pixel of an OLED display emits light, the OLED display does not require a backlight and may not require color filters as required by, for example, Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). The thin nature of OLED displays can contribute to flexibility (and in some cases transparency). For example, in some embodiments, the OLED display may be foldable. In addition, the emissive pixels of OLEDs can result in higher contrast, high brightness, wider viewing angles, and faster refresh rates than other display technologies. But beyond these advantages, OLED displays still have problems that can limit their use.
One problem with OLED displays is related to degradation of the visible light intensity (i.e., brightness) through use. For example, the brightness of a pixel produced by a current specified by the pixel level may be reduced through use. This can lead to a phenomenon (i.e., aging) in which more used pixels look different (e.g., darker) than less used pixels. To compensate for aging, more used pixels may be driven in a different manner than less used pixels. Embodiments of the present disclosure are contemplated in this context.
Disclosure of Invention
In at least one aspect, the present disclosure generally describes a technique for reducing the aging (detrimental) effects of an organic light emitting diode (i.e., OLED) display. For example, the aging factor of the partitions in the area of the OLED display is estimated. The limiting aging factor may be determined from the (estimated) aging factor, and the aging factor that is significantly different from the (estimated) aging factor can be adjusted to update the aging factor for the partitions in the region. The driver integrated circuit (i.e., driver IC) may then be controlled in accordance with the updated aging factor to minimize the aging effects in the OLED display area.
In a possible implementation, each partition can include one or more pixels, and each of the one or more pixels in each partition can be driven according to its updated aging factor.
In possible embodiments, these techniques can be applied to other regions (e.g., at least one other region) of an OLED display because OLED displays have multiple regions of different pixel densities.
In another possible embodiment, these techniques can be applied over the lifetime of the display to minimize the aging of the OLED display over time.
In at least one aspect, the present disclosure generally describes a method for reducing the aging effects of an OLED display. The method comprises the following steps: estimating an aging factor for a plurality of zones in a first area of the OLED display; determining a limiting aging factor based on the estimated aging factor; adjusting an estimated aging factor that is significantly different from the extreme aging factor; updating, in memory, the aging factors for the plurality of partitions in the first region to include the adjusted aging factor; and controlling the driver IC according to the updated aging factor to reduce the effect of aging in the first area of the OLED display.
The aging factor for a partition may indicate the pixel efficiency of the partition. A relatively low aging factor for a region may correspond to a region having relatively low pixel efficiency. A relatively high aging factor for a region may correspond to a region having relatively high pixel efficiency.
The estimated aging factor that is significantly different from the limiting aging factor may be an estimated aging factor that satisfies a threshold, e.g., is greater than a threshold. The threshold may be determined based on an extreme aging factor.
Controlling the driver IC according to the updated aging factor may include adjusting a drive signal of the pixel corresponding to the digital count of the pixel, the adjusting based on the updated aging factor.
The method may further comprise: estimating an aging factor for a plurality of zones in a second region of the OLED display, wherein the second region has a different pixel density than a pixel density of the first region of the OLED display; determining a limiting aging factor from the estimated aging factors for the plurality of partitions in the second region; adjusting the estimated aging factor for a plurality of partitions in a second region that is significantly different from the extreme aging factor for the second region; updating, in the memory, the aging factors of the plurality of partitions in the second region to include the adjusted aging factor of the second region; and controlling the driver IC according to the updated aging factor to reduce the effect of aging in the second area of the OLED display.
The method may further comprise: the estimating, the determining, the adjusting, the updating, and the controlling are repeated for a first area of the OLED display to minimize an effect of aging over time in the first area of the OLED display.
The OLED display may have a high per inch pixel (high PPI) region and a low per inch pixel (low PPI) region. For example, the high PPI region has a higher number of pixels per inch than the low PPI region.
The method may further comprise: specifying a transition region between a high PPI region and a low PPI region; and calculating an aging factor for the transition region, the aging factor gradually changing from the high PPI region to the low PPI region.
Each of the plurality of partitions may include one or more pixels. Each of the one or more pixels in a partition may be driven according to the updated aging factor for each partition.
Estimating an aging factor for the partitions in the area of the OLED display may include, for each partition: calculating a representative pixel level of the partition; determining short-term usage of partitions; determining cumulative usage of partitions; and correlating the cumulative usage with an estimate of the aging factor. The short term usage of a partition may be determined based on the representative pixel level of the partition. The cumulative usage of the partitions may be determined based on the short-term usage of the partitions.
The short term usage of the partition may be an average pixel level of the partition over a window period.
The cumulative usage may be a running total of short term usage over time.
The estimate of the aging factor may be derived from a statistical analysis of a group of OLED displays similar to OLED displays.
Determining the extreme aging factor from the aging factor may include determining a minimum aging factor for the aging factor. For example, the extreme aging factor may be the aging factor indicating the partition with the lowest pixel efficiency.
Adjusting an aging factor that is significantly different from the limiting aging factor may include: determining an aging factor difference between the aging factor and a limiting aging factor of the partition; comparing the aging factor difference to a threshold; and adjusting the aging factors of the partitions to match the extreme aging factors when the aging factor difference is above the threshold; and repeating the determining, the comparing, and the adjusting for other partitions in the area.
The method may further comprise: when the aging factor is below the threshold, the aging factor of the partition is not adjusted to match the extreme aging factor.
In at least one aspect, the present disclosure generally describes a mobile computing device comprising: an OLED display panel, a driver Integrated Circuit (IC), and an application processor configured by software instructions to carry out the above-described method.
In at least one aspect, the present disclosure generally describes a mobile computing device.

The application processor may be further configured by the software instructions to minimize aging of each region of the OLED display by: the estimating, the determining, the adjusting, the updating, and the controlling are repeated for a plurality of regions of the OLED display to minimize aging of the regions of the OLED display over time.
The application processor may be further configured by the software instructions to estimate an aging factor for a plurality of the zones in the area of the OLED display for each zone by: calculating a representative pixel level of the partition; determining short-term usage of partitions; determining cumulative usage of partitions; and correlating the cumulative usage with an estimate of the aging factor.
The application processor may be further configured by the software instructions to correlate the cumulative usage with the estimate of the aging factor by: an estimate of the aging factor is retrieved from the memory, the estimate of the aging factor being derived from a statistical analysis of a group of OLED displays similar to the OLED displays.
The application processor may be further configured by the software instructions to adjust the estimated aging factor that is significantly different from the limiting aging factor by: determining an aging factor difference between the aging factor of the partition and the extreme aging factor; comparing the aging factor difference to a threshold; and adjusting the aging factors of the partitions to match the extreme aging factors when the aging factor difference is above a threshold; and repeating the determining, the comparing, and the adjusting for other partitions in the area.

Detailed Description
The present disclosure describes aging compensation for OLED displays having regions of different pixel density (i.e., multiple resolution regions) in the same display. The disclosed aging compensation can manage each resolution region's aging compensation based on its usage over time and can minimize or eliminate boundary effects between resolution regions caused by their individual aging compensation. For example, visible defects (e.g., lines) between regions can be minimized or eliminated by the disclosed methods. In this manner, the disclosed subject matter addresses technical issues associated with aging effects on a display.
Aging can be a problem for OLED displays. Aging is due to uneven degradation of pixel efficiency and can appear as a residual image (i.e., a shadow image) on the display (i.e., screen). Aging may be caused by pixel usage and/or defective manufacturing processes. Unlike aging on LCD displays, aging on OLED displays is irreversible without compensation.
Fig. 1 illustrates a mobile computing device 100 (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, etc.) having an OLED display 110, the OLED display 110 including pixels that exhibit aging. The pixels of the OLED display 110 shown are driven at substantially this level. Despite this uniform driving condition, the residual image 120 of the previously displayed User Interface (UI) is still visible. The residual image resulting from aging may appear as a negative of the normally displayed image. For example, a bright pixel in a normally displayed image may be darker in the corresponding residual image. This relationship is due to the efficiency of the OLED pixel decreasing with its use. Thus, the OLED pixels may become darker over time.
The use of an OLED pixel may correspond to the energy of the light generated by the OLED pixel (i.e., the power of the light generated by the pixel integrates over time). The power of the light generated by an OLED pixel at a particular time depends on the drive signal corresponding to the pixel level assigned to that pixel. The specified higher pixel level configures the circuit to drive the pixel with a higher voltage and/or current in order to generate more light. Thus, pixels driven with a higher pixel level (average) are used more often than pixels driven with a lower pixel level (average). Thus, the display may have pixels of various efficiencies (i.e., aging levels). When pixels with different efficiencies (i.e., aging levels) are similarly driven, the pixels will transmit light at different powers (i.e., intensities, brightness). When the difference between the aging levels of the pixels becomes significant (e.g., due to an extended image display time), aging artifacts such as residual images may become visible.
To compensate for uneven pixel usage (i.e., pixel aging), more used pixels may be driven at a different current than less used pixels. For example, to have the same brightness, a first current may be used to drive more pixels and a second current may be used to drive less pixels. For example, a more used (i.e., less efficient) pixel may be driven with a first current that is higher than a second current in order to increase the luminance of the more used pixel such that its luminance is the same as the less used (i.e., more efficient) pixel. In other words, the aging compensation may be based on increasing (i.e. boosting) the drive point of the more used (i.e. darker) pixels. Alternatively, the less used pixels may be driven by a second current lower than the first current to reduce the luminance of the less used pixels to be the same as the more used pixels. In other words, the aging compensation may be based on reducing (i.e. compensating) the drive point of the less used (i.e. brighter) pixel. The present disclosure can be applied to any type of aging compensation, but would consider aging compensation based on reducing brighter pixels (i.e., aging fewer pixels) to match darker pixels (i.e., aging more pixels), as this type may provide some advantages (e.g., power consumption) in certain implementations.
OLED displays may be used in a variety of applications (e.g., televisions, mobile phones, tablets, etc.). The resolution of an OLED display is related to the number of pixels per inch (i.e., pixel density). In some applications (e.g., smartphones, tablets), it may be desirable for a single display panel (i.e., display) to have different pixel densities in different regions within the same display panel. In general, the display panel may have any number of different regions and any number of different pixel densities (i.e., pixel resolution, pixels per inch) corresponding to the different regions.
Fig. 2 illustrates a multi-region OLED display according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown, the multi-region OLED display may occupy a large portion of the front surface of the mobile computing device 200 (e.g., mobile phone). The OLED display of the mobile computing device 200 in the illustrated embodiment includes a high per inch pixel (i.e., high PPI) region 210 and a low per inch pixel (low PPI) region 220 (i.e., high versus low versus high). One possible motivation for such a display configuration may be based on one or more optical devices (e.g., light sensors, light sources) located behind the low PPI region 220 of the OLED display. The low PPI region 220 may allow sufficient light to propagate through the region where the optical device (or devices) can function. Thus, the operation display (albeit at a lower resolution) may be extended to an area that was dedicated to one or more light devices.
Pixels in regions of the OLED display having different pixel densities may be driven differently. For example, for a given pixel level, each pixel in the low PPI region 220 (i.e., low pixel density region) may be driven brighter than each pixel in the high PPI region 210 (i.e., high pixel density region) for a given pixel value. In other words, for a given pixel level, each pixel in the lower pixel density region 220 can be made brighter than the pixels in the higher pixel density region 210 to compensate for the smaller number of pixels. When such an adjustment is made, the brightness per unit area from the low PPI region 220 (i.e., portion) of the display may be made equal to the brightness per unit area from the high PPI region 210 (i.e., portion) of the display. In other words, the regions appear to have the same brightness.
The disclosed aging compensation techniques are described for an OLED display having two regions (e.g., a high PPI region and a low PPI region), such as shown in fig. 2. However, the present disclosure is not limited to such an embodiment. The disclosed techniques may be applied to OLED displays having additional regions of the same or different pixel densities. Furthermore, the regions of different pixel density may be of any shape, any size and any relative spatial configuration.
The disclosed aging compensation may be implemented as software, firmware, and/or hardware of a computing device (e.g., a mobile computing device). Fig. 3 is a system block diagram of a portion of a mobile computing device (e.g., mobile phone, tablet) configured with aging compensation. The mobile computing device 300 includes a graphics chip (i.e., graphics accelerator) 310 and an application processor 330 to handle the processing necessary to control the driver IC340 to configure the current provided to the pixels on the OLED display panel 350 (i.e., OLED display) in order to generate a visual image. For example, a digital image (e.g., a JPEG image) may be stored in the memory 320 and may be processed (e.g., by a graphics accelerator and/or an application processor) to assign pixel values from a range of possible pixel values (e.g., 0-255) to corresponding pixels in an OLED display. The driver IC340 is configured to convert the pixel values into necessary signals to control the luminance of each pixel. For example, the driver IC may control one of a plurality of transistors corresponding to a pixel in a particular row and column of the OLED display panel 350 to provide a current to the pixel, where the level of the current is related to the pixel value. In other words, the driver IC340 may act as an amplifier (e.g., a voltage controlled current source) to provide a signal (e.g., a current) to each pixel having a magnitude (e.g., a current level) corresponding to the pixel level. For example, a higher pixel level corresponds to a larger amplitude signal at the corresponding output of the driver IC. In addition, as described below, the amplitude of the signal provided to each pixel may be further adjusted to compensate for aging corresponding to the pixels of the OLED display panel.
As shown in fig. 3, the Application Processor (AP) may be configured to perform aging compensation 335. For example, the AP may be configured by software instructions retrieved from a non-volatile computer readable memory (e.g., memory 320) to perform a method for aging compensation. When configured for aging compensation, the AP 330 can adjust the signal from the graphics chip 310 to control the driver IC to increase or decrease the signal amplitude for a given pixel level. Thus, the disclosed aging compensation 335 can operate without affecting the operation of the graphics accelerator 310 or the driver IC 340. In other words, it is not necessary to adjust the display process or circuitry in the mobile computing device 300 to achieve the disclosed aging compensation.
Fig. 4 is a flow chart of an aging compensation method according to an embodiment of the present invention. Method 400 may be performed on different regions of an OLED display having multiple regions. For example, the method 400 may be performed for a first region having a first pixel density and for a second region having a second pixel density. The method performed for the first area may be performed in parallel with or in sequence with (i.e., performed by) the method performed for the second area.
Each region may be subdivided into partitions to simplify the computational requirements for the method. The partition can include one or more pixels. Each partition may be sized such that a single pixel level and aging factor may represent all of the pixels within the partition, and such that the pixels in the partition may have similar physical and electrical characteristics due to their proximity. Furthermore, the pixels in the partitions may have similar usage characteristics, as the pixel density of the partitions is typically much higher than the spatial frequency of the displayed image.
The method 400 may be performed periodically over the life of the OLED display so that aging compensation may be modified while using the OLED display. Each iteration of the method 400 may use short-term statistics as well as accumulated information from previous iterations. Thus, the method 400 can store and retrieve the results of the iteration from the memory 320 of the mobile computing device.
The method may also store and retrieve OLED panel data to and from the memory 320 of the mobile computing device. The OLED panel data may include information about regions, partitions, and pixels of the OLED display. In addition to region and zone designations, the OLED panel data may include statistical operational data associated with the OLED panel. The OLED panel data can be obtained 401 by statistical analysis (e.g., design of experiment) performed on a representative sample set of a plurality of OLED displays similar to the OLED display analyzed by method 400. This step of obtaining 401OLED panel data can occur at a different time (e.g., earlier) and at a different location (e.g., a factory) than other steps of performing method 400. Accordingly, the OLED panel data may be stored (e.g., factory settings) in the memory 320 of the mobile computing device. In a possible embodiment, the OLED panel data can be updated based on the results of method 400.
The method for aging compensation includes calculating 410 an aging adjustment necessary to compensate for changes in light output from the zones in the area. The calculation 410 includes estimating 420 an aging factor for the partitions in the region (e.g., for each partition). In a possible embodiment, each partition is assigned an aging factor to represent the aging of all pixels in that partition. The aging factor corresponds to a representative pixel efficiency estimated for the partition based on the use of the partition. When a pixel (or pixels) in a partition is used, the efficiency pixel (or pixels) of the partition decreases. Thus, in a possible implementation, the aging factor for each partition decreases with the use of the partition.
The calculation 410 of the aging adjustment also includes determining 440 a limit aging factor for the partitions in the region. In other words, the limit partition of the area can be determined. An extreme partition may be a partition within a region that has the most extreme aging factor (i.e., extreme aging factor) among all partitions. Each partition may be used differently and thus may have different luminescence for a particular pixel level. To adjust the pixels to have similar luminescence for a given pixel level, the output of the lighter pixels can be reduced to match the darker pixels. The extreme partitions can have an extreme aging factor that is the minimum aging factor for all partitions. The minimum aging factor may correspond to the least efficient (i.e., darkest partition for a particular pixel level) pixel and can serve as a baseline to which all other partitions can be compared and/or adjusted.
The calculation 410 of the aging adjustment can also include adjusting 460 the aging factor of a partition having an aging factor that is significantly different from the extreme aging factor. The adjusting 460 may include comparing the aging factor of the partition (e.g., each partition) to a limit aging factor and determining an aging factor (partition) that is significantly different from the limit aging factor (limit partition). The drive signals that can affect the pixels of a partition are adjusted so that for a given pixel level, when a limit partition is driven at the same pixel level, the partition outputs a similar (e.g., the same) luminescence as the limit partition. For example, if the lighter partitions and their drive signals are calibrated (e.g., reduced) according to the limit partitions, then the (lighter) partitions with an efficiency of 90% can be made to appear to have the same efficiency as the (darker) limit partitions with an efficiency of 30%.
The method 400 further includes outputting (480) the updated aging adjustment (i.e., the maintained or adjusted aging factor) to the driver IC. For example, one or more pixels in each partition can receive the same aging factor. The driver IC receives the aging factor and is configured by the aging factor to minimize variations in the pixels output for the same pixel level. Additionally, the method may also output intermediate and/or final results of the aging adjustment calculation (410) to the memory 320. In this way, the aging factor can be updated as the OLED panel is used. Thus, the method can include periodically performing aging compensation by repeating 490 the aging adjustment for the partition after a period of time.
For a better understanding of the above method, an exemplary embodiment of the main steps of the aging adjustment will be described in detail, taking the exemplary OLED display shown in fig. 5 as an example. The example OLED display 500 is divided into a first region 510 (e.g., a high PPI region) and a second region 520 (e.g., a low PPI region). Each region is further subdivided into partitions (i.e., indicated by dashed lines). Each partition may contain one or more pixels. For example, a given partition 530 (i.e., the ith partition) of the first region 510 includes pixels 540 (i.e., five points indicating pixels).
Each pixel in a partition may be driven at different pixel levels at any given time. Therefore, to calculate the aging factor for a partition, a representative pixel level for the partition may be derived. The representative pixel level may be any mathematical representation of the pixel level. For example, a representative pixel level may correspond to an average (mean) of pixel levels, a median pixel level, or any other statistically significant representation of pixel levels. Further, a representative pixel level of a partition may be referred to as a numerical count of the partition (i.e., D)C) Since the pixel level typically corresponds to a digital representation (e.g., indicated in an image file).
Fig. 6 includes possible details of the step of estimating 420 the aging factor of the method shown in fig. 4. The step of estimating 420 includes calculating 421 a numerical count (D) of the partitionsC). For example, for the ith partition 530 shown in FIG. 5, the number counts (D)C) May be an average of five pixel levels of a partition at a given time (t).
Estimating (420) the aging factor further comprises using a numerical count (D) of the regionsC) Short term usage of each partition is determined (423). The numerical count (i.e., pixel level) of each partition varies over time (i.e., D)C(t)). FIG. 7 is an example plot of digital count (i.e., pixel level) versus time for a partition. The short term usage can be calculated as the short term average of the numerical counts of the partitions (i.e., E (D) of the window periodC(t)). In other words, it is possible to match the window period TDThe corresponding window is used to calculate the short term average of the digital counts as shown in the following equation:
for example, as shown in FIG. 7, short term use of (For example, at time t1) Can be in window period 710 (i.e., T)D) Five D's of upper collection (i.e., sampling)CAverage of the values.
As shown in FIG. 6, estimating 420 the aging factor also includes determining 425 a cumulative usage (i.e., long term usage) of each partition. The cumulative usage of the partition may be calculated as a running total of short term usage over time, as shown in the following equation:
for example, as shown in FIG. 7, the cumulative usage may be at a first time (t)1) A second time (t)2) And a third time (t)3) Short term usage (i.e., average D) calculated in a windowC) The sum of (a) and (b). The window period (T) can be used in a shorter period than the short termD) The cumulative usage is calculated over a much longer duration. For example, cumulative usage may be calculated over the lifetime of the OLED panel. Thus, short-term usage may be calculated periodically, and the period 720 between short-term usage calculations may be selected based on a balance between computational efficiency and the ability to capture the efficiency degradation that requires aging compensation. As shown in fig. 7, the short-term usage samples may be periodic, with a period 720 between short-term usage samples longer than the short-term window period (T;)D)710。
As shown in fig. 6, estimating 420 the aging factor further includes correlating 427 the cumulative usage to the aging factor (i.e., pixel efficiency) for each partition. As described above, the aging factor of a partition may be related to the pixel efficiency of the partition. For example, the aging factor for a given (i-th) partition in a high PPI region may have an aging factor f between zero (e.g., 0% efficiency) and 1 (e.g., 100% efficiency)H(i). Likewise, the aging factor for a given (i-th) one of the low PPI regions may have an aging factor f between zero (e.g., 0% efficiency) and 1 (e.g., 100% efficiency)L(i). Aging factor (i.e., f)H(i)，fL(i)) May generally decrease over time. For example, as time extends to infinity (i.e., t → ∞), the limit of the aging factor isAnd (4) zero.
The cumulative usage of the partitions corresponds to time (i.e., increases over time). Thus, the aging factor (i.e., f)H(i)，fL(i)) Decreases with increasing cumulative usage. The details of how the aging factor decreases with cumulative usage can be described by a function or a curve. For example, the aging factor may decrease linearly with cumulative usage, as shown by the following equation:
the function or curve may be determined theoretically or empirically. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, a determination function or curve may be determined as part of the step of obtaining 401OLED panel data. FIG. 8 is an estimation and cumulative usage of possible aging factors. As shown, the estimate of the aging factor (e.g., for a partition) has a linear profile 820 that decreases with cumulative usage. The linear profile can be represented by a function having a slope (α) and an initial value (β). The parameters (α, β) of the function (i.e., the estimate) can be derived from a statistical analysis of a group of OLED displays similar to OLED displays. The results of the statistical analysis can be stored in a memory for use in estimating the aging factor from the cumulative usage data. As shown in fig. 8, the aging factor for a region may be a value between 0 and 1, and may decrease (i.e., have a negative slope α) with use from an initial value (β ═ 1) until it reaches zero (i.e., until it extinguishes). The cumulative usage of each partition can be correlated (i.e., mapped) to an estimate of the aging factor (810), as shown in FIG. 8. Correlation may also include, but is not limited to, curve fitting, extrapolation, interpolation, lookup, or any similar operation to perform the mapping 810 shown in fig. 8. One or more parameters, values, or equations of the function or curve (i.e., the estimation and use of aging) may be stored in and retrieved from memory 320 and may be part of the OLED panel data obtained 401 at an earlier time. The function or curve for each region of the display may be the same or different and may be any function including, but not limited to, a linear function, as shown in FIG. 8.
As shown in fig. 6, the estimate 420 may be repeated 429 for each partition of each region. Thus, the step of estimating (420) the aging factor for the partitions may output a vector of regions (e.g., each region). Vector of region (e.g. F)HOr FL) An aging factor (i.e., f) of a partition (e.g., each partition) included in a regionH(i)，fL(i))。
FIG. 9 includes details of the step of determining 440 the extreme aging factor for the region for the method shown in FIG. 4. The extreme aging factor corresponds to the partition of the area most affected by aging (i.e., the extreme partition). For example, the limit partition may be the partition with the least efficient light emission for a given number count. Thus, the extreme aging factor may be a minimum aging factor. To determine the minimum aging factor for each region, analysis may be performed (e.g., min (F)H)，min(FL) Aging factor vector (e.g., F)HAnd FL) To determine a minimum value (e.g., f)Hmin，fLmin)。
Fig. 10 includes details of the step of adjusting (460) an aging factor that is significantly different (e.g., by an amount that exceeds a threshold) from the extreme aging factor of the method shown in fig. 4. As shown in FIG. 4, the step of processing can receive 475 an aging factor vector (e.g., F) for each regionHAnd FL) And can also receive 477 region limit (e.g., minimum) aging factor (e.g., f)Hmin，fLmin)). Based on these inputs, the aging factor of a partition may be adjusted if it is significantly different from the extreme aging factor, or may be maintained if it is not significantly different. The output of the adjustment 460 is the updated aging factor for the partition. The updated aging factor for a partition may include an adjusted aging factor (e.g., adjusted according to a previous iteration (time)), and may also include a maintained aging factor (i.e., not adjusted according to a previous iteration (time)). The updated aging factor can be represented as dated aging factor vector 473 (e.g., F'HAnd F'L)。
As shown in FIG. 10, the aging factor for the 469 partition may be updated for each partition in each region. For a given partition (e.g., f) in a regionH(i)，fL(i)) In particular, the update 460 process includes determining 461 (e.g., based on a comparison) an aging factor for the partition and an aging factor (e.g., f) for the limit partition of the regionHminOr fLmin) The aging factor difference between them. The significance of the aging factor difference is evaluated and a decision 463 is made based on the significance. For example, the significance determination may include comparing the aging factor difference to a significance threshold (i.e., threshold). Further, if the aging factor difference exceeds a threshold, the aging factor difference may be determined to be significant. In one possible embodiment, a difference between the aging factor of a partition and the aging factor of a limit partition of greater than 10% of the limit aging factor can be considered significant. The aging factor for the 465 sections may then be adjusted if the aging factor difference is significant, and the aging factor for the 467 sections may then be maintained if the aging factor difference is not significant. Adjusting the aging factor may include decreasing the aging factor of the partition by an amount based on the aging difference (e.g., f)H(i)-fHmin，fL(i)-fLmin). This process may be repeated 471 for other partitions (e.g., each partition) in the region, and likewise, may be repeated for other regions (e.g., each region).
Fig. 11 graphically illustrates details of example updates of the aging factor for partitions (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, … N) in a region (e.g., low PPI region (L)). These partitions have widely varying aging factors prior to updating. The aging factor of a partition can correspond to the radiant efficiency of the partition. Thus, a larger aging factor may correspond to a high efficiency partition than a smaller aging factor. In order to make the partitions appear to radiate with similar efficiency, the regions of higher efficiency may be calibrated to radiate at lower power. In other words, for a particular number count, the optical power transmitted through a partition can be reduced to the same optical power transmitted for the same particular number count as the limit partitionAnd (6) matching. The limit partition of the partition shown in FIG. 11 is the partition with the lowest aging factor (f)Lmin) Partition (f) ofL(2)). The aging factor of a partition can be compared to a minimum aging factor to determine an aging factor difference (e.g., f)L(1)–fLmin) Whether greater than a threshold (delta)th) As shown in the following equation:
|fL(i)-fLmin|≥δth_L
for purposes of the example shown in fig. 11, one region is shown, but comparisons may be made for all regions in general. In this case, each region may have the same threshold value, or may have a different threshold value.
As shown in fig. 11, the aging factors fL (1), fL (3), and fL (n) can be considered to be significantly different from the aging factor fL (2) of the limit partition. Thus, the aging factors of the partitions may each be adjusted by an amount (i.e., B)L(1)，BL(3)，BL(N)) The updated aging factor is made closer to (e.g., matches) the aging factor of the limit partition. Mathematically, the adjustment can be expressed by the following equation:
f′L(i)＝fL(i)-EL(i)
BL(i)＝k·(fL(i)-fLmin)
0≤k≤ 1
for the example shown in fig. 11, the factor k is equal to 1. However, in general a factor k smaller than 1 can be used. For example, a factor k less than 1 can be used to allow iterative adjustment of the aging factor to the limit aging factor. The method may be used to adapt to varying aging factors. Possible adjustments of the aging factor for the high PPI region and the low PPI region (see, e.g., fig. 5) are mathematically summarized in fig. 12.
As described above, the method 400 for aging compensation outputs 480 the updated aging factor (i.e., the maintained or adjusted aging factor) to the driver IC. Fig. 13 illustrates a possible implementation of a driver IC. The driver IC may include a plurality of channels. For example, the driver IC may include a channel for each pixel in the display. Each channel can be equipped withArranged to receive a digital count (D) corresponding to the level of the illuminated pixelC). For example, the numerical count may correspond to an 8-bit numerical representation of the illumination level in the range of 0 to 255. The driver IC may be further configured to convert the digital count into a signal for driving the pixel. For example, the driver IC may convert the digital count to a voltage (e.g., using a digital-to-analog converter) and may convert the voltage to a current for driving the pixel to emit light at a particular level (e.g., using a voltage-controlled current source).
In other words, the driver IC may be considered as a multi-channel amplifier, wherein the gain of each channel may be controlled by the updated aging factor. When each channel of the multi-channel amplifier controls a pixel, all amplifiers in a partition for the pixel may receive the same updated aging factor for control. The driver IC may have a portion of a channel corresponding to each region of the OLED display.
The aging compensation may be considered as a calibration of the drive signal corresponding to the digital count. As shown in FIG. 13, the updated aging factor (f'H(i)，f’L(i)) Capable of adjusting the digital count (D) associated with the pixelCH(i)，DCH(i)) Drive signals (pixels) of the corresponding pixelsH(i)，PixelL(i)). For example, the updated aging factor may adjust the maximum current delivered to the pixel for maximum digital count. In this case, the minimum drive signal can be kept at zero, while all other drive signals can be adjusted to equally span the digital count range.
The aging compensation for each region can be derived and applied independently. For example, in the display shown in fig. 5, the first region (e.g., high PPI region) can have an aging factor (f) adjusted to be similar to the first aging factorHmin) And the second region (e.g., low PPI region) can have a second aging factor (f) adjusted to be similar toLmin) Is divided into a plurality of partitions. Such differences can, in some cases, result in intensity variations (i.e., visible artifacts) at the boundaries between regions. Thus, in some embodiments, the transition region may be defined by an aging factor of the regionBetween the regions that were transformed above.
Fig. 14 is a front view of an OLED display including a low PPI region 910, a high PPI region 930, and a transition region 920 therebetween. The low PPI region, the high PPI region, and the transition region are respectively divided into partitions (i.e., designated by dotted lines). The ith partition in the low PPI region can be designated as L (i) and can have a designation of fL(i)The jth partition in the high PPI region can be designated as h (j) and has a designation of fH(j)The aging factor of (1). The nth partition in the transition region can be designated as t (n). The aging factor of the transition region can be designated as fT(n)And may be calculated according to an equation including a weighting function (i.e., w (n)) to provide a smooth aging factor variation across the partition of the transition region between the low PPI region and the high PPI region, as shown by the following equation:
fT(n)＝w(n)fH(j)+(1-w(n))fL(i)
three aging factors can be calculated for the transition region partitions shown in fig. 14, 15 (i.e., T (1), T (2), T (3) between the low PPI partition (l (i)) and the high PPI partition (h (i)), illustrating example aging calculations. As shown, the weighting function gradually changes (i.e., increases) as the partition progresses from the low PPI partition 910 to the high PPI partition 930 through the partitions in the transition region 920. Based on the above equation, the transition partition (i.e., T (3)) adjacent to the high PPI partition (h (j)) can have the same aging factor (i.e., f) as the high PPI partitionT(3)＝fH(j)). Likewise, the transition partition (i.e., T (1)) adjacent to the low PPI partition (L (i)) can have the same aging factor (i.e., f) as the low PPI partitionT(1)＝fL(i)). Partitions between adjacent partitions can have aging factors (f) between these aging factorsT(2)). For example, the partition may be an average of other partitions. The example shown in fig. 15 is non-limiting. In general, the transition region 920 may include any number of partitions between the first region and the second region.
The transition region 920 may be designated as a portion of a high PPI region or may be designated as a portion of a low PPI region. In other words, the transition region may have a pixel density (i.e., pixel resolution) that matches the high PPI region or the low PPI region.
