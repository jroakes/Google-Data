- the resource block 230 may extend over a slot 220 , which can be about 0.5 milli-seconds (msec) long and can be part of a subframe 215 , which may be approximately 1.0 msec in duration.
- the resource block 230 may include six or seven symbols, depending on the type of cyclic prefix that is used, and the resource block 230 may include twelve sub-carriers 240 .
- the DL bandwidth can be about five MHz, which results in twenty-five resource blocks 230 . It must be noted, however, that the claimed subject matter is not limited to this particular bandwidth, as it may apply to other suitable ranges.
- the resource block 230 can be comprised of several resource elements 235 , which can represent a single sub-carrier 240 for a period of one symbol.
- reference symbols can be periodically transmitted, such as every sixth sub-carrier 240 and can be staggered in both time and frequency. This pattern is for DL transmissions.

- ID user identification
- SDMA space-division multiple access
- the user ID block 310 identifies the appropriate UEs 130 , and the time/frequency resource assignment block 320 enables the UEs 130 to determine which resources to use for transmitting data on the relevant UL channel.
- the SDMA index 330 can point to a particular DRS format (see FIG. 5 ) with unique cyclic shift so DRS uplink transmissions by each UE 130 of the MU-MIMO group are orthogonal.
- FIG. 4 a method 400 for resource allocation is shown.

- FIG. 5 shows an example of the process described in the method 400 .
- the steps of the method 400 are not limited to the particular order in which they are presented in the figures. Moreover, any of these methods can have a greater number of steps or a fewer number of steps than those shown in the figures.
- pointing values can be assigned to an index associated with one or more UEs, and at step 420 , a UL SG can be transmitted to multiple UEs over a DL channel (i.e., a distinct UL SG is transmitted to each UE). Data may then be received over an UL channel in accordance with the UL SG, as shown at step 430 .
- the base station 110 can assign pointing values to the UEs 130 that make up a MU-MIMO group 150 , and these pointing values can be contained in the SDMA index 330 .
- four UEs 130 may form a MU-MIMO group 150 , and the base station 110 can assign values from the set 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 to the UEs 130 , as shown in the SDMA index 330 of FIG. 5 .
- the base station 110 can arbitrarily assign these values to the UEs 130 or can assign them based on a preferred DRS format for one or more of the UEs 130 .
- the base station 110 can transmit over a DL channel to the UEs 130 of the MU-MIMO group 150 the UL SG 300 .
- the UL SG 300 can include information relating to resource allocation, such as the allocation of resource blocks 230 .
- the UEs 130 may transmit data to the base station 110 in accordance with the resource block 230 allocation of the UL SGs 300 , which the base station 110 can receive and process, assuming suitable channel conditions.
- the four UEs 130 of the MU-MIMO group 150 can be allocated four resource blocks 230 , which are designated as RBs 5 - 8 in the UL subframe 510 of FIG. 5 .
- This resource sharing is associated with MU-MIMO communication systems.
- the SDMA index 330 can point to the DRS format 540 for a particular UE 130 of the MU-MIMO group 150 .
- reference symbols can be transmitted on the fourth symbol of each slot, which is represented by the shaded vertical section in the UL subframe 510 .
- the DRS format 540 can indicate a cyclic shift to be employed by the UEs 130 .
- a UE 130 with an assigned value of “0” in the SDMA index 330 can determine that its DRS format 540 will also be “0,” which is indicated in FIG. 5 . This assignment corresponds to a cyclic shift of “0” of a known pattern for transmission as the reference symbols.
- a UE 130 with an assigned value of “1” in the index 330 can determine that its DRS format will be “1,” as well.
- acknowledgements on acknowledgement channels within a single acknowledgement bank can be transmitted to the UEs, which can provide an indication as to whether the data was correctly received.
- the scheduler 125 can generate acknowledgements, which can be transmitted over acknowledgement channels within the acknowledgment bank 550 to the UEs 130 of the MU-MIMO group 150 .
- An acknowledgement bank which may also be referred to as a physical HARQ indicator channel (PHICH) bank, can be defined as any element that can include indications as to whether a particular transmission was correctly received.
- the acknowledgement bank 550 can include a set of channels that carry ACKs or NACKs.
- the acknowledgement bank 550 may also include twenty-five acknowledgement channels, which refer to the transmissions from the UEs 130 . These acknowledgement channels may also be referred to as PHICHs.
- sharing resources is common in MU-MIMO systems. As such, there may be some ambiguity in the UEs 130 determining which location (i.e., channel) in the acknowledgement bank 530 applies to a particular UE 130 . That is, the UEs 130 that are sharing the resource blocks 230 labeled RB 5 through RB 8 may not be sure which of the acknowledgment channels 5 - 8 to monitor in the acknowledgement bank 550 .
- the multiplexed UEs 130 in the MU-MIMO group 150 may refer to the SDMA index 330 and the allocation of resource blocks 230 to determine which channel in the acknowledgement bank 550 to monitor for the acknowledgements.
- the resource blocks 5 - 8 have been allocated to this particular MU-MIMO group.
- the UEs 130 can then add the value 5, which represents the first resource block in the allocation, and add it to its unique value from the SDMA index 330 to determine the appropriate channel in the acknowledgement bank 550 .
- the UE 130 assigned with the value 0 in the SDMA index 330 can combine this value with the value 5 to determine that its assigned acknowledgement channel in the bank 550 is channel A/N 5 .
- the UE 130 with a value of 1 in the index 330 can determine that its assigned channel is A/N 6 , or value 1 plus value 5.
- the first resource block in the allocation can serve as the reference point for determining the channels, it must be noted that the invention is not so limited, as the second or subsequent resource blocks can serve this function.
- the number of resource blocks 230 in the resource block allocation can be greater than or equal to the number of UEs 130 in the MU-MIMO group 150 .
- the number of resource blocks 230 allocated to the MU-MIMO group 150 can be greater than or equal to four. This constraint can ensure that there is a one-to-one mapping of the SDMA index 330 with the appropriate acknowledgement channels in the acknowledgement bank 550 , which limits the necessary acknowledgement banks 550 to one.
- An adaptive HARQ re-transmission receives an UL SG to indicate a change compared to the UL SG received for the first packet transmission or previous re-transmission.
- the change might be changes to the resource allocation or modulation and coding scheme or some other control attribute.
- a non-adaptive HARQ re-transmission does not receive an UL SG and relies on the information receive from the UL SG corresponding to the first transmission of the packet or a previous re-transmission of the current packet.
- the constraint of limiting the number of allocated resource blocks 230 to a value that is equal to or greater than the number of multiplexed UEs 130 in a MU-MIMO group 150 is useful for employing the SDMA index 330 as an implicit pointer to guide the UEs 130 in determining which channel of the acknowledgement bank 550 to monitor.
- the number of multiplexed UEs 130 is actually greater than the number of allocated resource blocks 230 .
- an alternative technique can be used to guide them in correctly locating their acknowledgement channels.
- a method 600 for selective use of CCE-based implicit pointing is shown.
- this method 600 reference may be made to the other drawings herein, although it must be understood that the method 600 can be practiced in any other suitable system or component using any other suitable modulation scheme or protocol.
- FIGS. 7 and 8 show examples of the processes described in the method 600 .
- the steps of the method 600 are not limited to the particular order in which they are presented in the figures. Moreover, any of these methods can have a greater number of steps or a fewer number of steps than those shown in the figures.
- a base station transmits UL SG scheduling grants are transmitted to one or more UEs on different physical channels of a Physical DL control channel (PDCCH) on a DL sub-frame.
- the UEs can be subset of the UEs in the MU-MIMO group.
- the PDCCH ( 710 in FIG. 7 ) may consist of different time-frequency resource elements which may be grouped to form a control channel element (CCE).
- the physical channel can consist of one or more CCEs.
- FIG. 7 shows an example of 17 different possible physical channels obtained by combining different number of CCEs from a set of 8 CCEs. Physical channels are assigned to UEs on the PDCCH such that there is no overlap between the physical channels of any two UEs.
- the base station In response to the UL SG, the base station, in step 620 , receives data of the allocated resource blocks from at least one of the UEs. The base station then in response to the received data transmits acknowledgements on acknowledgement channels of a acknowledgement bank (PHICH bank, FIG. 7 , 730 ) to the UEs in step 620 .
- the acknowledgement channel used for transmitting the acknowledgement for a UE is based on the location of the physical channel used for transmitting the UL SG for the UE in step 610 .
- the index of the first CCE of the physical channel used for transmitting UL SG to the UE indicates the acknowledgment channel to use in the acknowledgment bank.
- CCE 1 ( 720 in FIG. 7 ) is associated with acknowledgment channel, PHICH 1
- CCE 2 is associated with acknowledgment channel
- PHICH 2 CCE 3 is associated with acknowledgment channel, PHICH 3
- the first CCE of the physical channels 1 , 9 , 13 , 15 , 17 is CCE 1 and thus the PHICH 1 is the acknowledgment channel used for the UE that was transmitted UL SG on any one of these physical channel 1 , 9 , 13 , 15 , or 17 .
- acknowledgment channel PHICH 4 within the acknowledgment bank is used for transmitting the acknowledgement for the UE that was transmitted UL SG on physical channel 4 or 14 (CCE 4 is the first CCE of physical channel 4 , 14 and is associated with acknowledgment channel, PHICH 4 ).
- CCE 4 is the first CCE of physical channel 4 , 14 and is associated with acknowledgment channel, PHICH 4 ).
- pointing to acknowledgment channels on a acknowledgment bank is based on location of the physical channel and in turn on the CCEs used.
- the size of the acknowledgment bank may be approximately equal to the number of possible CCEs in the PDCCH. In another embodiment the size of the acknowledgment bank is approximately equal to the sum of the number of possible CCEs in the PDCCH in each PDCCH candidate uplink search region supported in a given subframe or supported by the network.
- a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communication system may use resource allocation of FIG. 4 or FIG. 6 or a combination thereof.
- resource allocation acknowledgements are transmitted to a subset of UEs using RB based PHICH bank and to another subset of UEs using CCE based PHICH bank.
- the SDMA index can be used to indicate which CCE-based PHICH bank (given multiple CCE-based PHICH banks and no RB based PHICH banks) to use or the SDMA index can be used as an offset to drop down to a lower part of the CCE-based PHICH bank. This allows for only CCE-based pointing.
- a UE's SDMA index is greater than the number of RBs in the MU-MIMO resource allocation then an offset is added to a CCE pointer to locate a portion of the CCE-based PHICH bank.
- the CCE-based PHICH bank size may be extended in this case.
- the offset could be equal to the total number of CCEs allocated for the PDCCHs used for UL SGs (e.g. 8 CCEs maybe allocated for UL SGs for a 5 MHz LTE carrier and hence there 8 PHICHs would be needed).
- Multiple CCE-based banks can be viewed as one large CCE-based bank. For example, the size of the one large CCE-based bank can be larger than the total number of CCEs allocated for all UL SG PDCCHs in a given subframe.
- FIG. 8 Another embodiment for resource allocation and downlink acknowledgement transmission is shown in FIG. 8 .
- a base station transmits uplink scheduling grants to MU-MIMO UEs in a MU-MIMO group indicating a MU-MIMO resource allocation for each UE's first packet transmission.
- UEs in the MU-MIMO group use the CCE pointer-based PHICH bank for locating its acknowledgement channel (PHICH) whenever they receive a scheduling grant otherwise they use the RB pointer-based PHICH bank.
- PHICH acknowledgement channel
- a SDMA index which is used to determine the DRS format (cyclic shift) and when added, for example, to the first resource block index in the MU-MIMO resource allocation determines the PHICH index in the RB-pointer based PHICH bank which is used to locate the acknowledgement channel (PHICH) for retransmissions that did not have a corresponding UL SG.
- the base station does not send uplink scheduling grants to MU-MIMO UEs and the MU-MIMO UEs use the PHICH index determined from the previous UL SG.
- UL SGs are sent to a UE not in the MU-MIMO group (e.g., non-MU-MIMO UE or MU-MIMO UE in another MU-MIMO group) if one or more of its allocated resource blocks is within N resource blocks of the first resource block of the MU-MIMO group resource block allocation.
- the value N can be equal to the number of UEs in the MU-MIMO group, and the UL SG is transmitted over a physical channel that makes up a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH).
- the physical channel is comprised of one or more control channel elements (CCE).
- N is equal to 8.
- the acknowledgement channel used for transmitting acknowledgements to a UE was sent an uplink scheduling grant based on the location physical channel used for transmitting the uplink scheduling grant in the PDCCH.
