- Receiver 100 includes an antenna 102 coupled to an analog amplifier 104 to amplify a received wideband signal.
- the amplified signal is filtered by band pass filter 106 and then received by mixers 108 ( 1 , 2 ) which separates the filtered signal into real and quadrature signals at baseband and high frequencies.
- Amplifiers 110 ( 1 , 2 ) receive the baseband and high frequency signals so that analog low pass filters 112 ( 1 , 2 ) can remove signals outside the baseband frequencies, including the high frequency signals generated by mixers 108 ( 1 , 2 ).
- the analog signal output from the low pass filters 112 becomes a digital signal via analog to digital components 114 ( 1 , 2 ).
- a digital low pass filter 116 ( 1 , 2 ) receives the digital signals and feeds the real and quadrature signals (I_IN and Q_IN) to narrowband interference suppression system 120 , which dynamically suppresses identified narrowband interference and outputs the real and quadrature digital signals to digital receiver 122 .
- FIG. 2 a block diagram illustrates an embodiment of a narrowband interference suppression system 120 according to an embodiment.
- real and quadrature signals I_IN and Q_IN are received at filter banks 202 ( 1 , 2 ), and at adaptive bandpass finite impulse response (FIR) filters 204 ( 1 , 2 ).
- Filter banks 202 ( 1 , 2 ) each separate the real and quadrature signals into bands 1 : n .
- bands 1 : n can be approximately equal in width, and they together cover the desired signal's bandwidth of interest.
- the filter banks include a predetermined number of adjacent narrowband filters, which can be implemented as polyphase filter structures for efficiency. Other types of filter banks can be used as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure.
- Signals in bands 1 : n are each received at magnitude estimate components 206 ( 1 : n ), each of which receives corresponding I and Q signals for each band 1 : n , approximates the magnitude of complex signal formed by the I and Q signals by performing an absolute value of the I and Q signals and adding the larger absolute value of the two signals to 1/4 of the smaller absolute value of the two signals.
- the estimate of the absolute value of the complex signal from the Mth filter bank, where M is a fixed number between 1 and N provides an instantaneous estimate of the signal level of the interference, signal, and noise in the Mth band. This instantaneous signal level is then passed to short term integrators 208 ( 1 :N) which produce an output proportional to the average of the signal level over the period of the integration.
- the period of the integration is chosen such that the signal strength of any found narrowband interferers in each band can be rapidly tracked given each narrowband interferer has a distinct multipath fading profile versus that of the desired on-channel signal. Thus, bands with a high slew rate can be quickly identified.
- Components 202 , 206 and 208 each operate on the narrowband components of the received signal, and can be referred to as a narrowband processing component.
- Soft decision metric generator 210 can be implemented as a low cost and power efficient employed to generate “soft metrics” that are used to “notch out” a narrowband interferences centered at any given in-band location.
- soft decision metric generator 210 In addition to receiving outputs from short term integrators 208 ( 1 : n ), soft decision metric generator 210 also receives an average level of the signal unfiltered. More particularly, the unfiltered signal is received at magnitude estimate component 212 , where the magnitude of the signal is determined and fed to short term integrator 214 . Short term integrator 214 determines the average of the overall unfiltered signal. The output of short term integrator 214 is fed to soft decision metric generator 210 . Components 212 and 214 together provide a wideband processing component because they operate on the entire on-channel received signal.
- Soft decision metric generator 210 also receives soft decision metric thresholds 216 .
- Soft decision metric generator 210 generates (multiple) multi-bit soft decision metrics that include a center frequency select soft metric and/or a stop-band attenuation soft metric (for each interferer).
- the center frequency select metric adjusts the center frequency of the filter such that the the narrowband interferences are sufficiently attenuated.
- the stopband attenuation soft metric determines the amount of selectivity (i.e., stopband attenuation) in the adaptive bandpass filter(s) shown to notch out the narrowband interferences.
- the center frequency select soft metric and the stopband attenuation soft metric are first averaged in long term integrators 218 ( 1 , 2 ), then passed through lookup tables ( 222 and 224 ) before being fed into adaptive bandpass filters 204 ( 1 , 2 ). More specifically, long term integrator 218 ( 1 ) receives a center frequency select, which selects all but a center frequency tap in the case when bandpass “FIR” filters are used. Long term integrator 218 ( 1 ) operates on the soft metrics to avoid rapid changes in the choice of coefficients to be used in adaptive bandpass filters 204 ( 1 , 2 ).
- this integrator While operating in a low bandwidth mode, this integrator averages the soft decisions to prevent chatter or bounce between adjacent coefficient levels at a rapid rate. Such chatter between adjacent coefficient levels during steady state operation can degrade the performance of the receiver since it can cause a dithered frequency response.
- hysterisis is employed to reduce the chatter in the outputs of integrators 218 ( 1 , 2 ).
- Long term integrator(s) 218 ( 2 ) receives stopband attenuation metric(s) that changes the level of the center frequency tap.
- Look up table 1 ( 222 ) receives non-center tap signals, and look up table 2 ( 224 ) receives a center tap signal.
- Look up table 1 determines the amount by which all taps but the center tap should be adjusted, and look up table 2 determines thee amount by which the center tap should be adjusted.
- each adaptive bandpass filter 204 ( 1 , 2 ).
- Bandpass filters 204 ( 1 , 2 ) also receive the real and quadrature components of the signal, as shown.
- Adaptive bandpass filters 204 ( 1 , 2 ) can be implemented as FIR filters or other appropriate filter depending on system requirements, as one of skill in the art will appreciate. In certain circumstances, for example, an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter could be appropriate.
- IIR infinite impulse response
- One method for example, that provides varying levels of stop band attenuation is to store several sets of filter coefficients, one set for each desired attenuation level in a given frequency band.
- Each set of filter coefficients can be configured to be selected to provide a desired stop band and the desired level of attenuation.
- the system stores a set of filter coefficients for each frequency band. For example, if the system uses N frequency bands with M attenuation levels, then the system stores M*N coefficient sets.
- the system could generate IIR filter coefficients when the center frequency metric or the stopband attenuation metric changes using a digital signal processor or custom hardware to implement an algorithm that generates IIR filter coefficients.
- the M filters need not be identical, if the filters are identical, then the same coefficients can be used in each of the M filters. In the case of identical filters using the same coefficients, only N sets of filter coefficients need be stored, one set for each frequency band.
- IIR filters each may require storage of more sets of coefficients or the use of additional filters, IIR filters can, in general, realize a given performance specification with far fewer coefficients than an FIR filter, as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art.
- a block diagram illustrates generation of the center frequency adjust soft metric.
- a center frequency adjust is generated by outputting the index of the narrow band filter bank which exhibits the highest energy over a specified short term integration period as shown in block 302 , which receives the averaged magnitude for each narrow frequency band Ionb_ 1 through Ionb_N 304 , and determines which band has the maximum averaged magnitude.
- the index of that maximum band is output as center frequency adjust soft metric 306 .
- the center frequency adjust metric represents the narrowband filter bank that exhibits the highest energy over a specified short term integration period.
- normalization component 402 receives the identified maximum band determined as part of the calculation of the center frequency adjust soft metric. Normalization component 402 also receives the signal representing the averaged unfiltered signal, noise and interference, Ioch. Normalization component 402 outputs a parameter that can be more easily manipulated. Thus, normalization component 402 can be compared to a block that takes a logarithm of a number, for example. More particularly, in the embodiment shown, normalization is accomplished by directing unfiltered signal Ioch to detector 404 , which determines the number of leading zeros in Ioch.
- the output of detector 404 is then shifted left by a predetermined number of bits in blocks 406 and 408 .
- the identified maximum band is received by shift block 408 .
- the output of shift block 408 and 406 is fed to summer 410 , which acts as a division function operating on the normalized interferer magnitude and the normalized unfiltered signal. More particularly, summer 410 operates to subtract the normalized interferer magnitude from that of the normalized total on-channel signal magnitude.
- Multi-bit comparator 412 receives the output of normalization component 402 as well as programmable soft decision metric thresholds (TH_ 1 :N) 414 . Multi-bit comparator 412 compares the output of normalization component 402 to thresholds 414 .
- Thresholds 414 can be pre-programmed by a user, outside determination mechanism or the like.
- a soft metric is generated based on the threshold window for which the output of summer 410 matches.
- the result 416 represents a soft indication of an amount by which stopband attenuation is necessary.
- the number of regions (n) is reflected in the soft metric as the length of the result will be log 2 N bits wide.
- Multi-bit comparator 412 can be used to control the cutoff (3 dB corner) of the high pass filter.
- the soft decision metric block can compare Iodc and Ioch in many ways. If p(n) has only two states, it is just an off/on switch. In this case, an embodiment can provide for multiplying the interference by a preset gain, Iodc*G, and compare it to the total energy of the band, Ioch to make a decision whether or not to turn on the filter. If a system requires more than two states the comparison can be done between the interference and the total in-channel signal with the interfering band subtracted.
- an output signal p(n) is based on high pass filter coefficients as follows:
- FIG. 5 a block diagram illustrates another embodiment of a narrowband interference cancellation system appropriate for distortion of baseband signals. More particularly, FIG. 5 illustrates a paired down version of FIG. 2 that operates to cancel intermodulation distortion that affect baseband signals.
- second order intermodulation distortion IMD2
- IMD2 can cause problems with analog mixers and other types of analog circuitry do not have acceptable IP2 specifications or if the analog filtering does not sufficiently suppress near-in interferences.
- the near-in interferences become squared signals by the mixer and will be located at baseband DC.
- 3G Third Generation
- UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems
- IMD can be due to a strong EDGE interferer residing within the anti-aliasing filter's bandwidth.
- Narrowband processing block 502 can be implemented as a reduced version of the narrowband processing components shown in FIG. 2 to process the interference. More specifically, filter banks 202 ( 1 , 2 ) shown in FIG. 2 can be implemented as low pass filters 508 ( 1 , 2 ).
- filter banks 202 ( 1 , 2 ) shown in FIG. 2 can be implemented as low pass filters 508 ( 1 , 2 ).
- IIR infinite impulse response
- the IIR filter would attenuate most of a desired WCDMA signal which occupies 1.92 MHz.
- filter banks can be reduced to provide a real and quadrature signal output as shown as the outputs from low pass filters 508 ( 1 , 2 ) in FIG. 5 .
- filter banks instead of low pass filters can implemented to better isolate the IMD signal, or other more complex low pass filters
- the real and quadrature signals are received at magnitude estimator 510 , which outputs the magnitude of the filtered signal and provides the magnitude to short term integrator 512 , which provides the average magnitude over a specified period of time.
- Magnitude estimator 510 and short term integrator 512 can be implemented using the architecture described in FIG. 2 by selecting one band from filter banks 202 ( 1 , 2 ) rather than a plurality of bands 1 - n.
- an integrator which can operate in high bandwidth mode for rapid decisions.
- the first integrator is used to average out the multi-path profile. Also under certain situations such as discontinuous receive (DRX) mode it is valuable to make an estimate of the interference within one GSM slot. This can be accomplished by only using the first integrator stage.
- DRX discontinuous receive
- FIG. 5 also illustrates that wideband processing block 504 can be implemented using magnitude estimate component 212 , and short term integrator 214 shown in FIG. 2 to determine the average of the overall unfiltered signal.
- the unfiltered signal and the output of short term integrator 512 are received at soft decision metric generator 514 , which can be implemented as soft decision metric generator 210 shown in FIG. 2 , but utilizing only those components required for stopband attenuation via altering the center tap, and not using those components required to determine an appropriate center frequency.
- the output of soft decision metric generator 514 is received by long term integrator 516 , which provides an average soft attenuation metric over a period of time.
- Comparator 518 receives the averaged attenuation metric. Comparator 518 functions to compare the relative signal strength of signals Iosig and Iodc
- Comparator 518 also receives a chatter reduction threshold 520 , which functions to reduce chatter by preventing the attenuation metric to alter components too quickly.
- Null controller 522 receives the output of comparator 518 and provides adaptive high pass FIR filters 506 ( 1 , 2 ) with an attenuation signal and also provides the attenuation signal to amplifiers 524 ( 1 , 2 ).
- the integrated magnitudes are converted to dB by using logarithms or normalized by dividing one by the other. Because determining dB and dividing can be costly, an embodiment provides a method that is robust yet low complexity. That is, the output of the comparator can be implemented as a single bit, hard decision. For example, the hard decision can be based on a threshold such that if the signal representing the interference input to the comparator is greater than the threshold, it is assumed that there is interference at DC, and a high pass filter is required to cancel the DC interference. If the interference is below the threshold, it is assumed that the interference has not reached a level that would require blocking DC signals. Such an architecture can be implemented using simple multiplexers as switches and simple high pass filters for applying to the real and quadrature components.
- FIG. 5 illustrates adaptive high pass FIR filters 506 ( 1 , 2 ), which require normalization to provide a multi-bit output.
- normalization is achieved by multiplying both signals Iosig and Iodc by q[n], where q[n] is calculated as follows (b being the bit width of Iosig and Iodc):
- FIG. 2 provides a low cost, low power and high performance method to solve narrowband interference problems for interference at DC by reducing the complexity of the architecture and using the stopband attenuation information determined in the soft metric generator and not the center frequency information.
- the center frequency information is not necessary.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a reduced version of the architecture described with reference to FIG. 2 .
- An exemplary adaptive FIR filter 204 uses the output p(n) from the soft decision generator 210 to adapt high pass filter 204 ( 1 ).
- the adaptation can be done by dynamically updating the center tap of the FIR filter, which will adjust the baseband attenuation.
- Filter 204 ( 1 ) receives both the complex quadrature input Q_IN and p(n) at high pass FIR filter 610 .
- the filtered quadrature signal with attenuation within the stopband is adjusted according to p(n) is received by gain stage 620 .
- Gain stage 620 adjusts the output of filter 610 also according to p(n) to adjust the gain of the filter due to the change in attenuation.
- an adaptation of the filter can be done by adjusting the center tap as follows:
- k is the desired step size for the center tap and p(n) is the threshold level at the output of multi-bit comparator 412 shown in FIG. 4 .
- the null of adaptive FIR filter 208 ( 1 ), the height of the center tap can be adjusted to meet worst case conditions only. More particularly, rather than an “adaptive” FIR filter, in the reduced complexity
- other embodiments provide a more optimal method by using is to use an adaptive FIR which has variable attenuations based upon the relative integrated magnitudes of the desired WCDMA and the IP2 interference.
- FIG. 7 an embodiment illustrated shows the spectral plot as p(n) is varied in an adaptive version of high pass filter 218 ( 1 ) that sets the variables k, with the steps shown in the example with p(n) varying from 1 to 4, and the thresholds based upon predetermined specifications of an analog integrated circuit.
- the pass band remains relatively constant and the group delay remains flat.
- a variable symmetric FIR filter will achieve a flat group delay.
- IIR filters can achieve a similar response with a lower order, IIR filters typically have poor group delay around the null. In communication receivers it is highly desirable to have a flat group delay and a variable FIR to accommodate this need.
- Table 1 illustrates the high pass filter attenuation of IP2 interference as the center tap varies by p(n):
- a varying p(n) permits optimization of the attenuation on the IP2 interference while maintaining the maximum signal strength of the desired WCDMA signal. For example, if presented with an interference at sensitivity +3 dB using 22.3 dB of attenuation, the high pass filter over attenuates the desired signal thereby reducing the signal to noise ratio. Using an adaptive filter, such as illustrated as filter 218 ( 1 ) disclosed herein, p(n) would be set to 1 and the attenuation would be 8.2 dB. These additional steps allow a better resolution and thus will reduce the overall bit error rate degradation and improve (improve the C/I) as the interference becomes weaker.
- a high performance, low cost, low power method and system removes narrowband interferences.
- the method requires at least two components.
- a first component provides control by determining what the attenuation and center frequency of an adaptive filter should be.
- FIG. 8 a spectral plot illustrates the center frequency selection by adjusting filter taps except for the center tap of an adaptive bandpass FIR filter.
- FIG. 9 illustrates stopband attenuation by illustrating adjusting the center tap of an adaptive bandpass FIR filter.
- a second component is an FIR filter that provides high pass filtering.
- the filter bank can be reduced to include a single low pass filter since there is no need to determine the center frequency of the interference.
- the adjustment to the filter is simple because only the center tap needs to be adjusted. For an adjustment to the center frequency, all the other taps need to be modulated, such as multiplying by a constant multiplied by a cosine function.
- using an FIR filter is beneficial to insure a relatively constant group delay in the digital receiver.
- an FIR filter adaptively changes the corner of the FIR filter with a low level of cost and complexity while maintaining constant group delay.
- Block 1010 which provides for receiving an in-channel signal, the signal including quadrature and real signal components.
- Block 1012 provides a decision block wherein the received signal is identified as one of subject to center frequency interference only. If so, the method is directed to perform by applying a reduced architecture. If not, the method is directed to Block 1020 , which provides for filtering the signal in one or more filter banks.
- the filter banks separate the signal into different channels, which can be a plurality of narrowbands. After the narrow bands are determined in filter banks, at least one of the plurality of narrowbands as subject to interference.
- identifying a band subject to interference includes, in block 1030 , estimating the magnitude of each signal associated with each separated band, and then, in block 1040 , determining an average magnitude for each signal using short term integrators.
- the averaged magnitude of each of the narrow band signals is used to identify, in block 1044 , the one or more narrowbands having interference above a threshold.
- Block 1050 provides for receiving a total in-channel signal and, without applying a filter bank. Block 1050 applies whether or not, in decision block 1012 , it is determined if interference is present at a center frequency. Block 1052 provides for determining a magnitude estimate of the entire signal and block 1054 provides for determining an average magnitude estimate of the entire signal in a short term integrator. Following the short term integrator, the gain of the averaged magnitude of the signal can be altered to match that of the average magnitude output from short term integrators of block 1040 .
- the averaged magnitude estimates from block 1054 and block 1040 are received in a soft metric decision generator to provide one or more metrics to enable dynamic alteration of characteristics for filtering the identified narrowband interference. More particularly, block 1056 directs outputting the index of the narrow band filter bank which exhibits the highest energy over a specified short term integration period to provide a central frequency adjust metric.
- Block 1058 provides for receiving a threshold parameter, the identified signal with highest energy and the normalized average magnitude of the total in-channel signal and producing a stopband attenuation metric.
- the component that determines the stopband attenuation metric can be efficiently cost-effectively determined using shifters and comparators.
- Block 1060 provides for determining an average of one or both of the stopband attenuation metric and the center frequency metric in one or more long term integrators.
- the output including the stopband attenuation metric and center frequency metric is received according to block 1062 in respective look-up tables, which provides a table of appropriate parameters for filtering the narrowband interferer.
- Block 1070 provides for filtering the received signal to remove interference in a filter using either or both of the stopband attenuation parameters determined in the look-up table and center frequency paramters. If, in block 1012 , interference is not present in a center frequency, then the filtering can use both types of parameters. If, in block 1012 , interference is present only in a center frequency, the filtering can use only stopband attenuation parameters. As described above, the filtering can be performed by an adaptive bandpass FIR filter to performing different types of narrowband interference, whether it is center frequency interference or narrowband interference spanning a wideband channel. In some embodiments, the filtering can be performed by an IIR filter, and the like, when interference is center frequency interference.
- embodiments described herein include an interference cancellation system that considers the most general interference case i.e. N unknown interferences at N unknown frequencies.
- the interference cancellation system can detect N interferences, estimate N interference center frequencies, and estimate N appropriate attenuations.
- the N center frequencies and N attenuations can create N soft metrics to be used to create N band pass filters.
- embodiments encompass using, for example, one filter to attenuate ten unknown interferences at ten unknown frequencies, but if for example, two interferences at known frequencies are more likely to cause interference, embodiments also provide for having two filters with two soft metric center tap adjustments and no frequency adjustments. Similarly, the detection/estimation procedure can be optimized if and when variables can be replaced with constants.
