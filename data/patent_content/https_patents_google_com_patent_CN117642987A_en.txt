Abstract
In aspects, the high altitude platform station HAPS communicates with the user equipment UE using an adaptive phase change device APD. The HAPS receives characteristics of the APD (805) and selects the APD to include in a wireless communication path with the UE based at least in part on the characteristics (810). The HAPS transmits a resource grant to the APD, the resource grant including an indication of air interface resources for an APD-physical downlink control channel (APD-PDCCH) between the HAPS and the APD (815), transmits an indication of phase vector and timing information for a surface of the APD to the APD using the APD-PDCCH (820), and communicates with the UE using a wireless transmission traveling along a wireless communication path including the surface of the APD (825).
Description
Background
Non-terrestrial based communication systems, such as satellite-based or aircraft-based communication systems, provide flexibility to end users. To illustrate, a single satellite acting as a relay may provide coverage to a remote location that is difficult to reach, such as a mountain or ocean area with limited accessibility.
While the higher frequency ranges of the evolved non-terrestrial communication systems may be used to increase data capacity, the use of these higher frequency ranges to transmit and recover information also presents challenges. For example, higher frequency signals and MIMO (multiple input multiple output) transmissions are more susceptible to multipath fading and other types of path loss, which results in recovery errors at the receiver. Obstructions (e.g., buildings, foliage, vehicles, weather) may prevent and/or inhibit higher frequency transmissions from reaching the intended receiver. Accordingly, it is desirable to correct signal distortion in order to obtain sustainable performance benefits (e.g., increased data capacity) provided by these methods.

Detailed Description
A non-terrestrial network (NTN) may provide ubiquitous coverage for User Equipment (UE) communications using non-terrestrial flying or floating communication platforms (e.g., satellite communication systems, air vehicle platforms, aircraft-based communication platforms, unmanned aerial vehicle-based communication platforms). One of these non-terrestrial flying or floating communication platforms may be referred to as a High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS). Depending on the hardware configuration, HAPS may operate in higher frequency bands (e.g., frequency bands above 6GHz, frequency range 2, millimeter Wave (mm Wave) frequency bands defined by one or more of the 3GPP LTE, 5G NR, or 6G communication standards, such as 26GHz, 28GHz, 38GHz, 39GHz, 41GHz, 57-64GHz, 71GHz, 81GHz, 92GHz frequency bands, 100GHz to 300GHz, 130GHz to 175GHz, or 300GHz to 3THz frequency bands). Communications between HAPS and UEs using these higher frequency bands may encounter line-of-sight challenges that obstruct communications. For example, the UE may experience a block of communication with the HAPS from a fixed object such as a high-rise building or from a moving object such as a cloud. With the recent advances in adaptive phase change devices (APDs), new approaches may be available to improve the quality and/or reliability of communication services provided by non-terrestrial based communication systems.
While the described features and concepts of the systems and methods for adaptive phase change devices for non-terrestrial networks may be implemented in any number of different environments, systems, devices, and/or various configurations, aspects of adaptive phase change devices for non-terrestrial networks are described in the context of the following example devices, systems, and configurations.
Operating environment
Fig. 1 illustrates an example environment 100 that includes a user equipment 110 (UE 110) that may be capable of communicating with a terrestrial base station 120 (shown as terrestrial base stations 121 and 122) via one or more wireless communication links 130 (wireless link 130), which one or more wireless communication links 130 are shown generally as wireless link 131 and wireless link 132. Alternatively or additionally, UE 110 may communicate with one or more non-terrestrial communication platforms shown as HAPS 160 (e.g., HAPS161 and HAPS 162) over one or more of wireless links 130, wireless links 130 being shown generally as wireless link 133 and wireless link 134.UE 110 may communicate directly with the HAPS, as shown by wireless link 133, or UE 110 may communicate with the HAPS around block 103 by reflecting the signal of wireless link 134 using APD 101.
For simplicity, UE 110 is implemented as a smart phone, but may be implemented as any suitable computing or electronic device, such as a mobile communication device, modem, cellular phone, gaming device, navigation device, media device, laptop computer, desktop computer, tablet computer, smart appliance, carrier-based communication system, or internet of things (IoT) device such as a sensor or actuator. The terrestrial base stations 120 (e.g., evolved universal terrestrial radio access network node B, E-UTRAN node B, evolved node B, eNodeB, eNB, next generation node B, gNode B, gNB, ng-eNB, etc.) may be implemented in a macrocell, microcell, small cell, picocell, distributed base station, etc., or any combination thereof.
Land base station 120 communicates with UE 110 using wireless links 131 and/or 132, and wireless links 131 and/or 132 may be implemented as any suitable type of wireless link. Similarly, HAPS160 communicates with UE 110 using wireless links 133 and/or 134. Sometimes, the terrestrial base station 120 communicates with the HAPS160 using a wireless link 135. The radio links 131, 132, 133, 134, and/or 135 include control plane signaling and/or user plane data, such as a downlink of user plane data and control plane information transmitted from the terrestrial base station 120 to the UE 110, a downlink of user plane data and control plane information from the HAPS160 to the UE 110, an uplink of other user plane data and control plane information transmitted from the UE 110 to the terrestrial base station 120, an uplink of other user plane data and control plane signaling transmitted from the UE 110 to the HAPS160, a downlink and uplink communication between the base station and the HAPS, or any combination thereof. The wireless link 130 may include one or more wireless links (e.g., radio links) or bearers implemented using any suitable communication protocol or standard or combination of communication protocols or standards, such as third generation partnership project long term evolution (3 GPP LTE), fifth generation new radio (5G NR), mobile Satellite Services (MSS), and future evolution. In various aspects, base station 120 and UE 110 may be implemented for operation in a below gigahertz frequency band, a below 6GHz frequency band (e.g., frequency range 1), and/or a above 6GHz frequency band (e.g., frequency range 2, millimeter Wave (mm Wave) frequency band) defined by one or more of the 3GPP LTE, 5G NR, or 6G communication standards. Multiple wireless links 130 may be aggregated using carrier aggregation or multiple connection techniques to provide higher data rates for UE 110. The plurality of wireless links 130 from the plurality of terrestrial base stations 120 or HAPS160 may be configured for coordinated multipoint (CoMP) or Dual Connectivity (DC) communications with the UE 110.
The terrestrial base stations 120 form a first wireless communication network, such as a radio access network 140 (e.g., RAN, evolved universal terrestrial radio access network, E-UTRAN, 5G NR RAN, NR RAN), where the RAN 140 communicates with one or more terrestrial core networks 150 (core networks 150). To illustrate, the terrestrial base station 121 connects to the 5G core network 151 (5 gc 151) at interface 102 through an NG2 interface for control plane signaling and using an NG3 interface for user plane data communication. Terrestrial base station 122 connects to evolved packet core 152 (EPC 152) at interface 104 using an S1 interface for control plane signaling and user plane data communications. Alternatively or additionally, the land base station 122 uses the NG2 interface for control plane signaling and is connected to the 5gc 151 through the NG3 interface 107 for user plane data communications. Thus, certain terrestrial base stations 120 may communicate with multiple wireless core networks 150 (e.g., 5gc 151, EPC 152).
In addition to the connection with the core network, the terrestrial base stations 120 may communicate with each other. For example, land base stations 121 and 122 communicate through an Xn interface at interface 105. In some aspects, the terrestrial base station 120 coordinates with the HAPS160 through the wireless link 135 and/or through a connection to the terrestrial core network 150. As another example, the terrestrial core network 150 coordinates with the non-terrestrial core network 155 through the interface 106, as further described.
HAPS160 forms a second wireless communication network, generally labeled non-terrestrial access network 170 (NTN 170) in environment 100. In aspects, UE 110 communicates with the HAPS using wireless links 133 and/or 134, and wireless links 133 and/or 134 may be implemented using a common Radio Access Technology (RAT) for communicating with land base station 120 and/or an NTN RAT different from the RAT for communicating with land base station 120. As one example, a RAT used to communicate with HAPS160 may operate according to frequencies and protocols associated with Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) and the like. Alternatively or additionally, UE 110 communicates with HAPS160 using one or more RATs for communicating with terrestrial base station 120, such as LTE, 5G NR, 6G communications, etc.
In general, HAPS161 and HAPS162 represent non-terrestrial communication platforms and may be, for example, low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites, geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites, high Elliptical Orbit (HEO) satellites, high altitude communication platforms, airborne vehicle platforms, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based communication platforms. HAPS161 and HAPS162 may include onboard processing to implement base station functionality (e.g., a gNode B, a Distributed Unit (DU)) and/or to implement a bent-tube architecture (bent-pipe architecture), where the HAPS acts as a transponder relay. HAPS161 and HAPS162 communicate with elements of NTN 170 through one or more interfaces 180 (shown as interface 181, interface 182, and interface 183). Interface 181 supports an HAPS-to-HAPS link (such as an inter-satellite link (ISL)) that connects HAPS161 and HAPS162, and may be, for example, an optical interface, a laser interface, or a Radio Frequency (RF) interface. Interfaces 182 and 183 support gateway links (GWL) connecting HAPS161 and HAPS162 to non-terrestrial core network 155, such as through one or more ground stations 190 (e.g., remote Radio Units (RRUs)) and interface 196, respectively. The non-terrestrial core network 155 may include and/or communicate with any combination of ground stations (e.g., ground station 190), servers, routers, switches, control elements, and the like. The ground station 190 may alternatively or additionally be referred to as a non-terrestrial base station. As shown, non-terrestrial core network 155 communicates with terrestrial core network 150 via interface 106 and with ground station 190 via interface 196 (e.g., an N1, N2, and/or N3 interface). However, in different configurations, the ground station 190 may be connected to the terrestrial core network through an interface 108 (e.g., an N1, N2, and/or N3 interface) or to the base station 120 through a different interface 193 (shown generally in fig. 1 as an interface to the base station 122).
The non-terrestrial core network 155 can include an APD database 156.APD database 156 stores characteristics of APDs available to NTN. APD database 156 associates the characteristics of each APD with a unique identifier of the corresponding APD. Characteristics include the geographic orientation of the APD, the minimum time for setting a new Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) configuration of the APD, the incidence and reflection angular ranges of the APD, the ability to subdivide the array of multiple configurable surface elements of the RIS panel to enable multiple UEs to communicate with the NTN using the RIS panel, and how much the array of multiple configurable surface elements of the RIS panel can be subdivided, etc. The unique identifier for each APD may be a statically assigned APD-RNTI or another unique identifier, such as an identifier of the APD assigned at the time the APD was installed. Alternatively, APD database 156 may be included in terrestrial core network 150 and accessed from the NTN via interface 106.
Example apparatus
Fig. 2 illustrates an example device diagram 200 of one of UE 110 and base station 120 that may implement aspects of an adaptive phase change device for a non-terrestrial network. For clarity, UE 110 and/or base station 120 may include additional functions and interfaces omitted from fig. 2.
UE 110 includes an antenna 202 for communicating with base stations 120 in RAN 140 and/or HAPS160 in NTN 170, a radio frequency front end 204 (RF front end 204), and one or more wireless transceivers 210 (e.g., LTE transceiver, 5G NR transceiver, and/or 6G transceiver). The RF front end 204 of the UE 110 can couple or connect the wireless transceiver 210 to the antenna 202 to facilitate various types of wireless communications. Antenna 202 of UE 110 may include an array of multiple antennas configured in a similar or different manner from each other. The antenna 202 and RF front end 204 can be tuned and/or tunable to one or more frequency bands and/or various satellite frequency bands defined by 3GPP LTE, 5G NR, 6G communication standards and implemented by the wireless transceiver 210. In some aspects, satellite frequency bands overlap with 3GPP LTE-defined 5G NR-defined and/or 6G-defined frequency bands. In addition, the antenna 202, the RF front end 204, and/or the wireless transceiver 210 may be configured to support beamforming for transmission and reception of communications with the base station 120 and/or the HAPS 160. By way of example and not limitation, antenna 202 and RF front end 204 may be implemented for operation in a sub-gigahertz (GHz) band, a sub-6 GHz band, and/or a higher-than-6 GHz band defined by 3GPP LTE, 5G NR, 6G, and/or NTN communications (e.g., NTN or satellite bands).
UE 110 also includes a processor 212 and a computer-readable storage medium 214 (CRM 214). Processor 212 may be a single-core processor or a multi-core processor composed of various materials such as silicon, polysilicon, high-K dielectric, copper, and the like. The term "computer-readable storage medium" as described herein does not include propagated signals. CRM 214 may include any suitable memory or storage device, such as Random Access Memory (RAM), static RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), read Only Memory (ROM), or flash memory, that may be used to store device data 216 for UE 110. Device data 216 can include user data, sensor data, control data, automation data, multimedia data, beamforming codebooks, applications, and/or operating systems for UE 110, some of which are executable by processor 212 to enable user plane data, control plane information, and user interactions with UE 110.
The CRM 214 of the UE 110 includes a UE protocol stack 218. The UE protocol stack 218 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry that is integrated with or separate from other components of the UE 110. The UE protocol stack 218 may implement any suitable type of communication protocol, such as in a manner similar to the example wireless network stack model 500 described with reference to fig. 5.
The CRM 214 of UE 110 includes an NTN communication manager 220.NTN communication manager 220 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of UE 110. Although shown separately in diagram 200, some implementations include some or all of the functionality provided by UE NTN communication manager 220 within UE protocol stack 218. In other aspects, NTN communication manager 220 enables repeated communications across multiple portions of bandwidth, utilizes HAPS information for UE mobility operations, or implements UE-side aspects of flexible band pairing.
The device diagram of the base station 120 shown in fig. 2 includes a single network node (e.g., a gNode B). The functionality of the base station 120 may be distributed across multiple network nodes or devices and may be distributed in any manner suitable for performing the functionality described herein. The naming of such distributed base station functions is varied and includes terms such as Central Unit (CU), distributed Unit (DU), baseband unit (BBU), remote Radio Head (RRH), radio Unit (RU) and/or Remote Radio Unit (RRU). Base station 120 includes an antenna 252, a radio frequency front end 254 (RF front end 254), one or more wireless transceivers 260 (e.g., one or more LTE transceivers, one or more 5G NR transceivers, and/or one or more 6G transceivers) for communicating with UE 110 and/or HAPS 160. The RF front end 254 of the base station 120 can couple or connect a wireless transceiver 260 to an antenna 252 to facilitate various types of wireless communications. The antenna 252 of the base station 120 may include an array of multiple antennas configured in a similar or different manner to each other. The antenna 252 and RF front end 254 can be tuned and/or tunable to one or more frequency bands and/or various HAPS (satellite) frequency bands defined by the 3GPP LTE, 5G NR, 6G communications standards and implemented by a wireless transceiver 260. In addition, the antenna 252, the RF front end 254, and the wireless transceiver 260 may be configured to support beamforming (e.g., massive multiple-input multiple-output (Massive-MIMO)) for transmission and reception of communications with the UE 110 and/or the HAPS 160.

Although shown separately in diagram 200, some implementations include some or all of the functionality provided by BS NTN communication manager 270 within BS protocol stack 268. In some aspects, BS NTN communication manager 270 manages communication and/or coordination with non-terrestrial communication systems. To illustrate, BS NTN communication manager 270 manages communications (and/or performs other operations and/or analyses) with HAPS 160. Alternatively or additionally, the BS NTN communication manager may implement aspects of repeated communications, flexible band assignments, and/or HAPS information for the UE.
The CRM 264 of the base station 120 also includes a base station manager 274 (BS manager 274) that can control various functions of the base station 120. Alternatively or additionally, BS manager 274 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry that is integrated with or separate from other components of base station 120. In at least some aspects, BS manager 274 configures wireless transceiver 260 to communicate with UE 110, HAPS160, and/or a core network (e.g., terrestrial core network 150, non-terrestrial core network 155). Base station 120 also includes an inter-base station interface 276, such as an Xn and/or X2 interface, which the base station manager configures to exchange user plane data, control plane information, and/or other data/information between other base stations to manage communications of base station 120 with UE 110 and/or HAPS 160. The base station 120 includes a core network interface 278 that the base station manager 274 configures to exchange user plane data, control plane information, and/or other data/information with core network functions and/or entities.

HAPS160 and ground station 190 may include additional functions and interfaces omitted from fig. 3 for visual clarity.
HAPS160 may include onboard processing to implement a single network node (e.g., a gNode B). Alternatively or additionally, HAPS160 implements distributed base station functions, such as Distributed Units (DUs), that communicate with a Central Unit (CU) at ground station 190. In some aspects, HAPS160 implements a bent-tube architecture, where the HAPS acts as a repeater relay for ground station 190.

To illustrate, the antenna 302 and the RF front end 304 may be implemented for operation in any combination of satellite frequency bands. Thus, antenna 302, RF front end 304, and transceiver 306 provide HAPS160 with the ability to receive and/or transmit communications with base station 120, UE 110, another HAPS160, and/or non-terrestrial core network 155.
HAPS160 optionally includes one or more wireless optical transceivers 310 (wireless optical transceivers 310) that may be used to communicate with other devices.

In aspects of an adaptive phase change device for a non-terrestrial network, CRM 316 of HAPS160 includes HAPS protocol stack 320. The HAPS protocol stack 320 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of the HAPS 160. The HAPS protocol stack 320 may implement any suitable type of communication protocol, such as in a manner similar to the example wireless network stack model 500 described with reference to fig. 5.
CRM 316 includes HAPS communications manager 322. The HAPS communications manager 322 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry that is integrated with or separate from other components of the HAPS 160. Although shown separately in diagram 300, some implementations include some or all of the functionality provided by HAPS communications manager 322 within HAPS protocol stack 320.
The device diagram of the ground station 190 shown in fig. 3 can implement a single network node (e.g., a gNode B). Sometimes, the functionality of the ground station 190 may be distributed across multiple network nodes or devices, and may be distributed in any manner suitable for performing the functionality described herein. The naming of such distributed base station functions is varied and includes terms such as Central Unit (CU), distributed Unit (DU), baseband unit (BBU), remote Radio Head (RRH), radio Unit (RU) and/or Remote Radio Unit (RRU). The ground station 190 includes an antenna 352, a radio frequency front end 354 (RF front end 354), one or more wireless transceivers 360 (e.g., one or more LTE transceivers, one or more 5G NR transceivers, and/or one or more 6G transceivers) for communicating with the HAPS 160. The RF front end 354 of the ground station 190 can couple or connect the wireless transceiver 360 to the antenna 352 to facilitate various types of wireless communications.

The ground station 190 may include a radio access network interface 376 (RAN interface 376) to implement an interface 193 to one or more base stations 120. In various aspects, RAN interface 376 is similar to an Xn or X2 interface between terrestrial base stations.

Fig. 4 shows an example device diagram 400 of APD 101. In general, device diagram 400 depicts example entities in which aspects of an adaptive phase change device for a non-terrestrial network can be implemented, but may include additional functions and interfaces omitted from fig. 4 for visual clarity. APD 101 includes one or more antennas 402, a radio frequency front end 404 (RF front end 404), and one or more radio frequency transceivers 406 for wireless communication with base station 120, HAPS160, and/or UE 110. APD 101 may also include a position sensor 408, such as a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) module, that provides position information based on the position of APD 101.
Antenna 402 of APD 101 may include an array of multiple antennas configured in a similar or different manner from one another. In addition, the antenna 402, RF front end 404, and transceiver(s) 406 may be configured to support beamforming for transmission and reception of communications with the base station 120 and/or HAPS 160. By way of example and not limitation, antenna 402 and RF front end 404 may be implemented for operation in a sub-gigahertz frequency band, a sub-6 GHz frequency band, and/or a satellite frequency band. Thus, antenna 402, RF front end 404, and transceiver 406 provide APD 101 with the ability to receive and/or transmit communications with UE 110, base station 120, and/or HAPS160, such as information transmitted using wireless link 134 as further described.
APD 101 includes processor 410 and computer-readable storage medium 412 (CRM 412). Processor 410 may be a single-core processor or a multi-core processor implemented using a homogeneous or heterogeneous core architecture. The computer-readable storage media described herein do not include a propagated signal. CRM 412 may include any suitable memory or storage device, such as RAM, SRAM, DRAM, NVRAM, ROM or flash memory, that may be used to store device data 414 for APD 101. Device data 414 includes an application and/or operating system of APD 101 that can be executed by processor 410 to enable dynamic configuration of APD 101 as further described. The device data 414 also includes one or more codebooks 416 of any suitable type or combination and position information 418 for APD 180. Position information 418 can be obtained or configured using position sensor 408 or programmed into APD 101, such as during installation. Position information 418 indicates the position of APD 101 and may include azimuth, geographic coordinates, orientation, elevation information, and the like. HAPS160, by way of HAPS communications manager 322, can use location information 418 to calculate angle or distance information, such as between HAPS160 and APD 101 and/or between APD 101 and UE 110 of interest. Codebook 416 can include a surface configuration codebook that stores surface configuration information for the RIS of the APDs and a beam scanning codebook that stores pattern, sequence, or timing information (e.g., phase vectors and reflection identifiers) for implementing multiple surface configurations for directing the APDs to perform various reflection beamforming. In some aspects, the surface configuration codebook and the beam scanning codebook include phase vector information, angle information (e.g., calibrated to corresponding phase vectors), and/or beam configuration information.
CRM 412 of APD 101 includes an adaptive phase change device manager 420 (APD manager 420). Alternatively or additionally, APD manager 420 may be implemented in whole or in part as hardware logic or circuitry integrated with or separate from other components of APD 101. Typically, APD manager 420 manages the surface configuration of APD 101, such as by processing information exchanged with a base station over wireless link 134 and using that information to configure reconfigurable intelligent surface 422 (RIS 422) of APD 101. To illustrate, APD manager 420 receives an indication of a surface configuration over wireless link 134 (APD control channel), uses the indication to extract the surface configuration from codebook 416, and applies the surface configuration to RIS 422. Alternatively or additionally, APD manager 420 initiates transmission of uplink messages to a base station or HAPS over wireless link 134, such as acknowledgement/negative acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) for various APD configuration or management commands. In some aspects, APD manager 420 receives an indication of a beam scanning pattern (e.g., a beam scanning pattern index) over wireless link 134 and applies a sequence of various surface configurations to the RIS based on the beam scanning pattern and/or according to synchronization or pattern timing indicated by or received with the indication.
RIS 422 of APD 180 includes one or more configurable surface elements 424, such as configurable electromagnetic elements, configurable resonator elements, or configurable reflective array antenna elements. In general, configurable surface element 424 may be selectively or programmatically configured to control how RIS 422 reflects (e.g., directivities) and/or transforms incident waveforms. By way of example and not limitation, the configurable electromagnetic element includes scattering particles that are electronically connected (e.g., by PIN diodes). Implementations use electronic connections to arrange scattering particles, such as based on reflection principles, to control the directionality, phase, amplitude, and/or polarization of the transformed waveform (from the incident waveform). RIS 422 can comprise an array of configurable surface elements 424, where the array can comprise any number of elements having any size. As described below, the APD uses a guard period between receiving the control information and the reflected signal to provide time to reconfigure RIS 422.
In one aspect, RIS 422 is configured as an antenna to receive APD-physical downlink control channel (APD-PDCCH) transmissions from the HAPS. For example, RIS 422 is coupled to RF front end 404 and/or transceiver 406 to receive control channel information using APD-PDCCH, and in turn to configure RIS 422 to reflect communications between HAPS and UE using the received control channel information (e.g., phase vector and timing information).
In some aspects, the position and/or orientation of APD 101 is configurable, and APD 101 includes a motor controller 426 in communication with one or more motors 428, which motors 428 are operably coupled with the physical chassis of APD 101. Based on commands and control information received, for example, from HAPS160 or base station 120, motor controller 426 can send commands to motor 428 to alter one or more kinematic behaviors of motor 428, which motor 428 can include any suitable type of stepper motor or servo motor. For example, the motor controller 426 may issue commands or control signals that specify the shaft rotation of the stepper motor in degrees, the shaft rotation rate of the stepper motor in Revolutions Per Minute (RPM), the linear movement of the linear motor millimeters (mm), and the linear speed of the linear motor in meters per second (m/s). The one or more motors 428 may in turn be linked to a mechanism that mechanically positions a physical chassis or platform (e.g., avionics of an unmanned aerial vehicle, drives of a linear track system, gimbals within a base station, linear bearings within a base station) that supports APD 101. The physical position, azimuth, or orientation of APD 101 (and/or the platform supporting APD 101) may be changed by commands and signals generated by motor controller 426 and sent to motor 428. In response to receiving the position configuration from the base station or HAPS, APD manager 420 communicates a movement command to motor controller 426 based on the position configuration, such as through a software interface and/or a hardware address. Base station 120 or HAPS160 may reposition or redirect one or more APDs 101 to improve or enable directing wireless signal reflections to UE 110.
Typically, APD 101 can include multiple motors, where each motor corresponds to a different rotational or linear direction of movement. Examples of motors 428 that can be used to control the orientation and position of the APD include linear servomotors that can be part of (i) an orbital system mount for the APD, (ii) a motor that controls the direction and pitch, yaw, roll of the drone carrying the APD, (iii) a radial servomotor or stepper motor that rotates the axis if the APD is in a fixed position or gimbal, etc. For clarity, motor controller 426 and motor 428 are shown as part of APD 101, but in alternative or additional implementations APD 101 communicates with a motor controller and/or motor external to APD. To illustrate, APD manager 420 communicates the position configuration to a motor controller that mechanically positions a platform or chassis supporting APD 101. In aspects, APD manager 420 uses a local wireless link (such asZigbee TM IEEE 802.15.4 or hard-wired link) communicates the position configuration to the motor controller. The motor controller then adjusts the platform based on the position configuration using one or more motors. The platform may correspond to or be attached to any suitable mechanism that supports rotational and/or linear adjustment, such as a drone, rail propulsion system, hydraulic lift system, or the like.
As shown in fig. 4, the position of APD 101 may be defined relative to a three-dimensional coordinate system, with X-axis 430, Y-axis 432, and Z-axis 434 defining a spatial region and providing a framework for indicating a position configuration by rotational and/or linear adjustment. Although these axes are generally labeled as the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis, other frames may be utilized to indicate position configurations. For illustration, the aeroframe reference axes are taken as the vertical (yaw), lateral (pitch) and longitudinal (roll) axes, while the other moving frame reference axes are taken as the vertical, sagittal and frontal axes. As one example, location 436 is generally directed to a center location of APD 101 that corresponds to a baseline location (e.g., location (0, 0) using XYZ coordinates).
In aspects, APD manager 420 communicates a rotation adjustment (e.g., rotation adjustment 438) about X-axis 430 to motor controller 426, wherein the rotation adjustment includes a direction of rotation (e.g., clockwise or counterclockwise), an amount of rotation (e.g., degrees), and/or a rotational speed. Alternatively or additionally, APD manager 420 communicates a linear adjustment 440 along the X-axis, wherein the linear adjustment includes any combination of direction, speed, and/or distance of adjustment. Sometimes APD manager 420 also communicates adjustments about other axes, such as any combination of rotational adjustments 442 about Y-axis 432, linear adjustments 444 along Y-axis 432, rotational adjustments 446 about Z-axis 434, and/or linear adjustments 448 along Z-axis 434. Thus, the position configuration can include a combination of rotational and/or linear adjustments in all three spatial degrees of freedom. This allows APD manager 420 to communicate physical adjustments to APD 101. Alternatively or additionally, the APD manager communicates the RIS surface configuration as further described.
Example protocol stack
Fig. 5 illustrates an example block diagram of a wireless network stack model 500 (network stack 500) that can be employed in accordance with various aspects of an adaptive phase change device for a non-terrestrial network. Network stack 500 characterizes an example terrestrial and/or non-terrestrial communication system used in example environment 100. The network stack 500 includes a user plane 502 and a control plane 504. The upper layers of the user plane 502 and the control plane 504 share a common lower layer in the network stack 500. A wireless device, such as UE 110, base station 120, HAPS160, and/or ground station 190, implements each layer as an entity for communicating with another device using a protocol defined for that layer. For example, the UE 110 uses a Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) entity to communicate with a base station 120 using PDCP and/or a peer PDCP entity in the HAPS 160.
The shared lower layers include a Physical (PHY) layer 506, a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer 508, a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer 510, and a PDCP layer 512.PHY layer 506 provides hardware specifications for devices that communicate with each other. In this way, the PHY layer 506 establishes how devices connect to each other, helps manage how communication resources are shared between devices, and so forth.
The MAC layer 508 specifies how data is transferred between devices. In general, the MAC layer 508 provides the manner in which transmitted data packets are encoded and decoded into bits as part of a transmission protocol.
The RLC layer 510 provides data transfer services to higher layers in the network stack 500. In general, the RLC layer 510 provides error correction, packet segmentation and reassembly, and manages data transfer in various modes such as acknowledged, unacknowledged, or transparent modes.
The PDCP layer 512 provides data transfer services to higher layers in the network stack 500. In general, PDCP layer 512 provides transfer of data for the user plane 502 and the control plane 504, header compression, ciphering, and integrity protection.
Above PDCP layer 512, the stack is split into a user plane 502 and a control plane 504. The layers of user plane 502 include an optional Service Data Adaptation Protocol (SDAP) layer 514, an Internet Protocol (IP) layer 516, a transmission control protocol/user datagram protocol (TCP/UDP) layer 518, and an application layer 520 that communicate data using various interfaces. An optional SDAP layer 514 exists in the 5G NR network. The SDAP layer 514 maps quality of service (QoS) flows for each data radio bearer and marks QoS flow identifiers in uplink and downlink data packets for each packet data session. The IP layer 516 specifies how to pass data from the application layer 520 to the destination node. The TCP/UDP layer 518 is used to verify that data packets intended for the destination node arrive at the destination node, and uses TCP or UDP for data transfer at the application layer 520. In some implementations, the user plane 502 may also include a data service layer (not shown) that provides data delivery services to deliver application data, such as IP packets including web browsing content, video content, image content, audio content, or social media content.
The control plane 504 includes a Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer 524 and a non-access stratum (NAS) layer 526. The RRC layer 524 establishes and releases connections and radio bearers, broadcasts system information, or performs power control. The RRC layer 524 also controls the resource control state of the UE 110 and causes the UE 110 to perform operations according to the resource control state. Exemplary resource control states include a connected state (e.g., RRC connected state) or a disconnected state, such as an inactive state (e.g., RRC inactive state) or an idle state (e.g., RRC idle state). In general, if UE 110 is in a connected state, a connection with base station 120 or HAPS160 is active. In the inactive state, the connection with the base station 120 or HAPS160 is suspended. If the UE 110 is in an idle state, the connection with the base station 120 or the HAPS160 is released. Typically, the RRC layer 524 supports 3GPP access, but does not support non-3 GPP access (e.g., WLAN communications).
NAS layer 526 provides support for mobility management (e.g., using fifth generation mobility management (5 GMM) layer 528) and packet data bearer context (e.g., using fifth generation session management (5 GSM) layer 530) between UE 110 and entities or functions in the core network such as access and mobility management functions of 5gc 151, etc. NAS layer 526 supports both 3GPP and non-3 GPP access.
In UE 110, each layer of both user plane 502 and control plane 504 of network stack 500 interacts with a corresponding peer layer or entity in base station 120, HAPS160, terrestrial core network entity or function, non-terrestrial core network entity or function, ground station, and/or remote service to support user application and control operations of UE 110 in RAN 140.
APD operation using non-terrestrial networks
Fig. 6 illustrates an example 600 of configuring APD 101 in accordance with one or more aspects of an adaptive phase change device for a non-terrestrial network. Example 600 includes an example of HAPS160 and APD 101, which may be implemented similarly as described with reference to fig. 1-4. The RIS implemented by APD 101 comprises an array of "N" configurable surface elements, such as configurable surface element 602, configurable surface element 604, configurable surface element 606, and the like, where "N" represents the number of configurable surface elements of the RIS. For visual brevity, example 600 shows HAPS160 configuring a single APD 101, but HAPS160 may configure additional APDs (not shown in fig. 6).
In some aspects, HAPS160 configures the configurable surface elements of the RIS (e.g., configurable surface elements 602, 604, and 606) to direct how incident waveforms are transformed. For example, and with reference to fig. 1, haps160 analyzes link quality measurements, measurement reports, and/or other values (e.g., downlink quality measurements, uplink quality measurements, historical link quality measurements) to identify channel impairments that affect a wireless link (e.g., wireless link 134) with a UE. By way of example and not limitation, various link quality measurements that do not meet acceptable performance levels may indicate channel impairments, such as delay spread between a first received signal and a last received signal (e.g., receiving multipath rays) exceeding an acceptable delay spread threshold, average time delay (of multipath rays) exceeding an acceptable average time delay threshold, or Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) falling below an acceptable power level threshold. Alternative or additional measurements may be monitored, such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), power information, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) information, channel Quality Indicator (CQI) information, channel State Information (CSI), doppler feedback, block error rate (BLER), quality of service (QoS), hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) information (e.g., first transmission error rate, second transmission error rate, maximum retransmission), uplink SINR, timing measurements, error metrics, and so forth. Alternatively or additionally, HAPS160 uses UE position information to analyze the history to identify channel impairments. To illustrate, HAPS160 may determine from the analysis of the historical data records that the UE position corresponds to a position having a history of channel impairments.
In response to identifying the channel impairment, HAPS160 selects a surface configuration for the RIS of APD 101 that transforms the wireless signal (for implementing the wireless link) to mitigate the channel impairment and improve the received signal quality. As one example, HAPS160 initiates a beamforming process, receives RSRP measurements from a UE as part of the beamforming process, and selects the surface configuration corresponding to the highest RSRP value under the tested conditions.
In an implementation, HAPS160 manages the configuration of the RIS of APD 101 by using a surface configuration codebook 608 that may be preconfigured and/or known by both HAPS160 and APD 101. HAPS160 and APD 101 may maintain multiple surface configuration codebooks, such as multiple surface configuration codebooks corresponding to respective (different) orientations of the (movable) APD. To illustrate, HAPS160 analyzes a surface configuration codebook, which may be based on a current APD orientation, to identify a surface configuration that modifies and/or transforms various signal characteristics of an incident wireless signal, such as modifying one or more desired phase characteristics, one or more amplitude characteristics, polarization characteristics, and the like. Thus, HAPS160 may first select a surface configuration codebook based on the current APD orientation and then identify the surface configuration in the selected surface configuration codebook.
In some implementations, HAPS160 uses the history to select a surface configuration. For example, the base station uses the estimated UE position to retrieve the surface configuration from a history of surface configurations linking the geographic position (e.g., latitude, longitude, altitude) to improve signal quality at that position.
In some cases, HAPS160 transmits a surface configuration codebook 608 and/or a beam scanning codebook (or modifications to any of these codebooks) using wireless link 134 with the APD, such as by transmitting one or more messages using a narrowband APD-physical downlink control channel (APD-PDCCH), as described in further detail below. At times, HAPS160 transmits a plurality of surface configuration codebooks (e.g., codebook 416) to APD 101, such as a first surface configuration codebook for downlink communications, a second surface configuration codebook for uplink communications, a phase vector codebook, a beam scanning codebook, and so forth. In response, APD 101 stores surface configuration codebook 608 and/or other codebooks in CRM, which represent codebook 416 in CRM 412, as described with reference to fig. 4. Alternatively or additionally, APD 101 obtains the surface configuration and other codebooks through a manufacturing (e.g., programming), calibration, or installation process that stores surface configuration codebook 408 and other codebooks in CRM 412 of APD 101 during assembly, installation, calibration, verification, or manual addition or update of the codebooks by an operator.
Surface configuration codebook 608 includes configuration information specifying the surface configuration of some or all of the configurable surface elements (e.g., element 424) used to form the RIS of APD 101. Alternatively or additionally, the surface configuration codebook 608 includes APD positioning information (e.g., azimuth and/or elevation positions of APD/APD surfaces). As one example, each index of the codebook corresponds to a phase vector having configuration information and/or APD positions for each configurable surface element of APD 101. For example, index 0 maps phase configuration 0 to configurable surface element 602, phase configuration 1 to configurable surface element 604, phase configuration 2 to configurable surface element 606, and so on. Similarly, index 1 maps phase configuration 3 to configurable surface element 602, phase configuration 4 to configurable surface element 604, phase configuration 5 to configurable surface element 606, and so on. Surface configuration codebook 608 can include any number of phase vectors that specify configurations for any number of configurable surface elements such that a first phase vector corresponds to a first surface configuration of APD 101 (by configuration for each configurable surface element in the RIS), a second phase vector corresponds to a second surface configuration of APD 101, and so on. In aspects, one or more surface configurations or phase vectors may be mapped or calibrated to specific angle information of incident and/or reflected wireless signals (e.g., reference signals), signal rays, beamformed transmissions of HAPS 160, and the like. Alternatively or additionally, the surface configuration codebook 608 includes a plurality of APD positions for each surface configuration (e.g., a first entry/row in the codebook corresponds to a first surface configuration at a first APD position, and a second entry/row in the codebook corresponds to a first surface configuration at a second APD position).
The surface configuration information stored in the codebook may correspond to a complete configuration specifying an exact configuration (e.g., a configuration utilizing the value) or a delta configuration specifying a relative configuration (e.g., modifying the current state by the value). In one or more implementations, the phase configuration information specifies a direction increment and/or an angular adjustment between the incident signal and the transformed signal. For example, phase configuration 0 may specify an angular adjustment configuration of the element 602 such that the configurable surface element 602 reflects an incident waveform at a "phase configuration 0" that is offset from the angle or direction.
As shown in fig. 6, HAPS160 conveys an indication to APD 101 specifying a surface configuration. In this example, the indication specifies a surface configuration index 610 (SC index 610) that maps to a corresponding surface configuration of APD 101. In response to receiving the indication, APD manager 420 retrieves the surface configuration from surface configuration codebook 608 using the index and applies the surface configuration to the RIS. For example, APD manager 420 configures each configurable surface element as specified by a corresponding entry in surface configuration codebook 608.
In various implementations, HAPS160 conveys timing information (not shown) to APD 101, which may be included with the surface configuration. For example, HAPS160 sometimes indicates to APD 101 and using wireless link 134 a start time for applying the indicated surface configuration or beam scanning pattern, a stop time indicating when the APD may remove and/or change the surface configuration, and/or a timing offset (e.g., advance or delay from the start time) when to begin applying the indicated surface configuration. HAPS160 may synchronize and/or configure APD 101 to a particular UE (e.g., UE 110) by specifying timing information. For example, HAPS160 configures APD 101 for a particular UE by specifying a start time, a stop time, and/or a timing offset corresponding to the time slot assigned to the particular UE and/or compensation of estimated propagation delay. To maintain synchronization timing with HAPS160, APD 101 receives and/or processes HAPS synchronization signals.
In aspects, HAPS160 transmits a message to APD 101 over wireless link 134 indicating a surface configuration, similar to layer 2 or layer 3 control messages that use Information Elements (IEs) to convey information. Alternatively or additionally, HAPS160 uses signaling for rapid surface configuration changes (e.g., surface configuration applied on a slot-by-slot basis) to indicate control information. In aspects, HAPS160 uses APD-PDCCH signaling to transmit surface configuration indications and/or timing information, which allows HAPS160 to dynamically configure APD 101 on a slot-by-slot basis. In some aspects, HAPS160 transmits a surface configuration schedule to the APD indicating when different surface configurations are to be applied to the RIS/configurable surface element. Such surface configuration scheduling may be used to implement either a reflected beam scanning process or an incident beam scanning process.
In aspects, HAPS160 assigns an identity, such as an adaptive phase change device radio network temporary identifier (APD-RNTI), to each APD. The APD-RNTI may be shared across multiple beams of HAPS or across multiple HAPS. For example, HAPS160 and APD 101 may perform a Random Access Channel (RACH) procedure to establish wireless communication with each other, and HAPS160 dynamically assigns a particular APD-RNTI to APD 101 as part of the RACH procedure (e.g., HAPS160 assigns a unique APD-RNTI to each APD with which the HAPS establishes wireless communication).
Fig. 7 illustrates a signaling and control transaction diagram 700 that includes a combination of actions, signaling transactions, and/or control transactions that can be used to perform aspects of an adaptive phase change device for a non-terrestrial network. At 705, HAPS161 and 162 receive characteristics (capabilities) of the available APDs from APD database 156. APD characteristics may be supplied at the HAPS, requested by the HAPS during flight, and/or pushed by the APD database (e.g., when a new APD is added or modified). The APD database may transmit APD characteristics based on the geographic area served by the HAPS or along the flight path of the HAPS before the HAPS needs to access the APDs.
At 710, HAPS161 selects APD 101 for inclusion in a wireless communication path with a UE (shown as UE 111). As described above, HAPS161 selects APD 101 for inclusion in the wireless communication path based on relatively static conditions such as historical channel impairments that typically occur with UE 111 and HAPS161 at a particular geographic location or based on HAPS161 determining (e.g., based on link quality measurements) that dynamic environmental changes have occurred (e.g., cloud drift into the communication path).
Alternatively, at 715, HAPS161 may transmit an APD SIB (system information block) that includes an indication of a bandwidth portion (BWP) for the APD-PDCCH if APD 101 does not have a statically assigned APD-RNTI (such as the APD-RNTI assigned prior to first step 705 of the method depicted in diagram 700; e.g., an APD assigned when the APD is installed and optionally incapable of change). APD SIBs may also optionally include an indication of the periodicity of the APD to search for resource grants on the APD-PDCCH, as described below. To facilitate APD reception of APD SIBs, HAPS161 may broadcast the frequency and timing of APD SIBs in SIB1 (system information block type 1).
At 720, APD 101 performs a RACH procedure with HAPS using the indicated BWP from event 715, which enables HAPS161 to obtain the characteristics of APD 101 and assign APD-RNTI to the APD. In this way, APD 101 can enter a connected state with HAPS161 (similar to the UE RRC connected state). APD 101 can use the RACH procedure to communicate information about the APD to the HAPS in message a (MsgA) or message 3 (Msg 3) of the RACH procedure. For example, the APD can be capable of transmitting the capabilities of the APD to the HAPS by transmitting the capabilities of the APD directly or by transmitting a unique identifier of the APD that can be used to retrieve the capabilities of the APD from the APD database 156. In an alternative aspect, each APD 101 receives a (static) APD-RNTI assignment during the provisioning process.
At 725, HAPS161 schedules air interface resources for APD-PDCCH communications based in part on the characteristics of APD 101. At 730, HAPS161 sends a resource grant to APD 101 that includes an indication of the scheduled air interface resource. HAPS160 may use APD-RNTI associated with a particular APD to indicate APD-specific APD control information (e.g., surface configuration information, timing information, azimuth, and/or movement information) to the APD. For example, HAPS160 scrambles APD control information with an intended APD-RNTI and uses APD-PDCCH to transmit (scrambled) APD-specific APD control information, where the APD-PDCCH may use the same portion of bandwidth as the HAPS uses for user plane downlink communications to UE 110. The corresponding APDs assigned to a particular APD-RNTI identify the APD-PDCCH transmission and descramble the APD control information using the APD-RNTI.
In an alternative, APD 101 checks each slot of the received APD-PDCCH for an indication of a resource grant, APD 101 is configured to search for APD-PDCCH with a given multislot period (similar to idle mode Discontinuous Reception (DRX) of a UE), and/or APD SIB or RACH MsgB or Msg4 may include an indication of when APD 101 should query for a resource grant in APD-PDCCH. At 735, HAPS161 sends an indication of the phase vector and/or timing information to APD 101 using the APD-PDCCH to configure the RIS of APD 101 for communication with UE 111.
After the guard period, HAPS161 and UE 111 communicate using APD 101 to reflect signals between the HAPS and the UE at 740. The (timing) guard period between the APD receiving control information (e.g., phase vector and timing information) from the HAPS allows the APD to transition to reflecting the signal between the HAPS and the UE. The length of the guard period depends on the speed at which the APD can switch the configuration of the RIS 422 to the configuration for reflecting communications between the HAPS and the UE. In the example where multiple HAPS at different heights share an APD, the difference in propagation time between HAPS at different heights may also be included in determining (calculating) the length of the guard period. The HAPS schedule includes APD-PDCCH resources for APD control and air interface resources for resources that reflect signals between the HAPS and the UE. The signals between the HAPS and the UE may range from synchronization signals to reference signals to Physical Broadcast Channels (PBCH), physical Downlink Control Channels (PDCCH), physical Downlink Shared Channels (PDSCH), physical Uplink Control Channels (PUCCH), physical Uplink Shared Channels (PUSCH), and/or other signals. HAPS uses the capability information of APDs in determining scheduling of resources to provide a guard period. For example, the guard period may be the length of the cyclic prefix of the next symbol, the guard period may be the length of one OFDM symbol, or any other suitable length.
At 745, when HAPS161 shares an APD with another HAPS162, HAPS161 shares its resource schedule for APD 101 with another HAPS162. After the first HAPS (e.g., HAPS 161) obtains capability information (characteristics) of APD 101, the first HAPS can share the capability information with other HAPS (e.g., HAPS162 via communication link 181). Sharing APD capability information between multiple HAPS improves the efficiency of the UE's handover from the first HAPS to the second HAPS by eliminating the need to perform additional RACH procedures and/or additional capability lookup of APD database 156.
HAPS in NTN can also share APD-RNTI, whether assigned statically or during RACH procedure. In one example, by sharing APD-RNTI, first HAPS161 can switch UE 111 (e.g., a fixed or near stationary UE) to second HAPS162 using the same APD 101. In another example, the first HAPS161 may switch the UE 111 to a second HAPS162 using another APD (not shown).
In yet another example, the second HAPS162 can use the same APD 101 to communicate with different UEs 112. In this further aspect, the APD is capable of supporting beam reflection for multiple HAPS communicating with different UEs. NTN allocates a time slot for APD availability for each of a plurality of HAPS. For example, multiple UEs may time-share a single APD to reach different HAPS, or different NTNs can share the same APD using different time slots for the various NTNs. HAPS in different NTNs coordinate the use of the same APD by coordinating the slot assignments for the APDs. Each NTN can use the same APD-RNTI for an APD (e.g., a statically assigned APD-RNTI) or a different APD-RNTI (e.g., when an APD-RNTI is assigned during a RACH procedure with a different NTN). If HAPS in different NTNs have different track heights, control signaling timing may be affected and sufficient guard periods between time slots allocated to different HAPS avoid overlapping APDs in a manner that may cause interference.
As indicated at 750, the set of signaling and control transactions included in sub-graph 702 are performed by HAPS162 to schedule resources to communicate with a UE (shown as UE 112) using APD 101. HAPS162 employs shared resource schedule 745 received from HAPS161 to schedule these resources. In one option (not shown), sharing of scheduled resources and/or APD characteristics may be used to facilitate handover of a single UE from the first HAPS161 to the second HAPS 162.
At 755, HAPS162 sends (similar to event 730) a resource grant to APD 101 that includes an indication of the scheduled air interface resource. At 760, HAPS162 sends (similar to event 735) an indication of the phase vector and/or timing information using APD-PDCCH to configure the RIS of APD 101 for communication with UE 112. After the guard period, HAPS162 and UE 112 communicate using APD 101 to reflect signals between the HAPS and the UE at 765 (similar to event 740). APD 101 may thus reflect wireless communications between UE 111 and HAPS161 and UE 112 of a non-terrestrial access network and another HAPS 162.
Example method
Fig. 8 and 9 illustrate example methods 800 and 900 for an adaptive phase change device for a non-terrestrial network. Example method 800 generally involves configuring APDs by HAPS. At 805, a HAPS (e.g., HAPS 161) receives characteristics of an APD (e.g., APD 101). For example, the HAPS receives characteristics of the APD from an APD database (e.g., APD database 156), as described with respect to event 705 of fig. 7. The characteristic is associated with a unique identifier of the APD and includes one or more of: the geographic orientation of the APD, the minimum time for setting a new RIS, the configuration of the APD, the range of incidence angles of the APD, the range of reflection angles of the APD, the ability to subdivide the array of the plurality of configurable surface elements of the RIS panel to enable the plurality of UEs to communicate with the NTN using the RIS panel, and/or how much the array of the plurality of configurable surface elements of the RIS panel can be subdivided.
At 810, the HAPS selects an APD for inclusion in a wireless communication path with a UE (e.g., UE 110) based at least in part on characteristics of the APD. For example, based on the received characteristics and other information, such as the geographic position of the HAPS, the geographic position of the UE, or a change in channel conditions between the HAPS and the UE, the HAPS selects the APD to include in a wireless communication path with the UE, as shown by event 710 of fig. 7.
At 815, the HAPS transmits a resource grant to the APD, the resource grant including an indication of air interface resources for an APD-physical downlink control channel (APD-PDCCH) between the HAPS and the APD. For example, the HAPS transmits a resource grant to the APD indicating when the HAPS will transmit control information to the APD, as shown by events 725, 730, 755 of fig. 7.
At 820, the HAPS uses the APD-PDCCH to transmit an indication of phase vector and timing information for the surface of the APD to the APD. For example, the HAPS transmits control information to configure an RIS (e.g., RIS 422) for communication between the HAPS and the UE, as described by events 735, 760 of fig. 7.
At 825, the HAPS communicates with the UE using wireless transmissions traveling along a wireless communication path that includes reflected wireless transmissions using the surface of the APD. See event 740,765 of fig. 7.
The example method 900 generally involves configuring an APD. At 905, an APD (e.g., APD 101) receives a resource grant from a HAPS (e.g., HAPS 161) that includes an indication of air interface resources for scheduling of APD-PDCCHs between the HAPS and the APD. For example, the APD receives the resource grant as shown by events 730, 755 of fig. 7 in the HAPS and the same BWP that the UE (e.g., UE 110) is to use for communication.
At 910, the APD receives phase vector and timing information for a surface of the APD over the APD-PDCCH. For example, the APD receives phase vectors and timing information as shown by events 735, 760 of fig. 7, which indicates the configuration that the APD is to apply to the RIS (e.g., RIS 422) and the timing during which the configuration indicated by the phase vectors is applied. The HAPS may indicate the configuration (or sequence of configurations) using one or more SC indexes 610 as shown in fig. 6.
At 915, the APD uses the received phase vector and the indication of the timing information to configure the surface of the APD to reflect wireless transmissions from the HAPS to the UE traveling along wireless communication path 134. For example, HAPS applies the configuration indicated by the phase vector to the RIS at the time indicated by the timing information to reflect the wireless signal 134 between the HAPS and the UE.
