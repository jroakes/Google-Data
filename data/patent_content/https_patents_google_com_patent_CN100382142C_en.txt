Embodiment
As top the statement, the present invention is integrated in psychologic acoustics knowledge and hearer's sense of hearing profile in the tone alerts sequence, to obtain the loudest available alarm, keeps desired electric power simultaneously.
By software or firmware update, the present invention works with many present obtainable systems.In one embodiment, the present invention permits a user to this user's audiometrist profile optimization tone alerts.
The critical band of the sense of hearing (critical band) notion is when energy keeps constant in critical band, and loudness will increase (when surpassing critical bandwidth).Briefly,, compared with being grouped in when separating on frequency by specific bandwidth (being called " critical bandwidth ") entirely when a plurality of sounds on the dimensions in frequency, sound will be the loudest.In addition, the dB gain of each sound is selected as the function of hearer's sense of hearing profile.Loudness level lines such as ISO-226 provide such loudness level, and sound is loud equally on entire spectrum in the above.1KHz is perceived as louder than any other sound to the sound between the 4KHz etc. the statement of loudness sound (equal loudnesstones) notion.
In addition, the sense of hearing profile with dysacousis personage of moderate hearing loss generally shows on 2KHz approximately-the high-frequency loss of 10dB.This allows to dwindle the loudness scope, and it is essential by optimizing loudness.When the sound sequence of 1KHz in the 2KHz scope implemented the critical band notion, can see that it is essential that 7 sounds are cut apart to obtain for the optimum loudness for critical band: promptly, 1000,1170,1370,1600,1850,1720 and 2000Hz.Hearer's sense of hearing profile is comprised, to optimize the loudness of alert sequence.
Loudness in the human sensation
Loudness is human sensations to intensity, is the function [will obtain further information, referring to William Hartmann, Signals, Sound, andSensation, Springer, New York, 1998] of intensity of sound, frequency and quality.The acoustic energy level can be expressed as the function of intensity I, and the function of acoustic pressure p, and this is because I ∝ p2 is as follows:
When the reference variable that denominator value is chosen as corresponding to threshold of hearing, a decibel pressure ratio becomes sound pressure level SPL, and a decibel strength ratio becomes strength level.When the intensity that stimulates increases, human sensation (for example sense of hearing) increases with the logarithm degree [will obtain further information, referring to S.Stevens, The direct estimation of sensory magnitudes:loudness, AmericanJournal of Psychology, 69:1-25,1956].For measuring loudness, be necessary to set up such reference, it is associated subjective sensation with physical meaning.Create the loudness level, with the feature of the sensation of loudness of portraying any sound, this is because amplitude Estimation does not provide accurate expression.The loudness level of sound is the sound pressure level of the same 1-KHz tone that rings with the sound of testing.The unit measurement is " phon ", and it is an objective value, and loudness sensation is associated with SPL.Any sound with equal phon level is in equal loudness level.For given SPL, can distribute the phon level to continuous frequency spectrum.The level line of these curves is called contour of equal loudness [will obtain further information, referring to ISO-226, Acoustics-normal equal loudnesscontours, ISO Geneva, Switzerland, 1987].
Fig. 1 explains contour of equal loudness, and it is adapted from ISO-226.Curve set corresponding to the SPL value from threshold of hearing to sense of hearing maximum has defined loudness of equal value in each frequency with phon.Dotted line among Fig. 1 is represented threshold of hearing, reaches the limit of the sensation of loudness at this thresholding.This is created on the 3phon level, and this is because quietly thresholding will obtain further information at the 1KHz place corresponding to 3dB[, referring to E.Zwicker and H.Fastl, Psychoacoustics, SpringerSeries, Berlin, 1998].
Yet phon does not provide the tolerance to the loudness ratio.The loudness calibration provides a kind of measuring unit, and its statement is compared with another (sound), and a sound is felt to ring to what degree.The phon level is set fourth as the required SPL level of identical loudness level of obtaining.It does not set up the tolerance or the unit of loudness." sone " is introduced into, subjective measurement with definition loudness, wherein the sone value is 1 [will obtain further information corresponding to the 1KHz tone in the loudness of the intensity of as a reference 40dB SPL, referring to S.Stevens, The direct estimation of sensorymagnitudes:loudness, American Journal of Psychology, 69:1-25,1956].The ratio of sone ratio definition loudness makes when the sone level is increased to four times that the loudness of feeling also is increased to four times.Acoustic pressure p with the empirical relationship between the loudness S of sone tolerance typically by S ∝ I
kGiven, wherein k ≈ 0.3.Intensity is increased to ten times corresponding to increasing 10phon among the SPL.Because loudness approximately is proportional to the cubic root of intensity, the increase of 10phon roughly is doubled corresponding to the sone value.Sound is perceived as twofold and rings.
Critical band
The notion of the tool ascendant of theory of hearing be the critical band notion [to obtain further information, referring to H.Fletcher and W.J.Munson, Loudness, its definition, measurement, and calculation, J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 5:82-108,1933].The critical band notion is represented by the sense of hearing, with the treatment channel of absolute ratio definition auditory system.Critical band is represented along the constant physical distance of basilar memebrane (basilar membrane) [will obtain further information, referring to E.Zwicker and H.Fastl, Psychoacoustics, SpringerSeries, Berlin, 1998].It represents the signal process within single auditory nerve cell or the fiber.Together dropping on spectral component in the critical band is together handled and [will be obtained further information, referring to E.Zwicker, Procedure for calculating loudness of temporally variablesounds, J Acoust.Soc.Am, 62 (3): 675-682,1977].Critical band is regarded as independently treatment channel.Their common sense of hearings of forming sound are represented.Critical band also is regarded as such bandwidth, and wherein unexpected sensation changes and gain attention [will obtain further information, referring to William Hartmann, Signals, Sound and Sensation, Springer, NewYork, 1998].
Below approximately relate to the critical band rate and bandwidth [will be obtained further information to frequency (kHz), referring to Zwicker and E.Terhardt, Analytic expressions for critical bandrate and critical bandwidth as a function of frequency, J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 68:1523-1525,1980].
Yet, this equation is not the form of closing reversible (not invertible in closed form), reversible process provides in equation (3) followingly [will obtain further information, referring to H.Traunmuller.Analytic expressions for the tonotopic sensory scale, J.Acoust.Soc.AM, 88:97-100,1990].

Fig. 2 linear frequency yardstick that to be explaination provided by equation (2) and (3) is to the figure of the mapping of critical band yardstick.Correspondingly, Fig. 2 shows the critical band yardstick that both set up by equation (2) and (3).Fletcher has disclosed the feature of critical band notion about the original experiment of occlusion.In these experiments, but for the audio of different noise bandwidth assessment pure tone.But experimental result is illustrated the influence that audio only is subjected to the amount of the noise in the critical band.In the time of under bandwidth is reduced to critical bandwidth, the detection threshold of tone reduces.There is auditory filter in the experiment suggestion.Because the noise outside the specific bandwidth does not influence detection threshold, it seems that hearing mechanism (it suppresses these components) be reliable (likely).Auditory filter can be thought of as physiology course, the component outside its suppression filter zone, but the signal within the wave filter is not caused bad influence.The purpose of auditory filter is to isolate interested component of signal, and weakens the signal contribution outside this zone.The zone of boundary definition is a critical bandwidth thus, and experimental result shows that this critical bandwidth increases with the increase of frequency and [will obtain further information, referring to E.Zwicker and H.Fastl, Psychoacoustics, Springer Series, Berlin, 1998].
The critical band notion is crucial for the description sense of hearing especially loudness.If the intensity of sound is fixed, when bandwidth during less than critical bandwidth, the loudness of sound keeps constant [will obtain further information, referring to E.Zwicker and H.Fastl, Psychoacoustics, SpringerSeries, Berlin, 1998].In case bandwidth is increased to above critical band, loudness will increase.When bandwidth surpassed critical bandwidth, loudness increased, and is constant although energy keeps.This is based on such fact, and promptly the human auditory system is a part corresponding to critical band with the wide spectrum analysis.This is also consistent with the auditory filter notion, in the auditory filter notion, frequency is encoded continuously along basilar memebrane, and loudness [will be obtained further information with excitation area is related linearly, referring to A.T.Cacace and R.H.Margolis, On the loudness of complex stimuliand its relationship to cochlear excitation, J Acoust.Soc.Am, 78 (5): 1568-1573,1985].The critical band rate provides the measurement of the continuum of loudness to frequency channels (continuum).Since these auditory channels be process independently, their summation provides the gross rate to the loudness of being felt.
By the discrete unit of each critical band as loudness distributed, might be by the loudness of each phase Calais, critical band unit assessment frequency spectrum [will be obtained further information, referring to E.Zwicker, Procedure for calculating loudness of temporally variablesounds, J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 62 (3): 675-682,1977].The loudness of being felt that representative is generated by sound spectrum with value.The loudness value of each critical band unit is specific loudness, and the critical band unit is called as the Bark unit.Like this, 1Bark is at interval corresponding to given critical band integrated [E.Zwicker and H.Fastl, Psychoacoustics, SpringerSeries, Berlin, 1998].The critical band yardstick is that the frequency of basilar memebrane arrives spatial alternation.
Auditory filter
Subjective hearing test has disclosed with experiment [will obtain further information to the description of auditory filter shape, referring to R.Patterson, Auditory filter shapes derived withnoise, J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 74:640-654,1976 and E.Zwicker and H.Fastl, Psychoacoustics, Springer Series, Berlin, 1998 and B.C.Moore and B.R.Glasberg, Auditory filter shapes derived in simultaneous and forwardmasking, J.Acoust.Soc.America, 70:1003-1014,1981].First estimates [will obtain further information, referring to H.Fletcher and W.J.Munson, Loudness from sound and masking by noise result of experiment, its definition, measurement, and calculation, J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 5:82-108,1933].Fletcher has disclosed the notion of frequency band, and the auditory filter that will define the border of critical band is approximately rectangular filter.The width of auditory filter is generally described with critical band for simplicity.Yet they are not really to be rectangular shape.
The notion of rectangular bandwidth of equal value (ERB) is useful [will obtain further information, referring to William Hartmann, Signals, Sound, andSensation, Springer, New York, 1998] for describing critical bandwidth.ERB is the rectangular filter of unit height and bandwidth, comprises the power identical with critical band in the rectangle.Equation (4) provides the approximate expression of ERB of equation (2) following [will obtain further information, referring to WilliamHartmann, Signals, Sound, and Sensation, Springer, New York, 1998]:
Critical bandwidth is increased to about 500Hz linearly, increases logarithmically and with centre frequency direct ratio ground thereafter.A kind of experimentation that is used for the refining of definite auditory filter shape is [will obtain further information by the noise groove method that Patterson proposes, referring to R.Patterson, Auditory filter shapes derived from noise, J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 74:640-654,1976].It desirably limits masking effect, so that the better observation to the auditory filter process to be provided.At test period, the method is restricted to auditory filter as within the given specific bandwidth of noise groove.It provides a kind of method of depicting the critical band filter shape.Patterson and Nimmo[will obtain further information, referring to R.Patterson, J.Nimmo-Smith and P.Rice, The auditory filterbank, MRC-APU report2341,1991] (roex) function of the choice index (rounded exponential) in suggestion equation (5) is with the auditory filter shape of their experimental result of parametric description, as following the demonstration.

Fig. 3 explains the relevant roex auditory filter response of level of simulation, its corresponding to centre frequency be fc=100Hz, 1KHz, with 50 to 90dB the input level of 3KHz.Low frequency auditory filter slope reduces with level (level), and the high frequency slope increases slightly with level.
Excitation
Loudness is the function of incentive mode, and wherein excitation is the residual response of auditory filter.The incentive mode of sound is the expression of movable or excitation that this sound is caused, its function as characteristic frequency [to obtain further information, referring to E.Zwicker and H.Fastl, Psychoacoustics, Springer Series, Berlin, 1998].Incentive mode is used in all models of loudness.The conventional method that has two kinds of definite incentive modes.
Fig. 4 explains arrowband masking by pure tone thresholding.Correspondingly, Fig. 4 shows that first method (will obtain further information at ISO-532B[, referring to ISO-532, Acoustics-method forcalculating loudness level, ISO Geneva, Switzerland, 1975] the middle use), it is sheltered according to the pure tone of narrow band noise, calculates the expansion that is activated at critical band.The narrow band noise of given frequency is a masking tone, and its frequency of the sound that will detect changes.The thresholding curve that produces is the pattern of sheltering.Masking effect is meant the specific sound unheard phenomenon that becomes near the adjacent sound that rings.But the part masking effect has reduced audio, but does not shelter sound fully.Shelter the frequency of pattern contact test tone and describe masked thresholding.Zwicker and colleague's suggestion, what generate shelters the caused neural activation of modal representation and [will obtain further information, referring to E.Zwicker and E.Terhardt, Analytic expressions for critical bandrate and critical bandwidth as a function of frequency, J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 68:1523-1525,1980].ISO-532B[will obtain further information, referring to ISO-532, BASIC Program for calculating the loudness of sounds fromtheir 1/3-Oct band spectra according to ISO 532 B, Acustica, Letters to theeditors, 55:63-67,1984] in diagram flow process (charting routine) use the method shelter the expansion that rate of curve is calculated excitation.
In second method of proposing, [to obtain further information by Moore and Glasberg, referring to B.C.Moore, B.R.Glasberg and T.Baer, A model for the prediction ofthresholds, loudness, and partial loudness, J.Aud.Eng.Soc., 45 (4): 224-239, April 1997], incentive mode system generates from auditory filter.The expansion of auditory filter shape decision excitation, but not shelter pattern.The pattern of sheltering has reflected uses a plurality of auditory filters, but not the single auditory filter as the critical band.In the method for Moore and Glasberg, determine the auditory filter shape by in the noise groove, searching the sound levels that just can notice.
" groove noise (notch noise) " method of auditory filter shape is depicted in Fig. 5-6 explaination.Correspondingly, Fig. 5-6 shows groove noise method, and it also shows to such an extent that less being subjected to influences the auditory events that the masking effect of the method for Zwicker is made contributions.Groove noise method allows to change the groove center, desirably analysis is restricted to single auditory filter.The auditory filter shape is used to generate incentive mode jointly, and this incentive mode can be regarded as the output of auditory filter, and it is as the function of the centre frequency of auditory filter.
The generation of Fig. 7-8 explaination excitation function, wherein Fig. 7 shows the single auditory filter shape of the sinusoidal input of 1KHz, and Fig. 8 shows the incentive mode of generation.Correspondingly, Fig. 7-8 shows from the incentive mode of the 1KHz sine tone of the roex wave filter derivation of simulation [will obtain further information, referring to Martin Pflueger, Robert Hoeldrich and William Riedler, A nonlinear model of the peripheral auditory system, IEM Report, pages1-10, Feb 1998].The excitation that causes is generated by the output of making contributions of continuous auditoiy filterbank.Component of signal falls within the different auditory filters, and each auditory filter is abideed by its filter shape and responded.Although the auditory filter of this level is symmetrical on the linear frequency scope, the incentive mode of generation is not symmetrical.The auditory filter bandwidth increases with the increase of frequency, and does not separate linearly.These features generate asymmetric excitation function, the more significant excitation of its demonstration upwards expansion [will be obtained further information, referring to B.R.Glasberg and B.C.Moore, Derivation of auditory filter shapes from notched noisedata, Hearing Research, 47:103-138,1990].
The experiment measuring to the auditory filter shape of use groove noise method has disclosed shape and [will obtain further information with the variation of level, referring to R.Hellman, A.Miskiewicz and B.Scharf, Loudness adaptation and excitation patterns:Effects offrequency and level, J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 101 (4): 2176-2185,1997].If auditory filter is linear, then their shape will can not change with the level of input noise, but they have changed really.These observations cause the item that depends on level is included, and count (upper) auditory filter slope in to fall into a trap at equation (7), as shown in Figure 3.
Fig. 9 explaination at the stimulation level of the 1KHz sound that generates by the roex wave filter to the critical band pattern.Correspondingly, Fig. 9 shows the incentive mode of the various dB levels of 1KHz input sine on the critical bandwidth yardstick.Excitation system generates from the output of the Roex auditory filter that equation (7) is described, and calculates in the mode identical with the excitation function of Fig. 7-8.Can see that the excitation slope of Fig. 9 roughly is linear about power level on the critical band yardstick.The absolute thresholding of audiometric curve is described in the equation (20) as dotted line.
The hearing power law
Total loudness N of sound is by obtaining specific loudness N ' along critical band rate yardstick phase Calais.How similar with auditory system in frequency upper integral loudness, with specific loudness component along the ground addition of critical band yardstick increment.Specific loudness is the function of critical band rate z, is called " loudness distribution " or " loudness pattern ".The curve that the loudness mode producing is such, its down area sum be the direct measurement of the loudness felt.
The sensation of Steven law statement intensity increases as the power law of physical strength, the result, the relative variation that can suppose loudness is proportional to the relative variation of intensity [will obtain further information, referring to S.Stevens, The direct estimation of sensory magnitudes:loudness, American Journal of Psychology, 69:1-25,1956].Loudness hearing test experiment shows that the intensity of equal proportion causes the loudness of equal proportion to be estimated.Use specific loudness to substitute total loudness, excitation substitutes intensity, and following relation of plane is true:
Wherein encouraging E is intermediate value, and it is described the auditory filter slope and shelter contribution on the critical band rate.It provides specific strength better being similar to our frequency selectivity hearing.Equation (9) expression difference equation, it causes the power law of hearing.

Zwicker and colleague find that k=0.23 provides coming free narrow band noise to shelter the best-fit of observations of the experiment of pure tone.For k=0.3, compressive non-linearity provides the approximate match to sound, and to k=0: 23, it is that approximate match to masking by noise [will be obtained further information, referring to E.Zwicker and H.Fastl, Psychoacoustics, Springer Series, Berlin, 1998].Provide equation (11) to (16), to mate the loudness measurement under the low-intensity condition better, wherein loudness takes place to change fast.Equation (16) is the correction to general power law, calculates to comprise low-level loudness.For arriving high level among the E, extraneous term can be ignored.Low-level, it has illustrated near the violent decline of observed loudness thresholding.Moore etc. [will obtain further information, referring to B.C.Moore, B.R.Glasberg and T.Baer, Revision of Zwicker ' s loudness model, Acustica, 82:335-445,1996] revised the loudness equation of equation (16), representing the sense of hearing selectivity near quiet level preferablyly, as follows:
Equation (18)
In this equation, when E near E
TQThe time loudness near zero, and when encouraging when reaching thresholding the loudness vanishing.There are two favourable consequences in this simple modifications to the loudness equation.Observed loudness obtains explanation near the violent decline the thresholding in equation, mean with respect to the experiment loudness measurement, obtain better modeling near thresholding low-level and [will obtain further information, referring to B.C.Moore, B.R.Glasberg and T.Baer, Revision of Zwicker ' sloudness model, Acustica, 82:335-445,1996].This allows loudness quick increase of (for example low frequency region) in the high threshold zone.And when excitation increased, thresholding also almost can be ignored in calculating.
External ear is to the inner ear wave filter
External ear is closely related to the frequency selectivity and the loudness sensation of middle ear.The phase one of loudness model is to comprise the transport property of external ear to middle ear.External ear transmission comprises head, external ear, and the form of external auditory meatus, the high-frequency selectivity that it furnishes us with.Middle ear are from eardrum, and as pressure receiver, so that intensity of sound is converted into physical motion.
The intensity of sound is the little Air Force vibration in the big displacement, and required physical motion be on the zonule energetically.Physical motion is sent to inner ear, physical motion is converted to fluctuation here.This complete mutual impedance matching conversion that defined, it is very efficient in the human auditory system.This conversion is represented to the middle ear transmission equation by external ear, and is used as the logarithmic decrement curve A usually

HP(z) equation (19)
According to testing the hearing test result and measuring the modeling external ear to the middle ear transmission equation.A plurality of authors shown to issue among the ISO-226 etc. the isocontour adjustment of loudness.Pfluege etc. have proposed that external ear [will obtain further information to the parameterized model of middle ear transmission equation, referring to Martin Pflueger, Robert Hoeldrich and William Riedler, A nonlinear modelof the peripheral auditory system, IEM Report, pages 1-10, Feb 1998], provide in equation (19) at this model of fs=44.1KHz, with the deviation of explanation parameters R.The response modeling one group of general die-away curve A between loudness level lines such as contrary 100phon (top) and the contrary absolute hearing thresholding curve (bottommost)
0Transmission is characterised in that a series of low-pass filters and Hi-pass filter.8 rank IIR LPF determine total shape, and Hi-pass filter is determined low cut.The R factor is provided with the following LF-response of 1KHz.
Figure 10 explaination is for various R values, and the external ear that is provided by equation (19) is to the middle ear wave filter.Correspondingly, Figure 10 shows the R=0.94 to 0.99 at fs=44.1KHz, and increment is 0.10 wave filter.The loudness model assumption external ear of Zwicker is flat below 2KHz to the middle ear transmission equation, and follows the form of contrary absolute thresholding curve more than 2KHz.The following low frequency thresholding of this model assumption 2KHz is the complete result of inner low-frequency noise, therefore decays in this zone and should not reflect the thresholding of lifting.In the model of Moore and Glasberg, the external ear of supposing is based on loudness level lines such as contrary 100phon for the frequency below the 1KHz to the middle ear transmission equation, and be based on contrary absolute thresholding curve for the frequency more than the 1KHz.This is based on such supposition, and promptly inner ear has the internal noise lower bound, and its level raises to the middle ear transmission equation according to external ear.This level that allows the internal noise lower bound similarly raises along with loudness level such as contrary (rising).
The Zwicker supposition does not have the low-frequency noise lower bound, and the low frequency thresholding is strictly to increase along with the increase of internal noise level.Similar to Zwicker, Moore and Glasberg suppose that also inner ear is similarly responsive for the frequency more than the 1KHz.They propose that the filter shape in this zone is contrary absolute thresholding curve.100phon and absolute thresholding curve (I sense of hearing territory (MAF) be base thereon) also are approximately equivalent more than 1KHz.
The absolute hearing thresholding also can be approximate by following equation, wherein f represents [will obtain further information with KHz, referring to R.Hellman, A.Miskiewicz and B.Scharf, Loudnessadaptation and excitation patterns:Effects of frequency and level, J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 101 (4): 2176-2185,1997].
Equation (20)
Loudness and bandwidth
The loudness model of Moore and Glasberg is made following variation to the model of Zwicker: 1) reexamine the low cut of external ear in the middle ear wave filter; 2) assess excitation based on the analysis expression of the auditory filter that depends on asymmetric level; With 3) by the specific loudness of proposing in the equation (18) incentive relationship is illustrated near quietly loudness increase.Moore and Glasberg are introduced into the revision of the loudness model of Zwicker, the mode that changes with loudness level line levels such as explanations better.For why when sound had the bandwidth of subcritical bandwidth, it is constant that the loudness of the sound of constant intensity keeps, and their model also provides good an explanation.
The experimental result of Zwicker infers that for the bandwidth of subcritical bandwidth, loudness and bandwidth are irrelevant.And when bandwidth surpassed critical band, loudness increased.The incentive mode of all sound is identical within the loudness model assumption critical band of Zwicker [will obtain further information, referring to B.C.Moore, B.R.Glasberg and T.Baer, Revision of Zwicker ' sloudness model, Acustica, 82:335-445,1996].Incentive mode obtains from the pattern of sheltering of the pure tone sheltered by narrow band noise.The model of Moore and Glasberg is derived incentive mode from the auditory filter response, and its shape derives from the data that obtained by the experiment of noise groove.Their auditory filter analysis of passing through provides another alternative viewpoint to the description of incentive mode: loudness keeps constant below critical bandwidth, be not because excitation is identical, but because the total specific loudness that is caused by excitation is constant.When bandwidth surpassed critical band, the contribution that is enlarged the specific loudness that causes by excitation increased.The area that the area that is caused by excitation expansion increases greater than effective breadth reduces.Therefore, compare during with bandwidth subcritical frequency band, the contribution of specific loudness is bigger.
For the purpose of explaination, analog result [will be obtained further information, referring to B.C.Moore, B.R.Glasberg and T.Baer, Revision of Zwicker ' s loudness model, Acustica, 82:335-445,1996] use the auditory filter of equation (7) to duplicate.
Relation between Figure 11-13 explaination loudness and the bandwidth, wherein Figure 11 display centre is that 1KHz, bandwidth are 40,80,160,320,640 and the input narrow band noise of 1280Hz (all being in the constant level of 60dB SPL), Figure 12 shows corresponding incentive mode, and Figure 13 shows the loudness pattern of generation.Correspondingly, Figure 11-13 display centre is that 1KHz, bandwidth are 40,80,160,320,640 and the excitation and the loudness pattern of the narrow band noise of 1280Hz (all being in the constant aggregate level of 60dB SPL).As can seeing from Figure 11-13, for 20 and 160Hz between bandwidth, under the peak value minimizing in specific loudness zone with roughly the same along the slight increase at edge.In this scope, the total area (being loudness) is constant relatively.For the bandwidth on the 160Hz (critical bandwidth of 1KHz tone), enlarge increase the reducing cause by excitation greater than area under the peak value along the specific loudness area at edge.In this case, loudness increases.The model of Moore and Glasberg provides the result who obtains with experience approaching loudness prediction, and the model than Zwicker is more accurate [will to obtain further information, referring to B.C.Moore, B.R.Glasberg and T.Baer, Revision of Zwicker ' s loudness model, Acustica, 82:335-445,1996].Their model is emphasized the frequency selectivity of auditory system, and prediction loudness about intensity, frequency, with the variation of bandwidth on demonstrate success.
The loudness of two sounds of Figure 14-15 explaination equal energy, wherein Figure 14 shows by surpassing separated two sounds of critical band, and Figure 15 shows two sounds of same critical band.Correspondingly, Figure 14-15 shows that it is that twice two sounds and intensity within the critical band is rung that loudness by separated two sounds of critical band sounds.Critical band is as independent processing passage play a role [will obtain further information, referring to William Hartmann, Signals, Sound, and Sensation, Springer, New York, 1998].As a result, loudness not only depends on signal level and bandwidth, and depends on frequency.A simple example is used to show the strength that critical band is cut apart on the perceived loudness.The loudness of two sounds of the equal energy of Figure 14-15 explaination 80dB, it is separated at a) being exceeded a critical band, and b) within same critical band.
For the purpose of explaination, table 1 (below being listed in) shows the loudness of Figure 14 and 15 respectively, and it uses the power law of the sense of hearing, and wherein I is an intensity, and E is excitation, and c is a constant.Loudness by two sounds that surpass a separated equal power of critical band is the twice sound of two sounds within the critical band.But this hint applied mental acoustic signal modeling technique increases perceived loudness, and need not add energy.
The compressive non-linearity of being described by the power law of the sense of hearing discloses the loudness of two sounds that separated by critical band will be louder than two sounds within the critical band.What is interesting is that when being separated by critical band, the loudness of two sounds is doubled haply.This has illustrated the additive notion of loudness, wherein two same sounds that ring, that do not shelter mutually can sound it being that twice when putting together is rung and [will be obtained further information, referring to H.Fletcher and W.J.Munson, Loudness, itsdefinition, measurement, and calculation, J.Acoust.Soc.Am, 5:82-108,1933].This has set up biology prerequisite and the motivation that increases loudness and do not change signal energy.
The effect that table 1. is cut apart by critical band on the loudness of two sounds of the power law description of the sense of hearing
