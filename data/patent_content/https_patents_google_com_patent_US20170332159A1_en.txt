- a basic communication system includes a transmitter that converts a message to an electrical form suitable to be transferred over a communication channel.
- the communication channel transfers the message from the transmitter to the receiver.
- the receiver receives the message and converts it back to its original form.
- Fiber optic communication is an emerging method of transmitting information from a source (transmitter) to a destination (receiver) using optical fibers as the communication channel.
- Optical fibers are flexible, transparent media made of thin glass silica or plastic that transmits light throughout the length of the fiber between the source and the destination.
- Fiber optic communications allow for the transmission of data over longer distances and at higher bandwidth than other known forms of communications.
- Fiber optics are an improved form of communication over metal wires because the light traveled through the fiber experiences less loss and is immune to electromagnetic interference. Companies use optical fibers to transmit telephone signals, interne communication, and cable television signals.
- a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network or fiber access network connects the end users using optical fiber as the last mile connection from the service provider.
- FTTH fiber-to-the-home
- Fiber-optic communication provides a very low loss of signal and very high-bandwidth. These two properties allow service providers to directly connect to end-users from their central office (CO) using a passive fiber plant, which produces capital and operational cost savings.

- Fiber to the home is regarded as the end state of broadband access networks as fiber offers virtually unlimited bandwidth.
- FTTH replaces currently used copper infrastructure (e.g., telephone wires, coaxial cable, etc.).
- Multiplexing is a method used in optical networks to utilize the large bandwidth of optics to their full benefits. Multiplexing enables several virtual channels to be formed on a single fiber. Therefore, multiplexing several optical signals increases the utility of a network infrastructure.
- Time division multiplexing is a method used to multiplex several signals onto one high-speed digital signal on a fiber optic link. TDM multiplexes several signals by establishing different virtual channels using different time slots.
- Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) multiplexes the signals by having different channels use different wavelengths; separate lasers generate these channels and their traffic typically does not interact.
- a laser is a high-frequency generator or oscillator, which requires amplification, feedback, and a tuning mechanism that determines the frequency. Lasers emit light coherently such that the laser output is a narrow beam of light.
- a laser includes a medium that provides the amplification and the frequency, and mirrors that provide the feedback. Photons bounce off one mirror through the medium and head back to another mirror to bounce back for further amplification. One, and sometimes both mirrors, may partially transmit light to allow a fraction of the generated light to be emitted.
- a laser diode is an electrically pumped semiconductor laser having an active medium being a p-n junction. The p-n junction is created by doping (i.e., introduction of impurities into a pure semiconductor to change its electrical properties).
- Fiber-to-the-home is the delivery of a communication signal through optical fibers from an optical line terminal (OLT) housed in a central office (CO) to a home or a business.
- OLT optical line terminal
- CO central office
- FIG. 1A today's FTTH systems are mostly offered through point-to-multi-point time division multiplexed (TDM) passive optical networks 10 (PONs) using a passive optical power splitter at a remote node 70 (RN) in the field to share a common transceiver 50 (OLT) at the CO 40 , or through point-to-point (pt-2-pt) direct connection such as using optical Ethernets (not shown), where a home-run fiber extends all the way back to a CO and each customer is terminated by a separate transceiver, as opposed to the shared transceiver 50 (TDM) as shown.
- TDM point-to-multi-point time division multiplexed
- PONs passive optical power splitter at a remote node 70 (
- a PON 10 is a point-to-multipoint network architecture that uses optical power splitters to enable a single optical feed fiber 20 to serve multiple users 30 a - 30 n (e.g. 16-128).
- PON 10 provides optical signals from a CO 40 and includes an optical transmitter/receiver or transceiver 50 to a number of optical network terminals (ONUs) 60 on the customer premises that each includes a bidirectional optical transceiver.
- ONUs optical network terminals
- a TDM-PON Compared to pt-2-pt home run systems, a TDM-PON provides beneficial savings in the number of feeder fibers 20 (between a remote node 70 and the central office 40 ), and in the number of optical transceivers 50 at the CO 40 while saving patch panel space to terminate fibers.
- TDM-PON does not scale well with bandwidth growth. The bandwidth per household is often oversubscribed, since the bandwidth per optical line terminal transceiver at the central office 40 is shared among all ONUs 60 that are connected to an OLT 40 .
- Pt-2-pt systems provide high bandwidth to end users 30 ; however, pt-2-pt uses a great number of both trunk fibers 20 and optical transceivers 50 . Thus, pt-2-pt systems do not scale well with the OLT 50 at the CO 40 and the fiber count between the CO 40 and the RN 70 , resulting in greater space requirements, higher power, and an increased cost.
- the CO 40 receives information, such as video media distribution 42 , interne data 44 , and voice data 46 that may be transferred to the end users 30 .
- the CO 40 includes an optical line terminal (OLT) 50 connecting the optical access network to an IP, ATM, or SONET backbone, for example. Therefore, the OLT 50 is the endpoint of the PON 10 and converts the electrical signals used by a service provider's equipment and the fiber optic signals used by the PON 10 . In addition, the OLT 50 coordinates multiplexing between the conversion devices at the user end 30 .
- the OLT 50 sends the fiber optic signal through a feeder fiber 20 , and the signal is received by a remote node 70 , which demultiplexes the signal and distributes it to multiple users 30 .
- each CO 40 includes multiple OLTs 50 , 50 a - n.
- Each OLT 50 is configured to provide a signal to a group of users 30 .
- each OLT 50 may be configured to provide signal or services that are in different service, e.g., one OLT provides services in 1G-PON and another provides services in 10G-PON (as will be discussed later).
- the signals of multiple OLT can be multiplexed to form a time-wavelength division multiplexed (TWDM) signal (e.g., first optical system 300 A that includes a multiplexer 310 as shown in FIG. 3A ) before sending it to the remote node 70 .
- TWDM time-wavelength division multiplexed
- Multiplexing combines several input signals and outputs a combined signal having separate signals.
- the multiplexed signal is transmitted through a physical wire, e.g., single optical fiber 20 , which saves the cost of having multiple wires for each signal.
- the CO 40 multiplexes the signals received from several sources, such as video media distribution 42 , Internet data 44 , and voice data 46 , and multiplexes the received signals into one multiplexed signal before sending the multiplexed signal to the remote node 70 through the feeder fiber 20 .
- the multiplexing may be performed by the OLT 50 or a broadband network gateway (BNG) positioned at the CO 40 .
- BNG broadband network gateway
- most services are TDM multiplexed on the packet layer.
- Video content may be carried using Internet protocol (IP) and packet multiplex, or may be a radio frequency overlay on a different wavelength.
- IP Internet protocol
- Each OLT 50 , 50 a - n contains a carrier source (e.g., a laser diode or a light emitting diode) for generating an optical signal that carries the multiplexed signal to the end user 30 .
- a carrier source e.g., a laser diode or a light emitting diode
- a reverse process occurs using a demultiplexer (DEMUX).
- the demultiplexer receives the multiplexed signal and divides it into the separate original signals that were originally combined.
- a photodetector converts the optical wave back into its electric form and is located at the remote node or at the end user 30 .
- the electrical signal is then further de-multiplexed down to its subcomponents (e.g., data over a network, sound waves converted into currents using microphones and back to its original physical form using speakers, converting images converted into currents using video cameras and converting back to its physical form using a television).
- the demultiplexing of the signal occurs after the photodiode in the electrical domain.
- a transceiver or ONU 60 on the user end, includes a carrier source (e.g., laser diode or light-emitting diode) for generating an optical signal that carries the information to be sent from an end user 30 to the CO 40 .
- a carrier source e.g., laser diode or light-emitting diode
- one feeder fiber 20 is employed from the CO 40 to a remote node 70 , where the signal is split by a second optical system 300 B and distributed to, for example, optical network units 60 a - 60 n.
- TDM-PON time division multiplexed PON (passive optical network) technologies (e.g., G-PON or E-PON).
- a TDM-PON shares a single OLT transceiver 50 at the CO 40 with multiple end customers 30 using a splitter at the remote node 70 .
- the central office 40 receives information, such as video media distribution 42 , interne data 44 , and voice data 46 that may be transferred to the end users 30 .
- the CO 40 includes an optical line terminal 50 (OLT) connecting the optical access network to an IP, ATM, or SONET backbone.
- OLT optical line terminal 50
- the OLT 50 device is the endpoint of the PON 10 and converts the electrical signals used by a service provider's equipment and the fiber optic signals used by the PON 10 .
- the OLT 50 coordinates multiplexing between the conversion devices (e.g., the ONUs) at the user end 30 .
- the OLT 50 sends the fiber optic signal through a feeder fiber 20 , and the signal is received by a remote optical distribution node 70 , which splits or demultiplexes the optical signal using second optical system 300 B and distributes it to multiple users 30 .
- TDM-PON The most commonly deployed TDM-PON systems are the GPON system standardized by ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and the EPON system standardized by IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers).
- a GPON system offers 2.5 Gb/s downstream bandwidth and 1.25 Gb/s upstream bandwidths, shared on the feeder fiber 20 , 22 among the users 30 , and connected to the same OLT transceiver 50 .
- GPON systems are mature and very cost effective.
- TDM PON faces difficulty in bandwidth scaling as the optical transceivers of both the OLT 50 and the ONU 60 ends need to operate at the aggregate bandwidth of all of the ONUs sharing the same OLT.
- TDM-PONs typically have a 1:16 to 1:64 power splitting ratio. The average bandwidth per user and PON reach scales inversely with respect to the splitting ratio.
- Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) PON gives each user 30 a dedicated wavelength in each transmission direction.
- WDM-PON network each user 30 is allocated a different wavelength ⁇ for upstreaming data to the CO 40 . Therefore, each ONU 60 uses a wavelength-specific transmitter, such a tunable wavelength laser 200 , to transmit data to the CO 40 at different wavelengths ⁇ .
- the tunable wavelength laser may be tuned at the time of deployment for each particular path 22 (corresponding to a user 30 ), which allows the use of one type of transceiver by all users 30 .
- a TWDM-PON network architecture combines the cost advantage of supporting multiple users 30 on a single wavelength with the wavelength flexibility of WDM-PON, which provides service to multiple users via a single fiber and better utilizes WDM-PON components (e.g., Erbium-Doped Fiber amplifiers (EDFAs)).
- EDFAs Erbium-Doped Fiber amplifiers
- a cyclical AWG 200 is used at the RN 70 . Therefore, it is desirable to design an access network 100 as shown in FIG.
- each TWDM-PON provides different services (e.g., different PON rates for upstreaming and/or downstreaming or different PON protocols).
- hardware changes at the CO 40 must be coordinated with hardware changes at the user's premises (e.g., ONUs 60 ). Since in a TWDM-PON network each OLT 50 in the CO 40 serves multiple ONUs 60 , which are located at individual users' houses, it may be impossible to upgrade all the customer hardware (ONUs 60 ) on the PON 100 simultaneously.
- a cyclical wavelength demultiplexer such as a cyclical arrayed waveguide grating 200 , is used at the RN 70 .
- the use of the cyclical AWG 200 eliminates the need to use tunable filters at the ONUs 60 , which are much more expensive than non-tunable filters.
- the use of cyclical AWG 200 at the remote node 70 has a lower link loss than a large-port-count power splitter.
- Previously proposed TWDM PONs use an optical power splitter at the RN 70 to connect multiple ONUs 60 to each OLT 50 .
- each ONU 60 includes a blocking filter to block out of band wavelengths.
- a tunable ONU 60 is used and includes a tunable narrow band filter. Use of a tunable ONU 60 increases the cost of each ONU 60 , which leads to an increase in the cost of the network 100 .
- the power splitter at the RN 70 may not achieve large split ratios because the total power loss for a large splitter is difficult to overcome by the transmitters and receivers at the OLTs 50 and ONUs 60 .
- a wavelength selective (de)multiplexer such as the cyclical arrayed waveguide grating router (AWG) 200 to greatly increases the maximum split ratio and remove the need for narrow-band filters at the ONUs 60 , thereby reducing the cost (by not using tunable receivers).
- the cyclical AWG 200 decouples the loss from the number of ports, thereby allowing a higher split ratio with lower loss.
- a passive splitter 400 may be used following the second optical system 300 A (that includes the cyclical AWG 200 ).
- the cyclical AWG 200 greatly increases the efficiency of TWDM-PONs.
- Multiple TDM PONs e.g., 1G-PON and 10G-PON
- WDM is utilized to increase overall capacity of the network.
- FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate an exemplary arrayed waveguide grating 200 (AWG).
- An AWG 200 may be used to demultiplex an optical signal in a WDM or a TWDM system.
- AWGs 200 can multiplex a large number of wavelengths into one optical fiber, thus increasing the transmission capacity of optical networks.
- AWGs 200 can therefore multiplex channels of several wavelengths onto a single optical fiber at a transmission end, and reciprocally they can also demultiplex different wavelength channels at the receiving end of an optical communication network.
- An AWG 200 is a passive planar light wave circuit device typically used in optical networks as a wavelength multiplexer and/or demultiplexer.
- N ⁇ N AWGs 200 also have wavelength routing capabilities.
- an N ⁇ N AWG 200 can be designed with an egress port spacing matching the wavelength spacing.
- the N ⁇ N AWG 200 routes differing wavelengths at an ingress port 210 to different egress ports 220 such that all N wavelengths are mapped to all N egress ports 220 N sequentially.
- the routing of the same N wavelengths at two consecutive ingress ports 210 have the wavelength mapping shifted by one egress side.
- the wavelength channels on any ingress repeat at the FSR.
- the AWG 200 receives a first multiplexed optical signal at a first input 210 a (e.g., input 1 ) via a first optical fiber 10 a.
- the AWG 200 demultiplexes the received signal and outputs demultiplexed signals through its outputs 220 , 220 a - n (e.g., outputs 1 - 32 ).
- the AWG 200 is cyclic in nature.
- the wavelength multiplexing and demultiplexing property of the AWG 200 repeats over periods of wavelengths called free spectral range (FSR). Multiple wavelengths, separated by the free spectral range (FSR), are passed down each port 220 . Therefore, by utilizing multiple FSR cycles, different tiered services may coexist on the same fiber plant 20 , 22 .
- the star couplers and the waveguide grating should be carefully designed.
- the arrayed waveguides in the fiber grating should be correctly engineered.
- the phase difference between waveguides in the grating is a factor that determines the FSR B 1 -B 4 of the AWG 200 .
- the channel-by-channel loss profile within one FSR B 1 -B 4 is related with the overlap integral between the eigenmode (natural vibration of the AWG 200 ) of the output channel waveguide and beamlets diffracted from the waveguide arms in the grating.
- the end channels of any FSR B 1 -B 4 typically have a larger loss and compromised pass-band. It is usually optimal to design around four or six more channels than the desired number of channels, thereby wasting four or six channels of bandwidth per cycle, respectively.
- the disadvantage of using a cyclic AWG 200 with small FSR is that the channel spacing may vary slightly from cycle to cycle.
- the wavelength spacing may be wider for longer wavelengths.
- the material dispersion, i.e., the refractive index changing with wavelength, and waveguide cross-section design also contribute to the variation in channel spacing.
- the channel spacing can be optimized by proper material choice and waveguide design.
- a larger AWG 200 is used in combination with splitters (see FIG. 3D ).
- the AWG 200 may have multiple cycles of optical wavelengths ranges with repeating multiplexing and demultiplexing properties. As shown in FIG. 2C , each cycle B 1 -B 4 is often referred to as FSR. A multi-cycle AWG 200 sends multiple wavelengths ⁇ 1 - ⁇ 16 , separated by the FSR, down each port 220 , 220 a - 220 d. In most PON systems, different wavelengths are used for upstream and downstream of signals due to the near-far-effect. The near-far effect is a condition where a receiver captures the reflection of a strong signal (usually from its own transmitter), thereby making it impossible for the receiver to detect a weaker signal.
- a WDM-PON platform uses two FSR cycles of the cyclical AWG 200 (one cycle for downstream transmission and the other cycle for upstream transmission) for each tier of service.
- a second platform uses two FSR cycles of the cyclical AWG 200 (one cycle for downstream transmission and the other cycle for upstream transmission) for each tier of service.
- four usable cycles would allow for the simultaneous use of two platforms.
- Such a system 100 would deliver signals from both platforms to each of the users 30 , and each AWG output 220 would output/receive signals from both platforms.
- Each AWG output 220 is optically connected with at least one ONU 60 , then each ONU 60 would receive signals from both platforms. Having two services hit each ONU 60 is useful during system upgrades and during general use for TWDM systems where each AWG output 220 is connected to multiple ONUs 60 via a power splitter 400 .
- FIG. 2C shows a cyclical AWG 200 having an input 210 a and four outputs 220 , 210 a - 220 b.
- the cyclical AWG 200 receives four FSR (bands) B 1 -B 4 .
- FSRs B 1 and B 2 are used for upstream while FSRs B 3 and B 4 are used for downstream.
- FSR B 1 includes wavelengths ⁇ 1 - ⁇ 4
- FSR B 2 includes wavelengths ⁇ 5 - ⁇ 8
- FSR B 3 includes wavelengths ⁇ 9 0 ⁇ 12
- FSR B 4 includes wavelengths ⁇ 13 ⁇ 16 ; where ⁇ 1 ⁇ 2 ⁇ 3 ⁇ .
- each wavelength ⁇ 1 - ⁇ 16 is outputted from a different output 220 in a cyclical manner.
- the first wavelength ⁇ 1 of the first FSR B 1 is outputted through the first output 210 a of the cyclical AWG 200
- the second wavelength ⁇ 2 of the first FSR B 1 is outputted through the second output 210 b of the cyclical AWG 200
- the third wavelength ⁇ 3 of the first FSR B 1 is outputted through the third output 210 c of the cyclical AWG 200
- the fourth wavelength ⁇ 4 of the first FSR B 1 is outputted through the fourth output 210 b of the cyclical AWG 200 , completing the first cycle.
- the second cycle begins when the first wavelength ⁇ 5 of the second FSR B 2 is outputted through the first output 210 a of the cyclical AWG 200 , the second wavelength ⁇ 6 of the second FSR B 2 is outputted through the second output 210 b of the cyclical AWG 200 , the third wavelength ⁇ 7 of the second FSR B 2 is outputted through the third output 210 c of the cyclical AWG 200 , and the fourth wavelength ⁇ 8 of the second FSR B 2 is outputted through the fourth output 210 b of the cyclical AWG 200 , completing the second cycle.
- the third cycle begins with the first wavelength ⁇ 9 of the third FSR B 3 is outputted through the first output 210 a of the cyclical AWG 200 , the second wavelength ⁇ 10 of the third FSR B 3 is outputted through the second output 210 b of the cyclical AWG 200 , the third wavelength ⁇ 11 of the third FSR B 3 is outputted through the third output 210 c of the cyclical AWG 200 , and the fourth wavelength ⁇ 12 of the third FSR B 3 is outputted through the fourth output 210 b of the cyclical AWG 200 , completing the third cycle.
- the fourth cycle begins with the first wavelength ⁇ 13 of the fourth FSR B 4 is outputted through the first output 210 a of the cyclical AWG 200 , the second wavelength ⁇ 14 of the fourth FSR B 4 is outputted through the second output 210 b of the cyclical AWG 200 , the third wavelength ⁇ 15 of the fourth FSR B 4 3 is outputted through the third output 210 c of the cyclical AWG 200 , and the fourth wavelength ⁇ 16 of the fourth FSR B 4 is outputted through the fourth output 210 b of the cyclical AWG 200 , completing the third cycle.
- each FSR B 1 -B 4 includes four wavelengths ⁇ 1 - ⁇ 16 (FSR B 1 includes wavelengths ⁇ 1 - ⁇ 4 , FSR B 2 includes wavelengths ⁇ 5 - ⁇ 8 , FSR B 3 includes wavelengths ⁇ 9 - ⁇ 12 , FSR B 4 includes wavelengths ⁇ 13 - ⁇ 16 ), and the cyclical AWG 200 includes 4 outputs 210 . Therefore, one wavelength from each FSR B 1 -B 4 outputs each AWG output 220 . In other words, each AWG output 220 outputs a wavelength from an FSR B 1 -B 4 .
- a first platform may use the first FSR B 1 for upstreaming and the third FSR B 3 for downstream, and the second platform may use the second FSR B 2 for upstreaming and the fourth FSR B 4 for downstream.
- the network 100 may support three platforms by using six FSR cycles providing three platforms to each user 30 .
- the network may also provide four platforms by using eight FSR cycles, five platforms by using 10 FSR cycles, and so on.
- each wavelength ⁇ carries multiple users 30 , therefore, the network 100 may be configured to operate different protocols of PONs concurrently to serve different tiers of services (e.g., 1 G-PON and 10 G-PON).
- the service provider at the CO 40 may want to provide a business/premium service on a higher rate upstream/downstream PON and standard residential services on a lower rate upstream/downstream PON.
- the business/premium service may use one of the first and third FSRs B 1 , B 3 or the second and fourth B 2 , B 4
- the low upstream/downstream rate PON may use the other one of the first and third FSRs B 1 , B 3 or the second and fourth B 2 , B 4 .
- the service that the user 30 receives is determined by their respective the customer premises equipment (CPE), more specifically, their ONU 60 .
- CPE customer premises equipment
- the CPE may be configured to receive one or the other of the business premium service or the low upstream/downstream rate service.
- the user 30 wants to upgrade from the low upstream/downstream rate service to the business/premium service, the user 30 has to change/upgrade his CPE to be able to receive the upgraded/premium signals that are being transmitted from the CO 40 .
- a TDM-PON architecture 100 overlays two different services, e.g., 1G-PON MAC 50 a and 10G-PON MAC 50 b.
- the network 100 includes a first optical system 300 A in communication with a second optical system 300 B via a fiber feeder 20 that is arranged to convey a feeder signal S 1 and S 2 .
- the first optical system 300 A includes a multiplexer 310 , such as a band multiplexer.
- the multiplexer 310 is configured to multiplex and demultiplex between a first OLT signal S 1 ( ⁇ 1 - ⁇ 4 , ⁇ 9 - ⁇ 12 ) from the first OLT 50 a (1G-PON), a second OLT signal S 2 ( ⁇ 5 - ⁇ 8 , ⁇ 13 - ⁇ 12 ) from the second OLT 50 b (10G-PON), and the feeder optical signal S 3 of the optical feeder 20 , which includes both the first and second OLT signals S 1 , S 2 .
- the first OLT signal S 1 includes an upstream FSR B 1 and a downstream FSR B 3
- the second OLT signal also includes an upstream FSR B 2 and a downstream FSR B 4 .
- Each FSR B 1 -B 4 has wavelengths ⁇ 1 - ⁇ 16 , different than the other FSRs B 1 -B 4 .
- the second optical system 300 B may be part of or partially part of the remote node 70 .
- the second optical system 300 B is optically connected with the fiber feeder 20 .
- the second optical system 300 B is configured to multiplex and demultiplex between the feeder optical signal S 3 and ONU signals US 1 -US 4 , where the ONU signals US 1 -US 4 are outputted/inputted from output 320 of the second optical system 300 B.
- Each output 320 of the second optical system 300 B is connected to access fibers 22 , 22 a - n that connects it to an associated ONU 60 .
- Each ONU signal US 1 -US 4 includes a first upstream wavelength ⁇ 1 - ⁇ 4 in the first upstream FSR B 1 , a first downstream wavelength ⁇ 9 - ⁇ 12 in the first downstream FSR B 3 , a second upstream wavelength ⁇ 5 - ⁇ 8 in the second upstream FSR B 2 , and a second downstream wavelength ⁇ 13 - ⁇ 16 in the second downstream FSR B 4 . Therefore, the first ONU signal US 1 includes wavelength ⁇ 1 of FSR B 1 , wavelength ⁇ 5 of FSR B 2 , wavelength ⁇ 9 of FSR B 3 , and wavelength ⁇ 13 of FSR B 4 .
- the second ONU signal US 2 includes wavelength ⁇ 2 of FSR B 1 , wavelength ⁇ 6 of FSR B 2 , wavelength ⁇ 10 of FSR B 3 , and wavelength ⁇ 14 of FSR B 4 .
- the third ONU signal US 3 includes wavelength ⁇ 3 of FSR B 1 , wavelength ⁇ 7 of FSR B 2 , wavelength ⁇ 11 of FSR B 3 , and wavelength ⁇ 15 of FSR B 4 .
- the fourth ONU signal US 4 includes wavelength ⁇ 4 of FSR B 1 , wavelength ⁇ 8 of FSR B 2 , wavelength ⁇ 12 of FSR B 3 , and wavelength ⁇ 16 of FSR B 4 .
- the system 100 may include an optical splitter 400 in communication with each output 320 of the second optical system 300 B.
- the optical splitter 400 further expands the network 100 .
- Each optical splitter 400 conveys the signal US 1 -US 4 outputted from each port 320 of the second optical system 300 B to the ONUs 60 .
- the first signal US 1 outputted from the first port 320 a of the second optical system 300 B is split by the power splitter 400 , then the signal US 1 is conveyed to the ONUs 60 that are optically connected to the splitter 400 a.
- each ONU 60 a, 60 b includes the band-pass filter 64 that filters the wavelengths that the ONU 60 is designed to receive.
- the first ONU 60 a includes the band-pass filter 64 that allows wavelengths ⁇ 1 and ⁇ 9 (from the first OLT signal S 1 ) to pass to the colored diplexer 62 and the second ONU 60 b includes the band-pass filter 64 that allows wavelengths ⁇ 5 and ⁇ 13 (from the second OLT signal S 2 ) pass to the colored diplexer 62 .
- the functionality of the band-pass filter 64 maybe a part of the colored diplexer 62 , thus the band-pass filter 64 may not be a physical component in the ONU.
- Each ONU 60 includes a diplexer 62 , which multiplexes first and second ports P 1 , P 2 into a third port P 3 .
- the signals on the first and second ports P 1 , P 2 occupy disjoint frequency bands, i.e., are on different FSRs B 1 -B 4 ; therefore, the signals on the first and second ports P 1 , P 2 can coexist on the third port P 3 . Therefore, as shown in FIG. 3A , the two shorter wavelength bands FSR B 1 and FSR B 2 are used for uplink and the two longer wavelength bands FSR B 3 and FSR B 4 are used for downlink. This relaxes the requirements of the colored diplexer in the ONU 60 .
- each ONU 60 includes the band-pass filter 64 before the diplexer 62 to remove unwanted downlink channels from OLTs 50 for other services.
- the fixed band-pass filter 64 passes frequencies or wavelengths ⁇ within a certain range and rejects (i.e., attenuates) frequencies or wavelengths ⁇ outside that range. Therefore, each band-pass filter 64 passes the desired wavelengths ⁇ associated with the desired service.
- the diplexer 62 inside each ONU 60 also serves as the band-pass filter 64 before the receiver Rx to remove unwanted downlink channels from OLTs 50 for other services.
- the other wavelength downlink signals for the same service are all removed by the cyclic AWG 200 , 200 a.
- the AWG 200 when the cyclical AWG 200 is included in the second optical system 300 B to increase the split ratio of a TWDM-PON system, the AWG 200 only allows discrete (or colored) wavelengths to pass to each user 30 , which allows the effective stacking of multiple PONs on the same feed fiber 20 , 22 .
- FIGS. 3A-3C show 1G-PONs and the 10G-PONs operating over the same fiber plant 20 , 22 concurrently, utilizing the four-cycle AWG 200 .
- the cyclical AWG 200 restricts the possible wavelengths that may be overlayed over a fiber plant 20 , 22 .
- the multiple FSR cycles B 1 -B 4 allow each pair of cycles to serve a different product or network protocol.
- 1G-PON services at the first OLT 50 a use FSR B 1 having wavelengths ⁇ 1 - ⁇ 4 for upstream transmission, and FSR B 3 having wavelengths ⁇ 9 - ⁇ 12 for downstream transmission, e.g., while 10G-PON at the second OLT 50 b uses FSR B 2 having wavelengths ⁇ 5 - ⁇ 8 for upstream transmission and FSR B 4 having wavelengths ⁇ 13 - ⁇ 16 for downstream.
- This spectral allocation allows 1G-PON OLT 50 a and 10G-PON OLT 50 b to operate on the same fiber plant 20 because, as previously discussed with respect to FIG. 2B , each service uses different FSRs for each of its respective upstream and downstream transmission.
- the ONUs 60 , 60 a, 60 b receive both services 1G-PON and 10G-PON services from both OLTs 50 a, 50 b, and each ONU 60 , 60 a, 60 b is configured to select the desirable wavelength (i.e., of the respective service) with the fixed band-pass filter 64 in front of a receiver Rx associated with the ONU 60 .
- the second optical system 300 B includes a cyclical AWG 200 with four output ports 220 , 220 a - d each outputting a signal US 1 -US 4 .
- the second optical system 300 B also includes four outputs 320 a - 320 d.
- the output ports 220 , 220 a - d of the cyclical AWG 200 are aligned with the output ports 320 a - 320 d of the second optical system 300 B. Therefore, the first, second, third, and fourth output ports 220 , 220 a - d of the cyclical AWG 200 are the same as the first, second, third, and fourth output ports of the second optical system 300 B.
- the cyclical AWG 200 b includes eight output ports 220 a - 220 h and the second optical system 300 B includes optical couplers 340 , where each optical coupler 340 combines at least two cyclical AWG output ports 220 .
- power splitters also known as optical couplers 340 , 340 a - 340 d, may be co-located with the AWG 200 to increase the splitting ratio and therefore increase the number of users per feeder fiber.
- AWGs 200 are more expensive than power splitters; so placing the AWG 200 on the OLT 50 side of the power splitter /optical coupler 400 minimizes the number of AWGs 200 within the network 100 .
- FIG. 3E shows a 4-port AWG 200 followed by a 2 ⁇ N optical coupler 400 . As shown, two FSR cycles B 1 and B 3 are used on the AWG 200 .
- FIG. 3D shows a uniform channel spacing on two FSR cycles B 1 -B 4 .
- FIG. 3D is an expansion of the uniform channel spacing on one FSR cycle Bland B 3 as shown in FIG. 3F .
- an AWG 200 with double the number of the channels or outputs 220 may be used. Therefore, to create a N-channel two-cycle device (second optical system 300 B shown in FIG. 3D ), channel 1 and N+1 are fed into the inputs of a 2 ⁇ N optical coupler, 2 and N+2 into another coupler and so on.
- the first output channel 220 a of the AWG 200 connects to the first coupler 400 a
- the second output channel 220 b of the AWG 200 connects to the second coupler 400 b
- the third output channel 220 c of the AWG 200 connects to the third coupler 400 c
- the fourth output channel 220 d of the AWG 200 connects to the fourth coupler 400 d
- the fifth output channel 220 e of the AWG 200 connects to the first coupler 400 a
- the sixth output channel 220 f of the AWG 200 connects to the second coupler 400 b
- the seventh output channel 220 g of the AWG 200 connects to the third coupler 400 c
- the eight output channel 220 h of the AWG 200 connects to the fourth coupler 400 d.
- the first coupler 400 a couples the wavelength from the first output channel 220 a and the fifth output channel 220 e of the AWG 200 .
- the second coupler 400 b couples the wavelength from the second output channel 220 b and the sixth output channel 220 f of the AWG 200 .
- the third coupler 400 c couples the wavelength from the third output channel 220 c and the seventh output channel 220 g of the AWG 200 .
- the fourth coupler 400 d couples the wavelength from the fourth output channel 220 d and the eight output channel 220 h of the AWG 200 .
- the transfer function from the common port or input 210 of the AWG 200 to the output of the couplers 400 is almost identical to the implementation shown in FIG. 3E , except that the channel spacings will be more uniform across the FSRs.
- the second optical system 300 B implements the design of FIG. 3E , which ties two AWG outputs 220 using two-input couplers 400 .
- FIG. 3F Since the design of FIG. 3F may be generalized to multiple coupler ports, to create four FSR B 1 -B 4 cycles for example, outputs 1 , N+1, 2N+1, and 3N+1 must be connected to a four-input coupler 340 , as in FIG. 3D .
- the FSR B 1 -B 4 of any wavelength selective device can be reduced by an integer number using this method, including devices that are already cyclic in nature.
- the second optical system 300 B includes an AWG 200 b having 16 outputs, and four power couplers 340 , 340 a - d, each coupler 340 coupling four wavelengths resulting in the same output as shown in FIG. 3A .
- the system 100 of FIG. 3D may provide for uniform channel spacing between the FSR cycles B 1 -B 4 .
- FIGS. 4A-4D show the progress of a network 100 upgrade where the network 100 includes a single tiered service, the legacy service using the FSR B 1 for upstream and FSR B 3 for downstream.
- FSR B 2 and FSR B 4 are unused as shown in FIG. 4 A.
- the upgrade system/service should operate on the two unused FSRs B 2 , B 4 cycles of the AWG 200 .
- the first service may be provided by a first OLT 50 a while the upgrade may be provided by the second OLT 50 b.
- the first step of the system upgrade is to connect the upgraded system (e.g., OLT 50 b ) to the fiber plant using wavelength selective optical multiplexers (e.g., band multiplexer 310 ).
- the legacy system, OLT 50 a, and the upgraded system OLT 50 b coexist on the same fiber plant 20 , as shown in FIG. 4C .
- the next step of the upgrade is to start upgrading the ONUs 60 with upgraded CPEs that supports the upgraded services.
- each user 30 receives both services as discussed with respect to FIG. 3A . Therefore, when a user upgrades their CPE, the ONU 60 associated with the user 30 receives the upgraded services.
- the third step of the upgrade occurs when all the users 30 have upgraded their legacy ONUs 60 (supporting OLT 50 a ) to ONUs 60 that support the upgraded system (e.g., OLT 50 b ).
- the legacy services are disconnected, i.e., disconnect OLT 50 a, which frees two FSRs (in this case B 1 , B 3 ) that the legacy system was using.
- the capability of performing a network 100 upgrade is highly desirable to an ISP to avoid customer complaints leading to a large number of technical support calls.
- upgrading the services may be easier at the cost of operational complexity, which includes more fibers to be terminated at the OLT 50 side.
- each OLT 50 provides services to multiple ONUs 60 , it is essential for the service provider to prevent late upgraders from losing connectivity altogether.
- OLTs 50 that serve multiple ONUs 60 are: (1) optically integrated OLTs 50 that take advantage of photonic and packaging integration to serve multiple wavelengths; (2) systems that also use time division multiplexing (TDM) in addition to WDM to form a TWDM-PON; or (3) a combination of the two.
- TDM time division multiplexing
- FIGS. 5A-5D show a system 100 upgrade for multiple services.
- the service provider wants to offer different tiered services over the same fiber feeder 20 concurrently.
- the service provider may want to offer a 10G-PON service for business customers and a 2.5G-PON service for residential customers.
- each PON uses two FSR cycles B 1 -B 4 , resulting in a total of four FSR cycles B 1 -B 4 , see FIG. 3A and 5B .
- the service provider needs two additional FSR cycles B 1 -B 4 to upgrade either service seamlessly, resulting in a total of six FSR cycles.
- 5A-D allows the service provider to upgrade the lower tiered service, and then upgrade the higher tiered service with only the four used FSRs B 1 -B 4 .
- the first step of the upgrade is to send out legacy higher tier platform ONUs 60 to all lower tiered service users 30 , which would migrate them to the platform of the higher tier.
- all users 30 receive the two services that two OLTs provide, and based on the CPE equipment at the ONU 60 ( FIGS. 3B and 3C ), the service of the user 30 is determined. Therefore, upgrading the CPE at the ONU 60 allows the user 30 to receive the legacy higher-tier services without changes at the OLTs 50 .
- the service provider configures the CPEs of the previously low-tier customers to limit the traffic allowed to these customers to prevent a dramatic impact of network speed of the legacy high-tier customers.
- the next step in the upgrade is to decommission the legacy low-tier services by decommissioning or disconnecting the legacy low-tier OLTs 50 , which frees up two FSR cycles (e.g., FSR B 1 and B 3 ) as shown in FIG. 5C .
- the service provider installs the upgraded high-tier service on the same wavelength plan (e.g., FSR B 1 and B 3 ) as the legacy low-tier service as shown in FIG. 5D .
- the service provider provides the legacy high-tier users 30 with upgraded ONUs 60 configured to receive the upgraded legacy high-tier services.
- the legacy high-tier service platform becomes the upgraded low-tier service platform.
- the spectrum allocation of the low-tier service and the high-tier service is swapped (i.e., the upgraded low-tier platform uses FSR cycles B 2 and B 4 , while the upgraded high-tier platform uses FSR cycles B 1 and B 3 ).
- the upgrade processes allow for a reduced upgrade cost since the service provider does not cause any noticeable interruptions to the users 30 , thus avoiding service calls.
- the service provider supports a greater number of users 30 with the same number of fibers, thus reducing the number of CO 40 and the amount of feeder fiber required between the CO 40 and the remote node 70 , and ultimately saving operational costs.
- FIG. 6 provides an example arrangement of operations of a method 600 for operating the communication system 100 as discussed in FIGS. 3A-3F .
- the method 600 includes receiving, at a first optical system 300 A and multiplexing/demultiplexing between a first optical line terminal signal S 1 , a second optical line terminal signal S 2 , and a feeder optical signal S 3 including the first optical line terminal signal S 1 and the second optical line terminal signal S 2 .
- the first optical line terminal signal S 1 includes a first upstream free spectral range B 1 and a first downstream free spectral range B 3 .

Description
- This U.S. patent application is a continuation of, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §120 from, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/952,321, filed on Nov. 25, 2015, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
- This disclosure relates to upgrading from a legacy passive optical network (PON) system to an updated system using multi-cycle field arrayed waveguide grating router (AWG).
- A basic communication system includes a transmitter that converts a message to an electrical form suitable to be transferred over a communication channel. The communication channel transfers the message from the transmitter to the receiver. The receiver receives the message and converts it back to its original form.
- Fiber optic communication is an emerging method of transmitting information from a source (transmitter) to a destination (receiver) using optical fibers as the communication channel. Optical fibers are flexible, transparent media made of thin glass silica or plastic that transmits light throughout the length of the fiber between the source and the destination. Fiber optic communications allow for the transmission of data over longer distances and at higher bandwidth than other known forms of communications. Fiber optics are an improved form of communication over metal wires because the light traveled through the fiber experiences less loss and is immune to electromagnetic interference. Companies use optical fibers to transmit telephone signals, interne communication, and cable television signals. A fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network or fiber access network connects the end users using optical fiber as the last mile connection from the service provider.
- Fiber-optic communication provides a very low loss of signal and very high-bandwidth. These two properties allow service providers to directly connect to end-users from their central office (CO) using a passive fiber plant, which produces capital and operational cost savings. As demand for bandwidth in today's Internet continues to increase, as Fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) networks have become a good future proof technology for carriers to wire and rewire customers.
- In a fiber access network, upgrading from one technology to another may be difficult due to updates in hardware at a central office (CO) and at optical network units (ONUs) located at customer premises. In a typical passive optical network (PON), each optical line terminal (OLT) in the CO serves multiple ONUs. Therefore, upgrading the access network may be challenging due to the difficulty in coordinating the timing of hardware upgrades at the ONUs with individual customers. This disclosure provides a system and method of upgrading an access network while providing two concurrent services, a legacy service and an upgraded service, until all the legacy hardware at the ONUs has been upgraded smoothly and gradually.
- One aspect of the disclosure provides a communication system. The system includes a first optical system, a second optical system, and an optical feed fiber connecting the two optical systems.

The second optical line terminal signal includes a wavelength in a second upstream free spectral range and a wavelength in a second downstream free spectral range.

The second optical system is optically connected with the optical feed fiber and configured to multiplex and demultiplex between the feeder optical signal and optical network unit signals.

- Fiber to the home (FTTH) is regarded as the end state of broadband access networks as fiber offers virtually unlimited bandwidth. FTTH replaces currently used copper infrastructure (e.g., telephone wires, coaxial cable, etc.). Multiplexing is a method used in optical networks to utilize the large bandwidth of optics to their full benefits. Multiplexing enables several virtual channels to be formed on a single fiber. Therefore, multiplexing several optical signals increases the utility of a network infrastructure. Time division multiplexing (TDM) is a method used to multiplex several signals onto one high-speed digital signal on a fiber optic link. TDM multiplexes several signals by establishing different virtual channels using different time slots. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) multiplexes the signals by having different channels use different wavelengths; separate lasers generate these channels and their traffic typically does not interact.
- A laser is a high-frequency generator or oscillator, which requires amplification, feedback, and a tuning mechanism that determines the frequency. Lasers emit light coherently such that the laser output is a narrow beam of light. In some implementations, a laser includes a medium that provides the amplification and the frequency, and mirrors that provide the feedback. Photons bounce off one mirror through the medium and head back to another mirror to bounce back for further amplification. One, and sometimes both mirrors, may partially transmit light to allow a fraction of the generated light to be emitted. A laser diode is an electrically pumped semiconductor laser having an active medium being a p-n junction. The p-n junction is created by doping (i.e., introduction of impurities into a pure semiconductor to change its electrical properties).
- Fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) is the delivery of a communication signal through optical fibers from an optical line terminal (OLT) housed in a central office (CO) to a home or a business. Referring to
FIG. 1A , today's FTTH systems are mostly offered through point-to-multi-point time division multiplexed (TDM) passive optical networks 10 (PONs) using a passive optical power splitter at a remote node 70 (RN) in the field to share a common transceiver 50 (OLT) at theCO 40, or through point-to-point (pt-2-pt) direct connection such as using optical Ethernets (not shown), where a home-run fiber extends all the way back to a CO and each customer is terminated by a separate transceiver, as opposed to the shared transceiver 50 (TDM) as shown. APON 10 is a point-to-multipoint network architecture that uses optical power splitters to enable a singleoptical feed fiber 20 to servemultiple users 30 a-30 n (e.g. 16-128).PON 10 provides optical signals from aCO 40 and includes an optical transmitter/receiver or transceiver 50 to a number of optical network terminals (ONUs) 60 on the customer premises that each includes a bidirectional optical transceiver. - Compared to pt-2-pt home run systems, a TDM-PON provides beneficial savings in the number of feeder fibers 20 (between a
remote node 70 and the central office 40), and in the number of optical transceivers 50 at theCO 40 while saving patch panel space to terminate fibers. However, TDM-PON does not scale well with bandwidth growth. The bandwidth per household is often oversubscribed, since the bandwidth per optical line terminal transceiver at thecentral office 40 is shared among all ONUs 60 that are connected to anOLT 40. - Pt-2-pt systems provide high bandwidth to end
users 30; however, pt-2-pt uses a great number of bothtrunk fibers 20 and optical transceivers 50. Thus, pt-2-pt systems do not scale well with the OLT 50 at theCO 40 and the fiber count between theCO 40 and theRN 70, resulting in greater space requirements, higher power, and an increased cost. - The
CO 40 receives information, such asvideo media distribution 42,interne data 44, andvoice data 46 that may be transferred to theend users 30. TheCO 40 includes an optical line terminal (OLT) 50 connecting the optical access network to an IP, ATM, or SONET backbone, for example. Therefore, the OLT 50 is the endpoint of thePON 10 and converts the electrical signals used by a service provider's equipment and the fiber optic signals used by thePON 10. In addition, the OLT 50 coordinates multiplexing between the conversion devices at theuser end 30. The OLT 50 sends the fiber optic signal through afeeder fiber 20, and the signal is received by aremote node 70, which demultiplexes the signal and distributes it tomultiple users 30. In some examples, eachCO 40 includes multiple OLTs 50, 50 a-n. Each OLT 50 is configured to provide a signal to a group ofusers 30. In addition, each OLT 50 may be configured to provide signal or services that are in different service, e.g., one OLT provides services in 1G-PON and another provides services in 10G-PON (as will be discussed later). Where theCO 40 includes more than one OLT 50, the signals of multiple OLT can be multiplexed to form a time-wavelength division multiplexed (TWDM) signal (e.g., firstoptical system 300A that includes amultiplexer 310 as shown inFIG. 3A ) before sending it to theremote node 70. - Multiplexing combines several input signals and outputs a combined signal having separate signals. The multiplexed signal is transmitted through a physical wire, e.g., single
optical fiber 20, which saves the cost of having multiple wires for each signal. As shown inFIG. 1 , theCO 40 multiplexes the signals received from several sources, such asvideo media distribution 42,Internet data 44, andvoice data 46, and multiplexes the received signals into one multiplexed signal before sending the multiplexed signal to theremote node 70 through thefeeder fiber 20. The multiplexing may be performed by the OLT 50 or a broadband network gateway (BNG) positioned at theCO 40. Typically, most services are TDM multiplexed on the packet layer. Video content may be carried using Internet protocol (IP) and packet multiplex, or may be a radio frequency overlay on a different wavelength. Each OLT 50, 50 a-n contains a carrier source (e.g., a laser diode or a light emitting diode) for generating an optical signal that carries the multiplexed signal to theend user 30. On the customers' end, i.e., the ONU 60 at the user end, a reverse process occurs using a demultiplexer (DEMUX). The demultiplexer receives the multiplexed signal and divides it into the separate original signals that were originally combined. In some examples, a photodetector converts the optical wave back into its electric form and is located at the remote node or at theend user 30. The electrical signal is then further de-multiplexed down to its subcomponents (e.g., data over a network, sound waves converted into currents using microphones and back to its original physical form using speakers, converting images converted into currents using video cameras and converting back to its physical form using a television). In TDM PONs, the demultiplexing of the signal occurs after the photodiode in the electrical domain. - A transceiver or ONU 60, on the user end, includes a carrier source (e.g., laser diode or light-emitting diode) for generating an optical signal that carries the information to be sent from an
end user 30 to theCO 40. As shown, onefeeder fiber 20 is employed from theCO 40 to aremote node 70, where the signal is split by a secondoptical system 300B and distributed to, for example, optical network units 60 a-60 n. - Commercial FTTH systems are mostly implemented with TDM (time division multiplexed) PON (passive optical network) technologies (e.g., G-PON or E-PON). A TDM-PON shares a single OLT transceiver 50 at the
CO 40 withmultiple end customers 30 using a splitter at theremote node 70. Thecentral office 40 receives information, such asvideo media distribution 42,interne data 44, andvoice data 46 that may be transferred to theend users 30. TheCO 40 includes an optical line terminal 50 (OLT) connecting the optical access network to an IP, ATM, or SONET backbone. Therefore, the OLT 50 device is the endpoint of thePON 10 and converts the electrical signals used by a service provider's equipment and the fiber optic signals used by thePON 10. In addition, the OLT 50 coordinates multiplexing between the conversion devices (e.g., the ONUs) at theuser end 30. The OLT 50 sends the fiber optic signal through afeeder fiber 20, and the signal is received by a remoteoptical distribution node 70, which splits or demultiplexes the optical signal using secondoptical system 300B and distributes it tomultiple users 30. - The most commonly deployed TDM-PON systems are the GPON system standardized by ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and the EPON system standardized by IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). A GPON system offers 2.5 Gb/s downstream bandwidth and 1.25 Gb/s upstream bandwidths, shared on the
feeder fiber users 30, and connected to the same OLT transceiver 50. GPON systems are mature and very cost effective. TDM PON faces difficulty in bandwidth scaling as the optical transceivers of both the OLT 50 and the ONU 60 ends need to operate at the aggregate bandwidth of all of the ONUs sharing the same OLT. TDM-PONs typically have a 1:16 to 1:64 power splitting ratio. The average bandwidth per user and PON reach scales inversely with respect to the splitting ratio. - Rapidly increasing internet applications are straining the bandwidth available from legacy TDM-PON systems. To overcome the long-term increase in bandwidth demand, a migration to WDM or TWDM-PON (Time-Wavelength Division Multiplexing) with higher ONU count per
feeder fiber 20 is evident to be able to accommodate the increase in bandwidth demand and take rate. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) PON gives each user 30 a dedicated wavelength in each transmission direction. In a WDM-PON network, eachuser 30 is allocated a different wavelength λ for upstreaming data to theCO 40. Therefore, each ONU 60 uses a wavelength-specific transmitter, such atunable wavelength laser 200, to transmit data to theCO 40 at different wavelengths λ. The tunable wavelength laser may be tuned at the time of deployment for each particular path 22 (corresponding to a user 30), which allows the use of one type of transceiver by allusers 30. A TWDM-PON network architecture combines the cost advantage of supportingmultiple users 30 on a single wavelength with the wavelength flexibility of WDM-PON, which provides service to multiple users via a single fiber and better utilizes WDM-PON components (e.g., Erbium-Doped Fiber amplifiers (EDFAs)). As previously discussed, to efficiently upgrade the network, acyclical AWG 200 is used at theRN 70. Therefore, it is desirable to design anaccess network 100 as shown inFIG. 1B that is capable of being upgraded seamlessly from a one TWDM-PON architecture to another TWDM-PON, without theusers 30 experiencing an outage other than during the changing of the equipment at their house, where each TWDM-PON provides different services (e.g., different PON rates for upstreaming and/or downstreaming or different PON protocols). When upgrading theaccess network 100, hardware changes at theCO 40 must be coordinated with hardware changes at the user's premises (e.g., ONUs 60). Since in a TWDM-PON network each OLT 50 in theCO 40 serves multiple ONUs 60, which are located at individual users' houses, it may be impossible to upgrade all the customer hardware (ONUs 60) on thePON 100 simultaneously. This will causecustomers 30 that are slow to upgrade their equipment to loose service altogether until they perform their upgrade. Therefore, it is beneficial for the interne service provider (ISP) to find a way to concurrently service two PON protocols, i.e., the legacy TWDM-PON and the upgrade TWDM-PON, until allusers 30 have upgraded their ONUs 60 to the upgrade TWDM-PON. To accommodate such an upgrade, a cyclical wavelength demultiplexer, such as a cyclical arrayed waveguide grating 200, is used at theRN 70. The use of thecyclical AWG 200 eliminates the need to use tunable filters at the ONUs 60, which are much more expensive than non-tunable filters. In addition, the use ofcyclical AWG 200 at theremote node 70 has a lower link loss than a large-port-count power splitter. - Previously proposed TWDM PONs use an optical power splitter at the
RN 70 to connect multiple ONUs 60 to each OLT 50. When a large number of wavelengths are transmitted over an optical power splitter, each ONU 60 includes a blocking filter to block out of band wavelengths. In some examples, a tunable ONU 60 is used and includes a tunable narrow band filter. Use of a tunable ONU 60 increases the cost of each ONU 60, which leads to an increase in the cost of thenetwork 100. Moreover, the power splitter at theRN 70 may not achieve large split ratios because the total power loss for a large splitter is difficult to overcome by the transmitters and receivers at the OLTs 50 and ONUs 60. Therefore, it is desirable to use a wavelength selective (de)multiplexer, such as the cyclical arrayed waveguide grating router (AWG) 200 to greatly increases the maximum split ratio and remove the need for narrow-band filters at the ONUs 60, thereby reducing the cost (by not using tunable receivers). Additionally, thecyclical AWG 200 decouples the loss from the number of ports, thereby allowing a higher split ratio with lower loss. In addition, to maximize the number ofusers 30 on asingle fiber feed passive splitter 400 may be used following the secondoptical system 300A (that includes the cyclical AWG 200). Thus, thecyclical AWG 200 greatly increases the efficiency of TWDM-PONs. Multiple TDM PONs (e.g., 1G-PON and 10G-PON) using anAWG 200 may be thought of as a TWDM-PON, since WDM is utilized to increase overall capacity of the network. -
FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate an exemplary arrayed waveguide grating 200 (AWG). AnAWG 200 may be used to demultiplex an optical signal in a WDM or a TWDM system.AWGs 200 can multiplex a large number of wavelengths into one optical fiber, thus increasing the transmission capacity of optical networks.AWGs 200 can therefore multiplex channels of several wavelengths onto a single optical fiber at a transmission end, and reciprocally they can also demultiplex different wavelength channels at the receiving end of an optical communication network. AnAWG 200 is a passive planar light wave circuit device typically used in optical networks as a wavelength multiplexer and/or demultiplexer. N×N AWGs 200 also have wavelength routing capabilities. If a system has N equally-spaced wavelengths λN, an N×N AWG 200 can be designed with an egress port spacing matching the wavelength spacing. The N×N AWG 200 routes differing wavelengths at aningress port 210 todifferent egress ports 220 such that all N wavelengths are mapped to allN egress ports 220N sequentially. The routing of the same N wavelengths at twoconsecutive ingress ports 210 have the wavelength mapping shifted by one egress side. In addition, the wavelength channels on any ingress repeat at the FSR. In some implementations, theAWG 200 receives a first multiplexed optical signal at afirst input 210 a (e.g., input 1) via a first optical fiber 10 a. TheAWG 200 demultiplexes the received signal and outputs demultiplexed signals through itsoutputs - The
AWG 200 is cyclic in nature. The wavelength multiplexing and demultiplexing property of theAWG 200 repeats over periods of wavelengths called free spectral range (FSR). Multiple wavelengths, separated by the free spectral range (FSR), are passed down eachport 220. Therefore, by utilizing multiple FSR cycles, different tiered services may coexist on thesame fiber plant - In some implementations, to construct a low-loss
cyclic AWG 200, the star couplers and the waveguide grating should be carefully designed. The arrayed waveguides in the fiber grating should be correctly engineered. The phase difference between waveguides in the grating is a factor that determines the FSR B1-B4 of theAWG 200. The channel-by-channel loss profile within one FSR B1-B4 is related with the overlap integral between the eigenmode (natural vibration of the AWG 200) of the output channel waveguide and beamlets diffracted from the waveguide arms in the grating. The end channels of any FSR B1-B4 typically have a larger loss and compromised pass-band. It is usually optimal to design around four or six more channels than the desired number of channels, thereby wasting four or six channels of bandwidth per cycle, respectively. - The disadvantage of using a
cyclic AWG 200 with small FSR is that the channel spacing may vary slightly from cycle to cycle. The wavelength spacing may be wider for longer wavelengths. However, besides waveguide arm phase difference, the material dispersion, i.e., the refractive index changing with wavelength, and waveguide cross-section design, also contribute to the variation in channel spacing. The channel spacing can be optimized by proper material choice and waveguide design. Thus, in some examples, alarger AWG 200 is used in combination with splitters (seeFIG. 3D ). - The
AWG 200 may have multiple cycles of optical wavelengths ranges with repeating multiplexing and demultiplexing properties. As shown inFIG. 2C , each cycle B1-B4 is often referred to as FSR. Amulti-cycle AWG 200 sends multiple wavelengths λ1-λ16, separated by the FSR, down eachport network 100, four usable cycles would allow for the simultaneous use of two platforms. Such asystem 100 would deliver signals from both platforms to each of theusers 30, and eachAWG output 220 would output/receive signals from both platforms. EachAWG output 220 is optically connected with at least one ONU 60, then each ONU 60 would receive signals from both platforms. Having two services hit each ONU 60 is useful during system upgrades and during general use for TWDM systems where eachAWG output 220 is connected to multiple ONUs 60 via apower splitter 400. - To further explain the use of two platforms by way of using a
cyclical AWG 200,FIG. 2C shows acyclical AWG 200 having aninput 210 a and fouroutputs cyclical AWG 200 receives four FSR (bands) B1-B4. FSRs B1 and B2 are used for upstream while FSRs B3 and B4 are used for downstream. FSR B1 includes wavelengths λ1-λ4, FSR B2 includes wavelengths λ5-λ8, FSR B3 includes wavelengths λ9 0λ12, and FSR B4 includes wavelengths λ13λ16; where λ1<λ2<λ3< . . . <λ15<λ16. When thecyclical AWG 200 receives the wavelengths λ1-λ16 at itsinput 210, each wavelength λ1-λ16 is outputted from adifferent output 220 in a cyclical manner. Therefore, the first wavelength λ1 of the first FSR B1 is outputted through thefirst output 210 a of thecyclical AWG 200, the second wavelength λ2 of the first FSR B1 is outputted through the second output 210 b of thecyclical AWG 200, the third wavelength λ3 of the first FSR B1 is outputted through the third output 210 c of thecyclical AWG 200, and the fourth wavelength λ4 of the first FSR B1 is outputted through the fourth output 210 b of thecyclical AWG 200, completing the first cycle. The second cycle begins when the first wavelength λ5 of the second FSR B2 is outputted through thefirst output 210 a of thecyclical AWG 200, the second wavelength λ6 of the second FSR B2 is outputted through the second output 210 b of thecyclical AWG 200, the third wavelength λ7 of the second FSR B2 is outputted through the third output 210 c of thecyclical AWG 200, and the fourth wavelength λ8 of the second FSR B2 is outputted through the fourth output 210 b of thecyclical AWG 200, completing the second cycle. The third cycle begins with the first wavelength λ9 of the third FSR B3 is outputted through thefirst output 210 a of thecyclical AWG 200, the second wavelength λ10 of the third FSR B3 is outputted through the second output 210 b of thecyclical AWG 200, the third wavelength λ11 of the third FSR B3 is outputted through the third output 210 c of thecyclical AWG 200, and the fourth wavelength λ12 of the third FSR B3 is outputted through the fourth output 210 b of thecyclical AWG 200, completing the third cycle. The fourth cycle begins with the first wavelength λ13 of the fourth FSR B4 is outputted through thefirst output 210 a of thecyclical AWG 200, the second wavelength λ14 of the fourth FSR B4 is outputted through the second output 210 b of thecyclical AWG 200, the third wavelength λ15 of thefourth FSR B4 3 is outputted through the third output 210 c of thecyclical AWG 200, and the fourth wavelength λ16 of the fourth FSR B4 is outputted through the fourth output 210 b of thecyclical AWG 200, completing the third cycle. In this case, each FSR B1-B4 includes four wavelengths λ1-λ16 (FSR B1 includes wavelengths λ1-λ4, FSR B2 includes wavelengths λ5-λ8, FSR B3 includes wavelengths λ9-λ12, FSR B4 includes wavelengths λ13-λ16), and thecyclical AWG 200 includes 4 outputs 210. Therefore, one wavelength from each FSR B1-B4 outputs eachAWG output 220. In other words, eachAWG output 220 outputs a wavelength from an FSR B1-B4. As described, a first platform may use the first FSR B1 for upstreaming and the third FSR B3 for downstream, and the second platform may use the second FSR B2 for upstreaming and the fourth FSR B4 for downstream. Similarly, thenetwork 100 may support three platforms by using six FSR cycles providing three platforms to eachuser 30. The network may also provide four platforms by using eight FSR cycles, five platforms by using 10 FSR cycles, and so on. In a TWDM-PON architecture, each wavelength λ carriesmultiple users 30, therefore, thenetwork 100 may be configured to operate different protocols of PONs concurrently to serve different tiers of services (e.g., 1 G-PON and 10 G-PON). For example, the service provider at theCO 40 may want to provide a business/premium service on a higher rate upstream/downstream PON and standard residential services on a lower rate upstream/downstream PON. Referring to the example discussed with respect toFIG. 2C , the business/premium service may use one of the first and third FSRs B1, B3 or the second and fourth B2, B4, and the low upstream/downstream rate PON may use the other one of the first and third FSRs B1, B3 or the second and fourth B2, B4. The service that theuser 30 receives is determined by their respective the customer premises equipment (CPE), more specifically, their ONU 60. The CPE may be configured to receive one or the other of the business premium service or the low upstream/downstream rate service. In some examples, if theuser 30 wants to upgrade from the low upstream/downstream rate service to the business/premium service, theuser 30 has to change/upgrade his CPE to be able to receive the upgraded/premium signals that are being transmitted from theCO 40. - As previously described, to increase the
network 100 capacity, it is often desirable to overlay multiple services or platforms on thesame fiber 20. For example, in TDM-PON architecture, overlaying multiple services is achieved by using a different pair of wavelengths for each platform that is overlaid. Referring toFIGS. 3A-3C , in some implementations, a TDM-PON architecture 100 overlays two different services, e.g., 1G-PON MAC 50 a and 10G-PON MAC 50 b. Thenetwork 100 includes a firstoptical system 300A in communication with a secondoptical system 300B via afiber feeder 20 that is arranged to convey a feeder signal S1 and S2. The firstoptical system 300A includes amultiplexer 310, such as a band multiplexer. Themultiplexer 310 is configured to multiplex and demultiplex between a first OLT signal S1 (λ1-λ4, λ9-λ12) from the first OLT 50 a (1G-PON), a second OLT signal S2 (λ5-λ8, λ13-λ12) from the second OLT 50 b (10G-PON), and the feeder optical signal S3 of theoptical feeder 20, which includes both the first and second OLT signals S1, S2. The first OLT signal S1 includes an upstream FSR B1 and a downstream FSR B3, and the second OLT signal also includes an upstream FSR B2 and a downstream FSR B4. Each FSR B1-B4 has wavelengths λ1-λ16, different than the other FSRs B1-B4. - The second
optical system 300B may be part of or partially part of theremote node 70. The secondoptical system 300B is optically connected with thefiber feeder 20. In addition, the secondoptical system 300B is configured to multiplex and demultiplex between the feeder optical signal S3 and ONU signals US1-US4, where the ONU signals US1-US4 are outputted/inputted from output 320 of the secondoptical system 300B. Each output 320 of the secondoptical system 300B is connected to accessfibers - The
system 100 may include anoptical splitter 400 in communication with each output 320 of the secondoptical system 300B. Theoptical splitter 400 further expands thenetwork 100. Eachoptical splitter 400 conveys the signal US1-US4 outputted from each port 320 of the secondoptical system 300B to the ONUs 60. For example, the first signal US1 outputted from thefirst port 320 a of the secondoptical system 300B is split by thepower splitter 400, then the signal US1 is conveyed to the ONUs 60 that are optically connected to thesplitter 400 a. In this case, the first ONU 60 a, which is a 1G-PON MAC 60 a receives the outputted signal US1 and the second ONU 60 b, which is a 10G-PON MAC 60 b also receives the same outputted signal US1. In this case, each ONU 60 a, 60 b includes the band-pass filter 64 that filters the wavelengths that the ONU 60 is designed to receive. The first ONU 60 a includes the band-pass filter 64 that allows wavelengths λ1 and λ9 (from the first OLT signal S1) to pass to thecolored diplexer 62 and the second ONU 60 b includes the band-pass filter 64 that allows wavelengths λ5 and λ13 (from the second OLT signal S2) pass to thecolored diplexer 62. In some cases, the functionality of the band-pass filter 64 maybe a part of thecolored diplexer 62, thus the band-pass filter 64 may not be a physical component in the ONU. - Each ONU 60 includes a
diplexer 62, which multiplexes first and second ports P1, P2 into a third port P3. The signals on the first and second ports P1, P2 occupy disjoint frequency bands, i.e., are on different FSRs B1-B4; therefore, the signals on the first and second ports P1, P2 can coexist on the third port P3. Therefore, as shown inFIG. 3A , the two shorter wavelength bands FSR B1 and FSR B2 are used for uplink and the two longer wavelength bands FSR B3 and FSR B4 are used for downlink. This relaxes the requirements of the colored diplexer in the ONU 60. Moreover, each ONU 60 includes the band-pass filter 64 before thediplexer 62 to remove unwanted downlink channels from OLTs 50 for other services. The fixed band-pass filter 64 passes frequencies or wavelengths λ within a certain range and rejects (i.e., attenuates) frequencies or wavelengths λ outside that range. Therefore, each band-pass filter 64 passes the desired wavelengths λ associated with the desired service. In some implementations, thediplexer 62 inside each ONU 60 also serves as the band-pass filter 64 before the receiver Rx to remove unwanted downlink channels from OLTs 50 for other services. In some examples, the other wavelength downlink signals for the same service are all removed by thecyclic AWG - In some implementations, when the
cyclical AWG 200 is included in the secondoptical system 300B to increase the split ratio of a TWDM-PON system, theAWG 200 only allows discrete (or colored) wavelengths to pass to eachuser 30, which allows the effective stacking of multiple PONs on thesame feed fiber FIGS. 3A- 3C show 1G-PONs and the 10G-PONs operating over thesame fiber plant cycle AWG 200. Thecyclical AWG 200 restricts the possible wavelengths that may be overlayed over afiber plant colored diplexer 62 at the ONU 60, which is typically implemented using a TFF (thin film filter), seeFIGS. 3B and 3C . - 1G-PON services at the first OLT 50 a use FSR B1 having wavelengths λ1-λ4 for upstream transmission, and FSR B3 having wavelengths λ9-λ12 for downstream transmission, e.g., while 10G-PON at the second OLT 50 b uses FSR B2 having wavelengths λ5-λ8 for upstream transmission and FSR B4 having wavelengths λ13-λ16 for downstream. This spectral allocation allows 1G-
PON OLT 50 a and 10G-PON OLT 50 b to operate on thesame fiber plant 20 because, as previously discussed with respect toFIG. 2B , each service uses different FSRs for each of its respective upstream and downstream transmission. The ONUs 60, 60 a, 60 b receive bothservices 1G-PON and 10G-PON services from both OLTs 50 a, 50 b, and each ONU 60, 60 a, 60 b is configured to select the desirable wavelength (i.e., of the respective service) with the fixed band-pass filter 64 in front of a receiver Rx associated with the ONU 60. - As shown in
FIG. 3A , the secondoptical system 300B includes acyclical AWG 200 with fouroutput ports optical system 300B also includes four outputs 320 a-320 d. In this case, theoutput ports cyclical AWG 200 are aligned with the output ports 320 a-320 d of the secondoptical system 300B. Therefore, the first, second, third, andfourth output ports cyclical AWG 200 are the same as the first, second, third, and fourth output ports of the secondoptical system 300B. However, as will be discussed below with reference toFIG. 3F , in some implementations, thecyclical AWG 200 b includes eightoutput ports 220 a-220 h and the secondoptical system 300B includes optical couplers 340, where each optical coupler 340 combines at least two cyclicalAWG output ports 220. - Referring to
FIGS. 3D-3F , in some implementations, power splitters, also known as optical couplers 340, 340 a-340 d, may be co-located with theAWG 200 to increase the splitting ratio and therefore increase the number of users per feeder fiber.AWGs 200 are more expensive than power splitters; so placing theAWG 200 on the OLT 50 side of the power splitter /optical coupler 400 minimizes the number ofAWGs 200 within thenetwork 100.FIG. 3E shows a 4-port AWG 200 followed by a 2×Noptical coupler 400. As shown, two FSR cycles B1 and B3 are used on theAWG 200. - It is difficult to keep the frequency spacing in the FSR cycles B1-B4 of an
AWG 200 identical.FIG. 3D shows a uniform channel spacing on two FSR cycles B1-B4.FIG. 3D is an expansion of the uniform channel spacing on one FSR cycle Bland B3 as shown inFIG. 3F . Referring toFIG. 3F , anAWG 200 with double the number of the channels oroutputs 220 may be used. Therefore, to create a N-channel two-cycle device (secondoptical system 300B shown inFIG. 3D ),channel 1 and N+1 are fed into the inputs of a 2×N optical coupler, 2 and N+2 into another coupler and so on. For example, thefirst output channel 220 a of theAWG 200 connects to thefirst coupler 400 a, thesecond output channel 220 b of theAWG 200 connects to thesecond coupler 400 b, thethird output channel 220 c of theAWG 200 connects to thethird coupler 400 c, thefourth output channel 220 d of theAWG 200 connects to thefourth coupler 400 d, thefifth output channel 220 e of theAWG 200 connects to thefirst coupler 400 a, thesixth output channel 220 f of theAWG 200 connects to thesecond coupler 400 b, theseventh output channel 220 g of theAWG 200 connects to thethird coupler 400 c, and the eightoutput channel 220 h of theAWG 200 connects to thefourth coupler 400 d. Thefirst coupler 400 a couples the wavelength from thefirst output channel 220 a and thefifth output channel 220 e of theAWG 200. Thesecond coupler 400 b couples the wavelength from thesecond output channel 220 b and thesixth output channel 220 f of theAWG 200. Thethird coupler 400 c couples the wavelength from thethird output channel 220 c and theseventh output channel 220 g of theAWG 200. Finally, thefourth coupler 400 d couples the wavelength from thefourth output channel 220 d and the eightoutput channel 220 h of theAWG 200. The transfer function from the common port orinput 210 of theAWG 200 to the output of thecouplers 400 is almost identical to the implementation shown inFIG. 3E , except that the channel spacings will be more uniform across the FSRs. - Fabrication wise, increasing the number of channels/
outputs 220 in theAWG 200 increases the area of theAWG 200 and hence the cost. However, it does allow cyclic AWGs to have uniform channel spacings betweenchannels 210 over multiple FSR cycles B1-B4. Additionally, the ‘edge effects’ of the far channels on each FSR cycle B1-B4, including higher insertion loss, may also be avoided by using a large number of waveguides to create a much larger FSR B1-B4. This allows all channels to be far from any edges. In some implementations, as shown inFIG. 3D , the secondoptical system 300B implements the design ofFIG. 3E , which ties twoAWG outputs 220 using two-input couplers 400. Since the design ofFIG. 3F may be generalized to multiple coupler ports, to create four FSR B1-B4 cycles for example, outputs 1, N+1, 2N+1, and 3N+1 must be connected to a four-input coupler 340, as inFIG. 3D . The FSR B1-B4 of any wavelength selective device can be reduced by an integer number using this method, including devices that are already cyclic in nature. As shown inFIG. 3D , the secondoptical system 300B includes anAWG 200 b having 16 outputs, and four power couplers 340, 340 a-d, each coupler 340 coupling four wavelengths resulting in the same output as shown inFIG. 3A . Thesystem 100 ofFIG. 3D may provide for uniform channel spacing between the FSR cycles B1-B4. -
FIGS. 4A-4D show the progress of anetwork 100 upgrade where thenetwork 100 includes a single tiered service, the legacy service using the FSR B1 for upstream and FSR B3 for downstream. Thus, FSR B2 and FSR B4 are unused as shown in FIG. 4A. To facilitate a seamless system upgrade, the upgrade system/service should operate on the two unused FSRs B2, B4 cycles of theAWG 200. Referring back toFIG. 3A , for example, the first service may be provided by a first OLT 50 a while the upgrade may be provided by the second OLT 50 b. Therefore, the first step of the system upgrade is to connect the upgraded system (e.g., OLT 50 b) to the fiber plant using wavelength selective optical multiplexers (e.g., band multiplexer 310). At this point, the legacy system, OLT 50 a, and the upgraded system OLT 50 b coexist on thesame fiber plant 20, as shown inFIG. 4C . The next step of the upgrade is to start upgrading the ONUs 60 with upgraded CPEs that supports the upgraded services. During this time, eachuser 30 receives both services as discussed with respect toFIG. 3A . Therefore, when a user upgrades their CPE, the ONU 60 associated with theuser 30 receives the upgraded services. The third step of the upgrade occurs when all theusers 30 have upgraded their legacy ONUs 60 (supporting OLT 50 a) to ONUs 60 that support the upgraded system (e.g., OLT 50 b). At this step, the legacy services are disconnected, i.e., disconnect OLT 50 a, which frees two FSRs (in this case B1, B3) that the legacy system was using. - The capability of performing a
network 100 upgrade (e.g., at the CO 40) seamlessly, without service interruption to theuser 30, is highly desirable to an ISP to avoid customer complaints leading to a large number of technical support calls. In cases where the OLT 50 serves only one ONU 60 (e.g., WDM-PON networks), upgrading the services may be easier at the cost of operational complexity, which includes more fibers to be terminated at the OLT 50 side. However, where each OLT 50 provides services to multiple ONUs 60, it is essential for the service provider to prevent late upgraders from losing connectivity altogether. Examples of OLTs 50 that serve multiple ONUs 60 are: (1) optically integrated OLTs 50 that take advantage of photonic and packaging integration to serve multiple wavelengths; (2) systems that also use time division multiplexing (TDM) in addition to WDM to form a TWDM-PON; or (3) a combination of the two. -
FIGS. 5A-5D show asystem 100 upgrade for multiple services. In some implementations, the service provider wants to offer different tiered services over thesame fiber feeder 20 concurrently. For example, the service provider may want to offer a 10G-PON service for business customers and a 2.5G-PON service for residential customers. In this case, each PON uses two FSR cycles B1-B4, resulting in a total of four FSR cycles B1-B4, seeFIG. 3A and 5B . Using the process described inFIG. 4A-4D , the service provider needs two additional FSR cycles B1-B4 to upgrade either service seamlessly, resulting in a total of six FSR cycles. However, the process described inFIG. 5A-D allows the service provider to upgrade the lower tiered service, and then upgrade the higher tiered service with only the four used FSRs B1-B4. The first step of the upgrade is to send out legacy higher tier platform ONUs 60 to all lowertiered service users 30, which would migrate them to the platform of the higher tier. As previously discussed with respect toFIG. 3A , allusers 30 receive the two services that two OLTs provide, and based on the CPE equipment at the ONU 60 (FIGS. 3B and 3C ), the service of theuser 30 is determined. Therefore, upgrading the CPE at the ONU 60 allows theuser 30 to receive the legacy higher-tier services without changes at the OLTs 50. Once the ONUs 60 configured to receive legacy low-tier services are all upgraded to ONUs 60 configured to receive legacy high-tier services, then all theusers 30 are served by the legacy high-tier platform. This temporarily reduces the actual capacity of thenetwork 100 by the capacity of the legacy lower-tiered service. In some examples, the service provider configures the CPEs of the previously low-tier customers to limit the traffic allowed to these customers to prevent a dramatic impact of network speed of the legacy high-tier customers. The next step in the upgrade is to decommission the legacy low-tier services by decommissioning or disconnecting the legacy low-tier OLTs 50, which frees up two FSR cycles (e.g., FSR B1 and B3) as shown inFIG. 5C . Following, the service provider installs the upgraded high-tier service on the same wavelength plan (e.g., FSR B1 and B3) as the legacy low-tier service as shown inFIG. 5D . In addition, the service provider provides the legacy high-tier users 30 with upgraded ONUs 60 configured to receive the upgraded legacy high-tier services. Once all the legacy high-tier users 30 upgrade their CPE to support the upgraded high-tier services, the legacy high-tier service platform becomes the upgraded low-tier service platform. As shown inFIG. 5D , the spectrum allocation of the low-tier service and the high-tier service is swapped (i.e., the upgraded low-tier platform uses FSR cycles B2 and B4, while the upgraded high-tier platform uses FSR cycles B1 and B3). - As described, the upgrade processes allow for a reduced upgrade cost since the service provider does not cause any noticeable interruptions to the
users 30, thus avoiding service calls. In addition, by using TWDM , the service provider supports a greater number ofusers 30 with the same number of fibers, thus reducing the number ofCO 40 and the amount of feeder fiber required between theCO 40 and theremote node 70, and ultimately saving operational costs. -
