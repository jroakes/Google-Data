Definitions
- Smart meter technology employs a wireless network to communicate electrical energy consumption data associated with residential properties back to a utility for monitoring, billing, and the like.
- a number of wireless networking standards are currently available to enable electronic devices to communicate with each other.
- Some smart meter implementations for instance, employ Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) to enable electronic devices to communicate with a smart meter.
- IPv6 Internet Protocol version 6
- 6LoWPAN Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks
- 6LoWPAN Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks
- 6LoWPAN Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks
- 6LoWPAN Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks
- the currently available wireless networking standards may not efficiently connect all electronic devices of a network in a secure yet simple, consumer-friendly manner in view of one or more known practical constraints. Moreover, for one or more practical scenarios, the currently available wireless networking standards may not provide an efficient way to add new electronic devices to an existing wireless network in an ad hoc manner.
- the wireless network standard when providing a wireless network standard for electronic devices for use in and around a home, it would be beneficial to use a wireless network standard that provides an open protocol for different devices to learn how to gain access to the network. Also, given the number of electronic devices that may be associated with a home, it would be beneficial that the wireless network standard be capable of supporting Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) communication such that each device may have a unique IP address and may be capable of being accessed via the Internet, via a local network in a home environment, and the like. Further, it would be beneficial for the wireless network standard to allow the electronic devices to communicate within the wireless network using a minimum amount of power.
- IPv6 Internet Protocol version 6
- wireless network standards such as Bluetooth®, Dust Networks®, Z-wave®, WiFi, and ZigBee® fail to provide one or more of the desired features discussed above.
- Bluetooth® generally provides a wireless network standard for communicating over short distances via short-wavelength radio transmissions.
- Bluetooth's® wireless network standard may not support a communication network of a number of electronic devices disposed throughout a home.
- Bluetooth's® wireless network standard may not support wireless mesh communication or IPv6 addresses.
- Dust Networks® may also bring about one or more shortcomings with respect to one or more features that would enable electronic devices disposed in a home to efficiently communicate with each other.
- Dust Networks'® wireless network standard may not provide an open protocol that may be used by others to interface with the devices operating on Dust Networks' network.
- Dust Networks® may be designed to facilitate communication between devices located in industrial environments such as assembly lines, chemical plants, and the like.
- Dust Networks'® wireless network standard may be directed to providing a reliable communication network that has pre-defined time windows in which each device may communicate to other devices and listen for instructions from other devices. In this manner, Dust Networks'® wireless network standard may require sophisticated and relatively expensive radio transmitters that may not be economical to implement with consumer electronic devices for use in the home.
- the wireless network standard associated with Z-wave® may not be an open protocol. Instead, Z-wave's® wireless network standard may be available only to authorized clients that embed a specific transceiver chip into their device. Moreover, Z-wave's® wireless network standard may not support IPv6-based communication. That is, Z-wave's® wireless network standard may require a bridge device to translate data generated on a Z-wave® device into IP-based data that may be transmitted via the Internet.
- ZigBee® has two standards commonly known as ZigBee® Pro and ZigBee® IP.
- ZigBee® Pro may have one or more shortcomings in the context of support for wireless mesh networking Instead, ZigBee® Pro may depend at least in part on a central device that facilitates communication between each device in the ZigBee® Pro network.
- devices that remain on to process or reject certain wireless traffic can generate additional heat within their housings that may alter some sensor readings, such as temperature readings, acquired by the device. Since such sensor readings may be useful in determining how each device within the home may operate, it may be beneficial to avoid unnecessary generation of heat within the device that may alter sensor readings.
- ZigBee® Pro may not support IPv6 communication.
- ZigBee® IP may bring about one or more shortcomings in the context of direct device-to-device communication.
- ZigBee® IP is directed toward the facilitation of communication by relay of device data to a central router or device. As such, the central router or device may require constant powering and therefore may not represent a low power means for communications among devices.
- ZigBee® IP may have a practical limit in the number of nodes (i.e., ⁇ 20 nodes per network) that may be employed in a single network.
- ZigBee® IP uses a “Ripple” routing protocol (RPL) that may exhibit high bandwidth, processing, and memory requirements, which may implicate additional power for each ZigBee® IP connected device.
- RPL Rapple routing protocol
- WiFi's wireless network may exhibit one or more shortcomings in terms of enabling communications among devices having low-power requirements.
- WiFi's wireless network standard may also require each networked device to always be powered up, and furthermore may require the presence of a central node or hub.
- WiFi is a relatively common wireless network standard that may be ideal for relatively high bandwidth data transmissions (e.g., streaming video, syncing devices).
- WiFi devices are typically coupled to a continuous power supply or rechargeable batteries to support the constant stream of data transmissions between devices.
- WiFi's wireless network may not support wireless mesh networking.
- Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an electronic device such as a thermostat that may be disposed in a building (e.g., home or office) such that the electronic device may wirelessly communicate with another electronic device disposed in the same building.
- the electronic device may include a network interface that may enable the electronic device to wirelessly couple the electronic device to the other electronic device via a wireless mesh network.
- the electronic device may also include a processor that may determine at least one data path via the wireless mesh network to the other electronic device using a Routing Information Protocol—Next Generation (RIPng) routing mechanism and the network interface. After identifying at least one data path to the other electronic device, the processor may determine whether the identified data path(s) is secure using a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.
- DTLS Datagram Transport Layer Security
- the processor may send Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) data packets to the other electronic device via the secure data path(s).
- IPv6 Internet Protocol version 6
- the electronic device may establish a secure communication network between itself and the other electronic device disposed in the same building with relatively little user input.

- Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to an efficient network layer that may be used by devices communicating with each other in a home environment.
- a thermostat device may be used to detect a temperature of a home and coordinate the activity of other devices (e.g., lights) based on the detected temperature.
- the thermostat device may detect a temperature that may indicate that the temperature outside the home corresponds to daylight hours. The thermostat device may then convey to the light device that there may be daylight available to the home and that thus the light should turn off.
- the devices may use an efficient network layer to manage their communication. That is, the efficient network layer may establish a communication network in which numerous devices within a home may communicate with each other via a wireless mesh network.
- the communication network may support Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) communication such that each connected device may have a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address.
- IPv6 Internet Protocol version 6
- IP Internet Protocol
- it may be useful for each device to communicate within the network using low amounts of power. That is, by enabling devices to communicate using low power, the devices may be placed anywhere in a home without being coupled to a continuous power source.
- the efficient network layer may thus establish a procedure in which data may be transferred between two or more devices such that the establishment of the communication network involves little user input, the communication between devices involves little energy, and the communication network, itself, is secure.
- the efficient network layer may be an IPv6-based communication network that employs Routing Information Protocol—Next Generation (RIPng) as its routing mechanism and may use a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol as its security mechanism.
- RIPng Routing Information Protocol—Next Generation
- DTLS Datagram Transport Layer Security

- the user-interface components may include a mechanical or virtual component that responds to the user's motion. For example, the user can mechanically move a sliding component (e.g., along a vertical or horizontal track) or rotate a rotatable ring (e.g., along a circular track), or the user's motion along a touchpad may be detected.
- Such motions may correspond to a setting adjustment, which can be determined based on an absolute position of a user-interface component 104 or based on a displacement of a user-interface components 104 (e.g., adjusting a set point temperature by 1 degree F. for every 10° rotation of a rotatable-ring component).
- Physically and virtually movable user-interface components can allow a user to set a setting along a portion of an apparent continuum.
- the user may not be confined to choose between two discrete options (e.g., as would be the case if up and down buttons were used) but can quickly and intuitively define a setting along a range of possible setting values.
- a magnitude of a movement of a user-interface component may be associated with a magnitude of a setting adjustment, such that a user may dramatically alter a setting with a large movement or finely tune a setting with s small movement.
- the user-interface components 14 may also include one or more buttons (e.g., up and down buttons), a keypad, a number pad, a switch, a microphone, and/or a camera (e.g., to detect gestures).
- the user-interface component 14 may include a click-and-rotate annular ring component that may enable the user to interact with the component by rotating the ring (e.g., to adjust a setting) and/or by clicking the ring inwards (e.g., to select an adjusted setting or to select an option).
- the user-interface component 14 may include a camera that may detect gestures (e.g., to indicate that a power or alarm state of a device is to be changed).
- the device 10 may have one primary input component, which may be used to set a plurality of types of settings.
- the user-interface components 14 may also be configured to present information to a user via, e.g., a visual display (e.g., a thin-film-transistor display or organic light-emitting-diode display) and/or an audio speaker.

- the processor 20 may be implemented as localized versions or counterparts of algorithms carried out or governed remotely by central servers or cloud-based systems, such as by virtue of running a Java virtual machine (JVM) that executes instructions provided from a cloud server using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) or similar protocols.
- JVM Java virtual machine
- AJAX Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- the processor 20 may detect when a location (e.g., a house or room) is occupied, up to and including whether it is occupied by a specific person or is occupied by a specific number of people (e.g., relative to one or more thresholds).
- this detection can occur, e.g., by analyzing microphone signals, detecting user movements (e.g., in front of a device), detecting openings and closings of doors or garage doors, detecting wireless signals, detecting an IP address of a received signal, detecting operation of one or more devices within a time window, or the like.
- the processor 20 may include image recognition technology to identify particular occupants or objects.
- the processor 20 may also include a high-power processor and a low-power processor.
- the high-power processor may execute computational intensive operations such as operating the user-interface component 14 and the like.

Since the thermostat may be powered using a local battery, the thermostat may minimize its energy use such that the battery is rarely replaced.
- the thermostat may include a circular track that may have a rotatable ring disposed thereon as the user-interface component 14 .
- a user may interact with or program the thermostat using the rotatable ring such that the thermostat controls the temperature of the building by controlling a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) unit or the like.
- HVAC heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning
- the thermostat may determine when the building may be vacant based on its programming. For instance, if the thermostat is programmed to keep the HVAC unit powered off for an extended period of time, the thermostat may determine that the building will be vacant during this period of time.
- the thermostat may be programmed to turn off light switches or other electronic devices when it determines that the building is vacant.
- the thermostat may use the network interface 18 to communicate with a light switch device such that it may send a signal to the light switch device when the building is determined to be vacant. In this manner, the thermostat may efficiently manage the energy use of the building.

- the home environment 30 may further include a variety of partially communicating legacy appliances 70 , such as infra-red (IR) controlled wall air conditioners or other IR-controlled devices, which can be controlled by IR signals provided by the hazard detection units 50 or the light switches 54 .
- IR infra-red
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example wireless mesh network 80 that may be employed to facilitate communication between some of the example devices described above.

- the light switch 54 may be wirelessly coupled to the appliance 58 and the portable electronic device 66 .
- the appliance 58 may just be coupled to the pool heater 34 and the portable electronic device 66 may just be coupled to the irrigation system 36 .
- the irrigation system 36 may have a wireless connection to the entryway interface device 52 .
- Each device in the wireless mesh network 80 of FIG. 3 may correspond to a node within the wireless mesh network 80 .
- the efficient network layer may specify that each node transmit data using a RIPng protocol and a DTLS protocol such that data may be securely transferred to a destination node via a minimum number of hops between nodes.
- the efficient network layer may be part of an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model 90 as depicted in FIG. 4 .
- the OSI model 90 illustrates functions of a communication system with respect to abstraction layers. That is, the OSI model may specify a networking framework or how communications between devices may be implemented.
- the OSI model may include six layers: a physical layer 92 , a data link layer 94 , a network layer 96 , a transport layer 98 , a platform layer 100 , and an application layer 102 .
- each layer in the OSI model 90 may serve the layer above it and may be served by the layer below it.
- the physical layer 92 may provide hardware specifications for devices that may communicate with each other. As such, the physical layer 92 may establish how devices may connect to each other, assist in managing how communication resources may be shared between devices, and the like.
- the data link layer 94 may specify how data may be transferred between devices. Generally, the data link layer 94 may provide a way in which data packets being transmitted may be encoded and decoded into bits as part of a transmission protocol.

- the transport layer 98 may specify a transparent transfer of the data from a source node to a destination node.
- the transport layer 98 may also control how the transparent transfer of the data remains reliable. As such, the transport layer 98 may be used to verify that data packets intended to transfer to the destination node indeed reached the destination node.
- Example protocols that may be employed in the transport layer 98 may include Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
- the platform layer 100 may establish connections between devices according to the protocol specified within the transport layer 98 .
- the platform layer 100 may also translate the data packets into a form that the application layer 102 may use.
- the application layer 102 may support a software application that may directly interface with the user.
- the application layer 102 may implement protocols defined by the software application.
- the software application may provide serves such as file transfers, electronic mail, and the like.
- the network layer 96 and the transport layer 98 may be configured in a certain manner to form an efficient low power wireless personal network (ELoWPAN) 110 .
- the ELoWPAN 110 may be based on an IEEE 802.15.4 network, which may correspond to low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs).
- the ELoWPAN 110 may specify that the network layer 96 may route data between the devices 10 in the home environment 30 using a communication protocol based on Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).
- IPv6 Internet Protocol version 6
- each device 10 may include a 128-bit IPv6 address that may provide each device 10 with a unique address to use to identify itself over the Internet, a local network around the home environment 30 , or the like.
- the network layer 96 may specify that data may be routed between devices using Routing Information Protocol—Next Generation (RIPng).
- RIPng is a routing protocol that routes data via a wireless mesh network based on a number of hops between the source node and the destination node. That is, RIPng may determine a route to the destination node from the source node that employs the least number of hops when determining how the data will be routed.
- RIPng is capable of supporting IPv6 networking traffic. As such, each device 10 may use a unique IPv6 address to identify itself and a unique IPv6 address to identify a destination node when routing data. Additional details with regard to how the RIPng may send data between nodes will be described below with reference to FIG. 6 .
- the network layer 96 may also interface with a security protocol via the application layer 102 to manage the integrity of the data being transferred.
- the efficient network layer may secure data transferred between devices using a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol in the application layer 102 .
- DTLS Datagram Transport Layer Security
- the efficient network layer may determine whether a communication pathway between devices 10 is secure using the DTLS protocol of the application layer 102 . After the communication pathway is determined to be secure, the efficient network layer may facilitate secure data transfers between the devices 10 . In this manner, the efficient network layer may enable data transfers using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the like. Additional details with regard to the DTLS protocol will be described below with reference to FIGS. 8 and 9 .
- TCP Transmission Control Protocol
- UDP User Datagram Protocol
- the network layer 96 depicted in FIG. 5 is characterized herein as the efficient network layer mentioned above. That is the efficient network layer routes IPv6 data using RIPng. Moreover, the efficient network layer may interface with the application layer 102 to employ the DTLS protocol to secure data transfer between devices. As a result, the transport layer 98 may support various types of (e.g., TCP and UDP) transfer schemes for the data.
- FIG. 6 depicts a flowchart of a method 120 that may be used for determining a routing table for each device 10 in the wireless mesh network 80 of FIG. 3 using RIPng.
- the method 120 may be performed by each device 10 in the home environment 30 such that each device 10 may generate a routing table that indicates how each node in the wireless mesh network 80 may be connected to each other. As such, each device 10 may independently determine how to route data to a destination node.
- the processor 20 of the device 10 may perform the method 120 using the network interface 18 . As such, the device 10 may send data associated with the sensor 12 or determined by the processor 18 to other devices 10 in the home environment 30 via network interface 18 .
- the device 10 may send a request 132 to any other device 10 that may be directly (i.e., zero hops) to the requesting device 10 .
- the request 132 may include a request for all of the routing information from the respective device 10 .
- the device 10 at node 1 may send the request 132 to the device 10 at node 2 to send all of the routes (i.e., N 2 's routes) included in node 2 's memory.
- the requesting device 10 may receive a message from the respective device 10 that may include all of the routes included in the respective memory of the respective device 10 .
- the routes may be organized in a routing table that may specify how each node in the wireless mesh network 80 may be connected to each other. That is, the routing table may specify which intermediate nodes data may be transferred to such that data from a source node to a destination node.
- node 2 may send node 1 all of the routes (N 2 's routes 144 ) included in the memory or storage of node 2 .
- each node of the wireless mesh network 80 may send the request 132 to its adjacent node as shown in FIG. 7A .
- each node may then send its routes to its adjacent node as shown in FIG. 7B .
- FIG. 7B illustrates how each node sends its route data to each adjacent node as depicted with N 1 's routes 142 , N 2 's routes 144 , N 3 's routes 146 , N 4 's routes 148 , N 5 's routes 150 , N 6 's routes 152 , N 7 's routes 154 , N 8 's routes 156 , and N 9 's routes 158 .
- each node may know the nodes in which it may have a direct connection (i.e., zero hops). For example, initially, node 2 may just know that it is directly connected to node 1 , node 3 , and node 4 . However, after receiving N 1 's routes 142 , N 3 's routes 146 , and N 4 's routes 148 , the processor 20 of node 2 may build a routing table that includes all of the information included with N 1 's routes 142 , N 3 's routes 146 , and N 4 's routes 148 .
- node 2 may send a routing table that includes N 1 's routes 142 , N 2 's routes, N 3 's routes 146 , and N 4 's routes 148 .
- the requesting device 10 may update its local routing table to include the routing information received from the adjacent device 10 .
- each device 10 may perform the method 120 periodically such that each device 10 includes an updated routing table that characterizes how each node in the wireless mesh network 80 may be connected to each other.
- each device 10 may receive additional information from its adjacent device 10 if the adjacent device 10 updated its routing table with the information received from its adjacent devices. As a result, each device 10 may understand how each node in the wireless mesh network 80 may be connected to each other.
- FIG. 7C illustrates a routing table 172 that may have been determined by the device 10 at node 1 using the method 120 .
- the routing table 172 may specify each node in the wireless mesh network 80 as a destination node, the intermediate nodes between node 1 and each destination node, and a number of hops between node 1 and the destination node. The number of hops corresponds to a number of times that the data being sent to the destination node may be forwarded to an intermediate node before reaching the destination node.
- the RIPng routing scheme may select a route that involves the least number of hops.
- the RIPng routing scheme would route the data via nodes 2 , 4 , 5 , and 8 , which includes four hops, as opposed to routing the data via nodes 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , and 8 , include includes five hops.
- each device 10 may independently determine how data should be routed to a destination node.
- Conventional routing schemes such as “Ripple” Routing Protocol (RPL) used in 6LoWPAN devices, on the other hand, may route data through a central node, which may be the only node that knows the structure of the wireless mesh network. More specifically, the RPL protocol may create a wireless mesh network according to a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which may be structured as a hierarchy. Located at the top of this hierarchy may include a border router, which may periodically multicast requests to lower level nodes to determine a rank for each of the node's connections.
- DAG directed acyclic graph
- the data when data is transferred from a source node to a destination node, the data may be transferred up the hierarchy of nodes and then back down to the destination node. In this manner, the nodes located higher up the hierarchy may route data more often than the nodes located lower in the hierarchy. Moreover, the border router of the RPL system may also be operating more frequently since it controls how data will be routed via the hierarchy. In the conventional RPL system, in contrast to the RIPng system taught here, some nodes may route data on a more frequent basis simply due to its location within the hierarchy and not due to its location with respect to the source node and the destination node.
- FIG. 7D illustrates a new node 10 being added to the wireless mesh network 80 .
- the device 10 that corresponds to node 10 may perform the method 120 described above to determine how data may be routed to each node in the wireless mesh network 80 . If each node in the wireless mesh network 80 has already performed the method 120 multiple times, the device 10 at node 10 may receive the entire routing structure of the wireless mesh network 80 from the device 10 at node 4 . In the same manner, devices 10 may be removed from the wireless mesh network 80 and each node may update its routing table with relative ease by performing the method 120 again.
- ELoWPAN 110 may employ a DTLS protocol via the application layer 102 to secure data communications between each device 10 in the home environment 30 .
- ELoWPAN 110 may enable the transport layer 98 to send any type of data (e.g., TCP and UDP) via the secure communication pathway.
- TCP and UDP any type of data
- new devices 10 added to the wireless mesh network 80 may use UDP data transfers to effectively communicate to other devices 10 in the wireless mesh network more quickly.
- UDP data transfers generally use less energy by the device 10 that is sending or forwarding the data since there is no guarantee of delivery.
- the devices 10 may send non-critical data (e.g., presence of a person in a room) using the UDP data transfer, thereby saving energy within the device 10 .
- critical data e.g., smoke alarm
- TCP data transfer may be sent via TCP data transfer to ensure that the appropriate party receives the data.
- ELoWPAN 110 may employ the DTLS protocol to secure the data communicated between the devices 10 .
- the DTLS protocol may secure data transfers using a handshake protocol.
- the handshake protocol may authenticate each communicating device using a security certificate that may be provided by each device 10 .
- FIG. 8 illustrates an example of a manufacturing process 190 that depicts how the security certificate may be embedded within the device 10 .
- a trusted manufacturer 192 of the device 10 may be provided with a number of security certificates that it may use for each manufactured device.
- the trusted manufacturer 192 may embed a certificate 194 into the device 10 during the manufacturing process 190 . That is, the certificate 194 may be embedded into the hardware of the device 10 during manufacturing of the device 10 .
- the certificate 194 may include a public key, a private key, or other cryptographic data that may be used to authenticate different communicating devices within the wireless mesh network 80 .
- the user may integrate the device 10 into the wireless mesh network 80 without initializing or registering the device 10 with a central security node or the like.
- each device 10 may authenticate itself with a specific node (i.e., authentication agent). As such, before data is transferred between any two devices 10 , each device 10 may authenticate itself with the authentication agent node. The authentication agent node may then convey the result of the authentication to an enforcement point node, which may be co-located with the authentication agent node. The enforcement point node may then establish a data communication link between the two devices 10 if the authentications are valid. Moreover, in PANA, each device 10 may communicate with each other via an enforcement point node, which may verify that the authentication for each device 10 is valid.
- PANA Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access
- the efficient network layer may avoid using an authorization agent node, an enforcement point node, or both excessively. That is, no one node using the efficient network layer may be processing authentication data for each data transfer between nodes in the wireless mesh network. As a result, the nodes using the efficient network layer may conserve more energy as compared to the authorization agent node or the enforcement point node in the PANA protocol system.
- FIG. 9 illustrates an example handshake protocol 200 that may be used between devices 10 when transferring data between each other.
- the device 10 at node 1 may send a message 202 to the device 10 at node 2 .
- the message 202 may be a hello message that may include cipher suites, hash and compression algorithms, and a random number.
- the device 10 at node 2 may then respond with a message 204 , which may verify that the device 10 at node 2 received the message 202 from the device 10 at node 1 .
- the device at node 1 may again send the message 202 to the device 10 at node 2 .
- the device 10 at node 2 may then respond with a message 208 , which may include a hello message from node 2 , a certificate 194 from node 2 , a key exchange from node 2 , and a certificate request for node 1 .
- the hello message in the message 208 may include cipher suites, hash and compression algorithms, and a random number.
- the certificate 194 may be the security certificate embedded within the device 10 by the trusted manufacturer 192 as discussed above with reference to FIG. 8 .
- the key exchange may include a public key, a private key, or other cryptographic information that may be used to determine a secret key for establishing a communication channel between the two nodes.
- the key exchange may be stored in the certificate 194 of the corresponding device 10 located at the respective node.
- the device 10 at node 1 may send message 210 that may include a certificate 194 from node 1 , a key exchange from node 1 , a certificate verification of node 2 , and a change cipher spec from node 1 .
- the device 10 at node 1 may use the certificate 194 of node 2 and the key exchange from node 1 to verify the certificate 194 of node 2 . That is, the device 10 at node 1 may verify that the certificate 194 received from node 2 is valid based on the certificate 194 of node 2 and the key exchange from node 1 . If the certificate 194 from node 2 is valid, the device 10 at node 1 may send the change cipher spec message to the device 10 at node 2 to announce that the communication channel between the two nodes is secure.
- the device 10 at node 2 may use the certificate 194 of node 1 and the key exchange from node 2 to verify the certificate 194 of node 1 . That is, the device 10 at node 2 may verify that the certificate 194 received from node 1 is valid based on the certificate 194 of node 1 and the key exchange from node 2 . If the certificate 194 from node 1 is valid, the device 10 at node 2 may also send the change cipher spec message to the device 10 at node 1 to announce that the communication channel between the two nodes is secure.
- the device 10 at node 1 may send a group-wise network key 214 to the device 10 at node 2 .
- the group-wise network key 214 may be associated with the ELoWPAN 110 .
- devices previously authorized to communicate within the ELoWPAN 110 may provide the new devices access to the ELoWPAN 110 . That is, the devices previously authorized to communicate within the ELoWPAN 110 may provide the group-wise network key 214 to the new devices, which may enable the new devices to communicate with other devices in the ELoWPAN 110 .
- the group-wise network key 214 may be used to communicate with other devices that have been properly authenticated and that have previously provided with the group-wise network key 214 .
- identification information such as model number, device capabilities, and the like may be communicated between the devices.
- additional information such as data from sensors disposed on the device 10 , data analysis performed by the device 10 , and the like may be communicated between devices.
- the device 10 may not involve the user with establishing security or authentication processes for the device 10 .
- the security of the data transfers in the wireless mesh network 80 may not rely on a single node for security.
- the efficient network layer may ensure that data may be securely transferred between nodes even when some node becomes unavailable. As such, the efficient network layer may be much less vulnerable to security issues since it does not rely on a single node for securing data messages.
