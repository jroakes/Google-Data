Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to business listings and, more specifically, to augmenting business listings to include new businesses.
- Some aspects include a process for identifying a new business listing, the process including: identifying, from a log of local search queries, a term that does not correspond to a name of a business listing; determining a number of recent search queries containing the term and a number of historical search queries containing the term; determining that a rate based on the number of recent search queries exceeds a threshold rate based on the number of historical search queries; and identifying the term as a name of a new business listing.
- Some aspects include a tangible, non-transitory, machine-readable medium storing instructions that when executed by a data processing apparatus cause the data processing apparatus to perform operations, including: identifying, from a log of local search queries, a term that does not correspond to a name of a business listing; determining a number of recent search queries containing the term and a number of historical search queries containing the term; determining that a rate based on the number of recent search queries exceeds a threshold rate based on the number of historical search queries; and identifying the term as a name of a new business listing.
- Some aspects include a system, including one or more processors, and memory storing instructions that when executed by the processors cause the processors to effectuate operations including: identifying, from a log of local search queries, a term that does not correspond to a name of a business listing; determining a number of recent search queries containing the term and a number of historical search queries containing the term; determining that a rate based on the number of recent search queries exceeds a threshold rate based on the number of historical search queries; and identifying the term as a name of a new business listing.
- FIG. 1 shows an example of a new-business detector and the environment in which the detector operates
- FIG. 2 shows an example of a process for detecting new businesses
- FIG. 3 shows an example of a computer by which embodiments are implemented.
- Embodiments monitor query logs for unrecognized business names, which signal that a new business is likely extant and needs to be added to a business listing.
- Query logs present a relatively noisy signal from users, as some unrecognized queries are misspellings of known businesses, while others correspond to a new business.
- embodiments exploit the tendency of misspellings to remain generally constant in frequency over time, while a new business tends to cause an uptick in the rate of occurrence of a corresponding string, such as the business's name, in queries.
- embodiments establish a baseline for a given unrecognized term (e.g., a word or sequence of words) and, if that term exhibits a sudden increase from the baseline, it is identified as a likely new business.
- This automatically-generated lead is then fed to a work-list for a surveyor, who manually investigates further to confirm that a new business exists and should be added to the listing.
- the surveyor is presented with clues regarding the likely location of the business based on recognized portions of the query corresponding to location (e.g., a street name) and based on context in which queries were submitted (e.g., a viewport of an interactive map or location of the user's device).
- location e.g., a street name
- context in which queries were submitted e.g., a viewport of an interactive map or location of the user's device.
- some embodiments geolocate the submitted queries, cluster them, and detect spikes in each cluster, causing new local businesses to stand out in sharper relief relative to
- a search engine may receive queries including the unrecognized term “samwichs,” e.g., “samwichs restaurant,” samwichs 327 Main st.,” and “samwichs near mountanview.”
- the search engine verifies that the term “samwichs” does not correspond to a know business listing, and in some cases, presents the user with a spell-corrected version of search results, e.g., based on “sandwiches near mountaview,” or the search query, corresponding to a known sandwich shop in a business listing.
- the rate with which the term “samwhichs” appears in queries is generally constant, e.g., 1/100,000 queries or once every 2 days, plus-or-minus around 20%, in this hypothetical example.
- queries including this string will be submitted at a much higher rate, e.g., 1/20,000 queries or once every hour.
- Embodiments detect this change in rate and flag the term as likely being a name of a new business.
- some embodiments present the term and candidate locations inferred from the queries, e.g., 327 Main St. in Mountainview, to a surveyor, so the new business can be confirmed with relatively little effort.
- FIG. 1 shows an example of a computing environment 10 in which a new-business detector 12 operates to detect new businesses.
- the arrival of a new business is signaled by unrecognized terms occurring in queries submitted by user devices 14 or 16 to search engine 18 via the Internet 19 .
- These queries are stored in a query log 20 for subsequent analysis by the new-business detector 12 to augment a business listing 22 .
- the new businesses are presented on a mobile device 24 carried by a human reviewer in the field who confirms the existence of the new business before the business is added to the listing 22 .
- End-users query the search engine 18 via any of a variety of different interfaces on the user devices 14 or 16 , including an interactive map having a query input, a text input in a search engine website, and via spoken queries conveyed to search engine 18 for transcription into text queries. Examples of end-user devices 14 and 16 are described below with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the submitted queries include additional context, for instance a geolocation sensed by the mobile devices 14 or 16 , a map extent being displayed by the mobile devices 14 or 16 , and a IP address of the devices 14 or 16 .
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used.
- the search engine 18 maintains an index of resources for answering these queries.
- the query is submitted by the search engine 18 to the business listing 22 to determine whether a business in the listing is responsive to part of the query and indicate which part of the query is likely a business name.
- the business listing 22 includes names of businesses and, in some cases, locations of businesses. In some cases, some terms in the query do not match an entry in the business listing 22 , in which case, the search engine 18 stores the query in the query log 20 along with a timestamp of the query, and a geolocation of the query.
- Queries are geolocated based on the above-described context information. For example, queries are geolocated to a location known to match the IP address of the user device 14 or 16 from which the query was received; queries are geolocated to a area of a map being displayed on the user devices 14 or 16 ; or queries are geolocated to locations identified in the submitted query, as occurs when a query includes the name of the city or street along with the name of a new business.
- the search engine 18 is operative to suggest a spell-corrected version of the query to the user when a new term is detected.
- this selection is noted in the query log 20 (or the record in the log 20 is removed) as having been confirmed as a misspelling, rather than a query including the name of a new business.
- the new-business detector 12 includes a query-clustering module 26 , a new-term detector 28 , a historical-rate calculator 30 , a recent-rate calculator 32 , a rate-comparison module 34 , a new-business identifier 36 , and a candidate-business data store 38 . These components communicate with one another to acquire queries and associated data from the query log 20 , identify increases in the rate at which unrecognized terms occur, and flag those terms in the candidate-business data store 38 as names of new businesses to be investigated for addition to the business listing 22 .
- the query-clustering module 26 obtains the query records from the query log 20 and groups the query records by geographic location to form logs of local search queries. Geographic bins for grouping the queries may be predefined, for example by ZIP code, city, state, or an arbitrary grid, or geographic bins may be dynamically determined by clustering the geographic locations according to, for example, a k-means clustering algorithm. Some (or all) query records, as noted above, include a geographic location determined by the search engine 18 based on context information or geographic terms in the query.
- the output of the query-clustering module 26 is a plurality of logs of local search queries, each log containing one group of geographically clustered query records. Grouping the queries by location helps isolate signal from noise, as new businesses tend to start in a single location, and the local query log having that location exhibits a relatively large increase in the occurrence rate of the businesse's name relative to coincidental misspellings.
- the local query logs are input to the new-term detector 28 , which identifies in each log new terms that are absent from the business listing 22 .
- the new-term detector 28 operates within the search engine 18 , and new terms are associated with a query record in the query log 20 before being grouped geographically.
- the new term detector 28 submits each query in the log to the business listing 22 , which identifies the terms in the query absent from the business listing 22 .
- the new-term detector 28 outputs a new-term record, each record including an identifier of the local query log in which the term was detected, the query records in the log having the term, and the term itself.
- the new-term records are input to both the historical-rate calculator 30 and the recent-rate calculator 32 , which each measure the rate with which new terms are used in the local queries, but over differing time spans.
- the recent-rate calculator 32 measures the rate over a relatively short trailing duration from the current time
- the historical-rate calculator 30 measures the same property over longer time spans.
- the historical rate is characterized by a measure of central tendency (e.g., a mean, median, mode, etc.) and a measure of variability (e.g., standard deviation, max-to-min range, or variance).
- the historical-rate calculator 30 bins the query records at issue (i.e., those in a given new-term record) according to timestamps of the queries, for instance by month or year, and the mean (or other measure of central tendency) and standard deviation (or other measure of variance) of the rate across the bins is calculated to quantify the distribution of the rate over time.
- some embodiments of the historical-rate calculator 32 output for each new-term record a mean rate of occurrence of the term and a standard deviation of the rate of occurrence of the term.
- the recent-rate calculator 32 of this embodiment selects those query records of less than a threshold age, such as those having a timestamp within the previous seven days, previous 30 days, or previous three months, depending upon the desired responsiveness and acceptability of errors.
- the threshold age is selected based on the variability of the historical rate and the sample size to increase the likelihood of a statistically significant signal being detected, such that smaller sample sizes and greater variability result in older threshold ages.
- the selected queries are counted to determine the number of recent local search queries containing the corresponding term and a rate of occurrence, either explicitly by dividing the number of recent search queries by the amount of time in the trailing duration, or implicitly by using a fixed trailing duration such that the count consistently corresponds with the rate.
- the calculated recent rate of occurrence of each term is advanced to the rate-comparison module 34 , along with the corresponding new-term record.
- the historical rate and recent rate are normalized according to the total number of queries (either in the local area or without regard to area), e.g., by dividing the rates by the total for a corresponding time-bin or trailing duration. Normalizing the rates is helpful for analyzing queries of search engines that experience uneven rates of query submission, e.g., seasonal variation or growth in the user base. Otherwise, the increase in all query submissions could cause the recent rate for a potential new term to appear higher than the historical rate for reasons other than the arrival of a new business.
- the rate-comparison module 34 compares the outputs of the calculators 30 and 32 to identify instances in which the recent rate of usage of a unrecognized term exceeds the expected range indicated by the historical-rate calculator 30 in a local query log. To this end, in some embodiments, the rate-comparison module 34 determines whether the recent rate exceeds a threshold rate that is some number of standard deviations, e.g., approximately two, three, or four, above the mean historical rate. Or in some embodiments, the threshold rate is a predetermined amount above, or percentage of (e.g., 150%), the historical rate.
- the corresponding new-term record is advanced to the new-business identifier 36 , along with, in some cases, a confidence score based on the amount by which the recent rate exceeds the threshold. Otherwise, the term in question is disregarded from further analysis as likely arising from misspellings.
- some embodiments calculate multiple recent rates, each corresponding to a different trailing duration (e.g., a one-week rate, a one month rate, and a six month rate). Each of these recent rates has a different corresponding rate threshold relative to the historical rate, with lower thresholds applied to the recent rates measured over longer periods of time. Thus, a persistent but smaller increase that is not detected using the one-week rate may be detected by comparing the six-month rate to a smaller threshold over the historical rate. Using multiple recent rates in this manner alleviates some of the trade-offs that would otherwise be made between responsiveness and the risk of errors. If any of the recent rates indicate a new term, the new-term recored is input to the new-business identifier 36 .
- the new-business identifier 36 identifies the term as the name of a new business, either in the candidate-business data store 38 or in the business listing 22 , depending upon the embodiment.
- the new term is added directly to the business listing 22 along with an associated geographic location indicated by queries including the term, for example those queries determined to have a street address that is the same in more than a threshold number of queries including the term.
- confirmation is sought only for those new terms for which the confidence score is less than a threshold or for which the geographic location is insufficiently specified by context in the query records.
- New terms may be confirmed as new businesses with a variety of techniques. Confirmation is secured automatically, in some embodiments, by submitting a query from the new-business identifier 36 to the search engine 18 requesting reviews that mention a new business of the identified name. The term is confirmed by determining that more than a threshold number of reviews exist. Or confirmation may be secured manually by adding the name of the candidate new business to a work list for a human reviewer. In some cases, the work list is transmitted to the mobile device 24 , and each new business is presented along with a likely geographic location of the business inferred from the context of the queries and an interface by which the human reviewer indicates whether the new business is extant.
- the human reviewer visits the identified geographic locations for each item on the work list and confirms the new business, in which case the new-business identifier 36 adds the new business to the business listing 32 , either with the inferred location of the business, or a corrected location provided by the human reviewer.
- embodiments update the business listing 22 at relatively low cost, with relatively little effort on the part of human reviewers, who would otherwise likely canvas a geographic area looking for new businesses.
- the new businesses are identified and added to the listing, either automatically, or manually while focusing the human reviewer on relatively strong candidates for new businesses, thereby reducing the amount of effort consumed updating the business listing 22 .
- the components of the new-business detector 12 are illustrated as discrete functional blocks. But it should be noted that the software or hardware by which these functional blocks are implemented may be arranged differently from what is illustrated in FIG. 1 . For instance, such code or hardware may be conjoined, intermingled, subdivided, distributed, or otherwise differently arranged. Code for providing the functionality described herein may be stored on a tangible, non-transitory, machine-readable medium such that when the code is executed by a data processing apparatus, the data processing apparatus effectuates the operations described herein. Similarly, one or more instances of the computer system described below with reference to FIG. 3 may execute such code stored in memory of the computer system with one or more processors of the computer system to provide the functionality described herein.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example of a process 40 for detecting new businesses.
- the process 40 in some embodiments, is performed by the above-described new-business detector 12 , but is not limited to the particulars of that embodiment.
- the process 40 includes identifying, from a log of local search queries, a term that does not correspond to a name of a business listing, as indicated by block 42 .
- This step in some cases, is performed by the above-described query-clustering module 26 and new-term detector 28 , or this term may be performed by the above-described search engine 18 .
- process 40 includes determining a number of recent search queries containing the term and a number of historical search queries containing the term, as indicated by block 44 .
- Illustrated process 40 further includes determining that a rate based on the number of recent search queries exceeds a threshold rate based on the number of historical search queries, as indicated by block 46 . This step, in some embodiments, is performed by the above-described rate-comparison module 34 . Finally in this example, process 40 includes identifying the term as a name of a new business listing, as indicated by block 48 . This step is performed by the new-business identifier 36 of FIG. 1 . Thus, process 40 detects the presence of new businesses based on changes in the rate with which a name of a new business occurs in search queries and, in response, updates a business listing.
