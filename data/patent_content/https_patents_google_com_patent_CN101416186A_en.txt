Local search data storage 230 can be information like many other company/enterprises, school, library, tissue or the like the storage class.Map component 410 can use the information in the local search data storage 230 to create the mapping of the information of information in the local search data storage 230 from web search index thesaurus 420, as more detailed description below.
Refer back to Fig. 4, search component 430 can receive search inquiry from client 210.Search component 430 can be visited web search index thesaurus 420 to generate the Search Results of identification relevant documentation based on search inquiry.Relevant documentation can also comprise the local information that is associated with particular document.Search engine system 225 can be forwarded to the client 210 of submitting initial search query to Search Results and local information then, as is described in greater detail below.
Example process
Fig. 6 show principle according to the invention with the process flow diagram that local search related information is mapped to the example process that webpage is associated.Processing can check that each record that is stored in the local search data storage 230 comprises record (action 610) beginning of website with identification from map component 410.For example, map component 410 can be discerned the record that is associated with clauses and subclauses 500, and determines that the record that is associated with clauses and subclauses 500 comprises website www.clift.com.
In some instances, single cluster ID can comprise the record that contains a plurality of URL.In these examples, map component 410 can determine whether there are a plurality of URL (action 630) for any cluster ID then.If have a plurality of URL for single cluster ID, then map component 410 can be discerned among the described URL one (action 640) for this specified cluster ID.
For example, in one implementation, map component 410 can by check which source or feed provide URL about cluster ID come from a plurality of URL that this cluster ID is associated URL of identification.That is, map component 410 can with more may include usefulness from the information recently of being identified as such as feeding of the particular source of InfoUSA from another source and/or information reliably.When this cluster ID was mapped to URL, map component 410 can be from more reliable source identification URL then.
Whether alternatively, map component 410 can be visited the webpage corresponding to a plurality of URL, and determine to be included in address in the record that is associated with this cluster ID and telephone number and be complementary with information on corresponding to one in the webpage of URL.If the information on one in webpage is complementary with the address and the telephone number that are stored in the local search data storage 230, then map component 410 can be chosen as this URL the correct URL that is used to be mapped to this cluster ID.
In further substituting, map component 410 can be utilized such as the domain name registration entity of NetworkSolutions and carry out " WHOIS " inquiry.The WHOIS inquiry will provide enterprise name, address and the telephone number that is associated with domain name.If the information that provides and the address and the telephone number that are stored in the local search data storage 230 are complementary in response to the WHOIS inquiry, then map component can be chosen as this URL the correct URL that is used to be mapped to this cluster ID.
Except that attempting to discern about the supporting evidence that URL is mapped to the cluster ID in the local search data storage 230, search engine system 225 also can be searched conflicting information to discern suitable URL.For example, conflict mutually with address and/or telephone number in being stored in local search data storage 230 if be included in corresponding to the address on the webpage of a URL among the URL and/or telephone number, then this URL can be ignored or ignore to search engine system 225 for the purpose of mapping.In addition, if search engine system 225 finds many addresses on the webpage corresponding to a URL among the URL, then this can to indicate this URL/ website be directory site.In this case, this URL can be ignored or ignore to search engine system 225 for the purpose of mapping.
In a realization according to the invention, search engine system 225 can also be determined cluster ID not to be mapped to URL based on the size of the website that is associated with URL.For example, suppose that URL is www.dell.com.In this case, the contact details that are associated with dell.com that are stored in the local search data storage 230 may not have actual value to the user, because contact details may only be legal person address and universal telephone number.Therefore, search engine system 225 can be determined the quantity of the webpage that is associated with the website, and wherein this URL is in the webpage of described website one.If the quantity of the webpage on the website surpasses predetermined quantity, then search engine system 225 can be determined the contact details that are used for this URL should not offered the user.The predetermined quantity that should be appreciated that the webpage that is used to refer to the contact details that should not show URL and be associated with this URL can be any specific quantity.This allows search engine system 225 that these contact details (for example address and telephone number) are not provided when contact details are can not be to the user valuable.Therefore, in some instances, even be complementary with the information that is stored in the local search data storage 230 about the information of URL, search engine system 225 can not be mapped to URL with cluster ID yet.
After local search cluster ID was mapped to URL, map component 410 map information that can reverse was to create the mapping from this URL to this local search cluster ID.Map component 410 can be stored in (action 650) in the web search index thesaurus 420 with suitable URL with all or some information of being associated with cluster ID then.For example, map component 410 can be stored in web search index thesaurus 420 with the URL in Ford hotel in being used for restraining with the contact details (for example being stored in address and telephone number among clauses and subclauses 500-2 and the 500-3) in Ford hotel in the gram.By this way, the information that is associated with particular webpage that is stored in the web search index thesaurus 420 can comprise for example extracts and the contact details (for example address and telephone number) to the hyperlink of webpage, the text that is associated with particular webpage.For example, the clauses and subclauses that are associated with www.clifthotel.com can with the title that is associated with Ford hotel in the gram and take passages with gram in the address and the telephone number in Ford hotel comprise.Search engine system 225 can provide local search related information then when client 210 provides Search Results, as below in greater detail.
Fig. 7 show in the realization of principle according to the invention with the example process that provides Search Results and local search information to be associated.The example that Search Results is provided via the network such as network 240 has been used in the processing that is described below.Yet, technology described herein can be used in any search system.Processing can be used for the user interface (UI) of inputted search inquiry from client 210 via network 240 access servers 220 and reception.Alternatively, client 210 can have the toolbar that is associated with search engine system 225 that is carried on the client terminal device 210, and described toolbar makes the input of search inquiry more convenient.
Suppose that the user has imported search inquiry via client 210, and this search inquiry has been sent to server 220 via network 240.Search engine system 225 can receive search inquiry (action 710).In example implementation, search component 430 receives search inquiry, carries out search and generates Search Results (action 720).These Search Results can comprise the advertisement based on this search inquiry.In addition, search engine system 225 can discern with particular search result in one or more local search related information that are associated, such as address and telephone number.
For example, suppose that from one inquiry in the client 210 be " Ford in the gram ".In this case, supposing further that search engine system 225 has generated comprises the Search Results that links that is associated with the website in Ford hotel in the gram of San Francisco.Further hypothesis web search index thesaurus 420 has been stored the local information that is associated with Ford hotel in the gram, as mentioned above.For example, suppose web search index thesaurus 420 will be in the gram of San Francisco the address in Ford hotel and telephone number with the storage of including about www.clift.com.In this case, search component 430 will be in the gram in San Francisco the address in Ford hotel and telephone number in being stored in web search index thesaurus 420 in the gram Ford hotel title/hyperlink and take passages and retrieve.Search Results and contact details can be offered user's (action 730) then.
The example user interface screen 800 that provides to the user in action 730 is provided Fig. 8.With reference to figure 8, search engine system 225 can be provided for the title and the hyperlink of webpage in zone 810, and provides the extracts that is associated with webpage in zone 812.According to example implementation according to the invention, search engine system 225 also can provide the address and the telephone number in Ford hotel in the gram in zone 814.Go out as shown in FIG. 8, and compare on the top that contact details is placed on Search Results, be provided at contact details after the title and take passages before make the user be very easy to find address and telephone number.This makes the user can see clearly that contact details become more likely.
Though do not describe in detail at this, search engine system 225 can be stored be associated with interested various address latitude and longitude information.For example, the latitude and the longitude information that are associated of the address that search engine system 225 can be stored with zone 814 in Fig. 8 shows.When the user was chosen in the map in the zone 816 among Fig. 8 and Info Link, latitude and longitude information were automatically offered ground diagram generator assembly, and described ground diagram generator assembly is provided at the maps of zone 910 demonstrations.
In some instances, can there be a plurality of cluster ID for single URL.For example, suppose that URL is the homepage such as the chain restaurant in the restaurant of Wendy's (Wendy).In this case, the URL that is used for this homepage can be linked to a plurality of cluster ID that are associated with each different restaurants.These clusters ID and with each information that is associated of these clusters ID can be uncorrelated with user's search inquiry.For example, the cluster ID that is associated with restaurant at the Wendy's of New York is not with may be relevant with the user in the restaurant of the search Wendy's in San Francisco.Therefore, search engine system 225 can determine whether there are a plurality of cluster ID (action 750) for the single URL that generates in Search Results.If have a plurality of cluster ID for single URL, then search engine system 225 can not provide local information (for example address and telephone number) with the Search Results that returns to the user.
