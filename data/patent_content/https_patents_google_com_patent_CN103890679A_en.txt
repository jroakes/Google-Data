There is many dissimilar sensors and sensor output.In general, sensor output is directly or indirectly relevant to parameter, machine state, structural state, computing mode or the physical environment parameter of certain type.Fig. 9 shows the general characteristic of sensor output.Illustrate as first in Fig. 9 draws Figure 90 2, sensor can be exported by curve 904 and represent and time dependent signal, and wherein said signal is directly or indirectly relevant to the parameter P drawing with respect to Z-axis 906.Sensor can be continuously or with time interval output signal, wherein draws the time of output with respect to transverse axis 908.In some cases, sensor output can with two or more relating to parameters.For example, in drafting Figure 91 0, sensor output and two different parameters P that draw with respect to axle 912 and 914 respectively

2directly or indirectly be correlated with and (draw) in time the value changing with respect to Z-axis 916.In the following discussion, for the purpose of simplifying the description and discuss, suppose that sensor produces and the direct or indirect relevant output of single parameter, as the drafting Figure 90 2 in Fig. 9.In the following discussion, suppose that sensor output is the set about the parameter value of parameter P.Parameter can be relevant to environmental aspect (such as temperature, ambient lighting level, sound level and other such characteristic).But, parameter can be also data mode, the electric current drawing from power supply, gas or the fluid of the memory storage address in one or more positions, the data storage device of machine component flow velocity, gas or fluid pressure and comprise the parameter of many other types of the useful information for controlling object.
Figure 10 A-Figure 10 D shows the information of being processed and being generated by intelligent controller during control operation.Be similar to the drafting Figure 90 2 in Fig. 9, all figure all illustrate wherein with respect to another set of Z-axis rendering parameter value or control correlation and with respect to the transverse axis drafting figure of drafting time.Figure 10 A shows the idealized standard of the result of controlled entity operation.Z-axis 1002 in Figure 10 A represents designated parameter value P
s.For example, the in the situation that of intelligent constant-temperature device, designated parameter value can be temperature.For irrigation system, by contrast, designated parameter value can be flow velocity.Figure 10 A represents that intelligent controller is by controlling the drafting figure of the directed time dependent continuous curve 1004 of desired parameter value with realization of one or more devices, machine or system.The indication of described standard wishes that parameter value is lower by 1006 at first, then rises to relative high value 1008, then drops to intermediate value 1010, and and then rises to high value 1012.As an example, can visually show and control standard as control-time table to user.
Figure 10 B shows corresponding to the alternate figures of the control-time table of the control standard shown in Figure 10 A or coded data figure.Control-time table comprises corresponding to the parameter value at the edge 1018 in Figure 10 A to be increased by 1016, reduces by 1020 and increase by 1024 indication corresponding to the parameter value at the edge 1016 in Figure 10 A corresponding to the parameter value at the edge 1022 in Figure 10 A.The direction arrow of drawing in Figure 10 B can be considered to the indication of the desired parameter variation of set-point or the particular point in time in certain time period.
The control-time table of being learnt by intelligent controller represents the important component part of the result of automatic learning.The control-time table of learning can be by various different modes coding and is stored in intelligent controller, is controlled by the electronic memory or mass storage device in system or the remote data storage facility (comprising the data storage facility based on cloud computing) of intelligent controller.In many cases, the control-time table of learning can be encoded and be stored in multiple positions, and described control-time table comprises the control-time table being distributed between inner intelligent controller storer and remote data storage facility.Set-point changes and can be stored as the record that has multiple fields, and described field comprises that it be that set-point, set-point that the set-point that generates of system or user generate change is that instant control inputs set-point changes or field and other such field that timetable set-point changes, creates time and date that set-point changes, finally edits the time and date that set-point changes that indication set-point changes.In addition, set-point can be associated with two or more parameter values.As an example, scope set-point can indicating intelligent controller should maintain the scope of the parameter value at controlled environment place.Set-point changes so-called " set-point ".
Figure 10 C shows by intelligent controller and exports and the control that may be caused by the control-time table shown in Figure 10 B is exported.In this drawing, draw the amplitude of output control signal with respect to Z-axis 1026.For example, controlling output can be the voltage signal that is outputed to heating unit by intelligent constant-temperature device, and wherein high voltage signal indication is current should operate heating unit and low-voltage output indication should not operate heating system.Edge 1028 in Figure 10 C is corresponding to the set-point 1016 in Figure 10 B.The width of positive control output 1030 can with length Length Indication, desired parameter value variation or the Amplitude correlation by set-point arrow 1016.In the time obtaining desired parameter value, intelligent controller makes the output of high voltage signal discontinuous, as represented by edge 1032.Similarly positive output control signal 1034 and 1036 is to be drawn by the set- point 1020 and 1024 in Figure 10 B.
Finally, Figure 10 D shows as exported the parameter of observing of indicating and by intelligent controller, the control of one or more controlled entities is caused by sensor and changes.In Figure 10 D, draw the direct or indirect relevant sensor output to parameter P with respect to Z-axis 1040.The parameter value of observing is to be represented by level and smooth continuous curve 1042.Although this continuous curve can be regarded as with Figure 10 A in the initial specifications curvilinear correlation drawn, the curve of observing does not have standard curve described in exact matching.First, controlled entity is realized the parameter value variation being represented by the set-point 1016 in the control-time table of drawing in Figure 10 B and may be consumed finite time section 1044.Moreover once acquisition parameter value and controlled entity relate to discontinuous operation, parameter value can start to decline 1046, the operation that the control that causes feedback to cause exports to recover controlled entity is to maintain desired parameter value.Therefore, in fact the constant parameter value 1008 of the desired high level in Figure 10 A can finish as not having accurately corresponding to the time changing curve 1048 of controlling standard 1004.Above discuss with reference to figure 8, the first order of feedback is to use to control one or more controlled entities by intelligent controller, makes the fixed time behavior of the parameter in approximate match Figure 10 A as far as possible of the time dependent parameter value of observing shown in Figure 10 D.Above discuss with reference to figure 8, second level feedback control loop can relate to by user and changes in time the control-time table of storage or input instant steering order and change the standard shown in Figure 10 A, to generate the modification standard of the parameter value/time curve that produces the desirable operating result of reflection user.
Eurypalynous controlled entity and correlation control unit are permitted in existence.In some cases, control the indication that output can comprise current level, handling capacity or the output that whether should operate the indication of controlled entity and operate in the time of operation controlled entity.In other cases, controlling output may be scale-of-two activation/disables.For the purpose of simplifying the description and discuss, in below discussing, suppose the control output of latter one type.
Figure 11 A-Figure 11 E provides the explanation based on state transition graph of intelligent controller operation.In these figure, disk-like element or node represent that the curved arrow of intelligent controller state and interconnecting nodes represents state conversion.Figure 11 A shows a kind of possible state transition graph of intelligent controller.There are four kinds of main state 1102-1105.These states comprise: (1) stationary state 1102, and wherein current without any need for controller output and the current inertia of wherein said one or more controlled entity or in service mode from the feedback indication of sensor; (2) wake-up states 1103, wherein sensing data indication may need output to control one or more parameters are turned back in desired scope, but exports still one or more controlled entities described in un-activation of control signal; (3) active state 1104, the parameter that wherein sensing data continuation indication is observed is beyond desired scope and wherein said one or more controlled entity is exported activation and operating so that the parameter of observing turns back to specified scope by controlling; (4) initial stage stationary state 1105, but the parameter that the operation of wherein said one or more controlled entities has made to observe turns back to specified scope does not impel yet intelligent controller that output control signal is sent to described one or more controlled entity with the described one or more controlled entity of stopping using from the feedback of sensor.In general, state conversion is flowed in a clockwise direction, make intelligent controller conventionally take stationary state 1102, but regularly wake to activate described one or more controlled entity up due to feedback indication in step 1103, in state 1104, make the parameter of observing turn back to specified scope.Once in step 1105, make the parameter of observing turn back to specified scope, intelligent controller will stop using output control signal send to described one or more controlled entity, thereby turn back to stationary state 1102.
Each and two additional state in major cycle state 1102-1105 are associated: (1) timetable variable condition 1106-1109 and control variable condition 1110-1113.Repeating these states makes each major cycle state be associated with himself a pair of timetable variation and control variable condition.In general, this is because timetable changes and controls variable condition is transient state, and described controller state turns back to original major cycle state (reached timetable variation or control variable condition from described original major cycle state by previous conversion) or turns back to the next major cycle state above-mentioned circulation from described transient state.In addition, timetable variation and control variable condition are the parallel asynchronous operation states of a type being associated with major cycle state.Timetable variable condition represent intelligent controller and by displaying time table interface carry out that control-time table creates, control-time table is revised or the user of control-time table bookkeeping or other remote entity between mutual.Control variable condition and represent the mutual of user or other remote entity and intelligent controller, wherein user or other remote entity are input to intelligent controller by instant control command to be converted into the output control signal of described one or more controlled entities.
Except the alphanumeric labels that add circle associated with each photograph (such as the alphanumeric labels 1116 that adds circle), Figure 11 B is the same state transition graph shown in Figure 11 A.Figure 11 C provides key for these switch labels.Therefore Figure 11 B-Figure 11 C provides the state and the state that represent together intelligent controller operation to change both detailed descriptions together.
For the level of detail that key diagram 11B-Figure 11 C comprises, consider the state conversion 1118-1120 being associated with state 1102 and 1106.As the form providing from Figure 11 C can be determined, the conversion 1118 from state 1102 to state 1106 relates to by user, remote input or by intelligent controller itself, the control-time table that is stored in intelligent controller or the addressable one or more control-time tables of intelligent controller are made is changed.In general,, after timetable changes, operation is converted back to state 1102 via conversion 1119.But, changing and caused sensing data previously in specified scope, to drop on now in new specified scope relative impossible event in addition at timetable, state is transformed into wake-up states 1103 via conversion 1120 on the contrary.
In fact the automatic control time table learning major part that, generation is undertaken by intelligent controller is change and control in variable condition because intelligent controller operates in timetable.Provide intelligent controller how to control described one or more controlled entity to meet the information of hope and expectation of one or more users or remote entity from study in time wherein from the instant control inputs of user and other remote entity (cause being transformed into control variable condition 1110-1113).The control-time table of being made when being operated in timetable variable condition 1106-1109 by intelligent controller by intelligent controller changes the learning process of encoding.These variations are that the instant control inputs based on recorded, the control-time table recording change and current and historical control-time table information.Various types of information that can comprise recorded output control signal and sensor input and collect from external source (comprise can by the source of internet access) for the extraneous information source of learning.Except previously described state, also there are the one or more original states 1130 that represent "on" position first or reset the state after intelligent controller.In general, the start operation before the operation of one or more initial configuration causes from described one or more original states 1130 to stationary state 1102 or wake-up states 1103 via conversion 1132 and 1134.
Figure 11 D-Figure 11 E uses the extra shade of the state in the state transition graph shown in Figure 11 A to show two kinds of patterns of the automatic control time table learning of being carried out by the related intelligent controller of the application.The first pattern shown in Figure 11 D is steady-state mode.Steady-state mode is sought the best or near optimal control with the instant control inputs of minimum.Although study continues in steady-state mode, but described study is implemented relatively slowly and conservatively in response to instant control inputs, sensor input and the input from oracle, prerequisite is that steady state (SS) study is mainly to improve control operation and follow the tracks of the variation relatively slowly in time of desired control system for small grain size.In steady state (SS) study and general intelligent controller operation, the state of hope is the stationary state 1102 shown in the cross-hauling in Figure 11 D, and it is indicated this state as the target of steady state operation or wishes state most.Light shade is used to refer to other major cycle state 1103-1105 and in steady state operation pattern, has neutrality or favo(u)red state a little.Obviously, the centre of controlled entity or continued operation need these states to change with the timetable that one or more parameters is maintained in specified scope and follow the tracks of in described specified scope.But, these states a little disadvantage are: in general, minimum number or the minimum cumulative duration of the activation of described one or more controlled entities and the circulation of stopping using cause Optimal Control system conventionally, and the accumulated time that minimizes the activation of described one or more controlled entities causes conventionally with respect to energy and/or resource use amount Optimization control system.In steady state operation pattern, timetable variation and control variable condition 1110-1113 are totally unfavorable, because being intended that of control time table learning makes intelligent controller dream up in time one or more control-time tables of the desired operation behavior of accurate reflection user or other remote entity automatically.Although sometimes these states are temporarily forbidden continually due to variation, the variation of environmental aspect or the variation of controlled entity of desirable operation behavior, the general objectives of control time table learning is the frequency that minimizes timetable variation and instant control inputs automatically.In many optimization approach, especially wish to minimize the frequency of instant control inputs.
Compared with Figure 11 D, Figure 11 E shows active learning pattern, and wherein intelligent controller generally operates in the short time period after the conversion in major cycle state 1102-1103 in described one or more original states 730.During active learning pattern, compared with the steady state operation pattern shown in Figure 11 D, stationary state 1102 least favorables and timetable variation and control variable condition 1106-1113 are the most favourable, and wherein state 1103-1105 has neutrality hope property.In active learning pattern or in the operational phase, intelligent controller is sought frequently instant control inputs and timetable changes actively to obtain again fast one or more initial control-time tables.As discussed below, by using instant control inputs relatively fast to relax strategy, when operating under active learning pattern, attempt intelligent controller to force user or other remote entity to provide instant control inputs to determine fast global shape and the profile of initial control-time table in the relatively short time interval.After completing initial active learning and generating enough initial control-time tables, along with intelligent controller starts to improve control-time table and follows the tracks of the secular variation of controlling standard, environment, control system and other such factor, hope property relatively of various states reverts to the hope shown in Figure 11 D.Therefore, automatically the related intelligent controller that is associated with these methods of control-time table learning method and the application being that the initial active learning pattern of state mode of learning steady in a long-term is as feature after after short time period relatively.
Figure 12 provides the state transition graph that automatic control time table learning is shown.Automatic learning occurs in the normal controller operating period shown in Figure 11 A-Figure 11 C, and therefore the state transition graph shown in Figure 12 intelligent controller described with Figure 11 A-Figure 11 C in the parallel operation behavior occurring of intelligent controller operation described.After one or more original states 1202 of the original state 1130 corresponding in Figure 11 B, intelligent controller enters initial configuration learning state 1204, and wherein intelligent controller is attempted the one or more initial control-time tables of one or more establishments based in following item: be stored in intelligent controller or the addressable acquiescence control-time table of intelligent controller; Create by timetable the initial time table establishment dialogue that interface and user or other remote entity carry out; By the combination of two kinds of such approach; Or by additional route.Initial configuration mode of learning 1204 walks abreast and occurs with the conversion 1132 and 1134 in Figure 11 B.During initial learn pattern, there is no to occur the study that changes from manual input set-point, because found that user not inadvertently makes many such changes when exploring the feature of controller and function conventionally in its operating and controlling interface feature.
After initial configuration, and then intelligent controller is transformed into the active learning pattern 1206 of discussing with reference to figure 11E above.Active learning pattern 1206 is mode of learning states of the most of or all states the state 1130 in the various states containing in Figure 11 B.In other words, active learning pattern 1206 be with Figure 11 A-Figure 11 E in the parallel mode of learning state of the general operation state discussed.As above discussed, during active learning, intelligent controller attempts creating one or more control-time tables that bottom line is at least enough to the operation behavior of specifying intelligent controller and the entity of intelligent controller based on controlling from the frequent input of user or other Long-distance Control entity.Once complete active learning, intelligent controller is changed forward by multiple steady state (SS) learning phase 1208-1210.Each conversion downwards of being undertaken by described serial steady state (SS) learning phase state 1208-1210 in state transition graph shown in Figure 12 is to complete by the variation in mode of learning parameter, the approach that described mode of learning parameter generally causes automatic control time table learning more slowly and more conservative, because become for described one or more control-time tables of being developed by intelligent controller the hope and the standard that more and more accurately and more reflect user in previous learning state.The number of times of the information processing circulation that can carry out based on the time period, by intelligent controller, by determining whether the complicacy of one or more current control-time tables is enough to the basis of the steady state (SS) study that provides slower and/or determines whether to complete active learning based on other consideration, rule and threshold value.It should be noted that in some embodiments, can have multiple active learning state.
Figure 13 shows the time frame being associated with the exemplary control-time table that comprises short period frame timetable.Control-time table is expressed as the drafting figure of the transverse axis 1302 with the expression time on figure.The one or more parameter values of Z-axis 1303 general expression.As discussed further below, control-time table is appointed as desirable parameter value the function of time.Control-time table can be discrete value set or continuous curve.Specified parameter value is directly or indirectly relevant to the mentioned observable property that the measurement that can obtain by any various types of sensor measurements or from any various types of sensors in environment, system, device, machine or tissue is inferred.In general, sensor output is as at least one FEEDBACK CONTROL level, and the operation behavior of intelligent controller by described FEEDBACK CONTROL level adjusting gear, machine, system or tissue is so that observed parameter value is consistent with the parameter value of specifying in control-time table.Increase progressively by the hour and cover the time span in a week along transverse axis as the control-time table of following in question example.Control-time table comprises 7 sub-timetable 1304-1310 corresponding to several days.As discussed further below, in exemplary intelligent controller, there is automatic control time table learning take one day as the time interval, target be produce capable of circulation, within one week, connect one week, the stable control-time table weekly applied within the relatively long time period.Again as discussed below, intelligent controller can be learnt even more macrocyclic control-time table, such as annual control-time table, wherein below annual control-time table, have levels organized monthly, weekly, every day and sub-timetable even per hour.In some cases, intelligent controller can generate and maintain short period frame control-time table, comprise control-time table per hour, based on minute control-time table or the control-time table even increasing progressively with millisecond or microsecond.As the computer instruction of the storage of composition control routine together, control-time table is the tangible physical assemblies of control system.Control-time table is stored in physical storage medium as physical state.As controlled routine and program, control-time table must be the tangible physical control system component that can be accessed and be used by the steering logic based on processor and control system.
Figure 14 A-Figure 14 C shows three kinds of dissimilar control-time tables.In Figure 14 A, control-time table is continuous curve 1402, and it represents the function of the parameter value of drawing with respect to Z-axis 1404 and the time of drawing with respect to transverse axis 1406.Continuous curve only includes horizontal and vertical section.Horizontal segment represents to wish that parameter keeps the constant time period, and vertical section represents the desired variation of parameter value at particular point in time.This is the control-time table of simple types and hereinafter for automatic each example of control time table learning.But control-time table learning method also can be learnt the more timetable of complicated type automatically.For example, Figure 14 B shows and not only comprises horizontal and vertical section but also comprise the control-time table of straight-line segment at any angle.Therefore, can be specified with the variation of given speed generation parameter value rather than the variation of dedicated instant generation parameter value as the simple control-time table shown in Figure 14 A by this control-time table.Automatically control-time table learning method also can adapt to the control-time table based on level and smooth continuous curve, shown in Figure 14 C.In general, the characterization of the control-time table based on level and smooth continuous curve (shown in Figure 14 C) and data encoding storage data volume more complicated and that comprise is greater than the simpler control-time table shown in Figure 14 B and Figure 14 A.
In the following discussion, generally suppose parameter value lack system when operation (such as being that temperature and controlled system are while being heating unit when parameter value) trend towards court more low value relax.But in other cases, parameter value can Chao Genggao value relax lacking system when operation (such as being that temperature and controlled system are while being air-conditioning when parameter value).Relax direction conventionally corresponding to the direction of low-resource or system consumption more.In other cases, such as being that temperature and controlled system are, while comprising both HVAC system of heating and cooling function, to relax direction and can depend on environment or other outside situation when parameter value.
Turn to the control-time table shown in Figure 14 A, the control-time table 1402 that alternatively continuous curve can be represented is encoded to the discrete set-point corresponding to the vertical section in continuous curve or edge.Continuous curve control-time table is generally used for representing creating interface establishment or the storage control-time table of the combination establishment of the information of the control-time table based on having existed, the instant control inputs recording and/or the sensing data recording or these types by intelligent controller by user or remote entity via the timetable being provided by intelligent controller in the following discussion.
On figure, also draw a diagram and show instant control inputs with the relation of parameter value and time.Figure 15 A-Figure 15 G shows the expression of instant control inputs, and described instant control inputs can receive and carry out and then be recorded and cover the upper part as automatic control time table learning of control-time table (such as the control-time table of discussing with reference to figure 14A-Figure 14 C) above by intelligent controller.The perpendicular line segment table being finished by the filling with little or shade disk on figure shows instant control inputs.Figure 15 A shows the expression of two instant control inputs 1502 and 1504.Instant control inputs is equivalent to the edge (shown in Figure 14 A) in control-time table in essence, described instant control inputs is to be input to intelligent controller by user or remote entity, thereby wish that input control will be carried out by intelligent controller immediately, override any current control-time table of specifying intelligent controller operation.Therefore instant control inputs is the real-time set-point input to intelligent controller by control inputs interface.
Because instant control inputs is changed current control-time table, thus instant control inputs generally with in Figure 15 A, be shown the temporary transient control-time table parameter that formation extends forward from instant control inputs in time and be associated with the follow-up temporary transient control-time table of the dotted line horizontal and vertical lines of the relation curve of time.Temporary transient control-time table 1506 and 1508 is associated with the instant control inputs 1502 and 1504 in Figure 15 A respectively.
Figure 15 B shows the example of instant control inputs and the temporary transient control-time table being associated.Instant control inputs 1510 is to override current control-time table and guide the one or more controlled entities of intelligent controller control to equal the input set-point of the vertical coordinate of filling disk 1512 in representing of instant control inputs to realize parameter value in essence.Time in sight, after control inputs, when the temporary transient thermostatic control timetable time interval 1514 is in sight, after control inputs, extend certain time period, and then relax instant control inputs by follow-up instant control inputs end point or follow-up set-point 1516.The time span that instant control inputs maintains in the time interval 1514 is the parameter of automatic control time table learning.The direction of follow-up instant control inputs end point set-point 1516 and amplitude represent one or more extra control-time table learning parameters automatically.Note that automatic control-time table learning parameter is the adjustable parameter of controlling the operation of automatic control time table learning, and be different from described one or more parameter values of drawing and comprise control-time table with respect to the time.The parameter value of drawing with respect to Z-axis in the exemplary control-time table of current discussion indication is directly or indirectly relevant to observable (comprising environmental aspect, machine state etc.).
Figure 15 C shows the existing control-time table of the instant control inputs that superposes above.Existing control-time table requires 1522 in 7:00(Figure 15 C in morning in parameter value P) locate the increase that represented by edge 1520.The more early parameter value variation that instant control inputs 1524 designated magnitude are slightly little.Figure 15 D-Figure 15 G shows and can depend on each different embodiments of intelligent controller logic and/or the automatically currency of control-time table learning parameter value and each follow-up temporary transient control-time table of obtaining.In Figure 15 D-Figure 15 G, the temporary transient control-time table phantom line segments being associated with instant control inputs illustrate and existing control-time table in the described part that override by instant control inputs be to be illustrated by a line segment.In a kind of approach shown in Figure 15 D, the desired parameter value of being indicated by instant control inputs 1524 maintains set time section 1526, and after the described time period 1526, temporary transient control-time table is loosened to the parameter value of being specified at the time point of carrying out instant control inputs by control-time table as edge 1528 expressions.Maintain this parameter value 1530 until next timetable set-point, described next timetable set-point is corresponding to the edge 1532 in Figure 15 C, and now intelligent controller recovers to control according to control-time table.
In the substituting approach shown in Figure 15 E, the parameter value of being specified by instant control inputs 1524 is maintained to 1532 until reach next timetable set-point, in this case, set-point is corresponding to the edge 1520 in the control-time table shown in Figure 15 C.At described next set-point place, intelligent controller recovers to control according to existing control-time table.This approach is behaved desired conventionally, because user wishes manually to input conventionally, remain valid in set-point until next timetable set-point changes.
In the different approaches shown in Figure 15 F, by intelligent controller, the parameter value of being specified by instant control inputs 1524 is maintained to set time section 1534, after the described time period 1534, by the parameter value of having been specified at described time point by existing control-time table in 1536 recoveries.
In the approach shown in Figure 15 G, the parameter value of being specified by instant control inputs 1524 is maintained to 1538 until the arrival direction set-point contrary with instant control inputs, now at the existing control-time table of 1540 recovery.In substituting approach, instant control inputs further can be loosened to minimum reasonable level to attempt carrying out optimization system operation about resource and/or energy consumption.In these approach during being generally used for active learning, user is forced to initiatively to select to be greater than or less than the parameter value that uses the parameter value being associated with the energy of minimum or low speed or resource.
In an illustrative embodiments of automatic control time table learning, intelligent controller is monitored instant control inputs and timetable variation in the process of the monitoring period generally overlapping with the time span of control-time table or sub-timetable, and basis is except the one or more entities of existing control-time table control as being override by instant control inputs and table variation input time simultaneously.In the time that monitoring period finishes, recorded data is superimposed upon on existing control-time table, and existing control-time table and timetable change and the feature of instant control inputs generates new interim timetable by combining.After various types of parsings, new interim timetable is upgraded to existing control-time table in existing control-time table is intended to the future time interval of control system operation.
Figure 16 A-Figure 16 E shows an aspect by the method for existing control-time table and the timetable variation of recording and the control-time table that control inputs is synthetic new immediately.Figure 16 A shows the existing control-time table in monitoring period.Figure 16 B shows the instant control inputs of the multiple records that are superimposed upon after monitoring period on control-time table.Shown in Figure 16 B, there are 6 instant control inputs 1602-1607.Detect trooping of existing control-time table set-point and instant control inputs with clustering technique.A kind of approach detecting of trooping is to determine all time intervals that are greater than threshold length, neither exists existing control-time table set-point also not have instant control inputs, during the described time interval shown in Figure 16 C.The horizontal bidirectional arrow (such as four-headed arrow 1610) of drawing figure below represents to be greater than the interval of threshold length, on described interim, instant control inputs was added to existing control-time table time, neither exists existing control-time table set-point also not have instant control inputs.Then by not having the described part overlapping with these time intervals to be considered as trooping of existing control-time table set-point and instant control inputs in time shaft, shown in Figure 16 D.First troops 1612 contains existing control-time table set-point 1614-1616 and instant control inputs 1602 and 1603.Second troops 1620 contains instant control inputs 1604 and 1605.The 3rd troops 1622 contains existing control-time table set-point 1624.The 4th troops 1626 contains instant control inputs 1606 and 1607 and existing control-time table set-point 1628.In a cluster disposal route, each trooping is reduced to zero, one or two set-point in the new interim timetable being generated by recorded instant control inputs and existing control-time table.Figure 16 E shows four exemplary new interim timetables 1630 that obtain of trooping by identifying in analysis diagram 16D.
Troop and process zero, one or two new control-time table set-point of being intended to by each the existing control-time table set-point in trooping and instant control inputs being merged to reflection representative of consumer or the apparent willingness of remote entity to existing control-time table and instant control inputs and simplify new interim timetable.By contrast, may generate new interim timetable as existing control-time table set-point and instant control inputs and.But described approach will cause rough alterable height and fine-grained control-time table conventionally, it generally can not reflect the final hope of user or other remote entity and parameter value that conventionally formation can not be realized by Based Intelligent Control and the relation curve of time.As an example, in intelligent constant-temperature device, the assigned temperature of being separated by 15 minutes differs two set-points of 10 degree and cannot be realized by the HVAC system that is controlled by intelligent controller.Possible situation is that for example, under some environmental aspect, HVAC system maximum is merely able to the raising 5 per hour internal temperature of house to spend.In addition, simple control-time table can cause and can be used for controlling one or more entities to produce the more diverse collection of optimization strategy of the time dependent parameter value consistent with control-time table or P value by intelligent controller.In view of other constraint, intelligent controller then can Optimization control, such as minimization of energy use amount or the utilization of resources.
Trooping of existing control-time table set-point and instant control inputs resolved to one or two new interim timetable set-point and have many possible approach.Figure 17 A-Figure 17 E shows a kind of approach that parsing timetable is trooped.In Figure 17 A-Figure 17 E each, show three drafting figure.The first drafting illustrates the instant control inputs recording being superimposed upon on existing control-time table.The second drafting figure is reduced to dissimilar set-point the equivalent set-point of single broad types, and last drafting illustrates set-point is resolved to zero, one or two new interim timetable set-point.
Figure 17 A shows and troops 1702, the direction of its working control producing by the existing control-time table set-point about by intelligent controller and instant control inputs 704 and amplitude indication show obvious increases P value trend, as when existing control-time table set-point known in the time being plotted as the set-point of single type or event together with control inputs immediately.In this case, 4 set-point 706-709 in described 6 set-points cause specified P value to increase, and wherein only have single set-point 710 to cause P value slight reduction and a set-point 712 not to make P value change.Under this and analogue, replace all set-points by the single set-point of specifying P value to increase, this can be the intention of all expressing in existing control-time table and instant control inputs by legitimate inference.Troop described in being placed in the time of the first set-point and specify new P value to equal the highest P value by described any set-point appointment of trooping in the single set-point 716 of trooping of in this case, replacing set-point 704.
Trooping shown in Figure 17 B comprises 5 set-point 718-722.In these set-points two specify P values to reduce, specify the increase of P value and one without any impact for two.Therefore, the set of set-point does not show that any obvious P value changes intention, and therefore new interim timetable 724 does not comprise any set-point of trooping in the time interval, and wherein P value maintains the initial p value of the existing control-time table of trooping in the time interval.
Figure 17 C shows and shows obvious the trooping of trend downwards that is similar to the uptrending being represented by the set-point of trooping shown in Figure 17 A.In this case, by the time point place of the first set-point corresponding in trooping and specify P value to reduce to be equivalent to the minimum P value of being specified by any set-point in trooping single newly temporarily timetable set-point 726 replace described 4 set-points of trooping.
In Figure 17 D, troop and comprise three set-point 730-732.In the time that the time interval of trooping starts, improve the apparent willingness of P value corresponding to the set-point indication of existing control-time table set-point 730 and follow-up instant control set-point 731, and the apparent willingness that reduces P value in the time that the time interval of trooping finishes is indicated in last set-point 732.In this case, replace described three set-points by two set- points 734 and 736 of the intention that in new interim timetable, reflection is inferred by three set-points in trooping.Figure 17 E shows the similar situation of wherein being replaced three set-points in trooping by two new interim timetable set- points 738 and 740, with temporary transient raising in new interim timetable in Figure 17 B and reduce subsequently compared with P value, represent in this case temporary transient reduction and then improve subsequently P value.
Existence can be recognized many different calculation methods of the trend of the set-point of trooping of discussing with reference to figure 17A-Figure 17 E.These trend provide the example of the various types of trend that can recognize by calculating.Distinct methods and the strategy of resolving of trooping is possible, comprises equalization, curve and other technology.In all cases, troop the target of resolving be multiple set-points are resolved to reflection user view (as from existing control-time table and the judgement of instant control inputs) the most simply may set-point set.
Figure 18 A-Figure 18 B shows the impact of the perspective timetable variation of being inputted by user during monitoring period.In Figure 18 A-Figure 18 B and subsequent drawings, represent that by the perpendicular line 1802 finishing with the little filling disk 1804 of indicating specified P value the timetable of being inputted by user changes.Will carry out the time of set-point in plan and place set-point about transverse axis.Short perpendicular line segmentation 1806 represents to make by user or remote entity the time point that timetable changes, and horizontal line segmentation 1808 makes be connected with the execution time of the set-point being represented by perpendicular line segmentation 1806 and 1802 respectively input time.Shown in Figure 18 A in the situation that, user the morning 7:001810 change existing control-time table so that it comprises the set-point 1802 at 11:00 in morning place.Shown in Figure 18 A in the situation that, if if timetable variation is prospective and intelligent controller can be according to the one or more entities of control-time table control that change in same monitoring period, intelligent controller only changes into by control-time table changing with reflecting time table of indicating in Figure 18 B so.Therefore,, in the automatic control-time table learning method of one, do not record perspective timetable and change.Changing on the contrary existing control-time table changes with the desired timetable of reflection user or remote entity.
Figure 19 A-Figure 19 B shows the impact of the retrospective timetable variation of being inputted by user during monitoring period.Shown in Figure 19 A in the situation that, three variations are input to existing control-time table by user in the afternoon 6:001902, comprises and delete existing set-point 1904 and add two new set-points 1906 and 1908.All these timetables change impact are only controlled by the following monitoring period of revised control-time table, because the time that the time when inputting these timetables and changing is later than plan while there is the variation of P value.Timetable for these types changes, intelligent controller records instant control inputs table mode writing time to be similar to changes, and comprises the indication of the following fact: such set-point represents to revise interface by user by timetable rather than control inputs is made immediately timetable changes.
Figure 19 B shows the new interim timetable of the timetable variation being associated with shown in Figure 19 A.In general, timetable variation gives relatively large respect by the automatic control-time table learning method of current description.Make timetable and change not only consuming time but also trouble because user changes interface by timetable, so hypothesis timetable change very the earth reflection user's hope and intention.As a result, shown in Figure 19 B, the interpolation of the deletion of existing set-point 1904 and two new set- points 1906 and 1908 is input in existing control-time table to produce new interim timetable 1910.The timetable that edge 1912 represents corresponding to the set-point 1906 by Figure 19 A changes, and the timetable that edge 1914 represents corresponding to the set-point 1908 by Figure 19 A changes.In a word, change or retrospective timetable changes for the perspective timetable of making during monitoring period, the timetable that timetable is made in changing during being associated with existing control-time table and the instant control inputs recording and monitoring period changes between both preparatory stage based on study of new interim timetable and is given great respect.
Figure 20 A-Figure 20 C shows after completing monitoring period and is trooping and parsing is covered recorded data on existing control-time table before trooping.Shown in Figure 20 A, user during monitoring period, inputs 6 instant control inputs 2004-2009 and two retrospective timetables change 2010 and 2012, its covering or be superimposed upon on existing control-time table 2002.Shown in Figure 20 B, troop and produce 4 2014-2017 that troop.Figure 20 C shows by the parsing new interim timetable obtaining of trooping.Have that three existing control-time table set-points and two are instant to be controlled trooping of set-points and 2014 be resolved into new interim timetable set-point 2020 and 2022.Comprise two instant 2015 in 2(Figure 20 B that troop that control set-points and two retrospective timetable set-points) be resolved into set-point 2024 and 2026.2016 in 3(Figure 20 B troops) be resolved into existing control-time table set-point 2028, and comprise two instant 2017 in 4(Figure 20 B that troop that control set-points and existing control-time table set-point) be resolved into set-point 2030.In the time preparing follow-up time table propagation steps, stem from instant control set-point or stem from existing control-time table set-point or indication that retrospective timetable changes set-point carrys out newly each in timetable set-point temporarily of mark with set-point parameter value.Two kinds next are regarded as identical, and in Figure 20 C with the set-point of kind described in character " s " mark, the set-point with the temperature that stems from instant control set-point 2020 and 2022 is marked as to " i " simultaneously.As discussed further below, only the set-point that is labeled as " i " is propagated into the extra correlator timetable of higher level control-time table.
In some embodiments, can relate to the set-point that stems from instant control set-point in the newly interim timetable of expansion by the additional step after the parsing of trooping and troop and before new interim timetable is propagated.Figure 21 A-Figure 21 B shows set-point extended operation.Figure 21 A shows new interim timetable, and (as above discussed with reference to figure 20C) set-point is labeled as " s " or " i " to indicate the set-point classification that derives set-point.In this new interim timetable 2102, two set-points 2104 that are labeled as " i " are less than threshold time interlude interval 2108 with 2106 separation lengths and separate object to reach.Extended operation detects the multipair set-point that is labeled as " i ", it separates in time and is less than threshold time interval and a described right rear set-point is moved forward in time, makes described set-point to be separated to the predetermined fixed length time interval 2110 in Figure 21 B at least.In more complicated a little extended operation, move than threshold time and more approach follow-up set-point in a described right rear set-point, a rear set-point can move to the time point of the centre between described right the first set-point and follow-up set-point.Being intended that of extended operation guarantees fully to separate between set-point with simplification timetable and is created in attainable control-time table under the intelligent controller control of system.
It is, after monitoring period, the new interim sub-timetable creating as discussion is above propagated into the correlator timetable in higher level control-time table that the next one of being carried out by the automatic control-time table learning method of current discussion operates.In Figure 22 A-Figure 22 B, timetable propagation is shown.Figure 22 A shows the higher level control-time table 2202 that time span is one week and the sub-timetable every day of comprising (such as sub-timetable 2204 on Saturday).In Figure 22 A, by monitoring period, the sub-timetable on new interim Monday after having finished is replaced sub-timetable 2206 on Monday recently, in Figure 22 A by with the cross-hauling indication of the cross-hauling relative tilt of other the sub-timetable of several days corresponding to described week.Shown in Figure 22 B, for the timetable communications of the automatic control-time table learning method of current discussion relate to by new interim Monday sub-timetable 2206 propagate into other correlator timetable 2208-2211 of higher level control-time table 2202.In this case, working day, sub-timetable was regarded as phase simple crosscorrelation (the same also phase of sub-timetable at weekend simple crosscorrelation), but weekend sub-timetable be not regarded as to working day sub-timetable relevant.Sub-timetable is propagated the set-point relating to being labeled as " i " in new interim timetable 2206 and is covered relevant existing control-time table (in this case, sub-timetable 2208-2211) upper, and then resolve the existing control-time table that set-point covers and think that correlator timetable produces new interim sub-timetable.In Figure 22 B, be to be indicated by bidirectional crossed hacures by covering on correlator timetable 2208-2211 from the set-point that is labeled as " i " of new interim sub-timetable 2206.After resolving these covering set-points and existing sub-timetable, then whole higher level control-time table 2202 is considered to the current existing control-time table of intelligent controller.In other words, after resolving, new interim sub-timetable is upgraded to existing sub-timetable.In some cases, sub-timetable propagation rule can temporal evolution.As an example, can propagate all days of timetable weekly at first, but then can more optionally sub-working day timetable be propagated into working day and date at weekend timetable is propagated into all doomsdays.The propagation of sub-timetable can adopt other such rule.
As discussed, can there are the control-time table and multiple layerings of sub-timetable and the multiple set of level relevant control timetable that are maintained by intelligent controller above.In these cases, timetable is propagated and can be related to the relatively more complicated propagation rule that the interim sub-timetable newly creating should be propagated into which sub-timetable for determining.Although forward-propagating has in time been shown in Figure 22 B, also can be with the propagation of the forward with respect to the time or the new interim timetable of reverse implementation or new interim sub-timetable.In general, new interim timetable is propagated and is by rule or lists and be regarded as the described control-time table relevant to each control-time table and/or sub-timetable and the form of sub-timetable is controlled.
Figure 23 A-Figure 23 C uses the relation of P value and t control-time table to draw and illustrates the interim timetable propagation that makes new advances.Figure 23 A shows the existing control-time table 2302 that the set-point that is labeled as " i " in new interim timetable is propagated into.Figure 23 B shows to be had " i " mark and covers the propagation set-point on the control-time table shown in Figure 23 A.Two set-points 2304 and 2306 cover on existing control-time table 2302.Existing control-time table comprises 4 existing set-point 2308-2311.Second 2306 that propagates in set-point is reduced to parameter value the level 2312 of the corresponding parameter value level 2314 that is greater than existing control-time table 2302, and therefore overrides existing control-time table until existing set-point 2310.Under this simple scenario, do not make further adjustment, and propagation set-point is incorporated to existing control-time table to produce the new interim timetable 2316 shown in Figure 23 C.In the time that set-point has propagated into all relevant control timetables or sub-timetable and generated new interim timetable and sub-timetable for set-point, propagation steps termination and all new interim timetables are regarded as the new existing higher level control-time table of intelligent controller together with sub-timetable.
After correlator timetable or control-time table are propagated and covered in the set-point that is labeled as " i " to new interim timetable (shown in Figure 23 B), can apply multiple rule in covering set-point and existing control-time table to simplify and can realize the new interim timetable generating by propagating set-point and existing control-time table.Figure 24 A-Figure 24 I shows for simplifying and is coated with the existing control-time table of propagating set-point as generating the new various exemplary rule of the part of the process of timetable temporarily.Each in Figure 24 A-Figure 24 I comprises that two P values and t's is related to drafting figure, first draws to illustrate and propagates set-point and cover existing control-time table, and second draws to illustrate to resolve and propagate set-point to generate the newly part of timetable temporarily of propagating set-point acquisition by parsings.
First left-hand side P value in Figure 24 A and the relation of t drafting Figure 24 02 show propagation set-point 2404 and cover on existing control-time table 2405.Figure 24 A also shows for describing the term for resolving many exemplary rules of propagating set-point and existing control-time table.In Figure 24 A, the first existing set-point (pe
12406) lead in time propagation set-point 2404 and reach time span a2407, and the second existing set-point (pe of existing control-time table
22408) fall behind in time propagation set-point 2404 and reach time span b2409.The first existing control-time table set-point 2406 and the P value difference of propagating between set-point 2404 are called " Δ P " 2410.The relation of right-hand side P value shown in Figure 24 A and t is drawn Figure 24 12 and is shown the first propagation set-point resolution rules.Shown in this figure, in the time that Δ P is less than threshold value Δ P and b and is less than threshold value Δ t, delete and propagate set-point.Therefore, can remove and propagate set-point by rule 1 parsing propagation set-point and existing control-time table, shown in the right-hand side of Figure 24 A.
Figure 24 B-Figure 24 I illustrates that to be similar to the mode of the propagation of first in Figure 24 A set-point resolution rules shows the additional examples of propagating set-point resolution rules.Figure 24 B shows following rule: in the time that b is less than threshold value Δ t and there is no the rule of first shown in application drawing 24A, newly propagates set-point 2414 and move forward in time and existing set-point pe
1be worth Δ t apart
22416 and delete existing set-point pe
2.
Figure 24 C shows and is not all suitable for the three sigma rule of applying while propagating set-point when two rules above.If a is less than threshold value Δ t, propagates so set-point and move backward in time and pe
2at a distance of preset value delta t
3and delete existing set-point pe
1.
Figure 24 D shows applicable fourth line in the time that three rules all not can be applicable to propagate set-point above.In this case, the P value of propagation set-point becomes existing set-point pe
1p value and delete propagate set-point.
In the time that four rules above of above describing with reference to figure 24A-Figure 24 D are all inapplicable, can attempt additional rules and propagate set-point and existing control-time table to resolve.Figure 24 E shows the 5th rule.In the time that b is less than threshold value Δ t and Δ P and is less than threshold value Δ p, shown in Figure 24 E, delete and propagate set-point 2424.In other words, the propagation set-point that approaches very much existing control-time table set-point is not incorporated in new interim control-time table.During propagating set-point parsing, also can rethink existing set-point.For example,, shown in Figure 24 F, when occurring in the first existing set-point pe
1the second existing set-point pe afterwards
2while causing the changes delta P of parameter value to be less than threshold value Δ P, can remove the second existing set-point pe
2.Due to previously giving the respect that timetable changes after monitoring period, can produce the existing set-point approaching like this.Similarly, shown in Figure 24 G, when propagating set-point existing set-point after and when propagating the changes delta P of parameter value that set-point produces and be less than threshold value Δ P value, deletion propagation set-point.Shown in Figure 24 H, separate two existing set-points that are less than threshold value Δ t value and can be resolved into and first consistent single set-point in described two existing set-points.Finally, can delete in a similar manner the propagation set-point that approaches very much in time existing set-point.
In some embodiments, the set-point variation of user's input produces obvious difference between changing with the set-point automatically generating.The variation of previous set-point is called " being fixedly installed a little " and is not override by study.In many cases, user wishes should not change its manually set-point of input.The self-adjusting set-point that additional rules, trial method and consideration can be used to distinguish actively and steady state (SS) is learnt each level during both changes.Also it should be noted that during the compare operation for pattern match and the calculating of other automatic learning and determining, can treat differently with the set-point that two parameter values of indication parameter value scope are associated.For example, being regarded as in equivalence or identical two parameters, scope set-point changes may need to mate another scope set-point and change.
The illustrative embodiments of the intelligent controller that is associated with above-mentioned automatic control-time table learning method then, is provided.Figure 25 A-Figure 25 M shows the illustrative embodiments of the intelligent controller that is associated with above-mentioned automatic control-time table learning method.It should be noted that at the beginning following embodiment just can be by one in the many different possible embodiment of any many different designs of change and embodiment parameter (comprising module tissue, control structure, data structure, programming language, nextport hardware component NextPort, firmware and other such design and implementation mode parameter) acquisition.Many dissimilar control-time tables can be used by the dissimilar intelligent controller that is applied to different control fields.Being incorporated into automatic control-time table learning method in intelligent controller logic can depend on the type of the control-time table of specifying intelligent controller operation and quantity and significantly change.The time period that various dissimilar control-time tables are crossed over and the time granularity of control-time table can depend on design specific controller control task and extensively change.
Figure 25 A shows highest level intelligent controller steering logic.This high-level steering logic comprises the event disposal circulation of wherein being disposed various types of control dependent events by intelligent controller.In Figure 25 A, dispose the control dependent event of four kinds of particular types, but in general event is disposed circulation and can dispose the control dependent event of many additional type at the lower level place occurring in intelligent controller logic.Example comprises communication event, and wherein intelligent controller receives data or transfers data to remote entity, such as long-distance intelligent household device and cloud computing server.The control dependent event of other type comprise with according to the observation to parameter and the system of control-time table activate and stop using relevant control dependent event, can by drop on for detection of control-time table specified scope beyond various types of alarms of triggering of sensing data and the unusual or rare events of timer and the special disposal of needs.Figure 25 A shows the disposal of four exemplary control dependent events, and does not attempt describing all various dissimilar control dependent event that can be disposed by intelligent controller.
In step 2502, intelligent controller is waited for the next dependent event of controlling is occurred.In the time occurring to control dependent event, control flow to step 2504, and intelligent controller determines whether to input instant control inputs by user or remote entity by instant control inputs interface.In the time having inputted instant control inputs by user or other remote entity as determined in step 2504, intelligent controller is general by changing the storage inside specified scope of parameter value and activating if desired one or more controlled entities and carry out instant control inputs in step 2505, and then in step 2506, instant control inputs is recorded in storer.When needs add extra set-point or show At All Other Times feature (as determined in step 2507) when stopping instant control inputs, in step 2508 by extra set-point or show At All Other Times feature and add control-time table to.With reference to figure 15A-Figure 15 G, the example of the set-point of these interpolations is discussed above.Be indication current time while being the timer event of timetable set-point or list-directed current time of time (as determined step 2509) when trigger the control dependent event exiting from step 2502, intelligent controller is carried out time schedule controller set-point in step 2510.When the timetable control of carrying out is (as determined in step 2511) while adding the temporary transient timetable control that is used for stopping instant control inputs in step 2508, in step 2512, delete temporary transient timetable control in step 2510.It is (as determined step 2513) while changing via control-time table the variation that interface makes control-time table by user or remote entity when trigger the control dependent event exiting from step 2502, then when timetable changes (as determined in step 1514) while being perspective, in step 2515, by intelligent controller, existing control-time table is made to timetable and change, as above discussed with reference to figure 18A-Figure 18 B.Otherwise it is retrospective that timetable changes, and be recorded in storer with subsequently for change new interim timetable in the time stopping current monitoring period by intelligent controller in step 2516.
In the time that the control dependent event exiting from 2502 triggerings is the timer event that finishes to be associated with current monitoring period (as determined step 2517), in step 2518, call monitoring period routine to process instant control inputs and the timetable variation of being recorded above as discussing with reference to figure 15A-Figure 24 F.Control dependent event (it is generally enqueued onto event queue) amount after exiting from step 2502 time (as determined in step 2519), controlling flows turns back to step 2504 to dispose next queue events.Otherwise controlling flows turns back to step 2502, wherein intelligent controller is waited for the next dependent event of controlling.
Figure 25 B provides the control flow chart of the routine " monitoring period " of calling in the step 2518 in Figure 25 A.In step 2522, the state variable of the indication of the current mode of learning of intelligent controller access storage.In the time that described current mode of learning is active learning pattern, (as determined in step 2523) calls routine " proactive monitoring cycle " in step 2524.Otherwise, in step 2525, call routine " steady state (SS) monitoring period ".Although this control flow chart is simple, it clearly show that above the feature of the automatic control time table learning of discussing with reference to figure 11D-Figure 11 E and Figure 12.Automatically control time table learning bifurcated is the initial active learning cycle, is follow-up steady state (SS) learning cycle afterwards.
Figure 25 C provides the control flow chart of the routine " proactive monitoring cycle " of calling in the step 2524 in Figure 25 B.In the time that finishing, calls each monitoring period this routine.In example discussed above, when monitoring period ends at each control time every day end of list (EOL) (stopping immediately after 12:00 at noon).But in substituting embodiment, monitoring period can occur at each other different time interval and even can depend on other characteristic and parameter and generation changeably.Monitoring period is generally the minimum particle size time period corresponding to control-time table or sub-timetable, as above discussed.
In step 2527, as above discussed with reference to figure 16B and Figure 20 A, intelligent controller combines instant control inputs and the existing control-time table of all records.In step 2528, call that routine " troops " that the instant control inputs being recorded and timetable are changed and existing control-time table set-point is divided into and troops, as above with reference to figure 16C-Figure 16 D and Figure 20 B discussion.In step 2529, intelligent controller calls routine " simplification is trooped " to resolve each set-point in each trooping, as discussed with reference to figure 16A-Figure 20 C above.In step 2530, intelligent controller calls routine and " generates new timetable " to generate new interim timetable after the parsing of trooping, as above discussed with reference to figure 20C and Figure 21 A-Figure 21 B.In step 2531, intelligent controller calls the routine of discussing with reference to figure 22A-Figure 24 I above and " propagates new timetable " with correlator timetable and the control-time table to the control-time table of intelligent controller by the feature propagation of the interim timetable generating in step 2530.In step 2532, intelligent controller determines whether the current monitoring period completing is the last monitoring period in active learning pattern.In the time that the described current monitoring period completing is the last monitoring period in proactive monitoring mode of learning (as determined in step 2532), in step 2533 intelligent controller to arrange and control each state variable of current mode of learning be to operate under steady state (SS) mode of learning with indicating intelligent controller now, and in step 2534 each learning parameter be set to can with the parameter value of the Phase I compatibility of steady state (SS) study.
Automatically in the different embodiments of control time table learning, can use many different learning parameters.In the embodiment of current discussion, before learning parameter can be included in and stop, carry out the time quantum of instant control inputs, resolve and propagate set-point for trooping with respect to each threshold value Δ t of the parsing of existing control-time table and the amplitude of threshold value Δ P value by intelligent controller.Finally, in step 2535, delete instant control inputs and the timetable variation of recording and creating cluster information and other temporary transient information of during new interim timetable and the interim timetable of propagation, deriving and store, and reinitializing study logic to start follow-up monitoring period.
The control flow chart that Figure 25 D provides the routine of calling in the step 2528 of Figure 25 C " to troop ".In step 2537, by local variable Δ t
intbe arranged to mode of learning and learning phase correlation.Then,, in the while of step 2538-2542 circulation, repeat to call routine " time interval troops " and troop until meet one or more criterions of trooping (as determined in step 2540) to generate in existing control-time table.Before meeting the criterion of trooping, each next time the calling in the routine in step 2539 " time interval troops " in step 2542 increases progressively Δ t before
intvalue, troop and make it meet the criterion of trooping to change the next one.Variable Δ t
intcorresponding to causing set-point to be classified as to belong to minimum time length (as above discussed with reference to figure 16C) that two differences troop or two time interval (time period 1610) between trooping between set-point.Reduce Δ t
intgenerally can produce additionally and troop.
Intelligent controller can use the various dissimilar criterions of trooping.In general, can wish to generate sufficient amount troop produce sufficient control-time table and simplify, but too much trooping can cause extra control-time table complexity.Therefore, the criterion of trooping is designed to choose and is enough to produce the Δ t trooping of desired level that causes the control-time table of desired level to simplify
int.The while continuation that circulates, simultaneously Δ t
intvalue remain within the scope of acceptable value.When trooping, criterion can not be repeated to call and while meeting, in step 2543, can be adopted one or more substituting clustered approach to generate when needed trooping of simplifying for control-time table by the routine " time interval troops " in the while circulation to step 2538-2542.Alternative method can relate to the minimum and maximum parameter value in this locality based on indicating in control-time table or select to troop as cluster boundaries without the set-point time interval by multiple the longest in the set-point of selecting to generate in step 2537 in the time of all failures.
Figure 25 E provides the control flow chart of the routine " time interval troops " of calling in the step 2539 of Figure 25 D.In step 2545, intelligent controller determines that whether set-point is consistent with the start time of the control-time table corresponding to monitoring period.In the time that set-point is really consistent with start time of control-time table, (as determined in step 2545) is arranged to local variable " startCluster " start time of control-time table and local variable " numCluster " is arranged to 1 in step 2546.Otherwise, in step 2547, local variable " numCluster " is arranged to 0.In step 2548, local variable " lastSP " is arranged to the start time of control-time table, and in step 2548, local variable " curT " is arranged to " lastSP " and adds time increment Δ t
inc.Local variable " curt " is the indication of the current point in time in considered control-time table, local variable " numCluster " is the indication of the quantity of the set-point during the created next one is trooped, local variable " startCluster " is the indication of the time point of the first set-point in trooping, and local variable " lastSP " is the indication of the time of the set-point finally detecting in control-time table.Then, in the while circulation of step 2549-2559, corresponding to the control-time table of monitoring period from starting to traverse end, to generate by control-time table the sequence of trooping.In step 2550, the length in the time interval between the set-point that local variable Δ t is arranged to finally detect and the current point in time of considering.In the time there is the set-point consistent with current point in time (as definite in step 2551), in step 2552, call routine " next SP " to consider and to process set-point.Otherwise, when Δ t is greater than Δ t
inttime (as determined in step 2553), process troop (as determined in step 2554), in step 2555, close and storage cluster, and reinitialize local variable " numCluster " and troop to start the processing next one.Local variable in step 2556 " curt " increases progressively, and time (as determined in step 2557) while circulation in the time that curT is less than or equal to control time end of list (EOL) continues iteration.In the time that while circulation finishes and in the time that establishment is trooped, (as determined in step 2558), troops described in closing in step 2559 and storing.
Figure 25 F provides the control flow chart of the routine " next SP " of calling in the step 2552 of Figure 25 E.In step 2560, intelligent controller determines in the time that routine is called whether create and troop.In the time that establishment is trooped and as Δ t, be less than Δ t
inttime (as in step 2561 determine), in step 2562, Set For Current point is added to and is trooped.Otherwise, in step 2563, close and store trooping of current consideration.In the time that establishment is not trooped, in step 2564, the set-point of current detection becomes the first set-point in newly trooping.
Figure 25 G provide the routine called in the step 2529 of Figure 25 C " simplification troop " control flow chart.This routine is simple for circulation, and it comprises step 2566-2568, wherein as above with reference to figure 16A-Figure 21 D discuss simplify as simplification by the routine of calling in the step 2528 of Figure 25 C definite each trooping of " trooping ".In step 2567 by calling to simplify and troop routine " simplification ".
Figure 25 H is the control flow chart of the routine " simplification " called in the step 2567 of Figure 25 G.In step 2570, intelligent controller determines whether trooping of current consideration comprises that table changes set-point any time.In the time that trooping of described current consideration comprises that timetable changes set-point, in step 2572, remove any instant control set-point.Only include single timetable variation set-point during when trooping (as determined in step 2573), in step 2574, retain described single timetable and change set-point to represent whole trooping.Otherwise, multiple timetables are changed to resolving to zero, one or two set-point and troop representing in step 2575, as discussed with reference to figure 17A-Figure 17 E above.Then in step 2576, described zero, one or two set-point are input in existing control-time table.Do not comprise when any time table changes set-point (as determined in step 2570) when trooping and in the time can replacing the set-point in trooping by single set-point (as definite in step 2577), as above discussed with reference to figure 17A and Figure 17 C, in step 2578, replace the set-point of trooping with single set-point, as discussed with reference to figure 17A and Figure 17 C above.Note, as above discussed with reference to figure 20A-Figure 20 C, set-point is associated to indicate it to stem from timetable set-point or stems from instant control set-point with mark " s " and " i ".Similarly, in the time can replacing the set-point in trooping by two set-points (as determined in step 2579), in step 2580, replace and troop by two set-points with suitable mark, as above discussed with reference to figure 17D-Figure 17 E.Otherwise, there is the situation with reference to figure 717B description, in step 2581, delete in said case all residues set-point from trooping.
The control flow chart that Figure 25 I provides the routine of calling in the step 2530 of Figure 25 C " to generate new timetable ".In the time that new interim timetable comprises two or more instant controls set-point, (as determined in step 2583) calls routine " expansion " in step 2584.This routine extending marking is the set-point of " i ", as above discussed about Figure 21 A-Figure 21 B.Then in step 2585 using control-time table storage the new current control-time table within this time period, and in step 2586 for follow-up propagation steps retains the indication that set-point stems from instant control set-point or stems from timetable set-point.
Figure 25 J provides the control flow chart of the routine " expansion " of calling in the step 2584 in Figure 25 I.In step 2587, local variable " first " is arranged to the instant set-point of controlling of first in interim timetable.In step 2588, variable " second " is arranged to the instant set-point of controlling of second in interim timetable.Then in the while of step 2589-2599 circulation, travel through interim timetable and be less than together threshold time length Δ t to detect to abut against in time
1multipair instant control set-point.In step 2592-2596, the second set-point is mobile Fixed Time Interval Δ t in time
sor move to the mid point between previous set-point and next set-point, extend so that immediately control set-point.
The control flow chart that Figure 25 K provides the routine of calling in the step 2531 of Figure 25 C " to propagate new timetable ".The interim timetable creating in the step 2530 in Figure 25 C is propagated into correlator timetable by this routine, as above discussed with reference to figure 22A-Figure 22 B.In step 2599a, extra sub-timetable or timetable that the interim timetable generating in intelligent controller determining step 2530 should propagate into.Then, in for of step 2599b-2599e circulation, the institute retaining in step 2586 in Figure 25 I is retained to the instant set-point of controlling and propagate into next relevant control timetable, and resolve described set-point together with the existing control-time table set-point in next control-time table by calling routine " parsing is shown extra time " in step 2599d.
The control flow chart that Figure 25 L provides the routine of calling in the step 2599d of Figure 25 K " to resolve table extra time ".In step 2599f, the storage set of intelligent controller access time table resolution rules (such as above with reference to those of figure 24A-Figure 24 I discussion), and local variable j is arranged to the quantity of the timetable resolution rules that will apply.In addition, in the nested for circulation of step 2599g-2599n, the each instant control set-point in the set-point set that described rule application generates in the step 2599c of Figure 25 K.Described rule is applied to each instant control set-point in order until delete set-point (as determined in step 2599j) or until regular with simplification timetable (in step 2599k) as described in successful Application.Once resolve all propagation set-point in the nested for circulation of step 2599g-2599n, just the new interim timetable of table conduct storage time in step 2599o.
Figure 25 M provides the control flow chart of the routine " steady state (SS) monitoring " of calling in the step 2525 of Figure 25 B.This routine is similar to the routine " proactive monitoring cycle " of calling shown in Figure 25 C and in the step 2524 of Figure 25 B.Many steps are in fact approximate identical and in order will no longer to describe for simplicity.But step 2599q is non-existent additional step in routine " proactive monitoring cycle ".In this step, cover instant control set-point on existing control-time table set-point and timetable change database that set-point is used for searching for nearest historical control-time table with determine set-point set whether more approaching with intelligent controller for or another control-time table of transferring to relevant.In the time being shifted by this search indication control-time table (determining in as step 2599h), in step 2599I, carry out and shift, and before carrying out the new interim timetable of generation, make stored instant control and timetable change the sub-time table pack of the object time table of transferring to intelligent controller in step 2599t.The historical search routine of calling in step 2599q changes set-point with respect to the timetable of the one or more control-time tables corresponding to monitoring period or sub-time table record during also can screening recorded instant control set-point and monitoring period.Compared with active learning approach for active learning pattern, this is the part of more conservative learning track, and it is attempted the input based on recording during monitoring period and only conservatively changes control-time table.Therefore, although the program of carrying out when monitoring period finishes for active learning pattern and steady state (SS) mode of learning is similar, but between the steady state (SS) learning period, be to change with more conservative mode implementation timetable, and timetable change each successive stages of learning along with steady state (SS) and become more and more conservative.Owing to having a large amount of nearest and historical control-time table information in hand, intelligent controller can be made the instant control inputs that occurs in during monitoring period and timetable and changes whether to reflect that user wishes to change for a long time control-time table or the reflection temporary transient control relevant with situation with temporary transient local event changes on the contrary intelligent and predict more and more accurately.
As mentioned, intelligent controller can adopt the multiple different control-time tables applicable to different time sections.For example, the in the situation that of house HVAC thermostat controller, intelligent controller can use the various different control-time tables applicable to the Various Seasonal in a year; Winter, summer, spring and fall may use different control-time tables.The intelligent controller of other type can crossed over minute and hour to month, year and the different control cycles use of each of even larger time period various control timetables.
Figure 26 shows the control-time table based on week different corresponding to three of three kinds of different control models of the operation of intelligent controller.Each in three control-time table 2602-2604 controls intelligent controller operation until operate controls metastasis to another the different control-time table based on week in control-time table in the step 2599s of Figure 25 M in certain time period.Figure 27 shows according to the state transition graph of the intelligent controller of 7 different control time table handlings.The operator scheme that is controlled by specific control-time table is illustrated as disk (such as disk 2702), and conversion between operator scheme is illustrated as curved arrow, such as curved arrow 2704.In situation shown in Figure 27, state transition graph has been expressed the decisive higher level control-time table for intelligent controller that comprises 7 kinds of different operation modes, and each operator scheme is controlled by specific control-time table.Each in these specific control-time tables can be made up of the secondary sub-timetable of additional layer again.The related Auto-learning Method of the application can hold the automatic learning of multiple control-time tables and sub-timetable, no matter and its hierarchical organization why.Monitoring period is generally contained the sub-timetable of the shortest time minimum particle size in level, and conversion between sub-timetable and higher level control-time table be by higher level control-time table (the higher level control-time table that all state transition graphs are as shown in Figure 27 expressed), by the order sequence (such as sub-timetable every day in the control-time table weekly of discussing with reference to Figure 13) of the sub-timetable in larger control-time table or according to many other in control time table organization and timetable transfer criterion control.
Figure 28 A-Figure 28 C shows the control-time table of a type that can be carried out by intelligent controller and changes.Figure 28 A shows the existing control-time table of intelligent controller current operation institute basis.Figure 28 B shows the instant control inputs recording in the monitoring period completing recently and is added on the control-time table shown in Figure 28 A.These instant control inputs 2802-2805 seem to represent obviously to depart from existing control-time table 2800.In the step 2599q of Figure 25 M, intelligent controller can be considered various substituting control-time table or the historical control-time table of the alternative control-time table that can be the monitoring period that completes recently, comprises the control-time table 2810 shown in Figure 28 C.Result is, resolves instant control inputs and existing control-time table and will produce the control-time table of the control-time table 2810 extremely approaching shown in Figure 28 C.Then this provide strong indication to intelligent controller: the instant control inputs recording may show to transfer control to control-time table 2810 rather than revise existing control-time table and continue to use the control-time table of revising.Although this timetable that is in the step 2599s that can occur in Figure 25 M one type changes conversion, At All Other Times table change shift can be controlled by current date, what day understanding with may to together with specify the understanding of each environmental parameter of the use that is used for controlling multiple control-time tables that Based Intelligent Control operates.
Figure 29-Figure 30 shows the polytype consideration that can be made by intelligent controller during steady state (SS) learning phase.In Figure 29, show the similar drafting figure of the drafting figure of new interim timetable 2902 and or historical control-time table or interim timetable 2904-2918 nearest applicable to 15 of same time period.New interim timetable 2902 discloses immediately with visual comparison nearest and historical interim timetable 2904-2918 the interim timetable that makes new advances and represents that sizable basic change occurs control system.Between the steady state (SS) learning period, existing control-time table cannot be propagated or be used for replacing to these basic changes, but on the contrary only recently and institute's cumulative record of historical interim timetable just can be recorded and use for propagating or replacement object when considering that interim timetable provides better supports as the indication of following user view.For example, shown in Figure 30, if the record of relatively newer interim timetable and nearest and/or historical control-time table 3002-3016, intelligent controller very likely uses new interim timetable 2902 for replacing or propagate object so.

Then, provide the embodiment for the above-mentioned automatic control-time table learning method of above-mentioned intelligent constant-temperature device.Figure 40 A-Figure 40 D shows the step for realizing initial learn.Figure 41 A-Figure 41 M shows the process of the concept map of thermostat timetable.For exemplary one day monitoring period during the initial active learning cycle, along with the selected step according to Figure 40 A-Figure 40 D is carried out the process of processing the concept map that thermostat timetable occurs.For an embodiment, the step of Figure 40 A-Figure 40 D is to carry out by having or do not have the head unit microprocessor of the internuncial thermostat 3302 in internet.In other embodiments, one or more can the implementation by Cloud Server (thermostat 3302 has the network connectivity to it) in the step of Figure 40 A-Figure 40 D.Although the example existing in Figure 41 A-Figure 41 M is for heat time table case, described method is equally applicable to table learning and can be easily extended to the HVAC timetable that comprises the mixing of heating set-point, cooling settings point and/or scope set-point cool time.Although the example of Figure 40 A-Figure 41 M is present under the timetable of setting up the weekly specific background of (representing a special appropriate time basis for the foundation of HVAC timetable and execution), but in other embodiments, can also set up two all HVAC timetables, half cycle HVAC timetable, the timetable of HVAC timetable, bimonthly HVAC timetable, season HVAC timetable and other type monthly.Although just typical house is installed the example that presents and/or discussed Figure 40 A-Figure 41 M, this is the object for clear interpretation.Described method is applicable to the enclosure (enclosure) of various other types, such as retail shop, Business office, industrial environment etc.In the following discussion, be generally expressed as to the same day and the moment on the same day of described action or input the time of specific user action or set-point input, phrase " moment on the same day " is generally used for expressing the particular moment on the same day simultaneously.
Initial learn program representation " active learning " approach, wherein target is automatically to observe and follow the tracks of user behavior based on utmost point brief period to come for one or more user's Rapid Establishments suitable HVAC timetable at least substantially.Once set up initial learn program, then thermostat 3302 is switched to steady state (SS) study, the long-term repetition behavior that it relates to perception and adjusts one or more users.In most cases, conventionally user-friendly interview is set after, in step 4002 in response to the new installation of the thermostat 3302 in house or other controlled environment with start and start initial learn program.Also can call initial learn by other event (reset and maybe may wish that thermostat 3302 repeats the user's in active learning stage clearly request such as dispatching from the factory of intelligent constant-temperature device 3302).
In step 4004, access acquiescence start-up schedule.For an embodiment, start-up schedule is the single set-point of single set-point temperature of 8 of every mornings coming into force and comprise.This single set-point temperature be by approaching when interview is set finishes maybe in the time calling initial learn (wherein user be asked whether start to learn heat time table or cool time table) user's response of providing and arranging.In the time that user chooses heating, initial single set-point temperature setting is set to 68 °F or certain other suitable heating set-point temperature, and when user chooses when cooling, initial single set-point temperature setting is set to 80 °F or certain other suitable cooling settings point temperature.In other embodiments, acquiescence start-up schedule may be one of multiple pre-solid plate timetable of directly or indirectly being selected by user in the time of initial setting up interview.Figure 41 A shows the example of the acquiescence start-up schedule with the heating set-point that is labeled as " a " to " g ".
In step 4006, start new monitoring period.Having found provides good result in situation that the control-time table that is chosen in intelligent constant-temperature device of one day monitoring period obtains.But, also can use other monitoring period, comprise many days time periods, sub-time period on the same day, other suitable cycle, and alternatively other monitoring period may be variable, random or continuous.For example, in the time of continuous execution, any user set-point changes or the input of timetable set-point can be used as the trigger with next version, iteration or the improvement of generation time table in conjunction with information described in current time list processing (LISP).Are embodiments with the stealing thermostat of rechargeable battery for thermostat 3302 wherein, found cycle of one day in the freshness of timetable correction and maintained appropriate computational load on the head unit microprocessor balance to keep providing suitable between the needs of battery electric power.
In step 4008, in the middle of one day, intelligent constant-temperature device 3302 receives and store instant control and timetable variation is inputted both.Figure 41 B shows multiple instant control that the initial learn (occurring in Tu. in the example of current description) of typical a day makes and timetable changes the expression of user set-point input.Following discuss and accompanying drawing (comprising Figure 41 A-Figure 41 M) in, subscript " N " recognition time table above changes or the input of non real-time (" NRT ") set-point, and subscript " R " identification above instant control or in real time (" RT ") set-point input.The timetable set-point being pre-existing in the numeral of circle.For each NRT set-point, also provide the subscript below of the input time of identifying described NRT set-point.RT set-point is without any need for such subscript, because the horizontal level of described set-point on timetable indicated its entry-into-force time and its input time.Therefore, in the example shown in Figure 41 B, at 7:30 in the morning, user makes the RT set-point input " i " with 76 °F of temperature values, at 7:40 in the morning, user makes another RT set-point input " j " with 72 °F of temperature values, at 9:30 in the morning, user makes another RT set-point input " l " with 72 °F of temperature values, at 11:30 in the morning, user makes another RT set-point input " m " with 76 °F of temperature values, etc.In at 10 o'clock in morning Tu., user is created in by timetable interface the NRT set-point input " n " that noon on Tu., 12:00 came into force, and is created in the NRT set-point input " w " that Tuesday afternoon 9:00 comes into force.Subsequently, at Tuesday afternoon 4:00, user is created in the NRT set-point input " h " that the afternoon of Monday 9:15 comes into force, and is created in the NRT set-point input " k " that the morning on Tu., 9:15 came into force.Finally, 8 o'clock Tuesday afternoons, user was created in the NRT set-point input " s " that Tuesday afternoon 6:00 comes into force.
With reference now to step 4010,, in 24 hours monitoring periods, HVAC system is inputted to control in any RT set-point input that intelligent constant-temperature device comes into force according to any current version control-time table and user makes and any NRT set-point that can apply to cause and effect of having made.Maintaining RT set-point inputs the impact on Set For Current point temperature and is pre-existing in set-point until run into the NRT set-point that can apply to cause and effect or until make the input of follow-up RT set-point until run into the next one.Therefore, with reference to figure 41A-Figure 41 B, in Tuesday morning, afternoon 6:45, the current operation set-point of thermostat becomes 73 °F owing to being pre-existing in set-point " b ", then at 7:30 in the morning, current operation set-point is because RT set-point input " i " becomes 76 °F, then at 7:45 in the morning, current operation set-point is because RT set-point input " j " becomes 72 °F, then at 8:15 in the morning, current operation set-point becomes 65 °F owing to being pre-existing in set-point input " c ", then at 9:30 in the morning, current operation set-point is because RT set-point input " l " becomes 72 °F, then at 11:30 in the morning, current operation set-point is because RT set-point input " m " becomes 76 °F, then 12:00 at noon, current operation set-point is because NRT set-point input " n " becomes 71 °F, then 12:15 in the afternoon, current operation set-point is because RT set-point input " o " becomes 78 °F, etc..At 9:15 in the morning, there is not any variation due to NRT set-point " k " in Set For Current point, because NRT set-point " k " still do not exist.By contrast, NRT set-point input " n " can be applied on cause and effect ground, because it is to be come into force the input at 10 o'clock in the morning of described a day and at its appointment 12:00 at noon entry-into-force time by user.
Select alternate embodiment according to one, practicable step 4010 make RT set-point input only come into force the longest continue 2 hours or other relatively of short duration time interval as operating set-point temperature, operating set-point temperature is returned to any temperature that set-point or any NRT set-point input that can apply to cause and effect are specified that is pre-existing in by current time table.This is selected alternate embodiment to be designed to support user during the initial learn cycle, to make the input of more RT set-point and makes to realize quickly learning program.Alternative as additionally selecting, in step 4004, assign relatively low-energy set-point for example, as the relatively lower temp set-point (such as 62 °F) in () winter to initial time table, this is general produces more low-yield control-time table.Substitute as another, above during several days, return to after being substituted in 2 hours and be pre-existing in set-point, the minimum energy that operating set-point returns in timetable is on the contrary pre-existing in set-point.
With reference now to step 4012,, in the time that monitoring period finishes, the RT of mutual and relative current time list processing (LISP) storage and NRT set-point are with revision, the iteration of rise time table or improve (particular step for it has been shown in Figure 40 B).For example can carry out such processing in 11:50 in afternoon certain time approaching or about midnight of study day.When determining that in step 4014 initial learn is not while still completing, in step 4006-4010, the revision of timetable is for the initial learn of another day, once more revise and program is proceeded until initial learn completes in step 4012.In the time that initial learn completes, in step 4016, start steady state (SS) study, hereinafter with reference Figure 32 A-Figure 33 discusses.
For some embodiments, in step 4014, whether the decision whether completing about initial control time table learning is based on elapsed time and has the user behavior of q.s to record and to process.For an embodiment, only have when just initial learn being considered as through initial learn two days later and 10 independent one hour intervals existing user wherein to input RT or NRT set-point.Any various different criterions can be used to determine whether to exist enough user interactions to infer initial learn.
Figure 40 B shows generally the RT that stores corresponding to the processing of the step 4012 of Figure 40 A and the step of NRT.In step 4030, shown in Figure 41 C, the set-point input with the adjacent entry-into-force time is grouped into and is trooped.In one embodiment, other member's of entry-into-force time and at least one of each member entry-into-force time separates single the trooping of any set formation of the two or more set-points input that is less than 30 minutes.
In step 4032, process set-point input each troop to generate represent whole single new set-point of trooping with regard to entry-into-force time and temperature value.This program relates to simplification timetable, relates to the true intention of catching best user by user's set-point input behavior simultaneously.Although can use the various different approaches that comprise the temperature value of making cluster member and the equalization of entry-into-force time, for steps performed 4032, a kind of in greater detail method of Figure 40 C considers the NRT and the entry-into-force time of RT state relation, the input of each set-point and the input time that each set-point is inputted of the input of each set-point.
With reference now to Figure 40 C(, the step 4032 corresponding to Figure 40 B), in step 4060, in definite trooping, whether there is any NRT set-point input with the input time that is later than the entry-into-force time the earliest in trooping.When the case, then in step 4064, trooped by the entry-into-force time of NRT set-point input and the single representative set-point replacement of temperature value with input at the latest.This approach is respected user and is expended time in the hope of the desirable set-point of concrete input temperature within the described time.In step 4060, in the time not existing such NRT set-point to input, in step 4062, troop by thering is the entry-into-force time of the making cluster member that comes into force the earliest and equaling to have the single representative set-point replacement of the set-point temperature of the set-point temperature of the making cluster member of input time at the latest.This approach is respected user's hope (as expressed with instant control inputs and existing set-point).
Refer again to Figure 40 B, in step 4034, the type of set-point input of the temperature value based on therefrom assigning set-point is marked at the new representative set-point of determining in step 4032 with " RT " or " NRT ".Therefore,, according to the logic of Figure 40 C, if NRT set-point has the input time occurring at the latest for trooping, new set-point will be labeled as to " NRT " so.If RT set-point has the input time occurring at the latest, new set-point will be labeled as to " RT " so.In step 4036-4038, along with new set-point arrives the next stage of processing in step 4040, only carry out any odd number set-point input of not inputting to troop with other set-point.
Known with reference to figure 41C-Figure 41 D, troop for " ij " only with the input of RT set-point, the early entry-into-force time of assigning single representative set-point " ij " to make it have RT set-point input " i " has the temperature value (application of the step 4062 of presentation graphs 40C) of the RT set-point input " j " of input late simultaneously, and in step 4034, gives described new set-point " ij " appointment " RT " mark.Also known, troop for " kl " (the NRT set-point " k " with the entry-into-force time the earliest in trooping described in being later than input time), assign single representative set-point " kl " to make it have entry-into-force time and the temperature value (application of the step 4064 of presentation graphs 40C) of NRT set-point input " k ", and in step 4034, give described new set-point " kl " appointment " NRT " mark.Troop for " mno " (there is NRT set-point " n " but its input time early than the entry-into-force time the earliest in described trooping), the entry-into-force time the earliest of assigning single representative set-point " mno " to make it have RT set-point input " m " has the temperature value (application of the step 4062 of presentation graphs 40C again) of the set-point input " o " of input at the latest simultaneously, and in step 4034, gives described new set-point " mno " appointment " RT " mark.Residue result shown in Figure 41 D (all new set-points that are also considered to this stage wherein) is also followed the method for Figure 40 B-Figure 40 C.
Refer again to Figure 40 B, and then steps performed 4040 and step 4040 is applied to new set-point (shown in Figure 41 D) in groups after step 4034 and 4038.In step 4040, have more mobile to have than other new set-point new entry-into-force time of slow 60 minutes in time than any new set-point of any other new set-point entry-into-force time of slow 31 minutes to 60 minutes.This is relatively new set-point " q " and being illustrated in Figure 41 E, the entry-into-force time of set-point " q " move to afternoon 5:00 make its with the entry-into-force time (4:00 in afternoon) of new set-point " p " at a distance of 60 minutes.In one embodiment, in the time that step 4040 starts, the moment fragment based on timetable is only carried out once this program.In other words, these new set-points separate and do not have any iteration cascading.Therefore, distribute although step 4040 produces the time of the general new set-point entry-into-force time that separates at least one hour, still can retain some new set-points that entry-into-force time separation is less than hour.Find that these small differences can tolerate, and be conventionally better than by the caused ill-effect of cascade operation to realize separation in absolute hour.In addition,, after processing is pre-existing in timetable set-point, successfully complete separation in these hour with algorithm subsequently.In substituting embodiment, can use other disengaging time interval.
Meet the positive object being associated with initial learn with reference to the step 4042(of figure 40B), when then the new set-point of having set up in current study day is now marked as " RT " set-point in described new set-point, copy in other several the skys that can wish a week with similar set-point.Preferably, do not copy the new set-point that is marked as " NRT ", may create the input of similar desirable NRT set-point because create the user of bottom NRT set-point input.For some embodiments of finding to be fully applicable to create weekly timetable, the predetermined set of application copy rule.Which day of a week these copy rules depend on and start first initial learn program.Optimization copy rule, to consider the real time table (structure at weekend is different from working day conventionally for described timetable) of a large amount of desired users, promotes positive initial time table to set up simultaneously.For an embodiment, can application table 1 in the copy rule of statement.
Figure 41 F shows the impact from monitoring period on Tu. the copy to adjacent several days display section on (Monday and Wednesday) by the new set-point that is labeled as RT of Figure 41 E.Therefore, for example, the new set-point " x " that is labeled as RT with the entry-into-force time of 11:00 in afternoon is replicated as the new set-point " x2 " on Monday and all other working days, and has the new set-point " ij " that is labeled as RT of the entry-into-force time of 7:30 in the morning and be replicated as the new set-point " ij2 " on Wednesday and all other working days.According to the rule of form 1, also on all other working days, copy and comprise that all other of " mno ", " p ", " q " and " u " is labeled as the new set-point of RT.New set-point " kl " or " rst " that never mark is not NRT.Do not copy NRT user set-point input " h " (by wishing that its user of coming into force on Monday inputted on Tu.).
With reference now to the step 4044 of Figure 40 B,, new set-point and the new set-point of copying are covered to (shown in Figure 41 G) on the current time table that is pre-existing in set-point, this shows and is pre-existing in set-point and the new set-point with circle not with circle.In many subsequent steps, similarly treat the new set-point that is labeled as RT and be labeled as NRT, and when the case, describe these steps and do not use " RT " and " NRT " mark.In step 4046, carry out new set-point and be pre-existing in mutual screening and/or the time shift of set-point according to the predetermined filtering rule being designed to best or near optimal ground acquisition mode information and preference information are also simplified overall timetable complexity simultaneously.Although can use various different approaches, describe in more detail a kind of method for the target of steps performed 4046 in Figure 40 D.Finally, in step 4048, the result of step 4046 becomes the latest edition of further being revised or be used as the current time table of the start-up schedule in steady state (SS) learning program by another initial learn day.
With reference to statement, for carrying out a kind of Figure 40 D of method of processing of step 4046 of Figure 40 C, in step 4080, identifying the entry-into-force time, to be pre-existing in set-point than first slow below one hour and compare the second any new set-point that is pre-existing in the Zao first kind below hour in set-point.In Figure 41 G, surround the example of so new set-point of the first kind with dotted line.Even in Figure 41 G for task of explanation only show whole for time the part of timetable of a week, still in described timetable, carry out the step of Figure 40 D.In step 4081, when any new set-point of the first kind have than following closely be pre-existing in the Zao entry-into-force time below one hour of set-point time and in the time that it has with being pre-existing in set-point and being no more than the temperature value of 1 °F above apart, delete any set-point of the described first kind.For step 4081 with the object of other step of wherein degree of approach between the temperature value of two set-points or similar degree being evaluated, the version that rounds that is oppositely arranged some temperature value is separately carried out the comparison that point value is set, operate object even if the temperature value of set-point can be maintained to the degree of accuracy of 0.2 °F or 0.1 ° C for other, described in round and be still immediate 1 °F or immediate 0.5 ° of C.In the time that use rounds, for example, in the time that two set-point temperature of 77.6 °F and 79.4 °F are rounded to immediate °F separately first, described set-point temperature is regarded as being separated by 1 °F, and is therefore separated by and is not more than 1 °F.Similarly, in the time that two set-point temperature of 20.8 ° of C and 21.7 ° of C are rounded to immediate 0.5 ° of C separately first, the described set-point temperature 0.5 ° of C that is regarded as being separated by, and be therefore separated by and be not more than 0.5 ° of C.In the time being applied to the exemplary case at Figure 41 G place, in step 4081, new set-point " ij " is dropped in regular scope and as therefore shown in Figure 41 H and is deleted new set-point " ij ".
Delete any new set-point of the first kind in step 4081 after, in step 4082, identify any new set-point of the first kind of entry-into-force time in following closely be pre-existing in set-point 30 minutes.In the time of the such first kind set-point of identification, its in time backward mobile than above be pre-existing in set-point slow one hour, and delete the set-point that is pre-existing in following closely.In the time being applied to the exemplary case at Figure 41 G place, in step 4082, new set-point " ij2 " is dropped in regular scope, and therefore new set-point " ij2 " moves backward in time and is early pre-existing in set-point " f " at a distance of one hour, delete the follow-up set-point " g " that is pre-existing in, shown in Figure 41 H.Subsequently, in step 4084, identify any new set-point of the first kind in above be pre-existing in set-point 30 minutes of entry-into-force time.In the time of the such first kind set-point of identification, set-point move forward in time than following closely be pre-existing in set-point Zao one hour, and deletion above be pre-existing in set-point.In step 4086, for the new set-point of each residue in the scope of step 4082 or 4084 not in the first kind, the set-point temperature change that is pre-existing in set-point is above become to the temperature of new set-point and deletes described new set-point.
In step 4087, identify and delete in following closely be pre-existing in set-point one hour and temperature value and the set-point that is pre-existing in are above more or less the same in the new set-point of any RT of being labeled as of 1 °F.In step 4088, for each new set-point, delete any set-point that is pre-existing in hour of described new set-point.Therefore, for example, Figure 41 I show with new set-point " x2 " be apart less than one hour be pre-existing in set-point " a ", and therefore in Figure 41 J, delete and be pre-existing in set-point " a ".Equally, being pre-existing in set-point " d " is less than one hour apart and therefore in Figure 41 J, deletes and be pre-existing in set-point " d " with new set-point " q ".
In step 4090, the set-point time of coming into force the earliest from timetable starts and moves backward in time the set-point time of coming into force at the latest, deletes described set-point while differing the temperature value that is no more than 1 °F or 0.5 ° C when set-point has with the temperature value of set-point above.As above discussed, in many embodiments, due to automatic time table learning, deletion or adjustment are not fixedly installed a little.For example, Figure 41 K shows separately with set-point above and is no more than the set-point " mno " of 1 °F and " x " apart and therefore in Figure 41 L, deletes set-point " mno " and " x ".Finally, in step 4092, in the time there is any residue that the entry-into-force time is separated by below hour multipair (new or be pre-existing in) set-point, delete the set-point that every centering is come into force later.Then as indication in Figure 41 M, survival set-point is set up to the member as current time table, all described members are marked as " being pre-existing in set-point " successive iterations for the initial learn program of Figure 40 A, or the subsequent applications of learning for steady state (SS) described below in the time that described program completes.Certainly, in substituting embodiment, can change for calling discussed abovely troop, each time interval of parsing, screening and jump operation.
Figure 42 A-Figure 42 B shows the step for steady state (SS) study.Can be applicable to steady state (SS) study for many same concept of initial learn program description and teaching above, comprise the tracking inputted in the input of active user set-point and non real-time user set-point, troop, resolve, copy, cover and finally screen and shift.
Between the study of initial learn and steady state (SS), produce some difference: for steady state (SS) learning program, pay close attention to the historical pattern in the input of set-point deletion, copy delete set-point pattern across optionally increase and other difference of target date.With reference to figure 42A, steady state (SS) learning program starts from step 4202, and described step 4202 can completing (Figure 40 A, step 4016) and optionally can learn corresponding to ask to recover steady state (SS) after suspending study user corresponding to initial learn program.In step 4204, the appropriate version of access current time table.When in the time that initial learn (situation that normally new intelligent constant-temperature device is installed) is called steady state (SS) study afterwards immediately, current time table when control-time table has generally been initial learn.
But, in some embodiments, can in step 4204, access the timetable of previously having set up.During multiple different time tables of previously having been set up within the similar cycle of the previous year by intelligent constant-temperature device 3302 can be stored in thermostat 3302 or alternatively can be stored in and have in the Cloud Server connecting to the network of thermostat 3302.For example, can exist " January " timetable of setting up in January above and its then to store in storer January 31.When latter one on January when 1, steps performed 4204, addressable previously stored " January " timetable.
In some embodiments, intelligent constant-temperature device 3302 can be set up and store applicable to the timetable of any each time period and then in step 4204, access described timetable to be used as next current time table.Similar storage and again call method can be applicable to the historical RT/NRT set-point input database of below further discussing.
In step 4206, start the steady state (SS) study of new one day.In step 4208, in described one day, intelligent constant-temperature device receives and follows the tracks of real-time and non real-time user set-point and inputs both.In step 4210, in described one day, intelligent constant-temperature device all inputs to control HVAC system according to the current version of timetable, any RT set-point input of being made by user and any NRT set-point that can apply to cause and effect of having made.
Select alternate embodiment according to one, practicable step 4210 makes the input of any RT set-point only effective in maximum 4 hours, and after this operating set-point temperature returns to any temperature of being specified set-point by being pre-existing in current time table and/or any temperature of being specified by any NRT set-point input that can apply to cause and effect.Substitute as another, be substituted in 4 hours and return to any set-point that is pre-existing in afterwards, operating set-point returns to relatively low energy value on the contrary, such as the minimum set-point that is pre-existing in timetable.The operator scheme that can arrange according to user starts this low-yield basic operation.
