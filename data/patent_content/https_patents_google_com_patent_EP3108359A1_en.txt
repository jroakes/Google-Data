Definitions
- the landing page of a creative served on a mobile device is not optimized for mobile devices.
- the conversion rate of visitors of the landing page of the creative may be a lot lower than a landing page that is optimized for mobile devices. That being said, even landing pages that are optimized for mobile devices still struggle to convert visitors. This may be because the mobile device user may not be willing to put in the effort to find the information they are looking for and therefore, may leave the landing page without performing additional actions.
- At least one aspect is directed to a method for providing actionable objects on a landing page of a creative.
- the method includes identifying, by a data processing system, a creative for serving on a computing device.
- the creative can be associated with a network address of a landing page.
- the method also includes generating, by the data processing system, an actionable object to be rendered with content of the landing page and providing, by the data processing system, the actionable object to be rendered with the content of the landing page responsive to an action taken on the creative when served on the computing device.
- the data processing system can generate an information resource that includes content of the landing page and the generated actionable object.
- the data processing system can also associate a network address of the information resource to the creative such that responsive to an action taken on the creative, the information resource is rendered.
- the data processing system can render the actionable object on a first frame of the information resource and the content of the landing page on a second frame of the information resource.
- the first frame is rendered over the second frame.
- the first frame of the information resource includes an actionable item, which when selected, removes the first frame from the information resource rendered for display.
- the data processing system can receive, in response to providing the actionable object, an indication of an action taken on the actionable object.
- the data processing system can then increment a conversion count responsive to receiving the indication.
- the actionable object is configured to cause the computing device on which the actionable object is rendered to execute a particular task.
- the particular task includes one of launching a phone application, a location application, or another dedicated application.
- the data processing system can provide a script for insertion in the landing page associated with the content.
- the script can be configured to cause the generated actionable object to be rendered for display with the content of the landing page responsive to an action taken on the creative.
