The web page element having the identified content is created.
Description
- This disclosure is generally related to personalized networked documents.
- The world wide web (or web) is a portion of the Internet that allows a computer system to access electronic documents which are stored on another computer system. The electronic documents may be referred to as electronic pages, web pages or, more simply, pages. A web page may include text, graphics, sounds other types of multimedia information, data fields, and links, called hyperlinks, to files and documents accessible on other web pages. A collection of web pages hosted by an entity may be referred to as a web site. A user of a computer system can access and display web pages from web sites using a graphical user interface (GUI) generated by a browser application executing on the user's computer. A browser application also may be referred to as a web browser or simply, a browser. Web browsers may use a variety of protocols for accessing and communicating with web sites. One example of such a protocol is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
- Web pages may be created by an individual to include content related to the individual. Such a web page may be referred to, for example, as a personalized web page, a personal web page, a personalized web page, a customized web page or a personal home page. A personalized web page may include content about which the individual is interested.
- In one general aspect, a user request to create a web page element associated with the user and an indication of a topic to which content of the web page element is to relate is received. Content to be added to the web page element is automatically identified based on popularity of content related to the topic according to other users who share a demographic characteristic with the user. The web page element having the identified content is created.
- Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, automatically identifying content to be added may include accessing popularity indications of content, where the popularity indications are stored in a computer storage medium and indicate popularity of content related to topics. The accessed popularity indications may be used to identify popular content that is related to the topic of the web page element to be created, where the determination is based on popularity of content according to other users who share a demographic characteristic with the user. Automatically identifying content to be added may include identifying content to be added to the web page element based on the indicated topic, a demographic of the user and accessed popularity indications of content. Automatically identifying content to be added may include automatically identifying, without human intervention, content to be added to the web page element based on popularity of content related to the topic according to other users who share a demographic characteristic with the user.
- Receiving an indication may include receiving an indication of the topic based on a name of a control used to navigate to the created web page element. The demographic characteristic may include one of a country or language. The identified content may include automatically updated content, which may include a RSS feed. The identified content may include a gadget. The popularity of the content may represent content that is the most frequently occurring content.
- A theme for the web page element may be automatically selected based on popularity of a theme according to other users who share the demographic characteristic with the user. A layout style for the web page element may be automatically selected based on popularity of a layout style for a personalized web page element. A recommendation may be automatically provided to the user of new content for the web page element based on popularity of content related to the topic according to other users who share a second demographic characteristic with the user.
- In another general aspect, content to be added to an electronic document created for a particular user and made accessible to the particular user over a network is automatically identified. The content is identified based on popularity of content related to a topic according to other users who share a characteristic with the particular user. The electronic document having the identified content is created. The electronic document is made accessible over the network to the particular user.

FIG. 3 is a flow chart of anexample process 300 for creating a personalized web page. Theprocess 300 may be performed, for example, using auser access device 108 and the personalizedweb page system 102, both as described previously with respect toFIG. 1 . - The
process 300 includes receiving a request from a user identifying a topic for which a personalized web page is to be created (310). This may be performed, for example, by a user using auser access device 108. The user may identify a topic, for example, using the interface 270, as discussed previously with respect toFIG. 2C . The user may enter a topic name by typing one or more words, or the user may select a topic name from a list of presented topic names (e.g., a list of popular topic names may be presented in the interface 270 in a list box). As another example, the user may select a topic from a menu of the most popular topics. A user can indicate that the topic is a “home” topic, indicating that the page to be created is the user's home page. - Once an indicated topic name is received, a request is sent to the personalized web page system (320). For example, the
user access device 108 can send an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) request, including the indicated topic name, to the personalizedweb page system 102 across the network 110 (thenetwork 110 was described previously with respect toFIG. 1 ), to request creation of a personalized web page related to the requested topic. A user identity (e.g., user login information) may be included in the request. - The request is received from the user access device (330). For example, the personalized
web page system 102 may receive an HTTP request, including the indicated topic name, from theuser access device 108, across thenetwork 110. - Once the request has been received, data storage having indications of popularity of content related to the topic is accessed (340). For example, the personalized
web page system 102 can access the popularity database 126 (described previously with respect toFIG. 1 ). Thepopularity database 126 may store a frequency of occurrence of content items, indicating how often content items appear in users' personalized web pages. - Based on accessed data, content to be added is identified by selecting the most popular content related to the indicated topic (350). For example, the personalized
web page system 102 identifies the most popular content in thepopularity database 126 related to the indicated topic. In some implementations, related content may be selected based on a frequency threshold. For example, content may be selected based on a relevance to the indicated topic and also based on whether a content item appears in at least a certain number (e.g., 1000) of personalized web pages. Identified content can be filtered based on user demographics. For example, identified content can match the user's geographical region, country, language and/or other types of demographic or user characteristic information. - Once content has been identified, a personalized web page having the identified content is created (360). For example, the personalized
web page system 102 can create a web page document which includes the identified content. Identified content can be displayed in the created web page document using one or more gadgets, though this need not necessarily be so. Gadgets may be retrieved from thegadget database 136 discussed previously with respect toFIG. 1 . In some implementations, gadgets are organized under a tab having the user-specified name. - The created web page is saved in association with the user, for example, in the
user database 146. In some implementations, the contents of the web page do not change once the page is created unless the user manually changes the contents. In other implementations, the personalizedweb page system 102 periodically recommends new content, which the user can choose to add to the page. Additionally or alternatively, the personalizedweb page system 102 may automatically replace content that was previously automatically identified (as opposed to content manually added or selected by the user). - Once the web page has been created, the personalized web page having the identified content is sent to the user access device (370). For example, the personalized
web page system 102 sends the created web page to theuser access device 108, across the network 110 (e.g., using HTTP). - A personalized web page is received (380). For example, a personalized web page document sent by the personalized
web page system 102 across the network 110 (370) may be received by auser access device 108. Theuser access device 108 stores the received web page in memory and/or in persistent storage. - The personalized web page is presented (390). For example, the personalized web page may be presented in a web browser running on the
user access device 108. The personalized web page may be displayed as a “tab.” such as the tab 280 as discussed previously with respect toFIG. 2D . The displayed tab may be named using the indicated topic name (e.g., a tab with a name of “News” may be created if the indicated topic is “news”). -
FIG. 4 illustrates anexample environment 400 configured to provide personalized web pages. Theenvironment 400 includes the personalizedweb page system 102 and theuser access device 108, both discussed previously with respect toFIG. 1 . The personalizedweb page system 102 includes processinginstructions 402 anddata 404. The processinginstructions 402 includeinstructions 406 for determining the popularity of content for a topic andinstructions 408 for creating a personalized web page for a topic based on popularity of the topic. Theinstructions 406 may be, for example, an implementation of process 500 described in more detail below with respect toFIG. 5 . Theinstructions 408 may be an implementation of theprocess 300 previously discussed with respect toFIG. 3 . The created web page can be presented on the user access device as part of aweb browser application 409. - The
data 404 included in the personalizedweb page system 102 includesaccount information 410,gadget information 412, andgadget popularity indications 414. Theaccount information 410 may be stored in theuser database 146, thegadget information 412 may be stored in thegadget database 136, and thegadget popularity indications 414 may be stored in thepopularity database 126 as described previously with respect toFIG. 1 . - The
account information 410 includes, for each account, an account name 416 (here, “JOHNSMITH”, in the example information shown). Theaccount information 410 also includes, for each account, a set of topics 418A (here, “NEWS”) and 418B (here, “SPORTS”) included on the personalized web page associated with the account. Each of the topics 418A and 418B may be associated with a set of gadgets. For example, the news topic 418A is associated with a “NEWS GADGET A” 420A gadget, a “NEWS GADGET B” 420B gadget, and a “NEWS GADGET N” 420C gadget. As another example, the sports topic 418B is associated with a “SPORTS GADGET C” 422A gadget, a “SPORTS GADGET H” 422B gadget, and a “GADGET NN” 422C gadget. - The
gadget information 412 includes, for each gadget, a gadget name 430 (here, “SPORTS GADGET C”, in the example information shown), an associated topic 432 (here, “SPORTS”), and a gadget location 434 (here, “www.sportsgadget84848484.com”). Thegadget name 430 can be displayed as a gadget title when the gadget is presented in a web page (e.g., as text displayed in the title of an area of a web page used to display the gadget). A gadget in thegadget information 412 may be referenced by (or otherwise linked to) user accounts in theaccount information 410. For example, thegadget name 430 of “SPORTS GADGET C” is included in theaccount information 410 as agadget 422A associated with the topic 418A. The location 434 of a gadget may be a web address or URL (Uniform Resource Locator) associated with the gadget and may be used to receive content associated with the gadget. The location 434 may be associated with a publisher (e.g.,publishers 104A-B) who provides the content for the gadget. - The
gadget popularity indications 414 include, for each grouping of a gadget, topic, and demographic (e.g., country), an indication of the popularity of the gadget for the respective topic and country. For example, in the example data shown, agadget 440 named “GADGET X” has apopularity index 442 of 1 for atopic 444 of “SPORTS” in thecountry 446 of the United States. The personalizedweb page system 102 can calculate thegadget popularity indications 414, such as described, for example, with respect toFIG. 5 . -
FIG. 5 shows an example process 500 for identifying popular content. The process 500 may be performed, for example, by the personalizedweb page system 102 discussed previously with respect toFIG. 1 . - The process 500 includes obtaining content for personalized web pages for a particular topic (510). For example, the personalized
web page system 102 may process existing personalized web pages stored for users (for example, personalized web pages stored in the user database 146) to search for personalized web page content (e.g. gadgets) that are related to a particular topic. The personalizedweb page system 102 may find content of a particular topic by searching for web page titles (e.g., tab names) that have the same name as the topic. For example, the personalizedweb page system 102 can determine that content included on a web page with a title (e.g., tab name) of “sports” is related to a topic of “sports”. - Once content related to a topic is obtained, obtained content is filtered based on a particular demographic characteristic (520). For example, obtained content may be filtered based on country, language, region, country, and/or another type of demographic or user characteristic. Obtained content can also be filtered based on group membership profiles. For example, users may belong to one or more groups (e.g., users may belong to one or more groups of friends, and users may also belong to one or more groups of users who share a common interest). Content can be filtered by group membership so that a user can be subsequently presented suggested, topic-oriented content that is used by other members of groups of which the user is a member.
- The most popular content in the filtered content is identified ( 530). For example, the personalized
web page system 102 may identify up to a specified or otherwise predetermined or user-entered number (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 10, etc.) of the most popular gadgets in the filtered content. The most popular gadgets may be identified according to a count of how many times a gadget appears in the filtered content. A threshold can be used to include only those gadgets who appear at least a certain number (e.g., 100, 1000, 10,000, etc.) of times in the filtered content. - Indications of the identified content are stored in association with the demographic characteristic and the topic for later use in creating personalized web pages for the topic (540). For example, the personalized
web page system 102 may store indications of the identified content in thepopularity database 126. - A popularity-driven selection mechanism can be applied in a variety of settings. In addition to a popularity-driven selection of web content for a personalized web page, a user can select a look-and-feel theme for a personalized web page from a set of popular themes (discussed in more detail below with respect to
FIGS. 6A-B ). Other look-and-feel options can be presented to the user in a popularity-driven manner. For example, a user may select how many columns to use to display gadgets (e.g., whether to display gadgets in two or three columns on the personalized web page 220). Choices for number of columns to use (e.g., 2, 3, etc.) can be determined based on the most popular column layouts used in existing personalized web pages. A default layout can also be determined based on most popular use. -
FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrates example user interfaces for applying a theme to a personalized web page. Referring toFIG. 6A , a personalized web page 620 includes anarea 630 for selecting a “look and feel” theme, or “skin.” Thearea 630 can be displayed, for example, in response to the selection of a “Select theme” link 640. Thearea 630 includes a set ofgraphical theme buttons 650, where each theme button shows a graphic illustrating the look and feel of a respective theme. For example, a “Classic”theme button 650A illustrates a simple theme and a “City Scape”theme button 650B illustrates a theme including graphics of city buildings. The user selects one of thetheme buttons 650 to apply a respective theme. The displayed theme buttons can correspond to the most popular themes in use in personalized web pages associated with the personalizedweb page system 102. - The personalized web page 620 can be updated to reflect the applied theme, as will be discussed below. The user can select a “Save”
button 660 to persistently save the theme selection so that the personalized web page 620 is displayed using the selected theme every time that the user accesses the page 620. An indication of the selected theme can be stored in association with the user in theuser database 146. Thearea 630 can be removed from the personalized web page 620 after the theme selection has been saved. A “Cancel” button 670 can be selected to remove thearea 630 from the personalized web page 620 without saving a theme. -
FIG. 6B illustrates the personalized web page 620 with a theme applied. A “city landscape” theme has been applied to the personalized web page 620, in response to, for example, the selection of thetheme button 650B. The user can display other themes by selecting a different one of thetheme buttons 650. As discussed previously with respect toFIG. 6A , the user can select the “Save”button 660 to save the theme selection (and to remove the area 600 from the personalized web page 620), or the user can select the “Cancel” button 640 to remove thearea 630 from the personalized web page 620 without saving a theme selection. Once thearea 630 has been removed, gadgets that may have been hidden underneath (or otherwise removed from) the personalized web page 620 can be redisplayed. That is, gadgets on the right side of the web page 620 may have been hidden or removed in response to the display of thearea 630, and the personalized web page 620 can be updated to redisplay these gadgets. -
FIG. 7 illustrates anexample web page 700 for selecting content for a personalized web page from adirectory 720. Theweb page 700 can be displayed, for example, in response to the selection of thelink 249 on thepersonalized web page 220 discussed previously with respect toFIG. 2B . Thedirectory 720, which is included in theweb page 700, includes a list of topic names. Here, a “Popular” topic 722 is the selected topic. The user can also select from among a list of other topics, including a “News”topic 724 and a “Finance”topic 726. The topics that are listed in thedirectory 720 can be determined (e.g., by the personalized web page system 102) based on topic popularity. - In response to the selection of a topic in the
directory 720, information for gadgets associated with the selected topic is shown in anarea 740 of theweb page 700. For example, gadget information for popular gadgets is displayed, such asgadget information 742, which includes a gadget title (here, “Joke of the Day”), a popularity indication (e.g., “141,111 users”), and a graphic. The information displayed in thearea 740 can be filtered by demographic, group affiliation or another type of user characteristic. For example, thearea 740 can display gadgets associated with a user's language, country and/or region. - The gadget associated with the
gadget information 742 can be added (e.g., to the personalized web page 720) by selecting abutton 744. If thepersonalized web page 720 has an existing tab having the same name as the topic associated with the added gadget, then the added gadget can be placed on that tab. In some implementations, the added gadget is added to the tab that was displayed when thepage 700 was launched. For example, with respect toFIG. 2D , the “News” tab 280 is the displayed tab. If the user selects thelink 249 to launch thepage 700, then gadgets added using thepage 700 can be placed on the “News” tab 280. In other implementations, added gadgets are added to the user's “Home” tab. - On the
