- Network 140 can be any network or combination of networks that can carry data communication. Such network can include, but is not limited to, a local area network, medium area network, and/or wide area network such as the Internet.
- Client 110 can be a general-purpose computer with a processor, local memory, a display (e.g., LCD, LED, CRT monitor), and one or more input devices (e.g., a keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen display).
- client 110 can be a specialized computing device such as, for example, a tablet computer or other mobile device.
- Client 110 executes map image viewer 120 (or simply "image viewer 120"), the operation of which is further described herein.
- Image viewer 120 may be implemented on any type of computing device.
- a computing device can include, but is not limited to, a personal computer, mobile device such as a mobile phone, workstation, embedded system, game console, television, set-top box, or any other computing device.

- FIG. 2 is an exemplary system 200 for prominence-based generation of map features, according to an embodiment.
- system 200 includes a context analyzer 210, a prominence ranker 220, and a feature generator 230.
- system 200 will be described in the context of system 100 of FIG. 1, but embodiments are not intended to be limited thereto.
- system 200 may be implemented as a component of system 100 of FIG. 1, discussed above, according to an embodiment.
- context analyzer 210, prominence ranker 220, and feature generator 230 may be implemented as one or more components of map feature generation 160 of server(s) 150, as shown in FIG. 1 and described above.
- prominence ranker 220 automatically calculates a total prominence score for a set of map features in a geographic area of interest based on these various sources of information or search attributes that can be associated with a given search context.
- the exemplary attributes listed above e.g., geographic location of the user, user's search history, time of day, and ranking data associated with a map feature
- the exemplary attributes listed above will be described in the context of the aforementioned example of route navigation using turn-by- turn directions.
- embodiments are not intended to be limited thereto.
- FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate example browser displays 300A and 300B, respectively, for a web-based mapping service such as mapping service 130 and an integrated map image viewer such as image viewer 120 of FIG. 1, as described above, according to an embodiment.
- the mapping service provides various user interface elements 320 that, when selected, preferably changes the orientation and appearance of the map in areas where map data is available. For example, streets with available map data may be highlighted, for example, as depicted by arrow 315 in example display 300B.
- This highlighting can be, for example, a colored and/or shaded outline or overlay, or a change in color and/or shading. This can be implemented by using a transparency image with a map tile or by directly including the effect in the map tile served to the mapping service (e.g., via map tiles 132 of FIG. 1, as described above).
- a user may input one or more search terms via search field 330 of browser display 300A.
- search terms input by the user may include, but are not limited to, a business name, a physical address of a point of interest, and a request for directions between different points of interest.
- the map server serves portions of a tiled raster map, in which pre-generated, rasterized images or "tiles" (e.g., map tiles 132 of FIG. 1) that include map feature data are stored at a map server.
- pre-generated, rasterized images or "tiles” e.g., map tiles 132 of FIG. 1
- the rasterized images may be provided to the client, where they are used to create a view of the requested map or geographic region of interest. Additional views based on, for instance, panning, zooming, or tilting the requested map can be generated at the client using the tiles.
- Vector-based methods can also be used to generate digital maps in accordance with other embodiments.
- map data including feature data
- a map server in the form of vector graphic instructions.
- the instructions are interpreted by an application at the client in real-time to generate a map for the user.
- the map can be dynamically updated at the client to include those layers.
- the map can be dynamically regenerated at the client to include the new map views. For example, the prominence and landmark-threshold calculations may be performed locally at the client (e.g., at a mobile device of the user).
- viewport 31 OA of the map image viewer presents a panoramic image of the selected area.
- the user can click and drag around on the image to look around 360 degrees.
- a variety of user interface elements 320 are added to the underlying map image.
- These elements include navigation inputs such as, for example, zoom and panning controls (e.g., navigation buttons) on the left side of the viewport and annotations in the form of lines/bars, arrows, placemarks, and text that are provided directly in the panorama itself.
- the annotations are rendered in an appropriate manner that roughly matches the scene depicted in the viewport.
- This technique can readily scale to accommodate complex intersections with more than four directions.
- a "dead end" where the road continues but no further imagery is available, there is only one arrow on the street indicating the direction in which the user can navigate.
- a symbolic icon or message embedded in the image can be presented appropriately to inform the user that imagery is not available in this direction.
- the user interface may be presented in the context of navigation between different views of map features at varying levels of details and/or levels of zoom, where such features may be represented in graphical form, as discrete street-level panoramic images, or a continuous set of panoramic data. Further, a user may be able to navigate through such representations along a street or aerial view such that the user would be presented with a visually smooth experience similar to viewing, for example, the playback of scenes in a video.
- Method 400 begins in step 402, which includes receiving a user request associated with a geographic area or region of interest on a map.
- a user request may be for a general view of the map (e.g., at a particular level of zoom), one or more specific points of interest on the map, or travel directions between different points of interest on the map, as previously described.
- the appropriate search context is determined based on the received user request and one or more attributes associated with the user request or search context including, but not limited to, geographic location of the user, user's search history, time of day, and ranking data associated with a map feature, as described above.
- Steps 402 and 404 may be performed by, for example, context analyzer 210 in system 200 of FIG. 2, as described above.
- step 408 in which each of the identified map features are assigned a prominence score or ranking based on the relevance or relative significance of each map feature with respect to the search context.
- step 410 a graphical representation of each of the map features is generated based on the feature's assigned prominence score.
- map features may be rendered on the map in accordance with various rendering styles, where the rendering style for each map feature is based on the relative prominence score assigned to the map feature.
- the generated representation of the map feature(s) may be stored in memory for later access and display to a user, as described above.
- method 400 may include the additional step of rendering or displaying the generated representation.
- the graphical representation may be rendered in an image viewer of a mapping service (e.g., image viewer 120 of mapping service 130 in system 100 of FIG. 1, as described above), which is displayed to a user via a display coupled to a client device (e.g., client 110 in system 100, as described above).
- a mapping service e.g., image viewer 120 of mapping service 130 in system 100 of FIG. 1, as described above
- client device e.g., client 110 in system 100, as described above.
- Method 400 can be implemented solely on a client device or on one or more server devices such as, for example, client 110 or server(s) 150 in system 100 of FIG. 1, as described above.
- a client device e.g., a mobile device
- One benefit of using method 400 includes enabling users to distinguish particular map features that may be more pertinent to their individual needs and search criteria than other map features. For example, such map features may correspond to a geographic region of interest or one or more specific points of interest to be represented on a digital map, as described above.
