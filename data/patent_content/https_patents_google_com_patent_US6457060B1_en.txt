Definitions
- the present invention relates to computer networks, and more particularly, to accessing resources located in computer networks.
- the Internet has popularized the concept of linking one page (or document) to another page. Such linking is achieved by placing a link head in one page that points to a link tail where another page is located on the Internet.
- the link tail consists of a Universal Resource Locator (URL).
- Linking can also be used to link a computing device or its Internet browser running thereon to a home page.
- a home page is the initial page that the Internet browser displays to a user.
- the home page is normally set by the user of the Internet browser based on their preferences or set by a service provider that is facilitating the user's access to the Internet. Examples of Internet browsers are (i) Navigator by Netscape Corporation and (ii) Internet Explorer by Microsoft Corporation.

- FIGS. 1A-1E are screen shots illustrating basic conventional displaying of a home page and linking to resources. These screen shots pertain to screens displayed to a user of Microsoft Internet Explorer, Version 3.0.
- FIG. 1A illustrates a representative home page having an address (i.e., URL) of “uplanet.com/”.
- FIG. 1B illustrates the representative home page of FIG. 1A where a cursor is placed over a News/Events button on the representative home page. Note that the bottom left-hand portion of the representative home page shows a relative URL (“index.html”) for the page containing information on the News/Events. Hence, the home page is linked to the News/Events page by a link associated with the News/Event button.
- FIG. 1A illustrates a representative home page having an address (i.e., URL) of “uplanet.com/”.
- FIG. 1B illustrates the representative home page of FIG. 1A where a cursor is placed over a News/Events button on the representative home
- FIG. 1C illustrates the News/Events page that is displayed after the user selects (e.g., “clicks on”) the News/Events button.
- the address or URL for the News/Events page is “uplanet.com/new/index.html”.
- the News/Events page also contains several local links, including links to Events, Press Releases, Table of Contents, Contact information, and Trademarks information, any of which link to another page that can be displayed to the user.
- FIG. 1D illustrates the News/Events page when the user places a cursor over the Press Releases link. Note that in this event the bottom left-hand portion of the News/Events page shows a relative URL (“press.html”) for the page containing information on the Press Releases.
- FIG. 1E illustrates the Press Release page (“uplanet.com/new/ press.html”) that is displayed after the user selects (e.g., “clicks on”) the Press Release link on the News/Events page illustrated in FIG. 1 D
- one disadvantage of conventional linking is that the location of the resource being linked to needs to be known when the links are created.
- the links cannot be properly established if the location of the resource is not known.
- a link i.e., link head
- the location of the resource i.e., link tail
- Another disadvantage is that once conventional links are established, if the location of the resource changes, the linking fails. In this case, it is said that the link URL (i.e., link head) to the resource (i.e., link tail) is incorrect, so the link fails.
- link URL i.e., link head
- link tail the resource
- FIGS. 1F and 1G illustrate screen shots of dialog boxes used with Microsoft Internet Explorer to change a pre-stored URL for a home page.
- the screen shot shows that the home page address is “yahoo.com” which is a popular search engine for the Internet.
- the screen shot shows that the home page address has been changed to “msn.com” for the Microsoft Network, which on Internet Explorer is the default home page.
- service or network providers often desire to control the home page for the user that is a subscriber to their services.
- the disadvantages noted above severely hamper the ability of the service or network provider to move or change the home pages for users.
- a common Internet browser is used to connect to different service or network providers who each want the user to use a different home page, then the home page displayed to the user will need to be different for the different service or network providers.
- the invention relates to aliasing techniques that permit flexibly linking to remotely located resources.
- the aliasing techniques are used by a browser application to link to a remote resource located on a network (e.g., the Internet) when the location of the remote resource is initially unknown or likely to be changed based on events external to the browser application.
- the external events can include: relocation of the remote resource, use of a different device, change of user or carrier service to access the remote resource, or selection of different service levels.
- a browser application executes on a remote computing device and couples to a network gateway via a carrier network.
- the aliasing techniques of the invention are provided by sending alias information from the network gateway to the browser application, and then having the browser application form an alias table and store the alias table in the remote computing device.
- the remote computing device can be any of a wide range of two-way interactive communication devices, including a mobile phone, a desktop telephone, a personal digital assistant, an Internet-capable remote controller and a portable general purpose computer.
- the invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a method, an apparatus, and a computer system. Several embodiments of the invention are discussed below.
- an embodiment of the invention includes the operations of: identifying an alias URL that corresponds to the home page to be displayed on the display screen; converting, within the remote computing device, the alias URL to a resulting URL; requesting the home page from the network server using the resulting URL; and thereafter displaying the home page received from the network server on the display screen.
- another embodiment of the invention includes the operations of: identifying a link URL that corresponds to a page to be displayed on the display screen by the browser program; determining whether the link URL is an alias URL; converting, within the remote wireless computing device, the link URL to a resulting URL when the determining operation determines that the link URL is an alias URL; requesting the page from the network server using the resulting URL; and thereafter displaying the page received from the network server on the display screen.
- an embodiment of the invention includes a memory that stores a browser and an alias table; and a device controller operatively coupled to the memory.
- the device controller operates to execute the browser, operates to evaluate link requests by the browser to determine whether the link requests are aliases, and, for each of the link requests that are determined to be an alias, operates to convert the alias to an actual link in accordance with alias information stored in the alias table.
- the alias table can store at least one of an actual homepage link that corresponds to a homepage alias and an actual bookmark link that corresponds to a bookmark alias.
- an embodiment of the invention includes a display screen; and a computer readable media storing computer program instructions for operating a browser program and for storing computer program instructions for displaying a page on the display screen.
- the computer program instructions for displaying the page on the display screen include: program code for identifying a link URL that corresponds to the page to be displayed on the display screen by the browser program; program code for determining whether the link URL is an alias URL; program code for converting the link URL to a resulting URL when the program code for determining determines that the link URL is an alias URL; program code for requesting the page from the network server using the resulting URL; and program code for displaying the page received from the network server on the display screen.
- an embodiment of the invention includes: first program code for identifying a link URL that corresponds to a page to be displayed on the display screen; second program code for determining whether the link URL is an alias URL; third program code for converting the link URL to a resulting URL when the second program code determines that the link URL is an alias URL; fourth program code for requesting the page from the network server using the resulting URL; and fifth program code for thereafter displaying the page received from the network server on the display screen.
- an embodiment of the invention includes the operations of: identifying a link URL that corresponds to a page to be displayed on the display screen by the browser program; determining whether the link URL is an alias URL; converting the link URL to a resulting URL when the determining operation determines that the link URL is an alias URL; requesting the page from a remote network server using the resulting URL; thereafter displaying the page received from the remote network server on the display screen; and caching the page received from the remote network server based on the resulting URL.
- One advantage of the invention is that links can be created without prior knowledge of the location (e.g., URL) of the resource being linked.
- the aliasing techniques can provide flexible, in-browser linking to an appropriate home page or bookmark.
- Another advantage of the invention is that it allows network servers to relocate its resources or otherwise reorganize its site.
- Still another advantage of the invention is that external events can alter the linking to different resources even after the link (i.e., link head) is created.

- the invention relates to aliasing techniques that permit flexibly linking to remotely located resources.
- the aliasing techniques are used by a browser application to link to a remote resource located on a network (e.g., the Internet) when the location of the remote resource is initially unknown or likely to be changed based on events external to the browser application.
- the external events can include: relocation of the remote resource, use of a different device, changes of user or carrier service to access the remote resource, or selection of different service levels.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a communication system 200 according to an embodiment of the invention.
- the communication system 200 includes a wired section 204 and a wireless section 206 .
- the wired section 204 includes the Internet 208 and a network gateway 210 .
- the Internet 208 represents a large number of interconnected computers.
- the network gateway 210 operates to provide a gateway from the wired section 204 and the wireless section 206 .
- the network gateway 210 will normally perform some protocol translation and other account management and verification operations.
- the network gateway 210 includes an account information storage area 212 that stores account, configuration and other information.
- the wireless section 206 includes a carrier network 214 and at least one remote browser 216 .
- the remote browser is so named because the remote browser 216 is usually an application program that executes on a remote computing device.
- the remote computing device can, for example, be a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, or a portable general purpose computer. It can be, however, appreciated by those skilled in the art that the disclosed invention is equally applicable to browsers operating in other non-wireless computing devices as well.
- the wireless section 206 will include a plurality of remote wireless browsers 216 , each of which executes on a different remote computing device.
- the configuration and other information stored in the account information storage area 212 can store service limitations, security limitations, preference information and the like for the remote wireless browsers 216 .
- the account information storage area 212 can also store data or pages of data that are of interest to the remote wireless browser 216 .
- the stored data or pages can operate as a cache of information previously requested from the Internet or can operate as an information server within the network gateway 210 .
- the storage pages can represent pages to be displayed by the remote wireless browser. Such pages can be specially formatted or customized for use with a remote wireless browser or a particular user of a remote wireless browser.
- the communication system 200 allows a user of the remote wireless browser 216 to access the Internet 208 to retrieve data or supply data there-between.
- the remote wireless browser 216 couples to the carrier network 214 using wireless communications.
- the remote wireless browser 216 or a user thereof, can initiate a request for information from the Internet 208 .
- the remote wireless browser 216 forwards the request to the carrier network 214 using wireless communications.
- the carrier network 214 forwards the request to the network gateway 210 , typically using wired communications.
- the network gateway 210 serves as a primary transition point between the wireless communication of the wireless section 206 and the wired communication of the wired section 204 . Specifically, the network gateway 210 receives the incoming request from the carrier network 214 and performs protocol conversion as necessary and then forwards the request to the Internet 208 . Within the Internet 208 , the request is directed to a particular server computer. The particular server computer is the server computer within the Internet 208 that stores the resource being requested by the request. Normally, the request contains a Universal Resource Locator (URL) that specifically identifies the resource and its location within the Internet 208 . The requested resource, if available, is then obtained from the particular server computer and returned to the network gateway 210 . Again, the network gateway 210 can perform protocol conversion as necessary and then forwards the requested resource to the carrier network 214 . The carrier network 214 , then in turn, transmits the requested resource to the remote wireless browser that had requested the resource using wireless communications.
- URL Universal Resource Locator
- This configuration and other information stored in the account information storage area 212 can provide service limitations, security limitations, preference information and the like for the remote wireless browsers 216 within the communication system 200 .
- the account information storage area 212 can also store data or pages of data that are of interest to the remote wireless browser 216 . By properly formatting the pages stored in the account information storage area 212 , the remote wireless browser 216 is better able to view the pages on a limited-size screen display.
- the remote wireless browser 216 can remotely view information stored on the Internet 208 .
- the remote computing device 218 thus is not wired to the Internet 208 but is nevertheless able to couple thereto using wireless communications.
- the remote wireless browser 216 initially references a home page that is preferably displayed on the screen display of the remote computing device 218 .
- the home page for a remote computing device would be an address or URL stored in the remote computing device supporting the remote wireless browser 216 .
- resources on the Internet tend to move or change their address (i.e., URL).
- the remote wireless browser 216 is uninformed and, as a result, the remote wireless browser 216 cannot properly access the desired home page.
- the link URL i.e., link head
- the link URL is created in a document or page before the location (e.g., URL) of the resource is known.
- the link cannot be properly established until the location of the resource (i.e., link tail) becomes known.
- the invention overcomes the problems of the conventional approaches through use of an aliasing technique.
- the remote wireless browser needs not know the location of the resource being linked to.
- the actual location of the resource being linked to is irrelevant.
- the aliasing technique according to the invention provides location-independent resource addressing.
- FIG. 3A is a block diagram of a network gateway 300 according to an embodiment of the invention.
- the network gateway 300 can, for example, represent the network gateway 210 illustrated in FIG. 2 and be typically a server computer. To avoid obscuring aspects of the present invention, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuitry in the network gateway 300 are not described in detail.
- the network gateway 300 includes a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) interface 302 that couples to the carrier network 214 , an HTTP interface 304 that couples to the Internet 208 , and a server module 306 coupled between the UDP interface 302 and the HTTP interface 304 .
- the server module 306 performs traditional server processing as well as protocol conversion processing. In particular, the protocol conversion processing includes protocol conversion between UDP and HTTP.
- the network gateway 300 includes a random access memory (RAM) 308 and a read-only memory (ROM) 310 .
- the RAM 308 will store device identifiers, subscriber identifiers, configuration information, and alias conversion information. In one embodiment, such information is stored in the RAM 310 as a database.
- the RAM 310 can represent the account information storage area 212 illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 3B is a block diagram of mobile device 350 according to an embodiment of the invention.
- the mobile device 350 can, for example, correspond to the remote computing device 218 that operates the remote wireless browser 216 illustrated in FIG. 2 .
- the mobile device 350 includes a UDP interface 352 that couples to the carrier network 214 via a RF transceiver 353 to receive incoming and outgoing signals.
- a device identifier (ID) storage 354 supplies a device ID to the UDP interface 352 .
- the device ID identifies a specific code that is associated with a particular mobile device 350 .
- the mobile device 350 includes a client module 356 that performs many of the processing tasks performed by the mobile device 350 including establishing a communication session with the carrier network 214 and the network gateway 210 , requesting and receiving data (e.g., pages) from the Internet 208 , displaying information on a display of the remote computing device, and receiving user input.
- the client module 356 is coupled to the UDP interface 352 for the establishment of a communication session and the requesting and receiving of data.
- the client module 356 also couples to a display driver 358 that drives a display 360 .
- the client module 356 controls the display driver 358 to display information on the display 360 to the user.
- the client module 356 is coupled to an input device 362 , a ROM 364 , and a RAM 366 .
- the client module 356 operates a network browser, such as a Handheld Device Markup Language (HDML) web browser.
- the input device 362 allows a user of the mobile device 350 to input data and thus make selections in controlling and using the mobile device 350 .
- HDML Handheld Device Markup Language
- the ROM 364 stores predetermined data and processing instructions for the client module 356 .
- the RAM 366 is used to provide temporary data storage for incoming and outgoing data being received and transmitted as well as for storage of an alias table that facilitates the conversion of alias URLs to actual URLs.
- the remote wireless browser 216 in the remote computing device When the remote wireless browser 216 in the remote computing device is activated, it typically requests a communication session with the network gateway 210 and then seeks to display a home page as its initial page of information that is displayed to the user. Hence, prior to obtaining and displaying the home page, the remote computing device performs an initialization processing in order to establish communications with the network gateway 210 .
- the initialization processing and page display processing associated with the invention are described below in FIGS. 4, 5 , 6 A and 6 B.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a flow diagram of a portion of initialization processing 400 performed by an embodiment of the invention.
- the initialization processing 400 initially establishes 402 a communication session between the mobile device 350 (i.e., remote wireless browser 216 ) and the network gateway 210 .
- the communication session can be established in a number of different ways.
- the remote wireless browser 216 executing on the mobile device 350 will communicate with the network gateway 210 via the carrier network 214 .
- the mobile device 350 retrieves its device ID from the device ID storage 354 and forwards it to the network gateway 210 .
- the network gateway 210 receives the device ID and the server module 306 searches the RAM 308 to determine whether the database stored therein recognizes the device ID. If the device ID is recognized, the communication session is permitted. Additionally, if desired, additional authorizations, passwords or other security checks can be performed before permitting the communication session.
- the network gateway 210 downloads 404 alias information to the remote computing device associated with the browser 216 .
- the alias information stored in the database that corresponds with the device ID is downloaded 404 by the network gateway 210 to the remote computing device.
- the remote computing device then stores 406 the alias information in memory.
- the downloaded alias information forms an alias table in the remote computing device for use by the remote wireless browser.
- the alias table can be stored in the RAM 366 of the mobile device 350 .
- additional initialization processing can be performed between the remote computing device and the network gateway 210 depending upon the particular implementation and application. Such additional initialization processing is not associated with the present invention and not further discussed herein so as to not obscure the invention.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of page display processing 500 according to an embodiment of the invention.
- the page display processing 500 is, for example, performed by the remote computing device, e.g., the mobile device 350 illustrated in FIG. 3 B.
- the page display processing 500 initially receives and displays 502 a web page having URL links.
- a decision block 504 determines whether a link on the web page has been selected.
- the page display processing 500 awaits the selection of such a link. In other words, the page display processing 500 does not actually begin until a link is selected.
- the selection of a particular link to a resource can be performed in a variety of ways. As suggested by blocks 502 and 504 , the selected link could be selected by a user who would select a particular URL link of a displayed web page. Alternatively, the selected link could be associated with a startup sequence that would automatically select a link for a home page without the need to display any web page.
- a decision block 506 determines whether the URL link is an alias. If the decision block 506 determines that the link is an alias, then alias conversion processing is performed 508 . On the other hand, when the decision block 506 determines that the URL link is not an alias, then a decision block 510 determines whether the URL link is a relative link. When the decision block 510 determines that the URL link is a relative link, then relative link conversion processing is performed 512 . Following block 508 , block 512 , or the decision block 510 when the URL link is not relative, the resource is requested 514 using a resulting URL.
- the resulting URL is either the result of the alias conversion processing (block 508 ), the relative link conversion processing (block 512 ), or no link processing.
- the resource being requested is identified by the resulting URL which identifies a location on the Internet 208 .
- a decision block 516 determines whether the requested resource has been received. If the requested resource has not yet been received, the decision block 516 causes the page display processing 500 to await its reception. Once the decision block 516 determines that the requested resource has been received, then the resource is displayed 518 . Following block 518 , the page display processing 500 is complete and ends.
- FIG. 6A is a flow diagram of alias conversion processing 600 according to an embodiment of the invention.
- the alias conversion processing 600 is, for example, the processing performed by block 508 in FIG. 5 .
- the alias conversion processing 602 initially separates 602 the alias URL into an alias base URL portion and a relative URL portion. Next, the alias base URL portion is looked up 604 in an alias table to obtain an actual base URL. Then, the actual base URL is combined 606 with the relative URL portion to obtain the resulting URL. Following block 606 , the alias conversion processing 600 is complete and returns.
- a representative example of the alias conversion processing 600 is as follows. Assume that a page or document is displayed on a screen display of the remote computing device, and that a user selects a link contained on the page or document. Alternatively, assume that a link is automatically selected by the mobile device 350 . In either case, according to the invention, the selected link is associated with an alias address (i.e., alias locator) of a resource being requested. Hence, the selection of the link obtains the alias address. The alias address is then processed in accordance with the alias conversion processing 600 . Normally, the alias address is an alias URL, the actual address is an actual URL, and the resulting address is a resulting URL.
- alias address is an alias URL
- the actual address is an actual URL
- the resulting address is a resulting URL.
- Table 1 illustrates a representative alias table.
- the alias table associates an alias URL with an actual URL for resources.
- the alias “device:home” is an alias URL that corresponds or maps to the actual URL “home.cell.com/”.
- the alias “device:bookmarks” is an alias URL that corresponds or maps to the actual URL “home.cell.com/bookmarks/”.
- Such an alias table as in Table 1 allows the homepage and bookmarks for the remote wireless browser to be relocated or changed without having to reprogram or physically alter the remote wireless browser's operation.
- Table 2 illustrates an alias table where the carrier network is Carrier A.
- the alias table allows the remote wireless browser to display the appropriate homepage and bookmarks for the particular carrier network being utilized by the user.
- Table 3 illustrates an alias table where the carrier network is Carrier B. This alias table would have been downloaded from the network gateway supporting either the Carrier A or the Carrier B so that the appropriate homepage and bookmarks would be utilized by the remote wireless browser without burdening the user.
- the alias tables are also very useful in directing the remote wireless browser to the appropriate homepage and bookmarks based on a variety of other attributes, including the user, the device, the device type, the service, etc.
- the alias “device:home” can correspond or map to a particular user's homepage, e.g., “netA.com/homepage/user-x”.
- the alias “device:home” can correspond or map to a premium service homepage, e.g., “netA.com/homepage/premium/”.
- the alias information is preferably downloaded from the network gateway 210 to the remote computing device (FIG. 4, block 404 ), it should be recognized that an alternative arrangement would eliminate the need for the downloading by performing the alias conversion processing in the network gateway 210 (i.e., server side). Such an arrangement would require the server to process the incoming request to identify those of the URLs that are alias URLs and perform the alias conversion processing centrally.
- FIG. 6B is a flow diagram of relative URL processing 650 according to an embodiment of the invention.
- the relative URL processing 650 is, for example, the processing performed in block 512 of FIG. 5 .
- the relative URL processing 650 initially identifies 652 a base URL associated with the selected link.
- the link URL is combined 654 with the base URL to form a resulting URL.
- the relative URL processing 650 is complete and ends.
- Another aspect of the invention concerns the caching of resources identified by an alias using an actual URL.
- Most browsers implement a cache of previously fetched network resources, (e.g., HTML pages, HDML decks, TIF images, GIF images, etc.).
- the resources are identified by their actual URLs and cached using the actual URLs.
- this aspect of the invention stores the resources in the cache using the actual URLs. In other words, actual URLs or resulting URLs (and not the alias URLs) are used to store the resources in the cache.
- the aliasing provided by other aspects of the invention remains transparent to the network server that is providing the resources.
- management of the cache can be performed using conventional approaches without any need for changes due to the use of the aliasing techniques of other aspects of the invention.
- changes to the alias table are transparently handled by the cache. For example, outdated entries in the cache are ignored and new resources are stored as entries after being fetched.
- One advantage of the invention is that links can be created without prior knowledge of the location (e.g., URL) of the resource being linked.
- the aliasing techniques can provide flexible, in-browser linking to an appropriate home page or preferences (e.g., bookmarks).
- Another advantage of the invention is that it allows network servers to relocate its resources or otherwise reorganize its site.
- Still another advantage of the invention is that external events can alter the linking to different resources even after the link (i.e., link head) is created.
