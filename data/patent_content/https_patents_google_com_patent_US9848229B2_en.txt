- billing component 174 can postpone billing of an advertisement that was skipped for example until a threshold of viewing time of a video advertisement was reached. If a user later watched the video as a post-roll or as part of the “watch later” playlist, then this action could optionally be tracked by the billing component 174 . If the user met the viewing threshold for the amount of time needed to qualify for a view, then the view can be treated as a billable event regardless of whether the advertisement was watched when first presented or afterwards.
- the billing component 174 in connection with the archiving component 101 and the thumbnail views of archived video ads 260 can facilitate increasing advertisement related revenue for both advertisers (e.g., mitigating opportunity loss associated with skipped ads by providing users with an ability to view skipped ads at a later point in time thus creating renewed sales opportunity and brand recognition for the advertisers), and host sites for the video advertisements by increasing opportunity for users to reach the viewing threshold time required to charge for an advertisement view.
- advertisers e.g., mitigating opportunity loss associated with skipped ads by providing users with an ability to view skipped ads at a later point in time thus creating renewed sales opportunity and brand recognition for the advertisers
- host sites for the video advertisements by increasing opportunity for users to reach the viewing threshold time required to charge for an advertisement view.
- the viewing threshold can be based on a fixed length of playback time of a video ad, a percentage of playback time of the video ad, a dynamically adjusted length of playback time of a video ad, a length of playback time of a video ad based upon a length of content video to be viewed associated with the video ad, or other criteria.

Abstract
This disclosure relates system(s) and method(s) for overlaying functionalities, text, annotations, and/or features on video advertisements and content videos.
Description
This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/247,557, filed on Aug. 25, 2016, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/465,850, filed on May 7, 2012, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/565,229, filed on Nov. 30, 2011, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
This disclosure relates system(s) and method(s) for overlaying functionalities, text, annotations, and/or features on video advertisements and content videos.
Conventionally, after users are presented with an in-stream video ad, it's difficult for them to recall that video ad to watch it afterwards or interact with it. Moreover, given the option users often skip an in-stream video ad they are interested in watching in order to first watch a content video. Unfortunately, there is no easy manner to locate the skipped video ad and watch it later. Consequently, an advertiser of the skipped video ad is missing out on potential views for an interested audience. Likewise, a host site for the advertisement may also lose revenue if the video advertisement is paid for on a charge per view basis.
A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary non-limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting embodiments in simplified form as a prelude to more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow in the disclosure.
In accordance with a non-limiting implementation, a presentation component presents a content video or a video advertisement for user viewing, and an overlay component generates an overlay having a set of features related to the video advertisement, wherein the set of features enhance user interaction with the video advertisement. The presentation component presents the overlay with the content video or video advertisement.
In accordance with another non-limiting implementation, a content video or a video advertisement is presented for user viewing, an overlay is generated having a set of features related to the video advertisement, wherein the set of features enhance user interaction with the video advertisement, and the overlay is presented with the content video or video advertisement.
These and other implementations and embodiments are described in more detail below.
The innovation is described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this innovation. It may be evident, however, that the innovation can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the innovation.
It is to be appreciated that in accordance with one or more implementations described in this disclosure, users can opt-out of providing personal information, demographic information, location information, proprietary information, sensitive information, or the like in connection with data gathering aspects. Moreover, one or more implementations described herein can provide for anonymizing collected, received, or transmitted data.
By way of introduction, the subject matter described in this disclosure relates to presentation of video advertisements (e.g., promoted videos, video ads), archiving the video advertisements, and postponing billing thereof through use of an overlay to the advertisement that exposes a variety of features that enhance user interaction with the advertisement.
Conventionally, after users are presented with an in-stream video ad, it's difficult for them to recall that video ad to watch it afterwards or interact with it. Moreover, given the option users often skip an in-stream video ad they are interested in watching in order to first watch a content video. Unfortunately, there is no easy manner to locate the skipped video ad and watch it later. Consequently, an advertiser of the skipped video ad is missing out on potential views for an interested audience. Likewise, a host site for the advertisement may also lose revenue if the video advertisement is paid for on a charge per view basis.
Employment of the advertisement overlay can increase click through rate (CTR) and revenue of video ads by enabling user interaction with the video advertisement during and after the video ad plays via the connected overlay containing information related to an in-stream video ad (and any other interactive abilities relating to the video ad). The overlay can appear over the content video, or during or after the in-stream ad is played, and the user can optionally mask or unmask the overlay or interact with overlay components/features. The overlay can include for example: the video ad title; a video ad thumbnail (optional); a link that directs to a page where that video ad can be viewed in full; a click-through link to a specified landing page associated with the video ad; attribution text indicating the overlay refers to a video advertisement; text that “user just watched . . . ” or “watch later” to identify the video ad; playlist of archived content videos or video ads; advertisement rating feature; counters for playback time left in video ad or time remaining until video ad can be skipped; reminders to view archived video ads, or ability to mask/unmask the overlay at any time during playback of the content video.
In accordance with an embodiment, a system provides an archiving component that allows for storing, indexing, or bookmarking skipped video ads so that they can be easily located and viewed by a user at a later point in time. For example, instead of or in addition to a skip button for skippable in-stream ads, the system can display an option to add the video advertisement to a watch later playlist so that the user can access the skipped video ad at a later point in time. The watch later feature can optionally be configured to also display the skipped ad again at the end of video content to which the user skipped as a post-roll. If the user later watched the video as a post-roll or as part of the watch later playlist, then this action could optionally be tracked. If the user met a threshold for the amount of viewing time of the video ad needed to qualify as a view, then the advertisement view can be treated as a billable event regardless of whether the advertisement was watched when first presented or afterwards. Furthermore, skipped video ads, the watch later playlist, or skipped video ad overlays can be presented to a user automatically, for example, based upon an inference that the user is available to view video ads.
Referring now to the drawings, with reference initially to FIG. 1 , an advertising delivery system 100 is shown that facilitates providing advertising content in conjunction with archiving video advertisements for later viewing. Moreover, overlays can be generated that are associated with an in-stream video advertisement to provide features that enhance user interaction with the advertisement as well as user management of the video advertisement. Aspects of the systems, apparatuses or processes explained in this disclosure can constitute machine-executable component(s) embodied within machine(s), e.g., embodied in one or more computer readable mediums (or media) associated with one or more machines, non-limiting examples of which are illustrated in relation to FIGS. 10 and 11 . Such component, when executed by the one or more machines, e.g., computer(s), computing device(s), virtual machine(s), etc. can cause the machine(s) to perform the operations described. Advertising delivery system 100 can include memory 102 for storing computer executable components and instructions. A processor 104 can facilitate operation of the computer executable components and instructions by advertising delivery system 100.
In an embodiment, advertising delivery system 100 employs an archiving component 101, an overlay component 103, a thumbnail component 110, an ordering component 120, a caching component 130, a presentation component 140, and a billing component 174. In an aspect, overlay component 103 can generate an overlay that exposes features and functionalities of the below-noted components. Thumbnail component 110 can generate one or more thumbnail views of media content. In a non-limiting example, media content can include skipped or watched video advertisements, or content video(s) that are intended for playing after a video advertisement, or any other digital media. Ordering component 120 orders (ranks) respective media content to be displayed after respective advertisement(s) are viewed or skipped. The ordering of the thumbnails (which can correspond to the ordering of corresponding media content to be displayed) can for example be a function of determined or inferred user interest, user context, relevance to user, advertiser preference, host site preference. Caching component 130 can cache respective video ads, content videos, and associated thumbnails as a function of the ranking (e.g., to improve streaming speed, bandwidth utilization, buffering, or resource allocation), and presentation component 140 transmits or presents respective video ads, thumbnails of video ads, thumbnails of the content to be viewed as well as the content video(s). Presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103 can present additional functions and content in connection with video advertisements and content videos (e.g., headline for the video advertisement, title of video advertisement, link to the video advertisements' watch page, a user voting or ranking feature (e.g., +1, like, dislike . . . ), learn more feature, countdown for time left in the video advertisement, countdown of time left before the video advertisement can be skipped . . . ). Additionally, advertising delivery system 100 includes a memory 150 that can store video ads, content videos, and content thumbnails, as well as, data generated by archiving component 101, overlay component 103, thumbnail component 110, ordering component 120, caching component 130, presentation component 140, and billing component 174. Memory 150 can be stored on any suitable type of storage device, non-limiting examples of which are illustrated with reference to FIGS. 10 and 11 .
The video ads, the content videos, or associated thumbnails can include data associated with one or more data sources (not shown) that can be accessed by a client device (not shown) or by a content delivery system such as advertising delivery system 100 (and additional systems described in this disclosure). For example, a data source can include a data store storing media content and affiliated with a content provider that interacts with advertising delivery system 100. In another aspect, a data source can include a data store that stores media content remote from a content provider or an advertising delivery system 100.
A client device can include any suitable computing device associated with a user and configured to interact with or receive media content. For example, a client device can include a mobile device, a mobile phone, personal data assistant, laptop computer, tablet computer, desktop computer, server system, cable set top box, satellite set top box, cable modem, television set, media extender device, blu-ray device, DVD (digital versatile disc or digital video disc) device, compact disc device, video game system, audio/video receiver, radio device, portable music player, navigation system, car stereo, etc. Moreover, a client device can include a user interface (e.g., a web browser or application), that can receive and present displays and generated locally or remotely. It is to be appreciated that advertising delivery system 100 can be remote from the client device or can be included within the client device. As used in this disclosure, the terms “content consumer” or “user” refer to a person, entity, system, or combination thereof that employ advertising delivery system 100 (or additional systems described in this disclosure). In an aspect, a client device or advertising delivery system 100 (or additional systems described in this disclosure) can be configured to access media content via a wired or wireless network, such as for example the Internet, intranet, or cellular service.
In a non-limiting example, thumbnail component 110 can generate thumbnails as a function of inferred or determined user interest, for example, based on user preferences, historical views, user context, user location, user queries, etc. In a non-limiting example, thumbnail component 110 can determine thumbnails that are likely to be of interest to a user, for example using artificial intelligence, by examining logs storing user interaction with content, non-limiting examples or which include, user context, searches, navigation of a content, viewing content, social networking, browsing content, rating content, ranking content, purchasing content, like indication of content, dislike indication of content, and/or comments or annotations applied to content. In another example, user preferences stored in a user profile and/or inferred by monitoring user interaction with the client device can be employed to determine thumbnails of interest to a user. In a further example, user profiles for a user and/or friends of a user can provide shared preference settings or inferences of thumbnails that are of interest to groups of users. It is to be appreciated that any criteria can be employed for determining which thumbnails may be of interest to a user. Thumbnail component 110 can generate and associate a thumbnail to a content video or video advertisement based upon determinations of user interest.
Referring to FIGS. 1-7 , presentation component 140 can generate as shown in FIG. 2 a display 200 that displays a media player 210 that can play a video advertisement 213 or content video (not shown). FIGS. 3 and 5 illustrate respective overlays 300, 500 that can be generated by overlay component 103 and respective components described in this disclosure that generate or provide various features and functionalities. Overlays 300, 500 can be applied to the in-stream video advertisement 213 as shown in FIGS. 4 and 6 where respective overlays applied to in- stream video ads 400, 600 are depicted. Furthermore, portions of overlay 300, 500 can be applied to a content video 212A (e.g. associated with thumbnail 212) that is displayed/playing as shown in FIG. 7 , for example after the user has completed watching video ad 213, skipped video ad 213, or chosen to watch later video ad 213, and begun playing content video 212A. Overlay component 103 in conjunction with the presentation component 140 can generate a highly functional environment for users to interact with and manage video advertisements. As noted, the one or more elements/features of overlays 300, 500 can be selectively masked or unmasked (e.g., by the user, or by a machine or system). In a non-limiting example, masking or unmasking one or more elements/features of overlays can also be performed automatically for example as a function of determined or inferred user intent, user context, video content, etc. In another non-limiting example, automatic masking or unmasking of one or more elements/features of the overlay can be performed periodically, at fixed, random, or dynamically selected intervals. For example, an overlay can be presented at the beginning of playing of a content video and be masked after a period of time, and then reappear after another period time, and repeat this process until the end of the video. In another example, an overlay can be presented at a certain point during playing of a content video and be masked after a period of time. In a further non-limiting example, an option (not shown) can be provided for a user to mask or unmask one or more elements/features of an overlay. It is to be further appreciated that displaying of overlays 300, 500 can be optional based upon a level of user engagement with the video advertisement, for example, such as upon amount of viewing time or monitoring of user activity. Furthermore, displaying of overlays 300, 500 can be optional based upon advertiser specified parameters or option, partner parameters or options, or user preferences.
Turning to the respective features and functionalities made available by overlay 300, 500, thumbnail component 110 can generate a thumbnail 212 of content video to be displayed after the video advertisement 213 in overlay 300, 500. To facilitate user comprehension of what video is being viewed, and what video is upcoming, presentation component 140 and the overlay component 103 can provide a variety of information and features/functionalities to enhance user viewing experience through displays and overlays. For example, overlays can be generated by overlay component 103 and displayed by presentation component 140. In a non-limiting example, overlay 300, 500 can include an advertisement headline 214. During playing of video ad 213, advertisement headline 214 can be shown for video ad 213 in the upper-left corner of the player, over a semi-transparent background. It is to be appreciated that the functional and text features described in this document are not limited to any particular location or context, and can be provisioned in any suitable manner or location. For example, advertisement headline 214 can automatically fade after G seconds (G is an integer) but reappear if the user hovers a cursor/pointer over anywhere on the video advertisement player 210. In another example, if video ad 213 does not have an advertisement headline 214, optionally a title of video ad 213 can be displayed instead. If video ad 213 is hosted on a website, the title can link to the video ad's watch page. Furthermore, hovering over the title can show mouse-over text revealing a promotional slogan or the like related to video ad 213. Additionally, advertisement text 218 can be displayed, for example, at a bottom portion of the player. In a non-limiting example, advertisement text 218 can be static or dynamic text associated with video ad 213. In a further non-limiting example, advertisement text 218 can be customized to the user watching the video ad, for example, based on user preferences and/or interest.
Although various thumbnails 260, 261 and playlist(s) 280 are shown on the same page, it is to be appreciated that they can be on a separate page. The playlist feature 280 when clicked can display a set of archived video ads 260 or content videos 261 that will initiate running in a serial manner, and the ordering component 120 can tailor ordering of the respective playlists as a function of the various metrics described in this disclosure. Additionally, in a non-limiting example, a playlist 280 can include video advertisements, thumbnails of video advertisements, content videos, and/or thumbnails of content videos.
Additionally, the presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103 can present content viewing options for use with any suitable type of client device that receives media files. Client devices often have different capabilities and limitations (e.g., screen size, processors, decoders . . . ). In an aspect, the presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103 can provide presentation options in accordance with different client device capabilities or limitations. For example, data rendering capabilities may be more limited in a mobile device (e.g., a smart-phone) than in a fixed computing device (e.g., a desktop computer), such as a larger percentage of client device processing resources may be required to present a media file, such as a video (or other information), on the mobile device than would be required in viewing the same media file on a fixed computing device. In addition, because displays of various mobile devices are often smaller and/or lower resolution than displays in fixed computing devices, it may be possible only to display a relatively small amount of information at any given time on a mobile device. Presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103 can thus optimize display of options and content for respective devices. Furthermore, data connections between a mobile device and various networked resources (e.g., the Internet) may be slower than corresponding data connections between a fixed computing device and the same networked resources. Accordingly, presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103 can generate user options to account for variations in device capabilities and available bandwidth for consumption and rendering of media content. For example, differing format or resolution versions of the same media file can be presented based upon client device capabilities and limitations. In a non-limiting example, a video ad, thumbnail or content video can be presented in a highly compressed encoding format and with lower resolution to a mobile device over a wireless network, while a lower compressed encoding format and higher resolution version of the same video ad, thumbnail or content video can be presented to a desktop computer on a wired network.
In view of the above, in an aspect, the presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103 can present media content in various formats and/or in accordance with various display mediums. For example, in one embodiment, the presentation component can present a section of video in a format such as H.263, H.264 AVC, MPEG-4 SP, VP8, or other suitable format. In another embodiment the presentation component 410 may present an audio section in formats such as for example AAC LC/LTP, HE-AACv1(AAC+), HE-AACv2 (enhanced AAC+), AMR-NB, AMR-WB, FLAC, MP3, MIDI, Vorbis, PCM/WAVE, etc.
In an aspect, presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103 can automatically configure or present user options to consume media content based on encoding parameters such as video resolution, video frame rate, video bit rate, video codec, audio codec, audio channels, audio bit rate, etc. Thus, presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103 or a user may choose a format to consume media content that best suits capabilities of specific consumption mediums, available bandwidth, file size, processing capabilities, screen resolution, screen size, available encoders, available decoders, etc.
In an implementation, billing component 174 can postpone billing of an advertisement that was skipped for example until a threshold of viewing time of a video advertisement was reached. If a user later watched the video as a post-roll or as part of the “watch later” playlist, then this action could optionally be tracked by the billing component 174. If the user met the viewing threshold for the amount of time needed to qualify for a view, then the view can be treated as a billable event regardless of whether the advertisement was watched when first presented or afterwards. Thus, the billing component 174 in connection with the archiving component 101 and the thumbnail views of archived video ads 260 can facilitate increasing advertisement related revenue for both advertisers (e.g., mitigating opportunity loss associated with skipped ads by providing users with an ability to view skipped ads at a later point in time thus creating renewed sales opportunity and brand recognition for the advertisers), and host sites for the video advertisements by increasing opportunity for users to reach the viewing threshold time required to charge for an advertisement view. It is to be appreciated that the viewing threshold can be based on a fixed length of playback time of a video ad, a percentage of playback time of the video ad, a dynamically adjusted length of playback time of a video ad, a length of playback time of a video ad based upon a length of content video to be viewed associated with the video ad, or other criteria.
Referring now to FIG. 8 , an exemplary methodology 800 for presenting an overlay in conjunction with a video ad is illustrated. At 802, display of a video ad is initiated (e.g., using presentation component 140). At 804, an overlay related to the video ad is generated and/or applied to the video ad (e.g., using presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103). At 806, the video ad is displayed with the related overlay (e.g., using presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103). At 808, overlay elements/features can optionally be masked or unmasked automatically and/or by manual user input (e.g., using presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103).
Referring now to FIG. 9 , an exemplary methodology 900 for presenting a video advertisement overlay in conjunction with a content video is illustrated. At 902, display of a video ad is initiated (e.g., using presentation component 140). At 904, optionally an overlay related to the video ad is generated and/or applied to the video ad (e.g., using presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103). At 906, displaying of the video advertisement is ended and a content video is displayed. (e.g., using presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103). It is to be appreciated that displaying of the content video can be the result of, for example, playing of the video ad reached the end, a user choosing to skip the video ad, or a user choosing to watch the video ad later. At 908, an overlay related to the video ad is generated and/or applied to the video ad (e.g., using presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103). It is to be appreciated that the overlay at 908 can be the same or different from the overlay at 904. At 910, overlay elements/features can optionally be masked or unmasked automatically and/or by manual user input (e.g., using presentation component 140 and/or overlay component 103).
