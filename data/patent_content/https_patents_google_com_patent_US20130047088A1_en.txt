- FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary process for obtaining content focus duration information with respect to previously served content.
- the content focus duration information is received from applications running on user devices 108 .
- the applications track the amount of time spend focusing on served content. For example, the amount of time spend on a “click-to-call”, “get driving directions”, and/or on a landing page.
- An application 214 - 1 , 214 - 2 can provide duration information associated with previously served ads by monitoring/logging focus changes in the mobile device.
- a focus change occurs when the active application or graphical user interface element (e.g., window or icon) changes. For example, when a user clicks from one window to another.
- the process begins with an application presenting received ads (i.e., content) on the mobile device running the application (step 301 ).
- the presented ads can take various forms and can include various selectable content such as click-to-talk, driving directions, video clips, URLs, and the like.
- the application logs an ad or content identifier associated with the selected content along with a timestamp corresponding to receipt of the request to change focus from the application (step 303 ).
- Focus is then redirected from the application to the requested content, for example, a video clip, an audio file, click-to-call, driving directions, landing page and the like (step 305 ).
- the previously logged timestamp is converted to a duration (step 307 ).
- content focus duration information is transmitted to the ad server along with the ad/content identifier (step 309 ).
- the focus duration and ad/content identifier can be transmitted with a subsequent request for ads.
- this duration information e.g., the ad identifier and the focus duration value, are included in a request for ads transmitted to the ad server as extra common gateway interface (CGI) parameters in a subsequent ad request.
- CGI common gateway interface
- the ad server 204 provides quality metrics to content providers based on content focus duration information received from mobile applications 214 - 1 , 214 - 1 .
- the ad server 204 receives ad focus duration information related to previously served ads from one or more applications running on a mobile device (step 402 ).
- the ad focus duration information includes, an ad or content identifier for a previously served ad and an associated ad/content focus duration.
- the ad identifier and focus duration can be received, for example, as common gateway interface parameters embedded in a request for ads from an application running on a user device 108 .
- the received ad/content focus duration information is logged for further analysis and processing.
- the logged focus duration information is aggregated to provide various levels of granularity (step 404 ). For example, at a top level, the focus duration information may be aggregated on an advertiser basis, resulting in an average focus duration for all ads associated with a particular advertiser. In other instances, the focus duration information is aggregated on a campaign basis, resulting in focus duration information for each campaign created by an advertiser. In still other instances, the focus duration information is aggregated on an ad content basis, resulting in focus duration information for the various selectable options content in the ads. For example, click-to-call, driving directions, and/or video clips.
- the level of aggregation granularity can be predefined by the ad server 204 and/or selected by the advertiser, for example, as a user interface option of the quality metrics tool.
- the quality metrics are provided to virtual content provider/advertiser based in part on the aggregated duration information (step 408 ).
- the quality metric could be as simple as the aggregated duration value or could be a parameter of more detailed metrics provided to the content provider/advertiser.
- the logged duration information could be used to determine the miss click rate for a given ad.
- a miss click refers to a situation where a user mistakenly clicks on an ad. If a user selects an ad and them quickly redirects the focus back to the application (i.e., the duration is less than a predetermined value) this provides a good indication that the user did not intend to select/click on the ad.
- This type of detailed metric can be presented to the content provider/advertiser in the form of predefined categories, such as duration time ranges, or requesting application. This allows the advertiser to determine trends for future ad targeting. For example, the aggregated focus duration information may show that when a particular ad campaign is served to gaming applications there is a high number of miss clicks, whereas when served to non-gaming applications there are very few miss clicks.

Abstract
Methods, including a computer program product for collecting metrics for determining content presentation quality are provided. An application executing on a mobile device requests and receives virtual content for presentation on the mobile device. The application logs focus duration information associated with presented content and transmits the focus duration information to a virtual content server in subsequent requests for virtual content. The virtual content server aggregates the content focus duration information received in the requests for virtual content, and provides quality metrics to virtual content providers based in part on the aggregated focus duration information.
Description
- This disclosure relates to content presentation, and more particularly to methods and systems for collecting metrics for determining content presentation quality.
- As the availability of mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablet devices, portable computers, and the like, continues to grow, more and more consumers/users, (herein referred to as users) are utilizing such devices to electronically access content previously accessed through other devices which among other things have greater display size. This in turn increases the need for content publishers to take into consideration how users will be viewing/access their content.
- From an advertising perspective, the same concerns exist for the display of ads as well as landing pages in display restricted environments, such as mobile devices. Not only are advertisers concerned with displaying creatives, e.g., electronic ads, to mobile users in a manner that will entice the user to click on the creative/ad, but also in providing landing pages which will promote conversions. A “landing page” as referred to herein, is the content linked to in an electronic ad. For example, electronic ads commonly contain links to other electronic content such as web pages, images, video files, audio files and the like, this linked content is referred to a the “landing page.”
- Although a mobile-device user may be enticed by a creative and click on it, if the user faces a landing page which is not mobile friendly, for example, containing a bunch of content in small font, they usually don't want to dig into the page on the mobile device. In addition, some landing pages may not render properly on a mobile device. For example, some mobile devices do not support Flash and/or do not execute a Javascript properly. Accordingly, the design of the landing page can have a large influence on whether or not a click-through results in a conversion. As a result, there is a need for metrics to help advertisers and/or publishers measure the quality of their creatives and landing pages.
- This specification describes technologies relating to content presentation in general, and specifically to methods and systems for determining landing page duration.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a computer-implemented comprising executing an application on a mobile device; presenting a virtual content item to a user, the virtual content item including an associated identifier; if the virtual content item is selected by the user, logging the virtual content item identifier and a time stamp and redirecting the mobile device's focus away from the application; upon return of the focus to the application, converting the previously logged timestamp into a duration; and transmitting the logged virtual content item identifier and associated content focus duration to a content serving system.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a computer-implemented comprising receiving content focus duration information related to previously served content items from one or more applications running on a mobile device; aggregating the received content focus duration information; and providing a quality metric to virtual content providers based on the aggregated duration information.
- These and other embodiments can optionally include one or more of the following features. The virtual content item identifier and associated content focus duration can be transmitted to the content server as extra common gateway interface parameters in subsequent requests for virtual content items. The received content focus duration information categorized into a plurality of predefined categories and aggregated on a per category, content item, and/or content provider basis.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration only, and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims. Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.

exemplary publisher 106 is an application running on a user device, for example, a game running on a tablet or smart phone. The application can submit a request for an ad toadvertising management system 104. The ad request can include various information for use by theadvertising management system 104 in determining the ads to provide in response to the request. For example, the ad request can include the number of ads requested, information about the event which triggered the request, amount of ad space available for presenting/displaying the ad. In addition, the ad request can include various information about the device running the application. - Another
exemplary publisher 106 is a general content server that receives requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, and so on), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request. The content server can submit a request for ads to an advertisement server in theadvertising management system 104. The ad request can include the number of ads desired. The ad request can also include content request information. The content request information can include the content itself (e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, and so on), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, and so on), geo-location information, and so on. -
Search service 112 can also submit a request for ads to theadvertising management system 104. For example, ads can be requested for presentation along with the search results responsive to a received query. The request can include a number of ads desired. This number can depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, and so on. The request for ads can also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results. - In some implementations, the content server (or a client browser or the like) combines the requested content with one or more of the ads provided by the
advertising management system 104. The combined content and ads can be served (e.g., sent) to the users 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., an application on a mobile device). The content server can transmit information about the ads back to the advertisement server, including information describing how, when and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., in hypertext markup language (HTML) or JavaScript™). -
Search service 112 receives queries from a plurality of users 108. In response, thesearch service 112 retrieves relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages) and provides them to the requesting user. The search results identify resources responsive to the submitted query. Exemplary search results can include lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and can be grouped into a predetermined number (e.g., ten) of search results. - As noted above, the
advertising management system 104 can collect usage information fromadvertisers 102,publishers 106, and/or users. This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to ads that have been served by the management system. A served ad is an ad that has been provided for presentation in response to a request for ad(s). In addition, theadvertising management system 104 logs information related to the ads it serves. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an exemplaryadvertising management server 204 operable to provide ads for presentation in response to a request for ad(s), for example from amobile device 208. Themobile device 208 can include anad request module 216. Although shown separately inFIG. 2 , thead request module 216 may be a part ofvirtual content browser 213 and/or a part of one or more application(s) 214-1, 214-2 stored on the device. - According an exemplary embodiment, the
ad request module 216 is part of an application 214-1, 214-2 installed on themobile device 208. The developer of the application has the ability to compile executable code into the application which upon one or more predefined events will submit a request for ads to theadvertising management system 104. A broad range of triggerable events, conditions, user actions, and like may be predefined by the developer. - In addition to the information related to a particular ad request, various additional information regarding previously presented ads may be included in the ad request. For example, a request can include content focus duration information related to previously served ads (discussed in greater detail below). The additional information may be transmitted/provided to the
advertising management system 104 via common gateway interface (CGI) parameters embedded in the ad request. - The
ad server 204 includes anadvertiser frontend interface 220 for creating advertisements and/or ad campaigns,ad repository 224 for storing ads,ad selection engine 222,statistics collection module 230, statistics log(s) 226, and conversion log(s) 228. Theadvertiser interface 220,ad selection engine 222,statistics collection module 230,ad repository 224, and statistics log 226 may be part of theadvertising management server 204 as illustrated, or provided as independent components in communication with theadvertising management server 204 in a manner known in the art. For example,advertising management server 204 may be provided as a distributed computing system. -
Advertiser interface 220 provides an interface for advertisers 202 to create and manage ad campaigns. An ad campaign can be a simple of as a single creative with associated serving criteria or a plurality of creatives having related serving criteria. The serving criteria can include one or more parameters, provided by an advertiser or the advertising management system, indicating when, where and/or under what conditions particular creatives may be served. Using theadvertiser interface 220, an advertiser can create a campaign by providing the content needed to present the different creatives and defining the serving criteria for the campaign. For example, the serving criteria parameters can include one or more of the following: one or more keywords or topics, geographic information, a value indication for the creative, start date, end date, and the like. - The
advertiser interface 220 can include one or more tools to help an advertiser design a campaign and/or individual ad, also referred to as a creative. According to an exemplary embodiment, theadvertiser interface 220 includes a content focus metrics tool which can be utilized by an advertiser or content providers to gauge ad and/or campaign quality. -
FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary process for obtaining content focus duration information with respect to previously served content. The content focus duration information is received from applications running on user devices 108. In other words, the applications track the amount of time spend focusing on served content. For example, the amount of time spend on a “click-to-call”, “get driving directions”, and/or on a landing page. - An application 214-1, 214-2 can provide duration information associated with previously served ads by monitoring/logging focus changes in the mobile device. Generally, a focus change occurs when the active application or graphical user interface element (e.g., window or icon) changes. For example, when a user clicks from one window to another. Referring back to
FIG. 3 , the process begins with an application presenting received ads (i.e., content) on the mobile device running the application (step 301). The presented ads can take various forms and can include various selectable content such as click-to-talk, driving directions, video clips, URLs, and the like. - When a user selects a presented ad and/or linked content, the application logs an ad or content identifier associated with the selected content along with a timestamp corresponding to receipt of the request to change focus from the application (step 303). Focus is then redirected from the application to the requested content, for example, a video clip, an audio file, click-to-call, driving directions, landing page and the like (step 305). Upon return of the focus to the application, the previously logged timestamp is converted to a duration (step 307). This can be achieved, for example, by the application associating the ad identifier with the frame in which the content is displaying, so that when the user clicks on the content, the application stores a tuple containing the content identifier and the timestamp of the click. When focus is returned to the application, the application would then convert that tuple into a tuple containing the id and the duration of the click by subtracting the stored timestamp from a current time.
- Finally, content focus duration information is transmitted to the ad server along with the ad/content identifier (step 309). The focus duration and ad/content identifier can be transmitted with a subsequent request for ads. In some instances, this duration information, e.g., the ad identifier and the focus duration value, are included in a request for ads transmitted to the ad server as extra common gateway interface (CGI) parameters in a subsequent ad request. For example, if the user spent 2 seconds on an ad with the id 123456, the next ad request might contain the parameters duration_id=123456&duration_time=2000.
- As illustrated in the
FIG. 4 , thead server 204 provides quality metrics to content providers based on content focus duration information received from mobile applications 214-1, 214-1. Thead server 204 receives ad focus duration information related to previously served ads from one or more applications running on a mobile device (step 402). The ad focus duration information includes, an ad or content identifier for a previously served ad and an associated ad/content focus duration. The ad identifier and focus duration can be received, for example, as common gateway interface parameters embedded in a request for ads from an application running on a user device 108. The received ad/content focus duration information is logged for further analysis and processing. - Because an advertiser may create numerous ads and/or campaigns and each ad may be served numerous times on numerous user devices, the logged focus duration information is aggregated to provide various levels of granularity (step 404). For example, at a top level, the focus duration information may be aggregated on an advertiser basis, resulting in an average focus duration for all ads associated with a particular advertiser. In other instances, the focus duration information is aggregated on a campaign basis, resulting in focus duration information for each campaign created by an advertiser. In still other instances, the focus duration information is aggregated on an ad content basis, resulting in focus duration information for the various selectable options content in the ads. For example, click-to-call, driving directions, and/or video clips. The level of aggregation granularity can be predefined by the
ad server 204 and/or selected by the advertiser, for example, as a user interface option of the quality metrics tool. - Finally, the quality metrics are provided to virtual content provider/advertiser based in part on the aggregated duration information (step 408). The quality metric could be as simple as the aggregated duration value or could be a parameter of more detailed metrics provided to the content provider/advertiser. For example, the logged duration information could be used to determine the miss click rate for a given ad. A miss click refers to a situation where a user mistakenly clicks on an ad. If a user selects an ad and them quickly redirects the focus back to the application (i.e., the duration is less than a predetermined value) this provides a good indication that the user did not intend to select/click on the ad. This type of detailed metric can be presented to the content provider/advertiser in the form of predefined categories, such as duration time ranges, or requesting application. This allows the advertiser to determine trends for future ad targeting. For example, the aggregated focus duration information may show that when a particular ad campaign is served to gaming applications there is a high number of miss clicks, whereas when served to non-gaming applications there are very few miss clicks.
