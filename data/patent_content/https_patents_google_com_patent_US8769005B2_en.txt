- FIG. 3 is a table including a list of parameters. It is understood that more or fewer parameters may be used to arrive at the social index value.
- the list of parameters further includes examples of weights associated with the parameters.
- the categories of parameters can include, for example, communication duration or length, communication timing and communication records.
- Calculating the social net index can include using a plurality of predetermined weights including a weighted combination of values of the plurality of statistics. Calculating the social net index may also include using a plurality of self-adjusting weights for a weighted combination of values of the plurality of statistics. Self-adjusting weights can be provided by a variety of factors. For example, if there is a prediction that a particular contact is a likely callee and that callee is not dialed or a call is not received, then the standalone social network can adjust the weights accordingly. Also, when that particular callee is called or a caller calls, then the weights can be updated accordingly.
- a self-correcting property provides adjustment in real-time and dynamic updates for any untoward changes in calling pattern.
- rules based engine framework for example, can be applied. It may be understood that rules of a rules based engine are basic components of Artificial Intelligence where rules can be changed in accordance with the change in environment to provide output.
- a call or other communication is expected from “X” and “X” does not call.
- the weight associated with the following parameter for “X” may be changed accordingly.
- Various considerations can be made. For example, when making a wrong prediction the first time, a 25% change (decreasing the magnitude impact of default value) in an associated weight can be made. For making a wrong prediction for the second time, 66% change (decreasing the magnitude impact of default value) in an associated weight can be made. For making a wrong prediction for the third time, default values can be set to 0.
- the weights that can be associated with “X”'s parameters can be changed can be as follows: Nvr, Mvrl, Vvrl, Mvrc, Mvc, Tvrf, and Tvrl.
- the parameter weights can be changed in positive direction. For example, when X calls for the first time after a wrong prediction was made, a 25% change (increasing the magnitude impact of default value) in associated weight can be made. When X calls for the second time after a wrong prediction was made, 66% change (increasing the magnitude impact of default value) in the associated weight can be made. When making a wrong prediction for the third time, values can be set to a default value.
- a call or communication is expected to be made to “X” and “X” is called.
- “X” was further supposed to be called however, the call is not made.
- the weight that can be associated with the parameters for “X” can be changed accordingly, for example, by 25%/66%/100% increasing and decreasing magnitude.
- the weights associated with “X's” parameters that can be changed follow: Nvs, Mvsl, Vvsl, Mvsc, Mvc, Tvsf and Tvsl. It is understood that different weights can follow different changes that are not necessarily 25%/66%/100% as described above. For example, different weights may be 33%/66%/100% or any other combination of variations.
- a calculation for a social net index value can be described in the following manner.
- P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , P 4 , . . . , P 33 , and P 34 where P 1 corresponds to Nvs, P 2 corresponds to Nvr, . . . , and P 34 corresponds to Ttrl.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a method in accordance with this discussion.
- the embodiment is a method in a mobile communication device having a contact list including a plurality of contacts, the method including calculating a value for a social networking index for at least two contacts of the plurality of contacts to generate calculated social net index values 460 and determining a prioritized subset of the at least two contacts of the plurality of contacts according to the calculated values 462 . Sorting at least two contacts of the contact list according to the social net index can produce a prioritized list of contacts.
- Calculating a social networking index can include calculating a plurality of predetermined statistics values by a statistic generating module 130 (see FIG. 1 ), the values calculated from data in a log of past communications 464 from a mobile communication device 465 or a remote device 467 and further applying predetermined weights by a weighting module 131 with which to combine the plurality of predetermined statistics values 466 .
- the weighting module may further apply self-adjusting weights to statistics.
- the method can further include retrieving by a retrieving module 137 from an address resolver 121 associated IP addresses for the contacts of the prioritized subset 468 and preloading the associated IP addresses of the contacts in the prioritized subset 470 .
- a preloading module 138 can be configured to preload the associated IP addresses for the contacts of the prioritized subset 468 .
- the user may be prompted 472 by prompting module 139 as to whether to initiate communication.
- the method can include initiation of communication 474 based upon the preloaded address or location.
- the initiated communication may be of any type.
- a VoIP initiation module 132 can be configured to initiate a VoIP communication.
- An instant messaging communication module 133 can be configured to initiate an instant messaging communication.
- An IP presence state communication module 134 can be configured to initiate an IP presence state communication.
- the electronic device 102 can be configured to access a circuit based communication network. It is understood that any type of communication can be initiated and is within the scope of this discussion.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a method for updating the social net values.
- updating the social index values for the contacts including new contacts, revised contacts and removed contacts can also include any corresponding weights and any associated parameters.
- An updating module 135 can be configured to update the social networking index for each contact of the contact list, and configured to correspondingly update the prioritized list of contacts.
- the method includes updating the value of the social networking index for the at least two contacts of the plurality of contacts at predetermined time intervals or randomly 580 . If there is a change in the social net index values 582 , then the method can include updating correspondingly the prioritized subset 584 .
- the above-described methods and devices therefore can include generating, from a set of call logs, values of a plurality of statistics associated with contacts of a contact list and generating, from the values of the plurality of statistics, a social net index for at least two contacts of the contact list. At least two contacts of the contact list according to social net index are sorted to produce a prioritized list of contacts. Accordingly, one or more IP addresses for the contacts of the prioritized list of contacts can be loaded prior to initiating IP based communication with a device. When a caller to a roaming mobile communication device initiates contact with the roaming mobile communication device that has an IP address, albeit a temporary IP address, the caller can search the Internet for the roaming device's IP address. It may be beneficial if the delay of initiating communication with a device having an address or location, particularly with a changing IP address is reduced.
