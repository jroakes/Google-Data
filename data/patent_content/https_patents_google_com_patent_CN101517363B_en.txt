Abstract
A routing server receives a request for routing information. The request specifies one or more locations. A specified location may be ambiguous. For an ambiguous location, the routing server identifies a set of potentially-matching locations and ranks the locations according to a metric. The routing server returns routing information for the highest-ranked location that potentially matches an ambiguous location. If a request for routing information specifies two locations, and at least one location is ambiguous, the routing server pairs combinations of potentially-matching locations based on the query and calculates a metric for each pair. In one case, the metric is the distance between the locations in the pair. The routing server ranks the pairs based on the metric, and returns routing information for the highest-ranked pair.
