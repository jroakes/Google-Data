Forum's topic (model) | The time of model issue replys each time of replying of quantity and browses the time that quantity topic grade is browsed at every turn |
Post people's community of the people that posts | |
The user | Whether hour of log-on friend quantity advocate number of users grade profile is browsed number of users photo user's model or total page rank of forum's topic |
Community | Total page rank Community Page of all member web pages of number of members is browsed total page rank of all models of page rank of the web of the community page |
Blog entries | Check the page rank of quantity answer quantity clauses and subclauses |
These factors are not exhaustive, but can expand.In addition, under some rank mechanism or ranking function, can be weighted individual factors more than once.For example, in one embodiment, in the community in total page rank of all members and this community total page rank of all models overlapping because when calculating each member's page rank, considered the page rank of model.
The factor of given type social networking objects is assessed by the ranking function of correspondence, to be used for calculating the score of (420) given social networking objects.For example, can determine and one or more factor of weighting, come these contribution summations with linear combination then.In addition, the value of individual factors (such as, number of members) can be determined by brand-new degree or the time of considering the incident relevant with this factor.So doing the incident that allows to upgrade " counts " more than so not new incident.
In order to consider the brand-new degree of incident, can use a function in a plurality of functions.In one embodiment, the exponential time attenuation function is applied to each incident, to be used for determining the value of factor.The form of this function is as follows:
y＝f(Δt)＝e
-Δt
Wherein:
Δ t is the time gap with the current time; And
Y is the incident factor.
When Δ t=0 or time when being current, this influence factor is 1.According to this function, depend on exponential damping with respect to the time according to the grade of incident.In another embodiment, the time attenuation function can adopt following form:
Some exemplary ranking functions below are provided.
Forum's topic
According to following ranking function the topic in the forum is carried out rank:
Wherein:
K
1=answer quantity;
K
2=browse quantity;
Δ t is the time (supposing for the current time Δ t=0) of replying (perhaps browsing); And
ω
1And ω
2Be weight, and indicate the relative importance of replying and browsing respectively.
These values can automatically be set to predetermined value in social networking system, perhaps by the system designer adjustment.Alternatively, can use simpler ranking function based on the model issuing time:
Score={ ω
1K
1+ (1-ω
1) K
2F (Δ t)
Wherein Δ t is the averaging time of the time interval current time of issue model.
User's rank
Based on model ranking result and given user's friend, advocate and the quantity of simply browsing the user is carried out rank:
Wherein:
K
1Be to specify the user to be assigned therein as other members' of " good friend " (that is, the good friend specifies each other) quantity for " good friend " and/or user;
K
2Be that the user specifies and/or specify the quantity of this user for other members of " advocate " (that is, the advocate specifies each other);
K
3Be the quantity of document browsing;
S
iIt is the page rank of a model; And
K
4Be the quantity of the model that has of user.
Perhaps, can be user's scoring based on user's hour of log-on:
In addition, another designator of user's importance is whether the user has photo.To having the user of photo, the rank score can forward convergent-divergent (for example, * 2).
Community's rank
Community carries out rank according to its model, for example:
Wherein:
S
iIt is the page rank of each individual model in the community; And
K is the total quantity of model in the community.
In addition, community carries out rank according to its member, comprises member's quantity, rank or other factors.The rank of community is the accumulation of user's rank, and each user's rank can be come weighting by the time length (that is, having added time span since this community from this user) that this user becomes this community member.Also use other ranking functions, factor and weight." Boosts " increases the value of incident based on the brand-new degree of posting recently in for example forum, blog or the community or reply incident.
Additional zoom factor can be used for further adjusting individual weight.The first, if incident is sending from the scheduled time slot of current beginning, then the value of this incident convergent-divergent that makes progress promptly multiply by the value greater than 1.If event number is lower than certain threshold value, then also can use downward convergent-divergent.For example, if the answer quantity in the forum less than 5, then multiply by weighted sum the value less than 1.Brand-new degree can use other technologies (such as the total quantity of the page browsing that surpasses the set time fragment etc.) times to take in.
In case calculate the score that (420) go out a group objects, just can determine the relative rank of (430) object.Object sorts by score, and the rank of each object ordinal position that is it in sorted lists.Then, can use (440) these ranks with a kind of method in the various possibility methods.For example, can use (440) must assign in the presenting of search query results, make object relative to each other carry out rank.In addition, can generate and be used to show code with score object on certain threshold value, this code uses for example distinguishing font, color or figure (for example, " star " icon) visually to distinguish or annotation object, perhaps presents object in the form of " recommendation ".Can also use (440) rank to determine which classification which object is put into, wherein classification all in this way " focus community ", " recommend paste " or be placed on the BBBS (Bulletin Board System)BS.The object that rank is forward, in other words, the object of rank before certain rank can be designated as and be included in this kind.Therefore, the same object that rank is forward is assigned to the user.
