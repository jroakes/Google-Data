Definitions
- the field generally relates to displaying geometric models.
- Conventional systems allow a user to download geometric models from a web server and display images of those models on a client device. Typically, those images are organized according to query types, such as “UNESCO sites”, “museums” and “sport venues,” to name a few.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a distributed system environment 100 capable of generating geometric model sets from criteria selected by a user.
- Distributed system environment 100 includes one or more networks 102 , clients 104 , web servers 106 , and geometric model warehouses 110 .
- Network 102 may be any network or combination of networks that can carry data communication. Such a network 102 may include, but is not limited to, a local area network, metropolitan area network, and/or wide area network such as the Internet. Network 102 can support protocols and technology including, but not limited to, World Wide Web protocols and/or services. Intermediate web servers, gateways, or other servers may be provided between components of the system shown in FIG. 1 , depending upon a particular application or environment.
- Web server 106 is a computing device or an application executing on a computing device that helps deliver resources 120 , such as websites 118 to clients 104 .
- Website 118 may include one or more resources 120 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more web servers 106 .
- An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- a resource 120 is any data that can be provided over network 102 .
- Resource 120 is identified by a resource address that is associated with resource 120 .
- Resources 120 include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few.
- Resources 120 can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- Resources 120 may also include images of geometric models 111 stored in geometric model warehouse 110 , as described herein.
- Client 104 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user 108 and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 120 over network 102 .
- Example clients 104 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, (e.g., smartphones, tablet computing devices, notebooks), set-top boxes, game-console embedded systems, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- Client 104 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser that facilitates the sending and receiving of data and resources 120 over network 102 .
- Geometric models 111 are images or other two dimensional representations of various real-world objects.
- geometric models 111 may be associated with a geographic location in the real world.
- geometric models 111 may be 3D representations of buildings, bridges, monuments, signs, landmarks, etc., to name only a few.
- Such geometric models 111 may be created by a third-party data provider or user 108 .
- User 108 can generate geometric models 111 using 3D modeling software applications.
- user 108 can download geometric model 111 from web server 106 and use the 3D modeling software application to modify or create a new image of geometric model 111 .
- geometric model 111 includes various attributes. Those attributes may include, but are not limited to, an author of the model, geographic region of the model, popularity score of the model, architectural style, structural similarity to other geometric models 111 , etc.
- Geometric models 111 are stored in geometric storage warehouse 110 .
- Geometric model warehouse 110 can reside on web server 106 or another computing device that communicates with web server 106 using network 102 .
- Geometric model warehouse 110 includes a geometric model storage 112 , a model selector 114 and a popularity module 116 .
- Geometric model storage 112 stores geometric models 111 and their attributes.
- client 104 submits a request to geometric model warehouse 110 .
- geometric model warehouse 110 retrieves geometric models 111 from geometric model storage 112 and sends a response message to client 104 that includes geometric models 111 .
- geometric model warehouses that include selection criteria and geometric model warehouses return geometric models in response to those selection criteria. For example, if a user requests a geometric model of a “bridge”, geometric model warehouse returns a response message that includes geometric models of different types of bridges stored. The user does not have an ability to request other geometric models that are within the vicinity of the bridge or landmarks that have a similar shape to the bridge, but may or may not be an actual bridge, or bridges that are similar in shape to the selected bridge.
- geometric models 111 can be received by user 108 that are related to each other based on the selected criteria and the particular geometric model 111 .
- Example selection criteria for geometric models 111 may include an author, geographic location, nearby models, similar shapes, similar architecture and similar popularity, to name only a few.
- User 108 communicates with geometric model warehouse 110 through websites 118 hosted on web server 106 .
- user 108 connects to website 118 , user selects a focal model 111 a and the criteria for focal model 111 a.
- the browser then sends a message that includes focal model 111 a and the selected criteria to geometric model database 110 .
- Focal model 111 a is geometric model 111 for which user 108 selects criteria.
- Model selector 114 generates geometric model sets based on focal model 111 a and the selected criteria received from user 108 . Each criterion corresponds to one or more attributes that are associated with focal model 111 a. Model selector 114 scans through the attributes of geometric models 111 stored in geometric model storage 112 and determines geometric models sets that are related to focal model 111 a according to the selected criteria. For example, user 108 may request geometric model sets for focal model 111 a based on selected criteria, such as “nearby models” and “similar shapes.” Model selector 114 then determines a geometric model set that includes geometric models 111 that are near to focal model 111 a and another geometric model set that includes geometric models 111 that have a similar shape to focal model 111 a.
- Model selector 114 may also determine geometric model sets from each geometric model 111 identified in geometric model sets based on “nearby models” or “similar shapes” or both.
- Model selector 114 may generate a geometric model set that includes geometric models 111 that are near to the pyramid at the Louver Museum, such as, for example, an Eiffel Tower. Model selector 114 may generate another geometric model set that includes geometric models 111 that are similar in shape to the pyramid at the Louver Museum, such as, for example, a pyramid at Giza in Cairo, Egypt.
- Model selector 114 may also generate additional geometric model sets that are based on geometric models 111 included in the generated geometric model sets and the selected criteria. For example, model selector 114 may generate a geometric model set that includes a geometric model of the Sphinx in Cairo, Egypt, by selecting the “nearby model” criterion and the geometric model of the pyramid at Giza. In another example, model selector 114 may generate a geometric model set that includes a geometric model of the Empire State Building in New York, USA, by selecting the “similar shapes” criterion and the geometric model of the Eiffel Tower.
- Popularity module 116 determines popularity of each geometric model 111 .
- Popularity module 116 may determine the popularity of each geometric model 111 based on the input of user 108 . For example, popularity module 116 tracks a number of views, downloads, clicks that users 108 make for a particular geometric model 111 .
- Popularity module 116 may retrieve the above data by scanning the log files produced by geometric module warehouse 110 when users 108 request geometric models 111 .
- Popularity module 116 then compiles the scanned data off-line and generates a popularity score.
- the popularity score may be stored in the popularity attribute associated with each geometric model 111 .
- geometric models 111 that have a high popularity score are geometric models 111 that are often queried and are typically geometric models 111 that are interesting to the user.
- model selector 114 When model selector 114 generates geometric model sets, model selector 114 accesses the popularity attribute and ranks geometric models 111 in each geometric model set according to the value of the popularity attribute. In one embodiment, geometric models 111 in each geometric model set are sent to user 108 if they have a popularity score above a predefined threshold.
- model selector 114 when model selector 114 generates additional geometric model sets based on geometric models 111 in the generated geometric model sets and the selected criteria, model selector 114 also generates the additional geometric model sets based on the popularity score. For example, model selector 114 may retrieve the popularity score from the popularity attribute associated with each geometric model 111 in the generated geometric model set, rank geometric models 111 according to their popularity scores and recursively apply the selection criteria to geometric models 111 in the order based on the ranked popularity score. This allows model selector 114 to generate additional geometric model sets that are relevant to each other and include geometric models 111 that are interesting to the user.

A two-dimensional (2D) representation of a three dimensional (3D) geometric model and first and second criteria for the 3D geometric model selected by a user are provided to a geometric model warehouse. The geometric model warehouse determines a first set of 3D geometric models related to the 3D geometric model, based on the first criteria. The geometric model warehouse also determines a second set of 3D geometric models related to the 3D geometric model based on the second criteria. The geometric model warehouse sends the determined first and second sets of 3D geometric models for display to a client device.
Description
- 1. Field
- The field generally relates to displaying geometric models.
- 2. Background Art
- The emergence and development of computer networks and protocols, such as the Internet and the World Wide Web (or simply “web” or “Web”), allows users to use their computing devices to connect to servers and download, upload, share and display resources using their own computers. For example, users can upload images that include three dimensional (3D) geometric models of cities, towns, historic landmarks, buildings, bridges, transportation vehicles, etc., around the world. Such geometric models allow users to view historic landmarks and building around the world from their computer.
- Conventional systems allow a user to download geometric models from a web server and display images of those models on a client device. Typically, those images are organized according to query types, such as “UNESCO sites”, “museums” and “sport venues,” to name a few. However, conventional systems do not allow a user to select geometric models based on multiple criteria that may enhance a number of geometric models available to the user.
- A system, computer-implemented method, and computer-readable medium for browsing geometric models are provided. A two-dimensional (2D) representation of a three dimensional (3D) geometric model and first and second criteria for the 3D geometric model selected by a user are provided to a geometric model warehouse. The geometric model warehouse determines a first set of 3D geometric models related to the 3D geometric model, based on the first criteria. The geometric model warehouse also determines a second set of 3D geometric models related to the 3D geometric model based on the second criteria. The geometric model warehouse sends the determined first and second sets of 3D geometric models for display to a client device.

Web server 106 is a computing device or an application executing on a computing device that helps deliverresources 120, such aswebsites 118 toclients 104.Website 118 may include one ormore resources 120 associated with a domain name and hosted by one ormore web servers 106. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. - A
resource 120 is any data that can be provided overnetwork 102.Resource 120 is identified by a resource address that is associated withresource 120.Resources 120 include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name only a few.Resources 120 can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).Resources 120 may also include images ofgeometric models 111 stored in geometric model warehouse 110, as described herein. -
Client 104 is an electronic device that is under the control of auser 108 and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 120 overnetwork 102.Example clients 104 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, (e.g., smartphones, tablet computing devices, notebooks), set-top boxes, game-console embedded systems, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102.Client 104 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser that facilitates the sending and receiving of data andresources 120 overnetwork 102. -
Geometric models 111 are images or other two dimensional representations of various real-world objects. In an embodiment,geometric models 111 may be associated with a geographic location in the real world. Example,geometric models 111 may be 3D representations of buildings, bridges, monuments, signs, landmarks, etc., to name only a few. - Such
geometric models 111 may be created by a third-party data provider oruser 108.User 108 can generategeometric models 111 using 3D modeling software applications. In another example,user 108 can downloadgeometric model 111 fromweb server 106 and use the 3D modeling software application to modify or create a new image ofgeometric model 111. - In addition to an image,
geometric model 111 includes various attributes. Those attributes may include, but are not limited to, an author of the model, geographic region of the model, popularity score of the model, architectural style, structural similarity to othergeometric models 111, etc. -
Geometric models 111 are stored in geometric storage warehouse 110. Geometric model warehouse 110 can reside onweb server 106 or another computing device that communicates withweb server 106 usingnetwork 102. - Geometric model warehouse 110 includes a geometric model storage 112, a
model selector 114 and apopularity module 116. Geometric model storage 112 storesgeometric models 111 and their attributes. Whenuser 108 requestsgeometric models 111 using a browser onclient 104,client 104 submits a request to geometric model warehouse 110. In response, geometric model warehouse 110 retrievesgeometric models 111 from geometric model storage 112 and sends a response message toclient 104 that includesgeometric models 111. - In conventional systems, users submit requests to geometric model warehouses that include selection criteria and geometric model warehouses return geometric models in response to those selection criteria. For example, if a user requests a geometric model of a “bridge”, geometric model warehouse returns a response message that includes geometric models of different types of bridges stored. The user does not have an ability to request other geometric models that are within the vicinity of the bridge or landmarks that have a similar shape to the bridge, but may or may not be an actual bridge, or bridges that are similar in shape to the selected bridge.
- Unlike conventional systems, when
users 108 requestgeometric models 111 based on a particulargeometric model 111 and multiple selection criteria,user 108 can receivegeometric models 111 that are related to each other based on the selected criteria and the particulargeometric model 111. Example selection criteria forgeometric models 111 may include an author, geographic location, nearby models, similar shapes, similar architecture and similar popularity, to name only a few. -
User 108 communicates with geometric model warehouse 110 throughwebsites 118 hosted onweb server 106. Whenuser 108 connects towebsite 118, user selects afocal model 111 a and the criteria forfocal model 111 a. The browser then sends a message that includesfocal model 111 a and the selected criteria to geometric model database 110.Focal model 111 a isgeometric model 111 for whichuser 108 selects criteria. -
Model selector 114 generates geometric model sets based onfocal model 111 a and the selected criteria received fromuser 108. Each criterion corresponds to one or more attributes that are associated withfocal model 111 a.Model selector 114 scans through the attributes ofgeometric models 111 stored in geometric model storage 112 and determines geometric models sets that are related tofocal model 111 a according to the selected criteria. For example,user 108 may request geometric model sets forfocal model 111 a based on selected criteria, such as “nearby models” and “similar shapes.”Model selector 114 then determines a geometric model set that includesgeometric models 111 that are near tofocal model 111 a and another geometric model set that includesgeometric models 111 that have a similar shape tofocal model 111 a. -
Model selector 114 may also determine geometric model sets from eachgeometric model 111 identified in geometric model sets based on “nearby models” or “similar shapes” or both. - For example, when
user 108 selects criteria such as “nearby models” and “similar shapes” for a geometric model of a pyramid at the Louver Museum in Paris, France,user 108 may receive several geometric model sets.Model selector 114 may generate a geometric model set that includesgeometric models 111 that are near to the pyramid at the Louver Museum, such as, for example, an Eiffel Tower.Model selector 114 may generate another geometric model set that includesgeometric models 111 that are similar in shape to the pyramid at the Louver Museum, such as, for example, a pyramid at Giza in Cairo, Egypt. -
Model selector 114 may also generate additional geometric model sets that are based ongeometric models 111 included in the generated geometric model sets and the selected criteria. For example,model selector 114 may generate a geometric model set that includes a geometric model of the Sphinx in Cairo, Egypt, by selecting the “nearby model” criterion and the geometric model of the pyramid at Giza. In another example,model selector 114 may generate a geometric model set that includes a geometric model of the Empire State Building in New York, USA, by selecting the “similar shapes” criterion and the geometric model of the Eiffel Tower. -
Popularity module 116 determines popularity of eachgeometric model 111.Popularity module 116 may determine the popularity of eachgeometric model 111 based on the input ofuser 108. For example,popularity module 116 tracks a number of views, downloads, clicks thatusers 108 make for a particulargeometric model 111.Popularity module 116 may retrieve the above data by scanning the log files produced by geometric module warehouse 110 whenusers 108 requestgeometric models 111.Popularity module 116 then compiles the scanned data off-line and generates a popularity score. The popularity score may be stored in the popularity attribute associated with eachgeometric model 111. A person skilled in the art will appreciate thatgeometric models 111 that have a high popularity score aregeometric models 111 that are often queried and are typicallygeometric models 111 that are interesting to the user. - When
model selector 114 generates geometric model sets,model selector 114 accesses the popularity attribute and ranksgeometric models 111 in each geometric model set according to the value of the popularity attribute. In one embodiment,geometric models 111 in each geometric model set are sent touser 108 if they have a popularity score above a predefined threshold. - In another embodiment, when
model selector 114 generates additional geometric model sets based ongeometric models 111 in the generated geometric model sets and the selected criteria,model selector 114 also generates the additional geometric model sets based on the popularity score. For example,model selector 114 may retrieve the popularity score from the popularity attribute associated with eachgeometric model 111 in the generated geometric model set, rankgeometric models 111 according to their popularity scores and recursively apply the selection criteria togeometric models 111 in the order based on the ranked popularity score. This allowsmodel selector 114 to generate additional geometric model sets that are relevant to each other and includegeometric models 111 that are interesting to the user. - After
model selector 114 completes generating geometric model sets,web server 106 sends the generated geometric model sets toclient 104. -
Client 104 displays geometric model sets touser 108. For example,client 104 uses browser to display geometric model sets as an interactive webpage.FIG. 2A is a block diagram of anexemplary embodiment 200 of geometric model sets being displayed touser 108. - Block diagram 200 may be a webpage that displays
geometric models 111 around thex-y axis 202.Focal model 111 a may be included in the positive quadrant of the x-y axis. Geometric model sets may be displayed as geometric model set 206 and geometric models set 208. Geometric model set 206 may correspond togeometric models 111 that geometric model warehouse 110 selected based on the first criteria selected byuser 108. Geometric model set 206 may be displayed along the x-axis, as shown inFIG. 2A . Geometric model set 208 may correspond togeometric models 111 that geometric model warehouse 110 selected based on the second criteria selected byuser 108. Geometric model set 208 may be displayed along the y-axis, as shown inFIG. 2A . -
Selection menu 204 is a selection menu of the criteria thatuser 108 may choose to retrieve geometric model sets. Selection criteria may correspond to the attributes ofgeometric models 111 stored in geometric model warehouse 110.Selection menu 204 may beselection menu 204 x that corresponds to selection criteria used to retrieve geometric model set 206, orselection menu 204 y that corresponds to selection criteria used to retrieve geometric model set 208. -
Geometric models 111 in geometric model sets 206 and 208 may be displayed according to their popularity. For example,geometric models 111 that have a more popular score may be displayed beforegeometric models 111 that have a less popular score. -
User 108 may navigate and browse through geometric model sets 206 and 208. In one example,user 108 may use a mouse, a keyboard or a touch display to scroll through geometric model sets 206 and 208. Asuser 108 scrolls throughgeometric models 111,client 104 displays newgeometric models 111 as oldgeometric models 111 disappear from view. Geometric model sets 206 and 208 may link the first and last geometric model in the respective geometric model sets, such that whenuser 108 scrolls to the lastgeometric model 111 in the geometric model set, it is followed by the firstgeometric model 111 in the same geometric model set. This feature, allowsuser 108 to scroll infinitely through geometric model sets 206 and 208 and havegeometric models 111 repeat whenuser 108 scrolls through the entire geometric model set. - A webpage may also display geometric model sets that are related to
geometric model 111 in a different set (not shown inFIG. 2A ). Those geometric model sets may be below or to the one side to the relatedgeometric model 111. Moreover, those geometric model sets may be related togeometric model 111 according to first or second selection criteria, or both. -
User 108 may select a differentfocal model 111 a from geometric model sets 206 and 208. To select a newfocal model 111 a,user 108 may selectgeometric model 111 from geometric model set 206 or 208 and drag the selectedgeometric model 111 to the location of the positive quadrant of the x-y axis. In one embodiment, when browser determines that a newfocal model 111 a is selected, the browser may causeclient 104 to send a message toweb server 106 with a request to generate new geometric model sets 206 and 208. In another embodiment,client 104 may send a request to geometric model warehouse 110 afteruser 108 presses a search button (not shown) or has modified the selection criteria inselection menus -
