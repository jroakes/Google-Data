Definitions
- This document relates to interpreting search queries.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, including video or audio files, web pages for particular topics, maps, address information, directions and news articles.
- a search system can identify resources in response to a text query that includes one or more search terms or phrases.
- the search system typically ranks the resources based on their relevance to the query and on measures of quality of the resources and provides search results that link to the identified resources.
- the search results are typically ordered for viewing according to the rank.
- Some search systems can be used in conjunction with an online map. For example, some search systems can receive search queries for an address or a location and display the search results on an online map.
- the online map can display the geographical information associated with the search results in varying levels of granularity that range, for example, from street-level to state-level to country-level. In some cases, the online map can display the geographical information associated with the search result on a continental map or world map.
- This specification describes technologies relating to interpreting search queries.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that receives a search query.
- the method also selects a disambiguated interpretation of the search query based on analysis of stored search queries and analysis of stored responses of users having a similar characteristic as the user that initiated the search query.
- the method also provides a set of the search results. The set is selected based on the disambiguated interpretation of the search query.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- the stored search queries can include less ambiguous search queries that include at least a portion of the search query.
- the less ambiguous search queries can include at least one of search queries having a greater number of search terms than the search query or search queries having geographic information.
- the stored responses can include at least one of a refined search query received in response to a previously presented search result, wherein the previously presented search result was in response to a stored search query, or a user interaction with the previously presented search result.
- the user interaction with the previously presented search result can include at least one of a user click or a mouse over.
- the similar characteristic can include a geographic location from which the search query originated.
- the search query can include a query for a search result in a particular location.
- the set of search results can include search results that are responsive to the disambiguated interpretation of the search query.
- Search queries that are ambiguous or under-specified can be interpreted and a search result likely matching the user's intended search query can be provided.
- ambiguous search queries that typically yield search results located in geographically distant locations can be resolved such that intended search results can be displayed on an online map having high granularity of detail (e.g, a town or neighborhood of a city).
- the number of irrelevant search results can be reduced and different types of user interfaces can be provided to a user based on the search results likely matching the user's intended search query.
- the search results likely matching the user's intended search query are hotels
- a user interface that includes reservation information and price information can be provided, but if the search results include hotels and restaurants, the user interface that includes reservation information and price information would not be displayed to the user.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which a search system interprets search queries.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an example process for interpreting search results.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example histogram of similar search queries.
- a search system receives a search query from a user device.
- the search query is analyzed to determine whether the search query is ambiguous or is underspecified.
- the search system can determine the user's intended search query by analyzing previously received search queries that are similar to the search query and by analyzing geographical information associated with the user device.
- the search system can also determine the user's intended search query by analyzing stored user responses associated with the previously received search queries.
- the search system filters the set of search results and provides the search results that are relevant to the disambiguated search query.
- the systems discussed here may provide one or more mechanisms for collecting information about users. Users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs that may collect personalized information.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personal data is removed. Data can also be aggregated or filtered to remove some or all personal data.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which a search system interprets search queries.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , a user device 104 , a search system 106 , a search interpreter 108 , and a database of stored search queries 110 .
- FIG. 1 illustrates a single user device 102 , multiple user devices 102 can be included in the environment 100 .
- the network 102 can be any type of network such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 facilitates connectivity between the user device 104 , the search system 106 and the search interpreter 108 .
- the user device 104 can be any type of device capable of accessing the network 102 .
- the user device 104 can be a computer, a laptop, a tablet computer or a smart phone.
- the user device 104 can be used to transmit search queries 112 to the search system 106 and receive search results 114 from the search system 106 .
- the user device 104 can display the search results 114 and allow a user to interact with the search results 114 . For example, a user can click on a search result, perform another search query that refines a previous search query, mouse over a search result, etc.
- the user device 104 can monitor the user responses to the search results 114 and provide the user responses to the search system 106 .
- Various technologies to monitor the user responses can be used, e.g., using cookies to store and provide data regarding prior searches or selections, tracking user interactions throughout a search session, or using scripts to report user actions to a server.
- the user device 104 can display the search results on an online map.
- the search queries 112 can be queries for destinations (i.e., a geographical search query).
- a geographical search query can be a query for a particular location(s)/destination(s) (e.g., a specific restaurant(s), a specific store(s), a specific park, and/or an address), or a query for location(s)/destination(s) in a particular geographic area (e.g., a neighborhood, town, county, etc.).
- the geographical search query is generated in connection with an online mapping utility.
- the search queries 112 can be ambiguous.
- An ambiguous search query 112 can have a value that potentially produces one or more unrelated or otherwise diverse search results (e.g., search results that are geographically diverse or having divergent category associations).
- a search query 112 can have a value equal to “Lahore,” which can correspond to either a restaurant in San Francisco, Calif. or a city in Pakistan.
- An ambiguous search query can be ambiguous because it does not include additional terms or details that would disambiguate the search query (e.g., an underspecified search query). For example, search queries such as “Lahore, Pakistan” or “Lahore restaurant San Francisco” would disambiguate the search query “Lahore” because the user's intended search is discernible from the contents of the search query 112 .
- the search query 112 can include information associated with the location of the user device 106 .
- an IP address and geographical data associated with the IP address can be transmitted with the search query 112 .
- a user may choose to include geographical information in the search query 112 .
- the user can choose to provide GPS coordinates or other location identifying information associated with the user and/or the user device 104 (e.g., cellular tower information associated with the user device 104 ).
- the search query can include information associated with an online map or other resource that is being displayed on the user device 106 .
- the search query can include information identifying mid-town Manhattan as the location from which the search query originated.
- the search system 106 includes a plurality of servers located in various geographical locations and is configured to receive search queries 112 from the user device 104 and to return search results 114 to the user device 104 .
- the search system 106 can access indexes storing data related to the resources and/or databases that include data associated with the resources (e.g., address information, business category information, etc.) and identify the resources that are predicted to be relevant to the search query 112 .
- Various algorithms can be used to determine the relevance score.
- each of the search results can include information describing the search result 114 , such as address information, phone number, and/or categorical information (e.g., grocery store, restaurant, theater, city, place of interest, etc.).
- the search results 114 are ordered such that the first search result is the most relevant search result and the second search result is determined to be the second most relevant search result.
- the search system 106 can also receive information associated a user's response(s) to the set of search results 114 .
- the search system 106 can receive information associated with the particular search results a user clicked on or otherwise interacted with (e.g., a mouse over).
- the search system 106 can receive information such as a refined search query performed by a user in response to previously presented search results.
- a user can receive a set of search results that are responsive to a first search query, inspect the search results and provide a refined search query that includes further details related to the first search query, e.g., additional terms related to the query or geographical information.
- the search system 106 can receive the refined search query and the user's response to the resulting search results.
- the search system 106 can store the search queries 112 in a database of stored search queries 110 .
- the database 110 can be any type of database and/or memory that can store the search queries 112 .
- the search system 106 can also store the user responses associated with stored search queries 112 in the database of stored user responses 110 .
- the search system 106 can provide the search query 112 and the search results 114 to the search interpreter 108 to determine whether the search query 112 is ambiguous.
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze the address information associated with each of the search results 114 and determine whether the search results 114 are located in geographic areas that are separated by a large distance. For example, the search interpreter 108 can determine that the first search result is located in Sydney, Australia and the second search result is located in South America. In addition, the search interpreter 108 can compare the distance between two search results to a predetermined threshold (e.g., 100 miles) to determine whether the search query 112 is ambiguous.
- a predetermined threshold e.g. 100 miles
- the search interpreter 108 can determine that the search query 112 is ambiguous by analyzing the categorical information associated with the set of search results. For example, if the first search result is associated with the restaurant category and the second search result is associated with the city category, then the search interpreter 108 can determine that the search query is ambiguous. In some implementations, the search interpreter 108 analyzes the address and/or categorical information associated with several of the search results to determine whether the search query 112 is ambiguous.
- the search interpreter 108 can access the database of stored search queries 110 and identify prior search queries that are similar to the search query 112 (i.e., “set of similar search queries”).
- a prior search query can be similar to the search query 112 if it includes all or part of the search query 112 .
- the search interpreter 108 can receive a search query 112 that is equal to “Coles” and determine that prior search queries that include Coles as a prefix (e.g. “Coles, Sydney”) and/or Coles as a suffix (e.g., “Sydney, Coles”) are similar to the search query 112 .
- the search interpreter 108 can determine a previous search query is similar to the search query 112 if the search query is a subset of the previous search query and/or a substring of the previous search query. For example, “Disney park” is a subset of the phrase “Disney World Theme Park” and “Disney World” is a substring of “Disney World Theme Park.”
- the search system 106 can correct or make adjustments for spelling errors in either the search query 112 and/or the previous search queries.
- the search interpreter 108 can change the stem of each word in either the search query 112 and/or previous search queries. The search interpreter 108 can include these modified search queries in the set of similar search queries.
- search interpreter 108 can reduce the set of similar search queries to include only the previous search queries that originated in the same location as the search query 112 . For example, if the search query 112 includes geographical information indicating the user device 104 is located in San Francisco, Calif., the search interpreter 108 can limit the set of similar search queries to include only similar search queries that originated in San Francisco or within a predetermined distance away from San Francisco (e.g., within a 25 mile radius).
- the search interpreter 108 can disambiguate the ambiguous or under-specified search query 112 .
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze the set of similar search queries and generate histogram data based on the set of similar search queries.
- the generation of histograms can be performed offline, rather than in real time, although real time analysis of at least some information associated with stored user responses is possible.
- the search interpreter 108 collects and processes the information represented by the histogram (e.g., frequencies of search queries or a number of search queries over a particular time period) but does not generate a graph.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example histogram of similar search queries 300 .
- the search query is equal to “Disney” and the histogram 300 includes groupings for search queries originating from the same location as the search query “Disney” (e.g., Cleveland, Ohio).
- Grouping 302 represents the number of search queries for “Disney World Florida.”
- Grouping 304 represents the number of search queries for “Disney Cruises.”
- Grouping 306 represents the number of search queries for “EuroDisney.”
- Grouping 308 represents the number of search queries for “Anaheim Disneyland.”
- grouping 302 includes twenty search queries having the form “Disney World Florida.” Each grouping is associated with a search query count that represents the number of search queries in each grouping.
- the search interpreter 108 can use the histogram data to determine the user's intended search query by determining which grouping includes the largest number of search queries.
- the search interpreter 108 can identify the grouping with the greatest number of search queries as the intended search query and return search results that are relevant to that grouping. For example, referring to FIG. 3 , the search interpreter 108 can determine that grouping 302 a is the disambiguated search query because it contains the largest number of search queries and return search results relevant to the search query “Disney World Florida.”
- search interpreter 108 determined that the search query “Disney” should be interpreted to be “Disney World Florida,” if the search query “Disney” originated in location other than Cleveland, the search interpreter 108 could return a different result because the set of similar search queries could be different. For example, if the search query “Disney” originated from Los Angeles, Calif., the set of similar search queries could be different from those illustrated in FIG. 3 and the search interpreter 108 could interpret the search query to be another search query, such as “Disneyland.”
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze the stored user responses associated with the prior search queries in each of the groupings to interpret the ambiguous search query. For example, the search interpreter 108 can analyze the user responses associated with each search query in a grouping and determine whether the user responses provide an indication that the user was satisfied with the search results. For example, if a user clicked on one of the previous search results and did not return to the set of search results, the search interpreter 108 can determine that the user was satisfied with the search result.
- An example user response that indicates the user is not satisfied with the search results includes situations where the user clicks on a search result, returns to the search result page and then clicks on a second search result.
- a second example user response that can indicate user dissatisfaction is if the user performs a refined search query after receiving the set of search results.
- the search interpreter 108 can identify the grouping with the largest number of search queries that has no indications that the users were not satisfied with the search results as the user's intended search query (i.e., the disambiguated search query).
- this analysis is performed offline, rather than in real time, although real time analysis of at least some information associated with stored user responses is possible.
- the search interpreter 108 uses the histogram analysis in combination with other information to determine the user's intended search query. For example, the search interpreter 108 can use the histogram analysis in combination with user activity (e.g., the user's earlier search queries transmitted during the same session) to determine the user's intended search query. In some implementations, the histogram analysis can be used in combination with search metrics, such as the number of relevant websites/references.
- the search interpreter 108 can ignore the histogram analysis and choose the second interpretation because of the number of relevant web sites/references.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an example process 200 for interpreting search queries.
- the process 200 begins by receiving a search query 112 (at 202 ).
- a search query 112 can be transmitted from the user device 104 to the search system 106 .
- the search query 112 can be a search query for a particular location(s)/destination(s) (e.g., a specific restaurant(s), a specific store(s), a specific park, and/or an address), or a search query for location(s)/destination(s) in a particular geographic area (e.g., a neighborhood, town, county, etc.).
- a particular location(s)/destination(s) e.g., a specific restaurant(s), a specific store(s), a specific park, and/or an address
- a search query for location(s)/destination(s) in a particular geographic area e.g., a neighborhood, town, county, etc.
- a search is performed based on the search query 112 .
- the search system 106 can access indexes representing resources and/or databases that store data related to the resources.
- the search results are ordered such that the first search result is the most relevant search result and the second search result is determined to the second most relevant search result.
- Each search result can include information describing the search result, such as address information, phone number, and/or categorical information (e.g., grocery store, restaurant, theater, city, place of interest, etc.).
- the search system 106 can provide the search query and the search results to the search interpreter 108 .
- the search results are analyzed to determine whether the search query 112 is ambiguous.
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze the address information associated with the first search result and the second search result (i.e., the two most relevant search results) and determine whether the distance between the two addresses is greater than a predetermined threshold. If the distance is greater than the predetermined threshold, the search system 106 determines that the search results are not located in the same geographic area/region and that the search query 112 is ambiguous.
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze the other information associated with the search results, such as the business category information, and determine whether the search query is ambiguous. For example, the search interpreter 108 can compare the category information associated with two search results.
- the search system 106 can determine that the search query 112 is ambiguous.
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze address information and/or category information associated with all of the search results to determine whether the search query is ambiguous.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a particular set of steps to interpret search queries, the order of these steps can be modified.
- the ambiguity of the search query can be determined before or in parallel with retrieving the set of search results. For example, ambiguous search queries can be identified in memory based on an off-line analysis of stored search queries and user responses before the search query and the search results are provided to the search interpreter 108 . As a result, the disambiguity of the search query can be incorporated into the generation of search results at 204 .
- the search results are returned (at 218 ). For example, if the search system 106 determined that the search query 112 is not ambiguous, the search system 106 can provide the set of search results 114 to the user device 106 . The user device 106 can display the search results 114 to the user. In some implementations, the user device 106 presents the search results on an online and/or interactive map.
- the database of stored search queries 110 is analyzed to identify previous search queries that are similar to the search query 112 (at 210 ).
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze the database 110 and identify the set of similar search queries.
- the set of similar search queries includes previous search queries that include all or part of the search query 112 .
- the geographical information associated with the search query 112 is analyzed (at 212 ).
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze the geographical information associated with the search query 112 and determine the location of the user device 106 at the time the search query 112 was sent, a default location (e.g., home location) of a user associated with the user device 106 , or a geographical area associated with recent searches or other web activity on the user device 106 (e.g., a location being displayed on an online map).
- the search interpreter 108 can filter the set of similar search queries to include only the previous search queries that originated from the same geographic region as the search query 112 (or that were otherwise interpreted as being associated with the same geographic region as the current query).
- the search interpreter 108 can limit the set of similar search queries to include only previous search queries that originated in the same city and/or nearby cities as the search query 112 and/or within a predetermined distance from the user device 106 .
- the search query 112 is disambiguated (at 214 ).
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze the set of similar search queries and generate histogram data based on the set of similar search queries.
- the grouping of the histograms can be based the previous search queries.
- the search interpreter 108 can identify the grouping with the largest number of search queries and identify the grouping as the disambiguated search query.
- the search interpreter 108 generates the histogram data offline.
- the data represented by the histogram is generated but is not graphed.
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze the stored user responses that are associated with the previous search queries included in the groupings and determine whether the user responses provide an indication that the user was dissatisfied with the search results.
- the histogram data can include a search query count for each grouping and include a count of users that were not satisfied with the search results associated with each grouping (i.e., “a dissatisfaction count”)
- each type of user response that indicates that the user was dissatisfied with the search results can be counted differently.
- a refined search query can be equal to a full count (e.g., 1) but a mouse over a search result followed by a click on a different search result can be equal to a half count (e.g., 0.5).
- the dissatisfaction count can include subcounts that reflect the different types of user responses associated with the grouping (e.g., failure of a user to select any of the search results, user exploration of numerous presented search results without spending significant time on any of the search results, receipt of a refined search query after the user is presented with the search results, or determining that the user scrolled through multiple pages of presented search results).
- Various counting methods can be used.
- the search interpreter 108 can identify the grouping with the largest search query count and that does not include a significant dissatisfaction count as the disambiguated search query. In some implementations, the search interpreter 108 can identify the grouping with a score indicative of a combined largest search query count and the lowest dissatisfaction count penalty (e.g., where search query count is given a positive score and the dissatisfaction count is given a negative score) as the disambiguated search query. In some implementations, the search interpreter 108 can examine the subcounts associated with the dissatisfaction count and select, for example, the grouping that includes the highest combined score with positive scores assigned to the search query count and negative scores assigned to search queries that are followed by refined search queries. Other techniques for evaluating search query counts and dissatisfaction counts can also be used.
- the set of search results is filtered to remove search results that are not relevant to the disambiguated search query.
- the search interpreter 108 can remove search results that are not relevant to the grouping that was identified to be the disambiguated search query.
- the filtered search results are then provided to the user device 106 (at 218 ).
- the search interpreter 108 and/or the search system 106 can provide the filtered search results to the user device 106 , which can then display the search results on an interactive/online map.
- a user device 104 located in Sydney, Australia, can transmit a search query 112 equal to “Coles” to the search system 106 .
- the search system 106 can perform a search for “Coles” and provide the search results to the search interpreter 108 .
- the search interpreter 108 can analyze the search results and determine that the search query “Coles” is ambiguous because some of the search results are located in Sydney, Australia and some of the search results are located approximately 800 miles from Sydney.
- the search interpreter 108 can also determine that the search query is ambiguous because the category information associated with the some of the search results are related to a business and others are related to a city.
- the search interpreter 108 can then analyze the database of stored search queries 110 to identify previous search queries that are similar to “Coles.”
- the set of similar search queries can include search queries such as “Coles County Illinois,” “Coles Group,” “Coles Bookstore,” “Coles Supermarkets,” “Coles Groceries,” “Coles, SA” and “Coles Australia.”
- the search interpreter 108 can filter the set of similar search queries to include only the similar search queries that originated in or within a 25 mile radius of the user device 102 (i.e., Sydney, Australia).
- the search interpreter 108 can create a histogram based on the set of similar search queries, which in some cases can include the stored user responses associated with the set of similar search queries to disambiguate the search query.
- the search interpreter 108 can select “Coles Supermarket” as the disambiguated search query. The search interpreter 108 can then provide the search results responsive “Coles Supermarket” to the user device 102 . If the user device 102 had been located in South Australia, the histogram data could have revealed a strong tendency that the search query should be interpreted to be “Coles, SA.”

- mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, or optical disks.
- a computer need not have such devices.
- a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few.
- Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto optical disks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks.
- the processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer.
- a display device e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor
- keyboard and a pointing device e.g., a mouse or a trackball
- Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.
- a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components.
- the components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network.
- Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- inter-network e.g., the Internet
- peer-to-peer networks e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks.
- the computing system can include clients and servers.
- a client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.
- a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device).
- client device e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device.
- Data generated at the client device e.g., a result of the user interaction
- the search interpreter 108 can generate histogram data based on the set of similar search queries such that the groupings of the histogram are based on the categorical information associated with the search queries.
- a histogram can include groupings for search queries associated with grocery stores, restaurants, places of interest, etc.
- the search queries can be filtered based on the location from which the search query originated, as described above.
- the search interpreter 108 can disambiguate the set of similar search queries by identifying the grouping with the largest number of search queries as the user's intended search query and filter the search results to include only search queries associated with the categorical information.
