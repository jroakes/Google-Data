Fig. 2 shows the block diagram of the example press service 220 in environment for use.Press service 220 can be embodied as to one or more computer program being for example arranged on by network one or more locational one or more system for computer coupled to each other.
User 202 can communicate by letter with press service 220 by client terminal device 204.For example, client terminal device 204 can be the data processing equipment that is coupled to press service 220 by data communication network 210.Network 210 can comprise for example LAN (Local Area Network) (LAN), wireless network or for example internet of wide area network (WAN).Client terminal device 204 generally includes random access memory (RAM) 206 and processor 208.Client terminal device 204 also comprises for example web browser of software application or other communication softwares conventionally, is beneficial to transmit and receive data by network.
The cluster of the news article of one or more of language is safeguarded in press service 220.Press service 220 can be safeguarded the cluster of multilingual news article, and each cluster comprises uses monolingual article.Also with regard to whom say, press service can be safeguarded with a kind of cluster of news article of language description particular event and with another cluster of the article of another this event of language description.One or more version is also safeguarded in press service 220, and each version is taking corresponding geographic area as target.Each version comprise the news article that generated by press service 220 one or more present, this presents taking geographic area as target and is presented with the language that presents that is suitable for this geographic area.For example, presenting language can be one of official language of geographic area.
User 202 can be to press service 220 submit Queries.In the time of user's 202 submit Query, by network 210, this inquiry is sent to press service 220.Press service 220 searches for to identify the cluster with the news article of match query.Press service 220 is given with the cluster of the news article of match query and is distributed score.Press service 220 return with the cluster of match query in article distribute score.Press service 220 is made response by generating news results to inquiry, this news results is sent to client terminal device 204 for presenting to user 202 by network, for example, present as the news showing in the web browser that will move on client terminal device 204.Each news results identifies the corresponding cluster of news article and is included in one or more article in cluster.The article identifying can be the highest article of score rank for example distributing according to it.
Press service 220 generates and stores the data of the each cluster that characterizes news article.For example, one or more keyword that data can comprise one or more geographic area and be associated with each cluster of news article.Geographic area is the region relevant with the relative media event of news article in cluster, geographic area or the geographic area relevant with one or more entity relating in media event that for example media event occurs.For example for the French team carrying out in Brazil and Dutch team between the cluster of the relevant news article of football match, the geographic area being associated with cluster can comprise France, Holland and Brazilian.Similarly, one or more keyword being associated with cluster be with cluster in the relevant word of the news article media event relevant with it.Can for example make the keyword that rank is the highest to the keyword rank being associated is the keyword that press service is defined as presenting best media event.In some implementations, data also comprise the scope on date, for example, issued betwixt the date range of the news article of the threshold percentage in cluster.In the time that news article is added feeding and determines cluster or removed from given cluster, the data that press service 220 can updating form collection group.
Press service 220 also comprises news translation engine 230 or can communicate by letter with news translation engine 230.One or more cluster in the cluster of safeguarding for press service 220, news translation engine 230 can be selected the news article about the media event relevant with news article in cluster, and this news article is to use the language different from the language that will be included in the cluster in the news results of mark cluster to write.Describe in more detail and select these news articles referring to Fig. 3.In some implementations, press service 220 can be determined the news article that whether comprises other language in one or more news during being included in the news of being safeguarded by press service 220 presents each news results in presenting.For example, the top news that is the part of particular version when generation is now, and press service 220 can also determine whether the news article of the language different language corresponding from version to be included in any news results in the news results that top news presents middle identification.
In order to select the news article with other language, translation news engine 230 can be communicated by letter with translation service 240.Translation service 240 is to provide the service of for example statistical machine translation of the mechanical translation of text from source language to one or more target language.Translation news engine 230 can will for example provide to translation service 240 and from translation service 240 and obtain text to news article or the title mechanical translation to target language with the text of the news article of source language or by the title of the news article of source language and the data that identify target language.Or translation news engine 230 can for example be associated the data of the data of mark target language and mark news article URLs with news article provides to translation service 240.
In some implementations, the user 202 of client terminal device 204 can communicate by letter to obtain by network 210 and translation service 240 mechanical translation of news article.The language of for example, link during the news that, user 202 can select to be included in press service 220 and provides presents to become news to present from source language translation news article by network 210 to translation service 240 requests of transmitting.In addition, news presents can comprise user interface elements, in the time that user 202 selects this user interface elements, this user interface elements make client terminal device 204 from translation service 240 obtain and show the title of for example news article of part of news article, from the fragment of news article or the title of news article with from the translation of the fragment of news article.This amount that can be transferred into the data of client terminal device by restriction reduces required bandwidth.
Fig. 3 is the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure 300 of the news article of other language for selecting the news results that will be included in mark news article cluster.For simplicity, carry out description process 300 with respect to one or more system for computer of one or more position of implementation 300.For example, can carry out process 300 with the press service of for example Fig. 2 of press service 220.
System obtains the data (step 302) of the cluster that characterizes news article from press service.The cluster of news article comprises the article that presents language.The data that obtain comprise the title of one or more keyword being associated with the cluster of news article and one or more geographic area being associated with cluster.Obtained keyword can be carried out to rank and for example place in order, making the keyword of high rank is the keyword that press service is defined as presenting best media event.In some implementations, characterize the data of cluster and also comprise the media event relevant with it with news article in the cluster scope on corresponding date.Cluster can be to be selected for to be included in the cluster of news in presenting.
System can determine the corresponding language in any geographic area in the geographic area being associated from cluster whether with present language different (steps 304).The language corresponding with specific geographical area can be the language that for example (by press service or by user) is associated with geographic area.For example Russian can be associated with one or more geographic area in for example Russia and Ukraine, because Russian is Muscovite official language, although and because the official language of Russian Bu Shi Ukraine has the user of number of thresholds to use Russian or common user that Russian is associated with Ukraine in Ukraine.
If in the corresponding language in the geographic area being associated from cluster without any language with to present language different, system is determined and is not added the cluster (step 306) of any news article through translation to news article.
If the language of any language in the corresponding language in the geographic area being associated from cluster and the news article in cluster is different, system is translated into one or more keyword in the keyword being associated from cluster the different language (step 308) of language of news article in those and cluster.System can the rank based on keyword be selected the keyword that will be translated from obtained keyword.For example, system can obtain the translation higher than each keyword of predetermined threshold rank for rank.Can obtain translation from the translation service 240 of for example Fig. 2 of translation service.
In some implementations, the data of following possibility can be safeguarded or can access needle paired geographic area be identified to system: compared with the news sources in other regions in geographic area from paired, from the news sources in a region in paired geographic area, media event is had to different viewpoints.Can for example generate this data with traditional machine learning techniques.In these implementations, if cluster will be included in during news taking specific geographical area as target presents, system access data are to determine following possibility: with present the news sources of the geographic area taking it as target from news compared with, have the different viewpoint to event from the news sources of any geographic area in the geographic area being associated from cluster.If lower than assign thresholds, system can be determined the translation that is not included in the language corresponding with these geographic areas in cluster for the possibility of any geographic area in geographic area.
System is used through the keyword of translation and is identified the news article (step 310) from the publisher in region.For example, the every kind of language being translated into for keyword, system can generate the search inquiry obtaining according to the translation of the keyword with this language.Then, system can be identified the news article of this language from the Search Results receiving in response to search inquiry.System can receive the Search Results for the each search inquiry generated search inquiry from search service.For example, search service can be the universal search engine that indexed resource is searched for and given a mark.Or search can be the search that press service that the cluster of news article that press service is safeguarded is identified is carried out.Referring to Fig. 4 to using the instantiation procedure of identifying news article according to the search inquiry that obtains of keyword through translation to be described.
System selects to be included in the news article (step 312) in the news results of cluster of mark news article.System based on for example by obtain from it service of Search Results distribute to news article must assign to from identified news article, select news article.In some implementations, if any news article in the news article obtaining in response to particular search query does not have the score of distributing that exceedes predetermined threshold, system is definite does not identify any news article obtaining in response to this search inquiry in news results.
System generates the news results (step 314) of cluster being identified and comprised selected article.For example, news results can identify one or more news article and the selected news article in the cluster that presents language.Then can the news results of mark cluster be sent to client terminal device for presenting to user by network, for example, as will be shown in the part that the news in the web browser of moving presents on client terminal device.
In some implementations, system obtains selected news article to the mechanical translation that presents language from translation service.For example, system can for example provide the data of mark news article to translation service and obtain news article to the mechanical translation that presents language for for example URL of URLs of news article.Or system can provide the text of selected news article the text through translation that presents language to translation service and acquisition.In these implementations, the news results of mark cluster can comprise to the link of the mechanical translation of selected article.Can present this link to mechanical translation by following information, it is translation and this corresponding geographic area of identification sources language from the news article of particular source language that this information is specified it.
In some other implementations, system obtains title to for example article of the part of each selected article or the translation from the text fragments of article.In these implementations, news results can comprise selected article through the title of translation, through the text fragments of translation or through the title of translation with through text fragments the two and the following link of translation, in the time that user selects this link, this link makes request be submitted to translation service to obtain article from source language to the translation that presents language.
In some implementations, when before news results comprises one of selected news article, system determines whether the mechanical translation of each selected news article is mated to the news article in the cluster that has been included in news article fully.If this translation coupling, system is not included in this article in news results.For example, system can compare the title of the news article in title and the cluster of translation of each mechanical translation.If the title of mechanical translation mates the title of the news article in cluster fully, system can compare the text fragments from mechanical translation and the homologous segment of the text from the news article in cluster.If two fragments are mated fully, system determines that two news articles mate fully and avoid this news article to be included in the news results of mark cluster.This not only can strengthen the Search Results of presenting to user is the quality of news results, and can reduce the required storage space of the cluster of storage news article and the news article of cluster can be sent to client terminal device time bandwidth-saving.
By use procedure 300, system can provide improved automatic cross language search.System can be with automated manner during with single language submit Query, offers user by the news results that the relevant search result from corpus is for example identified related news article by multilingual.
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure 400 for selecting news article.For simplicity, one or more system for computer that is positioned at one or more position with respect to the process of carrying out 400 is carried out to description process 400.For example, can carry out process 400 with the press service of for example Fig. 2 of press service 220.
System obtains the translation that presents language relevant language to every kind of region from cluster to one or more keyword being associated to the cluster of news article, the i.e. every kind language (step 402) different and corresponding with one or more geographic area being associated with the cluster of news article from presenting language of the language of being correlated with to every kind of region.
System for every kind of region the language generation of being correlated with according to the search inquiry (step 404) that keyword is obtained to the translation of this language.Search inquiry is for the inquiry that is included in the news article in the cluster of the news article that press service safeguards.For given language, search inquiry can comprise keyword to the each translation in the translation of this language.Alternatively, search inquiry is also specified one or more additional search parameter.
