Figure 1A is the exemplary release vehicle 100 that is used to present location-based content-targeted online advertisement.Release vehicle 100 can be any media that can present advertisement, includes but not limited to: electronic document (for example, HTML, SGML, XML .pdf), display screen (for example, LCD, TV screen), audio frequency etc.In shown example, release vehicle 100 is the webpages that have the website of domain name " pizzamakingpros.com " on the WWW.The content that is presented on webpage 100 is directed to making the interested client of pizza.Content can be to be included but not limited to: text, picture, photo, video, music, audio frequency, electronic document, software etc. by user search or any information of watching.In shown example, webpage 100 comprises various articles, study course and the recipe relevant with pizza.When user capture webpage 100 and/or with webpage 100 on presented content exchange the time (for example, link by clicking the characteristic article or mouse are suspended in this and chain), as shown in Figure 1B, show location-based content-targeted advertisement.
Figure 1B is the revision of the release vehicle 100 shown in Figure 1A, comprises exemplary location-based content-targeted advertisement.In response to click or with other mutual (Figure 1A) of linking 101, article " Portobello Mushrooms﹠amp; NY Style Pizza " show that together with the advertisement of orientation 102 are present on the webpage 100.In shown example, directed advertisement shows that 102 comprise by making three relevant different advertisements that the advertiser supported 104 with pizza or pizza.Directed advertisement shows that 102 also can present a plurality of advertisements of being supported by same advertiser.The content that advertisement 104 can comprise any kind (for example, text, image, audio frequency), and be used for one or more user interface elements 106 mutual and/or that connect with other resource (for example, advertiser or vendor web site, chatroom, forum) with advertisement.Provide one or more user interface elements in can showing in the advertisement of orientation, be used to show and hide each advertiser's contact details, to solve the problem of the finite space in the directed advertisement demonstration.
In shown example, advertisement 104a comprises being used for automatically setting up with advertiser's " I LoveNY Pizza " phone is connected and links 108.Can use known agreement to set up this communication linkage, such as voice-over ip (VoIP) and/or the commercial available communication technology (for example, Skype
Advertisement 104 comprises the mark 110 corresponding to the mark on ground Figure 112 114, this ground Figure 112 be positioned at targeted ads show 102 below.Mark 114 illustrates the position in advertiser's shop.Mark 110,114 can be any desired shape, size or color, and can comprise letter, numeral or other indication, in order to mark 110,114 is associated with advertisement 104.Advertisement 104 can be presented to the user with various forms, and is not limited to the form shown in Figure 1B.
Ground Figure 112 can be two dimension or three-dimensional map.Ground Figure 112 also can be static state and/or dynamic.In some implementations, can draw with convergent-divergent ground Figure 112 so that detailed information to be shown.For example, the user can come Figure 112 movably by using indicating equipment (for example, mouse) to click or draw ground Figure 112.Alternatively, the user can use can be embedded among ground Figure 112 or the one or more Navigation Control (for example, button, slide block) that present in discrete user interface, pane or tool bar, navigation on ground Figure 112 (for example, move, rotation, convergent-divergent).Except displayed map 112, can provide various Map Services, such as estimation and user's position and the ability of mile (or other unit) distance this target location between of the driving direction of watching and printing to a position together with this needed time of position of arrival.Ground Figure 112 also can provide multiple view mode defaultly, comprise street map view, satellite and high resolving power aerial photograph and cover satellite and the high resolving power aerial photograph on street map.
In some implementations, except map the replacement of map (or as), audio file can be sent or otherwise be delivered to the user by stream, and it provides listened to the description of advertiser position in this geographic area.In some implementations, map and advertisement can be provided for the user as fax or with the electronic document (for example .pdf file) that invests Email.
In some implementations, for the user provides search box, disparity items or shop in the geographic area of its permission user search orientation, perhaps identical project or the shop in the different geographic regions.Also can (for example provide a kind of means for the user, link), be used to check selected position by the availability of the commodity of advertisement or service and/or show that directed geographical location can use by the tabulation of the commodity of advertisement or service (for example, the film shown of theater or certain movie shows the time).
Several observations of making about the example shown in Figure 1B.The first, the content that advertisement 104 is associated with or " orientation " presented to the webpage 100, it is pizza in this example.The second, ground Figure 112 is provided with mark 114, and this mark 114 illustrates position physics, " entity " of the enterprise of the product that provides relevant with this content, and it is pizzeria in this example.The 3rd observation be, selects advertisement 104 based on user's geographic position and/or from the area-of-interest that the content of webpage 100 is obtained, and it is Palo Alto in this example, California (Palo Alto in California).
Because the content of webpage 100 is used to determine relevant advertisements 104 together with interested geographic area, this location-based content-targeted advertisement 104 provides the significant advantage that surpasses conventional targeted ads.In addition, needn't call discrete map products (for example, Google the user
TM
Fig. 2 is the example web page 200 of the location-based content-targeted online advertisement of diagram.This webpage 200 comprises the content relevant with film (for example, up-to-date information, comment).In shown example, the user is positioned at the Manhattan, and it is still interested in seeing a film in the Manhattan perhaps to be positioned at another zone.When this user clicks user's " Googleplex " link, present directed advertisement and show 202.This directed advertisement shows that 202 comprise mark 204, and it illustrates the current physical location at the theater of Manhattan of showing positive Googleplex.Linking of these marks and the theater that is linked to the Manhattan 206 is associated.This link 206 can be directed to the user various information resources, such as projection time, comment etc.Be similar to shown in Figure 1A and Figure 1B, user's geographic position (Manhattan) and/or the area interested that 200 content is obtained from the website can be used to identify the current theater in the Manhattan of playing Googleplex.This advertisement 206 can be directed to the general content (for example, film) of webpage 200 or be directed to certain content (for example, Googleplex).
The advertisement orientation system
Fig. 3 is the block diagram of example ad orientation system 300.This advertisement orientation system 300 comprises: context server 302, location server 304, Advertisement Server 306, map server 308, ad storage storehouse 310, geography information (GI) thesaurus 312 and content server 316.This system 300 is examples that are used for transmitting to the final user advertisement orientation system of location-based content-targeted advertisement.Other configuration is possible.For example, can carry out by the single computing machine in the network or a plurality of computing machine by the function that server provided shown in Fig. 3.Server can be in alone server process of moving on the discrete computing machine or the Single-Server process moved on single computing machine.Ad storage storehouse 310 and GI thesaurus 312 can comprise the one or more databases that are positioned on one or more memory devices.In some implementations, can directly receive geography information from positioning system, positioning system such as GPS (GPS), positioning system, wireless local network positioning system (based on the location of WLAN), based on positioning system of cellular network etc. based on radio signal.
In some implementations, system 300 can be the part of online issue instrument, such as the Google AdSense that is used for being provided by Google (California, USA mountain scene city)
TMForContent.In other was realized, system 300 can be the part of on-line search engine.Utilize search engine, the user can provide and can be used for the accurate geographic zone of targeted ads by system 300, perhaps system 300 determines user's interest by the search activities (for example, rolling, convergent-divergent, search terms) of monitoring user, determines more accurate geographic area.
In operation, custom system 314 provides ad-request to Advertisement Server 306.This custom system 314 can be any equipment that can present advertisement, includes but not limited to: personal computer, PDA(Personal Digital Assistant), mobile phone, smart phone, media player/recorder, game console, television system, electron plate, navigational system etc.In some implementations, custom system 314 comprises processor 318 and computer-readable medium 320 (for example, storer, hard disk).Computer-readable medium 320 can further comprise operating system 322 (for example, Windows
Advertisement Server 306, and receives and show directed advertisement and out of Memory on the display device (not shown) of custom system 314.
Determine the geographic position
A kind of is to ask geography information to this user in order to definite user's the geographic area or the method in user's interest zone.For example, when the user registers on the website, can point out the user that family or enterprise address are provided.Alternatively or additionally, can use the IP address to determine user's geographic position.When custom system 314 and Advertisement Server 306 were got in touch with requested webpage, this custom system 314 was transmitted the IP address to Advertisement Server 306.For example, this IP address can be provided by ISP (ISP).IP address location device can use this IP address to determine user's geographic area.The example of IP address location device is the IP address location device instrument by the exploitation of Geobytes company.
Refer again to the example of Figure 1B, when the custom system 314 that is positioned at Palo Alto during from Advertisement Server 306 request advertisements, Advertisement Server 306 receives the IP address with this request, and this IP address is forwarded to location server 304.IP address location device can use the IP address to visit IP address/location database subsequently, and retrieves the geographic position that is associated with this IP address, and it is a Palo Alto in shown example.
Except the IP address, Advertisement Server 306 also can receive recommends URL, and it is the URL of the previous page of visiting of user.When custom system 314 was got in touch Advertisement Servers 306 with requested webpage, this custom system 314 can be transmitted this to Advertisement Server 306 and recommend URL.In some cases, recommend URL to provide and to be used to determine user's the geographic area or the information of area-of-interest.For example, if recommend URL to be
“http://www.google.com/serach？q＝pizza+palo+alto+ca”，
Then location server 304 can find out that the user uses google search engine, execution to come this webpage for the search of the pizza of Palo Alto, California and by the link of for example clicking on the search-engine results page.According to this information, can suppose that the user is positioned at Palo Alto or Palo Alto is an area-of-interest, and the advertisement context is a pizza.
In some implementations, service (for example, search engine, map products) storage is about the information of the service in user and user's the system.In some instances, this information is stored among the cookie.If this information comprises geography information, then this information can be used to determine user's position potentially.
In some implementations, the use location tracer technique such as GPS, radiobeacon, sub-district-ID, time of arrival (TOA), enhancement mode difference observing time (E-OTD) etc., can be determined the position of custom system 314.In this case, the direct track user system 314 of the location server 304 of use location tracer technique.
Another is used for determining that method of customer location or area-of-interest is the content (for example, the webpage that identifies) of current that visiting or the webpage of having visited in the past of examination user in recommending URL.For example, can make progress context server 302 of Advertisement Server 306 and/or location server 304 sends web page contents identifiers (ID).This content of pages ID is used to from content server 316 searching web pages contents, can be analyzed to determine advertisement context or location context based on it by context server 302 subsequently.The result of this analysis (for example, the advertisement contextual information) is passed to Advertisement Server 306, and it uses this result together with come the one or more advertisements of 310 retrievals from the ad storage storehouse from location server 304 received positional informations.
Clustering algorithm with data set (for example, a web pages) be partitioned into subclass or " bunch ", make total characteristic or the principal character of data sharing in each subclass.For example, if webpage comprises and makes the relevant content of pizza that then clustering algorithm will detect this content (for example, pizza) and this webpage is assigned to one or more bunches that are associated with pizza.
In case webpage is assigned to one or more bunches, can bunch determine the advertisement context based on what this was assigned.For example, the pizzamakingpros.com webpage 100 shown in Figure 1A can be assigned to food bunch, pizza bunch and/or restaurant bunch etc.Advertisement Server 306 can use this advertisement context of determining together with come the location-based content-targeted advertisement of 310 retrievals from the ad storage storehouse from location server 304 received positional informations.In some implementations, ad storage storehouse 310 is can be at advertisement and relational database (for example, the My SQL that inquired about
TM), this advertisement has specific advertisement context, and with the specific geographical area in have physics and exist the advertiser of (such as the pizzeria of Palo Alto, California) to be associated.
In some implementations, advertisement orientation system 300 can based on search terms that the user provided or key word be oriented in advertisement on the search-engine results page or from the page of search-engine results page link, it comprises directed advertisement and shows.Can use this search terms to determine user's geographic area or user's interest zone and advertisement context.Search terms can be used to directed relevant advertisements together with web page contents and location identifier.
In case determined advertisement context and position, Advertisement Server 306 can send to this information map server 308, comprises the map image of the mark that is used for the position that is associated with advertisement with generation.Map server 308 is couple to GI thesaurus 312, and it comprises the data that are used to generate static state and/or dynamic map and stack (overlay), this all mark shown in Figure 1B 114 in this way that superposes.For example, the coordinate in " entity " shop of advertiser's physics (for example, latitude, longitude) can be stored in the GI thesaurus 312, where make map server 308 know is inserting mark in the map, this map generates based on user's position or the area-of-interest that is provided by location server 304.When generating this map, this advertisement and map are delivered to custom system 314 by Advertisement Server 306, are used for presenting in the targeted ads demonstration of the demonstration of the targeted ads shown in Figure 1B 102.This targeted ads shows and can be presented on any display surface, includes but not limited to: display screen (for example, LCD), any surface that can receive projection, TV screen, navigation demonstration, hologram etc.
The advertisement orientation process
Fig. 4 is the process flow diagram of example ad orientation process 400.The step of process 400 needn't take place with particular order, and the generation that can walk abreast of at least some steps.When custom system receives ad-request (402), these advertisement orientation process 400 beginnings.In some implementations, ad-request can comprise the URL of webpage, and context server can be creeped (crawl) this webpage to determine advertisement context (404).On the basis of scheduling or in response to trigger event, this webpage of can creeping.This context server for example uses clustering algorithm to handle this content.Clustering algorithm sign with can be used to that definite contextual principal character of advertisement or characteristic be associated bunch.If do not creep this webpage before, then this page can be creeped in real time by crawl device.
This process 400 is also determined user's position or area-of-interest (406) based on web page contents and/or one or more station location marker.IP address, information and/or the web page contents of recommending URL, user profiles, user to provide can be provided location identifier.
Use advertisement context and positional information, can be from the location-based content-targeted advertisement of ad storage library searching (408).Fall into the advertisement context by definite which advertisement, and which advertiser who is associated with those context-sensitive advertisements has the physics existence in the geographic area of orientation.In case determined this advertisement, then can create map and/or out of Memory (for example, audio file, fax .pdf, bit stream) (410) with mark, this mark illustrates advertiser's position, shop or other physical attribute that is associated with the advertiser.Then, this advertisement and map can be passed to custom system, are used for presenting on the display device of custom system (412).
Can show targeted ads comprising on the webpage of targeted content, perhaps can use different communication medias,, provide this advertisement such as email message or instant message.This advertisement and map can be delivered to custom system when the user is watching the webpage with targeted content.This map can be static, dynamic or the combination of the two.Utilize dynamic map, the user can browse directed geographic area near zone additional information, dwindle with the geographical context of checking directed geographic area, amplify checking the details of directed geographic area, and additionally browse the advertiser in directed geographic area and the directed geographic area.Advertisement can comprise the link that the user is directed to again the advertiser website, perhaps provides bubble, pop-up window or other user interface element relevant to the relevant information of the product of advertisement or service to show.Map or related advertisement can comprise (for example, the Skype that communicates by letter that is used to set up with the advertiser
TM) link.
In some cases, the advertiser owing to highly dense intensity in the specific geographical area causes may showing too much mark on map.For example, this may occur in the big city, and the advertiser squeezes thick and fast in little geographic area in the big city.Too much mark may make and can't read map especially have on the custom system little or the low resolution display screen.For this situation, can use rank or filtering system to determine and to present which advertisement and the number of the position mark that in given map, will comprise to the user.This process also can be determined to come displayed map with great ratio, so that distinguish position mark easily.
In some implementations, can move advertisement bidding and determine a best N advertisement, and only this N advertisement is shown to the user.In some cases, this best N advertisement can be the top n advertiser, or given advertiser's (hamburger special permission shop allied that for example, has 30 positions in New York City) top n position.By each shop to the distance in predetermined geographic position individually or in conjunction with other factors (for example) based on the shop popularity of click-through rate, page rank, can determine this top n position.
In some implementations, the only advertisement of preceding x% based on the score value that is calculated can have the position mark that is included in the map.This number percent can be based on the size of the display screen of custom system and resolution and is changed.For example, the advertisement that is passed to mobile phone can show the advertisement and the mark of less number percent, to reduce the in disorder and increase readability of screen.Can use score value to determine the upward position (or will on map, not comprise the mark that is associated with given advertisement) of given advertisement of tabulation.This score value can consideration and geographic position and advertisement context or advertiser's the relevant available information of preference.For example, can use a plurality of location pointers (for example, the information that web page contents, IP address, user provide, user profiles, recommendation URL, gps data) to determine mark, to determine advertiser position near the user.One or more grading parameters can be weighted to increase or to reduce the susceptibility of score value to such parameter.Advertisement can be presented to the user makes the position of advertisement in tabulation based on this score value.For example, the higher advertisement of marking will be at the top of tabulation, and can represent their mark in map.The lower advertisement of marking will be placed in the bottom of tabulation, and can or can not represent their mark in map, and this depends on the advertisement from higher ranked, has comprised how many marks.For those based on score value and the selected advertisement that presents to the user can provide at this by the estimated distance of the position of advertisement and travel time.These estimations can be presented at the trip (for example, walking, automobile, public transport, bicycle) of various patterns.
Advertisement orientation system framework
Fig. 5 is the block diagram of example ad orientation system framework 500.Other framework is possible, comprises the framework with more or less assembly.In some implementations, framework 500 comprises: one or more processors 502 (for example, double-core Intel
ad storage storehouse 504, one or more network interface 506, GI thesaurus 507, optional supervisory computer 508 and one or more computer-readable medium 510 (for example, RAM, ROM, SDRAM, hard disk, CD, flash memory, SAN etc.).These assemblies can be by one or more communication channels 512 (for example, Ethernet, ESB, PCI, PCI-Express etc.) switched communication and data, described communication channel (for example can comprise the various known network equipments, router, hub, gateway, bus) and utilize software (for example, middleware) to come the transmission of data and control signal between the promotion equipment.
