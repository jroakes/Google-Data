End 1071-NIn corresponding one.Message exchange client 1071-NCan occur in a variety of manners, and the form can be
Client computing device 1061-NBetween change, and/or can be in client computing device 1061-NIn single client
It calculates and operates diversified forms in equipment.In some implementations, message exchange client 1071-NOne or more of can be with short
Messaging service (" SMS ") and/or multimedia messaging service (" MMS ") client, online chatting client are (for example, instant message
(instant messenger), the Internet relay chat (Internet relay chat) or " IRC " etc.) and social networks
The application of associated message transmission is exclusively used in personal assistant messaging service with the dialogue of automatic message transmission system 120
Etc..In some implementations, message exchange client 1071-NOne or more of can be via webpage or by web browser
Other resources that the other application of (not shown) or client computing device is presented are realized.
As described in more detail, in various implementations, the identification of automatic message transmission system 120 is set with client calculating
Standby 1061-NOne of the associated task of user, and by providing needle for being presented to the user via client computing device
The dialogue of and user relevant to the task is initiated the content of task customization.Automatic message transmission system 120 for appoint
Be engaged in " initiation " of relevant dialogue is not necessarily mean that user has neither part nor lot in any dialogue with system 120 and/or user not
Any input for causing system 120 to initiate dialogue is provided.On the contrary, it means that initiate dialogue relevant to task in system
Before, any ongoing dialogue with automatic message transmission system 120 is not all clearly directed to the task.For example, user
It can participate in the dialogue of automatic message transmission system with the update-for obtaining the news about the same day, weather etc. and system
120 can initiate dialogue relevant to task during this participation.In some implementations, automatic message transmission system 120 can
To initiate the dialogue with user relevant to task, and user does not provide to automatic message transmission system 120 directly and task
Relevant any input (for example, being inputted with the natural language in the preceding dialog of system 120).For example, automatic message transmits
System 120 can based on user and other systems (for example, e-mail system, search engine, calendar system and/or with it is automatic
The separated other systems of messaging system 120) interaction initiate current based on user and/or the in the past dialogue of position.
Client computing device 1061-NEach of and automatic message transmission system 120 may include for storing number
According to one or more memories with software application, one or more processors and rush for accessing data and execution application
Into the other assemblies communicated by network.By one or more client computing devices 1061-NAnd/or it is passed by automatic message
The operation that delivery system 120 executes can be distributed in multiple computer systems.Automatic message transmission system 120 may be implemented as
Such as the computer program run on one or more computers in one or more positions coupled to each other by network.
Automatic message transmission system 120 may include natural language processor 122, user property engine 124, task engine
126, translation engine 128, message generate engine 130 and task parameters module 132.In some implementations, it is convenient to omit engine
122,124,126,128,130 and/or module 132 one or more.In some implementations, can with combine engine 122,124,
126,128,130 and/or one or more of module 132 whole or many aspects.In some implementations, engine 122,
124, one or more of 126,128,130 and/or module 132 can be in the groups separated with automatic message transmission system 120
It is realized in part.For example, can be by client computing device 1061-N122,124,126,128,130 are realized in the component of execution
And/or one or more of 132 or its any operation part.
The processing of natural language processor 122 is by user via client computing device 1061-NThe natural language of generation inputs,
And annotation output is generated so that one or more other assemblies of automatic message transmission system 120 use.For example, at natural language
Reason device 122, which can handle, passes through client device 106 by user1One or more user interface input devices generate nature
The input of language free form.The annotation output of generation includes one or more annotations of natural language input and optionally includes
One or more (for example, all) terms of natural language input.
In some implementations, natural language processor 122 is configured as identifying and annotating in natural language input various
The syntactic information of type.For example, natural language processor 122 may include part-of-speech tagging device, it is configured as with its grammer angle
Color annotates term.For example, part-of-speech tagging device can use its part of speech to mark each term, for example, " noun ", " verb ", " describe
Word ", " pronoun " etc..In addition, for example, in some implementations, natural language processor 122 can be wrapped additionally and/or alternatively
Interdependent parser is included, the syntactic relation being configured to determine that between the term inputted using natural language.For example, according to
Depositing parser can determine which term modifies subject and verb of other terms and sentence etc. (for example, syntax point
Analysis tree) --- and interdependent can be annotated to this.
In some implementations, natural language processor 122 can additionally and/or alternatively include entity indicia device, should
Entity indicia device is configured as annotating entity reference in one or more sections, the reference to people, tissue and position etc..It is real
Body marker can with high granularity level (for example, so that all references that can identify the entity class to such as people) and/or
Lower granularity level (for example, so that all references that can identify the specific entity to such as specific people) annotation is to reality
The reference of body.Entity indicia device may rely on the content of natural language input to parse special entity and/or can be optionally
It communicates with knowledge graph or other entity data baks to parse special entity.
In some implementations, natural language processor 122 can additionally and/or alternatively include quoting resolver altogether,
It, which is configured as context based on one or more, will be grouped the reference of identical entity or " cluster ".For example, can
With using reference resolver altogether, by natural language input, " I likes Asia village.It please subscribe it." in word " it " resolve to it is " sub-
Continent village ".
In some implementations, the one or more components of natural language processor 122 may rely on from natural language
The annotation of one or more other assemblies of processor 122.For example, in some implementations, name entity indicia device can rely on
The all of special entity are referred to annotate in the annotation from total reference resolver and/or interdependent parser.Moreover,
For example, in some implementations, quoting resolver altogether may rely on the annotation from interdependent parser to cluster to same
The reference of entity.In some implementations, when handling the input of specific natural language, one or more of natural language processor 122
The correlation that a component can be used except the input of specific natural language be previously entered and/or other related datas come determine one or
Multiple annotations.For example, the first message with the user in the dialogue of Auto Attendant can be " they have an appointment tomorrow noon ",
And the subsequent message of user can be " subscribing it at that time ".At processing " subscribing it at that time ", quoting resolver altogether can be incited somebody to action
" it " resolve to " appointment " and can use " they have an appointment tomorrow noon " be previously entered will resolve to " at that time " it is " bright
Its noon ".
User property engine 124 determines the dialogue and/or automatic message transmitting system participated in automatic message transmission system 120
System 120 can initiate one or more attributes of the user of dialogue with it, and these attributes are supplied to automatic message transmitting system
One or more other assemblies of system 120.The other assemblies of automatic message transmission system 120 can use these attributes, with example
Such as determine the value of the task of user of distributing to, the one or more parameters for determining task, determine when to initiate with the dialogue of user,
It generates and the output of the dialogue of one or more users and/or determines whether that translation is supplied to the natural language of user and exports.With
Family property engine 124 is communicated with the user attribute database 152 that can store one or more user properties.In various realizations
In, user property engine 124 and/or user attribute database 152 can be entirely or partly in client computing devices 1061-N
It is upper to realize and/or be based on client computing device 1061-NThe data of offer determine one or more user properties.Can by with
The some examples for the user property that family property engine 124 determines include the current location of user (for example, based on GPS or other positions
Set data), one or more position (for example, the positions of " family " of user, the previously visited mistake of user) in the past of user, user
The user profiles of language, the time-constrain (for example, electronic calendar based on user) of user and user are (for example, based on across more
The User Activity of a Internet service).
Task engine 126 is user's identification mission and provides information (example relevant to the task to message generation engine 130
Such as, make a reservation for for the identifier of the movement of the task and/or one or more service entities, for the one or more of the task
Parameter value) and optionally to message generate engine 130 offer when be suitable for engine 130 initiate it is related to the task of user
The instruction of dialogue.Task engine 126 can use one or more of various resources to determine the task of user, such as task
User property and/or user that database 154, user property engine 124 provide are supplied to the mistake of automatic message transmission system 120
Natural language is gone to input.
Assignment database 154 can provide in one or more non-transitory computer-readable mediums, and can determine
Adopted multiple tasks, each task indicate at least one movement and at least one entity associated with the movement.Task it is some
Example include arrange with the appointments of government organs, from corporation requests service, from enterprise's ordering products, food order, logical at the restaurant
Cross taxi acquisition traffic, meet with client, establish utility service, purchase film ticket etc..It can be in assignment database 154
In with various granularity level define task.For example, task can be defined as " arranging any appointment with any government organs "
Or be more narrowly defined as the appointment of specific government organs " arrange with " or " arrange with specific government organs it is certain types of about
Meeting ".In some implementations, one or more tasks of assignment database 154 can respectively with one or more specific user's phases
One or more tasks of association and/or assignment database 154 can be with the specific marks of one or more that can instantiate task
Standard is associated.In some implementations, the whole or many aspects of assignment database 154 can be merged into client computing device
1061-NOne or more of a part.
In some implementations, task engine 126 can be based on associated with the user in assignment database 154
It is engaged in identify the task of user.For example, assignment database 154 may include one or more entries, specific to user, and
It can be created in response to being carried out by user and/or being related to the one or more of user based on the movement of calculating, the movement is for example
It is the one or more client computing devices 106 used by user via user1-NOne or more movements of execution.For example,
Assignment database 154 may include one or more calendars, remind entry and/or to user personalization and can by with
Other entries that family is created intentionally by the interaction of user and the one or more application (for example, calendar application) for calculating equipment
(for example, cannot be accessed by other users without user's license).
Moreover, these entries are not intentional by user for example, assignment database 154 may include one or more entries
Creation, but equipment is calculated by one or more, client computing device 106 is passed through based on user1-NOne or more of
One or more movements of execution are to infer creation.For example, it is assumed that user executed to remove timeworn furniture it is relevant it is multiple mutually
Networking search, such as search " how I get rid of timeworn furniture ", " who receives furniture " and " furniture removal ".In such an example, may be used
Optionally to remove the entry of task for furniture for user's creation in assignment database 154, created intentionally without user
Entry.As another example, assignment database 154 may include one or more entries, these entries are had by user
Meaning creation, but based on being related to one or more calculating actions of user (for example, based on the Email for being sent to user
Content, text message or other communications) creation.
In some implementations, task engine 126 can be related to user in no task in assignment database 154
The task of identity user in the case where connection.For example, in some implementations, assignment database 154 may include and can instantiate
The associated task of one or more standards of task.The user property provided based on those standards and user property engine 124
Between consistency, one of these tasks can be determined as the task of user by task engine 126.For example, assignment database 154
It may include the task of " food order ", it is associated with following standards: at the restaurant, and in dominant language not to be user institute
The language said and/or be not user dominant language position.Task engine 126 can be provided based on user property engine 124
User property identify " food order " task of user, during which indicates the current location of user at the restaurant and
Current location is in using the geographic area for being not language described in user.As another example, assignment database 154 can wrap
The task of the free rubbish removal of scheduling and town is included, it is related to as the standard of new resettlement person of the town is arrived
Connection.Task engine 126 can be moved to the use of the town recently based on the instruction user provided by user property engine 124
Family attribute identifies " dispatch free rubbish remove " task.As another example, assignment database 154 may include specific
Task of subway ticket is bought in city, it is associated with as the standard of new visitor of the town is arrived.Task engine 126 can
" purchase subway ticket " task is identified with the user property provided based on user property engine 124, which indicates user
It is present in town and did not access the town before.
The input of natural language that user provides can be translated into another language and/or can will be by by translation engine 128
Message generates the natural language output that engine 130 generates and translates into language described in the recipient user of the output (for example, receiving
The native language of person user).In some implementations, translation engine 128 can use one provided by user property engine 124
Or multiple user properties determine language described in user, such as the native language of user.
In some implementations, message generates engine 130 and calculates equipment initiation and user's via the associated client end of user
Task relative conversations, and user is assigned to initiate to talk with based on identification mission.For example, message generation engine 130 can be with base
Dialogue relevant to task is initiated in the instruction task provided by task engine 126 is the output of the task of user.As closed
Described in translation engine 128, in various implementations, message generates engine 130 and can participate in and use via translation engine 128
The dialogue at family.For example, engine 128 can by message generate engine 130 generate natural language output be presented to user it
It is preceding translation it, and/or, can by the natural language formulated by user input be supplied to message generate engine 130 before and/or
Service entities are being provided it to as a part of communication to translate it before initiating the task with service entities.
Message, which generates engine 130, can initiate task relative conversations to provide a user additional information relevant to task
And/or the value of one or more parameters of task is determined based on the user's input provided in session.In some implementations,
Message generate engine 130 can session generate problem or other prompt, be configured as from user extract task must
It wants and/or it is expected the value of parameter, and can be adapted based on user in the response of session in session.
Message generation engine 130 utilizes one or more resource next life problematic or other prompts are to request letter from user
Breath.For example, message generate engine 130 can use user session current and/or past natural language input, by
The annotation for the input that natural language processor 122 provides, user property, the task engine provided by user property engine 124
The value of 126 task parameters provided or the en-tity protocol and/or native language of other mission bit streams, en-tity protocol data library 156
One or more entries of database 158.It may include task parameters module 132 that message, which generates engine 130, determine task
The natural language input what parameter is provided by user in session is effectively specified, and store it is associated with task that
The value of a little parameters.Message, which generates engine 130, can use the value of such storage to prevent from generating natural language output, the nature
It has been any parameter of the effectively specified task of the task that language output, which prompts user to specify,.Task parameters module 132 may be used also
With by the value of task and the parameter of task (value of parameter for being determined by task engine 126 and/or being determined in session) transmission
The execution of task is initiated to other one or more computing systems.
En-tity protocol data library 156 can be arranged in one or more non-transitory computer-readable mediums, and
Multiple agreements are defined, each agreement is suitable for one or more movements of one or more entities and/or task.Each agreement is fixed
Adopted one or more necessary and/or desired parameters, to execute the associated movement of task and/or utilize associated service
Entity/entity executes associated movement.For example, the first agreement can be it is associated with restaurant reservation movement and with carry out it is pre-
The associated general protocol in all restaurants ordered.First agreement can define the call parameter of movement, such as day of appointment, reservation
Time and reservation number.Moreover, for example, second protocol can be it is associated with restaurant reservation movement and with the meal subscribed
The associated second protocol of subset in shop (for example, certain restaurant).Second protocol can define necessity and/or the phase of certain restaurant
Hope parameter, whether user wants whether indoor or outdoors seat, exhibition position or desk, user have diet restriction etc..
Native language database 158 can be arranged in one or more non-transitory computer-readable mediums, and
For each of one or more geographic areas and/or language, the entry including defining following part: in the geographic area
And/or the language section (for example, sentence, phrase and/or term) used in language with conversational mode；And selectively, with this
The associated task of a little language sections.For example, the entry of United States geographic area may include following entry: " I wants to take
[position] ", " the estimation admission fee to [position] is how many ", " to take thank you ", it is all these all with one or more tasks
It is associated, such as obtains the task of traffic from taxi driver.In addition, for example, the entry of the geographic area of United States can be with
Including following entry: " I wants to order [food] ", it is related to access restaurant task, food order task and/or other tasks
Connection；" you are able to tell where is my toilet? ", with access restaurant task, access service entities task and/or other tasks
Be associated etc..Note that the word in earlier examples bracket " [] " indicates a kind of word, engine 130 can be generated by message
Using such description and/or the member used as such and the natural language input that can be provided based on user be determined
One or more specific words " filling ".The language section of native language database 158 may include text chunk, and can also wrap
Include audible file and/or the link to audible file, for example, " .wav " file, " .mp3 " file, " .mpeg " file and/or its
The file of his format, the file of the extended formatting when executed by a computing apparatus, make to calculate the corresponding audio output of equipment generation.
Message generate engine 130 can use the entry of native language database 158 determine initiate and/or continue with
The content of user is supplied to when the relevant dialogue of task.For example, as described in more detail, for the Given task of user,
Message, which generates engine 130, can identify that associated with the task in database 158 and with user current location is associated
And/or one or more language sections associated with the language of the current location of user.Message generates engine 130 can be to user
Those language sections audibly and/or are visually presented as in the content for initiating to provide when the dialogue with user relevant to task
A part and/or a part as the additional content provided in the continuation of the task relative conversations with user.
Turning now to Fig. 2A and Fig. 2 B, automatic message transmission system 120 and message exchange client 107 are provided1It is each
The additional description of kind component.Some descriptions of Fig. 2A and Fig. 2 B are provided with the example from Fig. 3 A.Fig. 3 A shows the calculating of Fig. 1

Calculate equipment 1061Execute one or more movements.
Fig. 2A shows message exchange client 107 of the task 202 based on user to user1Offer task related content
203A is via message exchange client 1071Initiate the example with the dialogue of user.
In fig. 2,126 task based access control database 154 of task engine and/or based on user property engine 124 provide one
A or multiple user properties 201 identify the task 202 of user.Task 202 is supplied to message and generates engine by task engine 126
130。
As Working Examples, it is assumed that task engine 126 determines the task 202 of " removing timeworn furniture ", and instruction " removes house
The movement of tool " and the particular service entity for indicating " Sunnyvale city " for the movement.In some realizations of Working Examples
In, task engine 126 can be based on the task associated with the user in assignment database 154 and/or based on user property
The user property 201 that engine 124 provides carrys out identification mission.
For example, it is assumed that user has submitted multiple search relevant to furniture is removed to individual search engine, such as
Search for " how getting rid of furniture ", " who receives furniture " and " furniture removal ".In such an example, general furniture remove task can be with
It is associated with user in assignment database 154 to be optionally based on those search.In some realizations of Working Examples, task is drawn
Sunnyvale city can be identified as based on the user property 201 provided by user property engine 124 being used for furniture removal by holding up 126
The particular service entity of task.For example, task engine 126 can determine that user is Sunnyvale city based on user property 201
Resident, and can be based further on assignment database 154 and/or other resources determine that the furniture of Sunnyvale city removes task
It is associated with the mandatory standard of the resident as the town.Moreover, for example, task engine 126 can be belonged to based on user
Property 201 determine that users are new resettlement persons to Sunnyvale city, and be also based on assignment database 154 and/or other moneys
Source determine the furniture of Sunnyvale city remove task with as the associated (example of the optional standard of new resettlement person to the town
Such as, because new resettlement person may also be unfamiliar with the service in the city).Furniture shift based on user property 201 Yu Sunnyvale city
Except the consistency between the standard of task, which can be the task of user by task engine 126.
Message generate engine 130 identified using task 202 en-tity protocol from en-tity protocol data library 156 and/or
Language section from native language database 158, for generating task related content 203A.In some implementations, task phase
Holding 203A inside the Pass is natural language output, all to request user interface input for determining whether user wants side from user in this way
Help execution task (for example, " apparently you need to be implemented [task] for natural language output.You want me and help? ") and/or determine
The necessary and/or required parameter of task 202 is ((for example, natural language output " the apparently execution [task] that you need.I can help
It is busy.If it does, me is allowed to know [task parameters] ") prompt natural language output.
Task related content 203A is provided to message exchange client 1071, for via client computing device 1061
User interface output equipment carry out audible and/or vision to user and present.In some implementations, task related content 203A is
Natural language output, and the output translates into message exchange client 107 by translation engine 1281User language.At that
In a little realizations, the output of translation is provided to message exchange client 1071.In some other realizations, message exchange client
1071Translation engine 128 can be merged and execute translation.
In some implementations, message generates engine 130 and determines use using the movement and/or entity that are indicated by task 202
In the en-tity protocol for generating automatic message.For example, " it is pre- to carry out restaurant for what the restaurant reservation of instruction restaurant candidate entity acted
Order " task, engine 130 can identify the general en-tity protocol for being suitable for all restaurants for being subscribed.Can be based on will
General en-tity protocol distributes to " carrying out restaurant reservation " movement and/or " restaurant " entity in en-tity protocol data library 156 to know
Not general en-tity protocol.General en-tity protocol can define one or more necessary and/or desired, for executing task ginsengs
Number, such as: reservation date, subscribes number and the restaurant for reservation at the ticket reserving time.Task can be generated mutually inside the Pass in engine 130
Hold 203A to request the information about one or more of those parameters.In some implementations, general en-tity protocol and/or its
One or more parameters of his agreement may include or otherwise indicate to include the text in the prompt of those parameters.For example, with
The relevant parameter of reservation number may include the text of such as " how many " or " how many people ".
In some implementations, it includes task parameters module 132 that message, which generates engine 130, determines that task 202 is designated
Which parameter (if any).For example, task 202 can provide specified one or more by task engine 126
The value of parameter, such as executing the particular service entity of task 202.Message, which generates engine 130, can use one or more
Specified parameter come prevent generate prompt user specify specified parameter task related content 203A.
Work on example, and message, which generates engine 130, can generate Fig. 3 A's in response to the task 202 of " removing timeworn furniture "
Task related content 390A, the movement and instruction for the instruction of task 202 " removing furniture " that " should remove timeworn furniture " are dynamic for this
The particular service entity of " Sunnyvale city " made.In some implementations, message, which generates engine 130, can be based on en-tity protocol number
Content 390A is generated according to the agreement in library 156.For example, database 156 may include associated simultaneously with the movement of " removing furniture "
And special entity agreement associated with the particular service entity of " Sunnyvale city ".In some realizations in these implementations,
Agreement may include some or all natural language texts of content 390A and should to provide text related to task to initiate
The dialogue with user instruction.Although showing content 390A in figure 3 a with English, in some implementations, it can be with
Another language is translated by translation engine 128, and translates and is provided to user as content 390A.
Fig. 2 B shows the example for continuing the dialogue initiated in Fig. 2A by following manner: task based access control 202 (Fig. 2A) (example
Such as, the en-tity protocol based on task based access control selection) and the natural language input 204 that is provided in the continuation of dialogue based on user
Generate attachment of a task related content 203B.Attachment of a task related content 203B is provided to message exchange client 1071, so as to
Vision is carried out to user and/or the sense of hearing is presented.
In fig. 2b, in response to the task related content 203A of Fig. 2A, user utilizes calculating equipment 1061One or more
A user interface input device is to message exchange client 1071Response natural language input 204, message exchange client are provided
1071Natural language processor 122 is sent by natural language input 204.Natural language input 204 can be as described herein
Free form input, and can be for example by user via calculate equipment physics or dummy keyboard provide key entry input
Or it is supplied to the spoken of the microphone for calculating equipment by user and inputs.In the reality that wherein natural language input 204 is spoken input
In existing, text input can be optionally transcribed by calculating equipment and/or natural language processor 122.
Continue the Working Examples, natural language input 204 can be " certainly！I has 2 sofas and 4 chair ", such as
The user of Fig. 3 A inputs shown in 380A --- and can be given birth to by offer task related content 390A by message by user
It is provided in the continuation for the dialogue initiated at engine 130.
Natural language processor 122 handles natural language input 204 and generates the various annotations of natural language input.It is natural
Language processor 122 is to the message generation offer annotation of engine 130 output (for example, the term of natural language input 204 and generation
Annotation) 205.
Work on example, and natural language input 204 can be " certainly！I has 2 sofas and 4 chair ", such as Fig. 3 A
User input 380A shown in, and natural language processor 122 can will " certainly！" annotation be positive response, by " sofa "
It is furniture entity that " chair ", which annotates, and is quantity associated with " sofa " by " 2 " annotation, and be and " chair by " 4 " annotation
The associated independent quantity of son ".Natural language processor 122 can provide one or more of those terms and/or annotation
As annotation input 205.
Message generate engine 130 using annotation input 205 and the en-tity protocol from en-tity protocol data library 156 and/or
Language section from native language database 158 is for generating attachment of a task related content 203B.For example, message generates engine
130 can analyze annotation input 205 to determine whether annotation input 205 indicates user for the phase of another task related content
It hopes.For example, if expectation of 205 instruction of input to another task related content, message, which generates engine 130, can use figure
En-tity protocol used in 2A prompts user to provide one defined by en-tity protocol to generate attachment of a task related content 203B
The value of a or multiple expectations and/or call parameter.As described herein, which of movement be task parameters module 132 can also determine
Parameter (if any) effectively specifies (and/or specified via task 202) by natural language input 204, and stores
The designated value of those parameters.Message, which generates engine 130, can use the determination of module 132 to prevent from generating prompt user and refer to again
The attachment of a task related content 203B of those fixed parameters.For example, generating engine 130 using definition in message includes " special date "
Parameter parameter agreement in the case where, if natural language input 204 instruction the specific dates and the specific date to the ginseng
Effectively, then module 132 can be the parametric distribution specific date to number.Based on the distribution, engine 130 can ignore the parameter, and
And it is based instead on other parameters and generates attachment of a task related content 203B.
Work on example, " certain in response to what is received！I has 2 sofas and 4 chair " natural language input
204, message, which generates engine 130, can be generated the attachment of a task related content of " sorry, each set only allows two projects "
203B.In some implementations, engine 130 can generate content 203B based on the input provided by task parameters module 132.Example
Such as, module 132 can use annotation input 205 and specify six furniture items for having in natural language input 204 to determine
There are two (agreement used in Fig. 2A) parameters of the maximum value of furniture item --- and generate engine 130 to message and parameter is provided
The invalid instruction of designated value.Message generate engine 130 can the parameter based on agreement and the parameter that is based upon in agreement refer to
Fixed maximum value generates content 390B.
Attachment of a task related content 203B is provided to message exchange client 1071, for via client computing device
1061User interface output equipment carry out audible and/or vision to user and present.In some implementations, the attachment of a task mutually inside the Pass
Holding 203B is natural language output, and the output translates into message exchange client 107 by translation engine 1281User
Language.In those are realized, the output of translation is provided to message exchange client 1071。
Work on example, it is assumed that another exemplary example of Fig. 2 B has been provided attached in message generation engine 130
Task related content 390B is added to occur later.Particularly, it is assumed that user provides another further user input 380B of Fig. 3 A,
Instruction is " good.I first makees 2 sofas ".In some realizations in these implementations, message, which generates engine 130, can be generated Fig. 3 A
Another attachment of a task related content 390C.For example, task parameters module 132 can determine that user inputs 380B instruction agreement
Furniture item parameter quantity virtual value (two), and message generates engine 130 that the attachment of a task phase of Fig. 3 A can be generated
Hold 390C, inside the Pass to request the user for " special date " parameter for being not yet assigned the agreement of valid value to input.
Attachment of a task related content 390C include can be determined in the protocol (for example, being defined in the protocol) with about
The relevant information (for example, " you will need at home ") of meeting date parameter, including prompt (" which date you want "), and including
Three optional options of the virtual value (date) of special date parameter.In some implementations, message generates engine 130 and can pass through
Following manner determines date of selectable option: with reference to one of the available service date for being updated to reflect that Sunnyvale city
Or multiple databases, communication, and the date received in reply are sent to computing system associated with Sunnyvale city and/or human hair
And/or use other technologies.
User by the interaction (for example, by patting graphic element) of corresponding graphic element and/or can pass through
Another natural language inputs (for example, " asking June 19 ") to select one of optional option.For example, as shown in fig. 3, it is false
If user's " patting " or otherwise selection include the graphic element of " 6/19 ".Another input can be provided to message generation and draw
130 are held up, message, which generates engine 130, can specify all of task with virtual value via task parameters module 132 is determining
Parameter.In the response, message, which generates engine 130, can provide another attachment of a task related content 390D, indicate task
It has been initiated (" for reservation on June 19 ") and another information (" confirmation letter ... addressee relevant to the task is provided
Case ").In some implementations, task parameters module 132 can initiate task by following manner: by the specified parameter of task
Value be transmitted to (for example, by Sunnyvale city control) other one or more computing systems with by those computing systems and/
Or the execution of one or more people's initiations movement by receiving the user interface output from those computing systems.
Fig. 3 B shows the calculating equipment 106 of Fig. 11, with display screen 140, display can be in client computing device
1061User and another example according to the dialogue occurred between the automatic message transmission system 120 of realization described herein.
Particularly, how the dialogue that Fig. 3 B shows Fig. 3 A may provide the natural language different from shown in Fig. 3 A in response to user
User interface inputs and a different examples.In other words, it shows how automatic message transmission system 120 can be based on
An example of dialogue is adapted in the user interface input that session provides.
In figure 3b, automatic message transmission system 120 is with related to the identical task of task related content 390A of Fig. 3 A
Content 390E initiates dialogue.In figure 3b, user is with only including " certainly！" input 380C responded, and the input
The quantity of project in the not specified input 380B as such as Fig. 3 A of 380C.Automatic message transmission system 120 is provided into one
The task related content 390F (it can be generated based on the furniture item quantity of the parameter of the agreement in such as Fig. 3 A) of step is still wrapped
Different contents is included, as identical done in the input 380B of Fig. 3 A as user, it is invalid that user does not specify in input 380C
Number parameter.
In figure 3b, user is responded with the input 380D of " sofa and TV ".Message generates engine 130 and uses another
Task related content 390G " it is sorry, without TV.Only sofa or add another? " it is responded.The response can be with base
In another parameter of agreement, the parameter designated television is non-removable.
The dialogue of Fig. 3 B continues another user and inputs 380E and input the another of 380E customization for another user
A task related content 390D.
Turning now to Fig. 4, provides and generate engine using the message that native language database 158 generates task related content
130 another example.Fig. 4 shows the calculating equipment 106 of Fig. 11, can be in client for showing with display screen 140
End calculates equipment 1061User and according to the dialogue occurred between the automatic message transmission system 120 of realization described herein
Another example.Display screen 140 in Fig. 4 further include: text replys interface element 484, and user can choose it via void
Quasi- keyboard generates user's input；And speech answering interface element 485, user can choose it and used with generating via microphone
Family input.Display screen 140 further includes system interface element 481,482,483, can be interacted by user and be set so as to calculate
Standby 1061Execute one or more movements.
In Fig. 4, task engine 126 has identified the task of " food order at the restaurant ", task instruction movement
" food order " and indicate service entities " restaurant " for the movement.In some implementations, task engine 126 can be based on true
One or more user properties of the fixed user provided by user property engine 124 meet " food order at the restaurant " task
One or more standards identify " at the restaurant in food order " task.For example, it is assumed that " food order at the restaurant " task packet
It includes at the restaurant and in the geographic area with the dominant language different from language (for example, the dominant language of user) of user
In standard.It is further assumed that user user property instruction user at the restaurant in and restaurant be located at its dominant language and user
The different geographic area of any language in.For example, it is assumed that user is saying Spanish country, and unique described in user
Language is English.Task engine 126 " can eaten based on this consistency between user property and the standard of task to identify
Food order in shop " task.
Message generation engine 130 generates task related content 490A using the task of " food order at the restaurant ",
Prompt the user whether want help execute task (" you want help order? ").
In response to the task related content 490A of Fig. 4, user utilizes calculating equipment 1061One or more user interfaces
Input equipment come provide response natural language input 480A " be.I wants to order some chickens ".
Message generates engine 130 using the current location (as indicated by user property) of task and user come from local language
It says in database 158 and identifies natural language entry " Me gustaria [food] favor ".For example, the natural language entry can be with
Based on its in database 158 it is associated with the task of " food order " and with correspond to user current location geographic region
Domain is associated and identifies.Message generates engine 130 and generates content 490B comprising the natural language based on natural language entry is defeated
Out, and it includes being based on the substitution placeholder that " pollo " is the translation of " chicken " that indicates in input 480A
" pollo " of " [food] ".
Content 490B further includes selectable graphic element (" clicking to listen to example ") when selected by the user will
Via calculating equipment 1061Loudspeaker " Me gustaria pollo favor " is audibly presented to user.In some realities
In existing, " Me gustaria pollo favor " can replace or supplement the display of " Me gustaria pollo favor " and
Automatically it is audibly presented to user.
Content 490C further includes selectable graphic element (" clicking here to attempt to say "), which works as quilt
When user selects, customer-furnished Oral input will be made by calculating equipment 1061Microphones capture.Oral input can be with
It is analyzed by automatic message transmission system 120 and/or other assemblies, to determine whether it matches " Me gustaria pollo
favor".If it does, then automatic message transmission system 120 can be via another task related content (not shown) to user
The instruction user feedback of correctly description language section is provided.If it is mismatched, automatic message transmitting can pass through another
Task related content (not shown) provides a user feedback, which indicates user without correctly description language section, instruction
The term improperly described and/or its audibly provide a user phrase and/or provide a user another and hear phrase
Chance.
Although the particular example using the entry from native language database 158 is shown in FIG. 4, it is contemplated that
Many variations.For example, in some implementations, in response to identifying the task of user, automatic message transmission system 120 can be under
Mode is stated to initiate to talk with: providing one or more contexts " foreign language " phrase appropriate, without prompting user to confirm first
User wants to be provided these phrases.For example, the initiation of the dialogue of Fig. 4 may be " in seeming you at the restaurant.If you want to order
Purchase food say ' Me gustaria [the food you want], favor'.For example, order chicken say ' Me gustaria
pollo favor'".The initiation of dialogue optionally automatically audibly can also be presented at least some contents and/or automatically receive
User is listened to describe the trial of at least some contents.
As another example, the geographic area with the dominant language different from the dominant language of user is located at based on user
In restaurant (or calendar based on user, instruction user will be quickly in such restaurant), task engine 126 can
To identify more generally task " communication at the restaurant ".In addition, message generation engine 130 can be from native language database 158
Multiple language sections relevant to the task are identified, for example, language section " gracias " (thanks), " donde esta el bano "
(where is bathroom), " Me gustaria, [the food you want], favor " (I wants [food that you want]).Disappear
Breath generate engine 130 can with content " allow I know you whether wish to hear at the restaurant used in useful native language it is short
Language " initiates dialogue.In response to user's input certainly, message generates engine 130 can be known to user's presentation one or more
The English of other language section (for example, N number of most popular language section) and those language sections is explained.
The graphic user interface for participating in dialogue is shown in Fig. 3 A, Fig. 3 B and Fig. 4, and in some other of this paper
It is described in example.However, in some implementations, the prompt provided by automatic message transmission system 120 can be by audibly
(via the loudspeaker of the calculating equipment of user) is communicated to user, without showing those prompts.In addition, those realize certain
In a little versions, the input of spoken user interface can be provided via user to provide user's input.As a particular example, one
A little to realize, it does not include that the calculating equipment of any display engages in the dialogue with automatic message transmission system that user, which can use,.
Fig. 5 is the flow chart for showing following exemplary methods 500: the task based on user initiates the dialogue with user, is based on

Be engaged in parameter or all necessary task parameters) whether by frame 552 with task value provided together and/or based in frame 556
And/or customer-furnished natural language inputs determining value to parse at 562.For example, system may determine whether be
Defined in the agreement of task all necessary task parameter definitions value.
If the system determine that not yet parse all task parameters, then system proceed to frame 566 and generate another it is additional in
Hold to parse the task parameters not parsed.In some implementations, additional content is optionally determined based at frame 554 and/or 558
Agreement.For example, one or more special parameters in view of the agreement determined at frame 554 are not by connecing in box 556 and 562
What the input of receipts was specified, additional prompt can be generated to request those special parameters in system.
After generating additional prompt at frame 566, system then proceedes to frame 560 and 562, then true again in frame 564
Surely one or more task parameters (for example, all task parameters or all necessary task parameters) base for the task of frame 552
Whether received another input is resolved at second of iteration in frame 562.
If the system determine that task ginseng can be parsed (in the first time iteration or subsequent iteration of frame 564) at frame 564
Number, then system proceeds to the optional frame 568 that wherein system initiates the execution of task.In some implementations, system can be by task
Other one or more computing systems are transmitted to, together with one or more values of analytic parameter to pass through those computing systems
And/or the execution of task is initiated by receiving one or more people that the user interface from those computing systems exports.
