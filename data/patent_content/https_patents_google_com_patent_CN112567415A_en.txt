Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for a content platform that receives a request to provide a digital component. The request includes information about the user to which the digital component is directed. The future-ized queries are obtained from a provisioning log of a provisioning system configured to execute an existing digital component using provisioning code that directs the digital content to a set of users. The future query is loaded as a data structure into memory of the prediction system. The system uses an instruction set derived from the provisioning code to determine that a similarity between a particular future query and the request exceeds a threshold similarity. The system then generates a predicted output as a response to the request based on the future query exceeding the threshold similarity. The prediction output includes data describing the future supply (provision) of the digital component.
Description
Technical Field
The present description relates to modeling traffic sent over a communication network.
Background
The internet facilitates the exchange of information between users worldwide. This exchange of information enables distribution of content to various users. In some cases, content from multiple different providers may be integrated into a single electronic document to create a composite document. For example, a portion of content included in an electronic document may be selected (or specified) by a publisher of the electronic document. Different portions of the content (e.g., digital components) may be provided by third parties (e.g., entities that are not the publisher of the electronic document and/or that are not authorized to modify the code defining the electronic document).
However, in some cases, the digital component is selected for integration with the electronic document only after presentation of the electronic document has been requested and/or while the electronic document is being rendered. For example, when rendering an electronic document at a client device, machine-executable instructions included in the electronic document may be executed by the client device. The executable instructions may enable the client device to contact one or more remote servers to obtain a digital component to be integrated into an electronic document when rendered at the client device. Given the dynamics and globality of the internet, it is difficult to model and predict the manner in which digital components will be provided to users over time. The present application relates to modeling traffic on computer networks, such as the internet, to allow for the modeling and prediction of the manner in which digital components will be distributed over these networks.
Disclosure of Invention
This document describes techniques for improved prediction of distribution of digital components that may be provided over a network as a response to an electronic request for a particular type of content.
An electronic request may be received from a user/client device interacting with content of a publisher page displayed or rendered on the client device. In some cases, the request may be received from a publisher server hosting the publisher page. The content provider may submit specialized content (e.g., digital components) to the content platform as candidates for responding to the request. The content platform may be configured to manage the use and selection of specialized content in response to requests for such content.
Based on the described techniques, a prediction system of a content platform predicts distribution of a digital component and generates an output indicating a number of users to whom the digital component will be directed by a provisioning (serving) system of the content platform. For example, the prediction system predicts the performance by using computational logic of the search library that substantially matches or completely matches the computational logic executed in the provisioning system of the content platform. The prediction system saves a future (fused) set of user queries in memory and processes the information in the queries against the parameters (e.g., targeting and filtering requirements) of the input requests from the content providers to distribute one or more digital components. The prediction system may determine information in the future user query set that is similar or matches parameters of the input request from the content provider. The prediction system uses information from these similar or matching future queries to generate an output.
The described techniques include configuring program code ("provisioning code") executing at a provisioning system so that the provisioning code can be effectively reused and implemented at a forecasting system to perform accurate impression forecasts. For example, the provisioning codes are uniquely organized such that the overall computational logic of the provisioning codes can be maintained as a repository, such that the provisioning representation of digital marketing (digital marketing) and corresponding repository are easily reversible for efficient implementation in the predictive system. The request from the content provider to distribute one or more digital components may be referred to herein as digital marketing. Digital marketing may include one or more digital components and one or more parameters (e.g., targeting and filtering requirements).
Using these techniques, provisioning code may be organized or structured with fewer (e.g., much fewer) global structures relative to conventional approaches. The provisioning code also does not require a reverse index to be built on existing digital marketing, which may prevent efficient reuse and implementation of the code by the prediction system. Further, the data structure for each marketing is configured to be the same between the supply and forecast systems. This allows the marketing data structure to be easily reused at the forecasting system to construct a marketing representation for each forecasting request, thereby reducing developer burden and enabling the forecasting system to benefit from the development and improvement of the supply system.
In one example embodiment described herein, a computer-implemented method includes receiving a request to provide a digital component to a set of users, where the request includes information about the set of users to whom the digital component is directed. The method obtains a plurality of future queries from a historical provisioning log of a provisioning system based on the received request, the provisioning system configured to provision the existing digital component using a provisioning code that directs the existing digital component to a set of users. For each future query of a plurality of future queries, the method comprises: loading the future query as a data structure into a memory of the prediction system; determining, by the prediction system, a similarity metric between the request and at least the future query based on an instruction set of the prediction system derived from the supply code; and for the particular prospective query, determining that the similarity metric indicates that a similarity between the particular prospective query and the request exceeds a threshold similarity. The method generates, by a prediction system and based on a particular future query, a prediction output as a response to the request, wherein the prediction output includes data describing future offerings of the digital component, and determines a number of users to whom the digital component will be directed by the offering system.
In some implementations, determining the number of users to which the numeric component will be directed can include determining the number of users to which the numeric component will be directed based on a number of particular future queries for which the respective similarity metrics indicate that the similarity between each of the particular future queries and the request exceeds a threshold similarity.
The provisioning code of the provisioning system may include a set of predefined reversible data structures. The instruction set of the prediction system may be derived using a set of predefined invertible data structures included in the provisioning code of the provisioning system. The method may also further include filtering a plurality of future queries for information about the set of users in the request. A plurality of future queries may be filtered using filtering logic in an instruction set of the prediction system. The filtering logic may be derived from a set of predefined invertible data structures. The target representation of the digital component may be generated in response to information about the set of users for a plurality of future query processing requests. The target representation may be generated using target logic in an instruction set of the prediction system, the target logic being derived from a set of predefined invertible data structures. The target representation of the digital component may include information describing demographic attributes of the number of users, a geographic area including the number of users, and/or a time frame in which the digital component is distributed. The target representation of the digital component may include a qualification value that controls the transmission of the digital component. The set of predefined invertible data structures may be configured to provide filtering functionality of the provisioning system. The filtering logic of the prediction system may be configured to simulate, at the prediction system, a filtering function performed by the supply system when the supply system supplies the digital component. The set of predefined reversible data structures may be configured to provide a target function of the provisioning system. The target logic of the prediction system may be configured to simulate, at the prediction system, a target function performed by the supply system when the supply system supplies the digital component.
The prediction system may generate a respective similarity score based on the similarity metric determined for each future query. A respective similarity score may be generated for each future query obtained from the historical supply logs. The respective similarity scores may indicate a match between the plurality of first parameters of the request and a plurality of second parameters of the particular future query obtained from the historical supply log.
Other embodiments of this and other aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, encoded on computer storage devices, configured to perform the actions of the methods. A computing system of one or more computers or hardware circuits may be so configured by virtue of software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof installed on the system that in operation causes the system to perform actions. One or more computer programs may be so configured by virtue of having instructions which, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform actions.
The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular implementations, and can yield one or more of the following advantages. These techniques provide the following advantages: wherein there is no clock skew (skew) in the logic for supplying digital marketing as a response to the request or for predicting future performance of digital components that may be supplied as a response to the request. For example, the same logic and data structures may be used to serve digital components or other content for digital marketing, as well as to predict performance of digital marketing.
These techniques include organizing and structuring provisioning codes of a provisioning system in a manner that enables efficient reuse at a predictive system. The prediction system may be configured to predict an estimated reach (reach) of digital marketing by effectively simulating a function for supplying marketing. This method of predicting the reach of digital marketing provides a more accurate indication of how marketing will be distributed over a network when performed by a provisioning system. This enables the content platform to predict the distribution of specific digital marketing with greater accuracy relative to conventional approaches. Further, the platform accurately predicts the distribution of digital marketing over a network regardless of whether the request to perform marketing includes broad or narrow specifications.
The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features, aspects, and advantages of the present subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

Detailed Description
FIG. 1 illustrates an example computing system 100 for predicting performance of digital marketing. The system 100 generally includes a server 102, a client device 104, a third party interface 116, a network 120, and a content platform 130.
In some implementations, the system 100 and the server 102 can include one or more processors, memory, and data storage devices (e.g., non-transitory storage devices) that collectively form the system 100. The processors of system 100 and server 102 process instructions for execution by the devices and components of the system, including instructions stored in memory or on storage devices for performing the operations/acts described in this document.
For example, execution of the stored instructions may result in performance of the operations described in more detail below. In other embodiments, multiple processors may be used, with multiple memories and types of memory, as appropriate. For example, the devices and components of both system 100 and server 102 may be connected to multiple other computing devices, with each device (e.g., a server array, server bank, or multi-processor system) performing some of the acts or operations associated with the processes or logic flows described in this specification.
In general, the server 102 and other components of the system 100 may be implemented in part by executing program code in the form of an executable application, also referred to as an "app," that may be launched or executed using a client or user device. Upon execution, the app may establish a data connection with the server(s) of the system 100 to transmit and receive data signals to and from the servers.
Client device 104 is an electronic device capable of requesting and receiving resources over network 120. Example client devices 104 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices capable of sending and receiving data over a computer network. For example, the client device 104 may be an auxiliary device or may include a virtual auxiliary application that coordinates the transmission and reception of portions of data via the client device 104. In some implementations, the client device 104 is a smart speaker, e.g., a smart speaker with an integrated display, that sends and receives data in response to voice commands from a user. In other implementations, the client device 104 is an augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) device or an example game console. The client device 104 may generally include a user application, such as a web browser 106, that may be used to display the publisher page 108. The local application executed by the client device 104 may also facilitate the transmission and reception of data over the network 120.
The network 120 may be a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), the internet, or a combination thereof. The network 120 connects the client device 104, the third party interface 116, and the content platform 130 of the server 102. The system 100 may include many different user/client devices 104 that may receive various electronic documents that include different types of digital components transmitted by content servers of the content platform 130 (as described below).
The electronic document may be data that presents a set of content at the client device 104. For example, the publisher page 106 may be an electronic document configured to receive and/or integrate one or more digital components for display at the client device 104. Examples of other electronic documents include web pages, word processing documents, Portable Document Format (PDF) documents, images, videos, search result pages, and feed sources. Native applications (e.g., "apps"), such as applications installed on mobile, tablet, or desktop computing devices, are also examples of electronic documents.
A publisher of a given electronic document may maintain a data source for populating portions of the electronic document. The electronic documents may include tags or scripts that cause the client device 104 to request content from a data source when a given electronic document is processed (e.g., rendered or executed) by the client device 104. The client device 104 integrates the content obtained from the data source into a given electronic document to create a composite electronic document that includes the content obtained from the data source.
The electronic document may include a tag or script for obtaining the digital component. In these cases, the tag or script is executed by the client device 104 when a given electronic document is processed by the client device 104. Execution of the script causes the client device 104 to generate a request for a digital component (referred to as a "request for content 122") that is transmitted over the network 120 to the content platform 130. Content platform 130 may use the information in request 122 to select one or more digital components that are provided (e.g., as "reply 124") in response to request 122 for content.
The third party interface 116 can be an example user/mobile computing device, a client computer, or any combination of software, middleware, or related front-end components. The interface 116 is configured to exchange data communications with the content platform 130. For example, the interface 116 may provide a marketing request 118, the request 118 including details regarding digital marketing to direct specialized content (e.g., digital components) to a set of users. The details may include a set of parameters, such as targeting and filtering requirements, that specify the type of content to be included in the marketing and the particular type of user to which the marketing is directed. In some implementations, marketing request 118 describes or includes particular specialized content (e.g., digital components) to be included as part of digital marketing.
Digital marketing may be a collection of advertisement/content groups (e.g., advertisements, keywords, and bid/qualification values) that share budgets, have common or different location goals, or have common or different topics. Digital marketing may be used to render organized content that indicates categories of products or services offered by a particular entity (such as a company or merchant). The ad group may contain one or more ads, such as a numeric component, that target a shared set of keywords.
The digital component may be discrete units of digital content or digital information (e.g., a video clip, an audio clip, a multimedia clip, an image, text, or another unit of content). The digital component may be electronically stored in the physical memory device as a single file or collection of files, and the digital component may take the form of a video file, audio file, multimedia file, image file, or text file, and include advertising information such that the advertisement is a type of digital component.
The phrase "digital component" may refer to a portion of digital content that is integrated in the publisher page 108 and rendered to a user via the client device 104. In some implementations, the digital content can be integrated in the publisher page 108 by way of an advertisement or content impression (impression). For example, an impression corresponds to obtaining an advertisement or digital content from a source and rendering the content at the publisher page 108. In some implementations, when digital content is integrated at the publisher page 108, an impression is treated as one impression each time it is acquired or viewed by a user.
The content platform 130 generates a report output 170 (described below) that may be received at the interface 116. The report output 170 can include data describing details regarding future execution of digital marketing. For example, the report output 170 can include information about the expected performance of digital marketing. The expected performance may indicate a number of users to whom digital marketing will be directed during execution of the marketing using one or more systems of the content platform 130.
The content platform 130 includes a provisioning system 140 and a prediction system 150. The provisioning system 140 generally includes data for digital marketing 146, as well as prior requests/queries 148 relating to other digital marketing that the provisioning system 140 may have previously performed. The history log 144 corresponds to the prior request/query 148 and may be provided as an output of the provisioning system 140. The provisioning system 140 may store or have access to data describing requirements (e.g., targeting or filtering requirements) of the existing digital marketing 146. As described in more detail below, the data describing the requirements may be stored or accessed as a data structure of content platform 130. The provisioning system 140 is configured to provision content of one or more digital marketings 146, which may include digital marketing indicated via the new marketing request 118. For example, the provisioning system 140 processes information in a user query according to marketing requirements ("marketing data structures") corresponding to a given digital marketing.
The prediction system 150 generally includes prediction code 155 and memory 160, the memory 160 storing a set of future queries 165 obtained from the example data processing pipeline. The data processing pipeline uses data obtained from the historical log 144 provided as output by the provisioning system 140 to generate a set of future queries. The techniques described in this document may be used to implement an improved impression prediction system 150 configured to generate a predicted or predicted output for determining an expected performance of digital marketing.
The prediction system 150 is configured to load a set of user queries (and/or requests) for future journaling into the memory 160. Each query or user query in the set of user queries for future logging is loaded into memory 160 as a data structure. When the content platform 130 receives a request 118 to schedule (or execute) a new digital marketing, the prediction system 150 is configured to obtain all eligible (eligible) queries for the new marketing using a set of one or more future queries 165. For example, the prediction system 150 may obtain qualified queries based on similarity metrics between the request and the set of future queries 165. The similarity metric is determined at least for data in the information processing request 118 in the future query 165. In some examples, request 118 is a predictive request that seeks to determine the performance of digital marketing that is scheduled to be performed at a future date. Prediction system 150 uses an instruction set of prediction code 155 derived from provisioning code 142 to determine a similarity metric.
The server 102 generates an example report output 170 using the content platform 130. The reporting output 170 can be a predictive output that includes data describing the future execution of the digital marketing. The prediction output 170 can indicate the reach amount and a particular qualification (e.g., bid or price) that a particular digital marketing will offer. For example, prediction output 170 may indicate that for a particular user demographic, a particular marketing will achieve 1000 impressions within two days of performing the marketing.
The reach of digital marketing provides an indication of the number of users in the digital audience who actually received or interacted with the marketing content. In some cases, digital marketing seeks to provide targeted content to groups of users of digital audiences having a particular set of demographic characteristics (e.g., age and gender). In other cases, an administrator of a plurality of digital marketings may want to know the respective reach and demographic details of the number of users receiving the content of each of the plurality of marketings.
The content platform 130 may perform a computational process to suggest or forecast an adjusted qualification value or bid amount based on data included in the output predictions generated by the prediction system 150. In some implementations, the predicted adjusted eligibility values enable content providers to spend monetary resources more efficiently to trigger the transmission of digital components, e.g., to increase their probability of achieving a given outcome or monetary benefit.
The qualification value can be a monetary amount, such as a bid amount, that an entity (e.g., content or advertisement provider) will spend to transmit a numeric component of advertising marketing to achieve a desired conversion (conversion) result. The conversion results may result in earning a particular target score or achieving certain business/monetary benefits. In some implementations, the conversion result is implemented when a user converts or purchases an item after interacting with the digital component presented at the client device 104.
FIG. 2 illustrates a functional block 200 of example provisioning logic and example prediction logic of content platform 130. The function block 200 indicates that the provisioning code 142 includes a search library 220 that accesses a list of marketing data structures 215 and performs operations to generate an advertisement/content candidate set 225.
For example, the repository 220 of the provisioning code 142 is configured to include a set of predefined reversible data structures for storing requirements in a request to perform digital marketing. The data structure may also include information about the user query 122, which may be served in reply 124 with specialized content (e.g., advertisements or numeric components) for marketing. The search repository 220 interacts with the list of marketing data structures 215 to generate a set of candidate advertisements 225. The corpus 220 may perform filtering and targeting (targeting) on the set of queries 122 using filtering and targeting requirements (e.g., advertiser constraints) for digital marketing, where the requirements are included in the request 118 to perform digital marketing.
The function block 200 also indicates that the predictive code 155 includes a list of prospective marketing data structures 255 and a search repository 260 that interacts with the prospective marketing data structures 255 to generate the prediction/report output 170. The future marketing data structure 255 also interacts with a planned or future digital marketing set 280. The reporting output may include information for determining an expected performance of the digital marketing of the request 118, such as information indicating the number of users to whom the digital marketing will be directed during actual execution of the provisioning system 140 rather than predicting execution of the digital marketing. The repository 260 includes a set of instructions derived from the supply code 142.
For example, using a set of predefined invertible data structures included in the provisioning code 142, the prediction system 150 derives a set of instructions for performing the prediction operations in the same or substantially the same manner as the provisioning system 140 performs its provisioning operations. The derived instruction set of the repository 260 permits the prediction system 150 to emulate, copy, or otherwise simulate particular computing operations performed by the repository 220 of the supply code 142. For example, the computing operation may be an operation performed at provisioning system 140 to transmit or provision the digital component to client device 104 as a reply 124 to query 122.
The reversible (e.g., adaptable, adjustable, reusable, etc.) data structure of the provisioning code 142 is uniquely configured as a logical structure within the provisioning code 142 to permit reversible and reuse within the predictive code 155. For example, the provisioning code 142 is uniquely organized so that its overall computational logic can be maintained as a search repository. The search library is organized such that the supply representation and corresponding search logic of the digital marketing are readily reversible for implementation at the forecasting system. In one embodiment, the reversible data structure corresponds to a particular format or construct for organizing, managing, or storing data in a manner that enables efficient access and processing of the data. For example, the data structure may be a data array, a data tree, or a data file of a particular type that is adaptive to the use of the supply code 142 or the forecast code 155.
Provisioning code 142 (including its search library) may be organized or structured with fewer (e.g., much fewer) global structures relative to traditional structured approaches. The provisioning code 142 also does not use the reverse index built on existing digital marketing. Such reverse indexing may prevent efficient reuse and implementation of the provisioning code by the prediction system 150. In some embodiments, each marketing data structure is configured to be identical between the supply system 140 and the forecast system 150. This allows prediction code 155 to easily reuse marketing data structure 215 to construct each prediction request marketing representation, e.g., for inclusion in output 170.
The search library 260 includes filter logic 265, target logic 270, and a score generator 275. The filtering logic 265 may be configured to filter or remove queries from the set of future queries based on the filtering constraints of the request 118. For example, the future query may indicate that the user is a female located in the United kingdom, while the filtering constraint of request 118 specifies that the content is directed to a male in mountain View City of California. Similarly, targeting logic 270 may be configured to obtain a particular set of future queries based on targeting requirements of request 118. For example, a future-query set may be generated using user information from 18-25 year old males residing in the metropolitan city based on target data for a particular set of users, where the target data is specified by the request 118. In some examples, a particular set of requirements may be implemented as a target constraint, a filtering constraint, or a combination of each. For example, demographic information for digital marketing may be implemented primarily as targeting constraints using targeting logic 270, while a subset of the demographic information is implemented as filtering constraints using filtering logic 265. One basic example of a filtering constraint may involve the filtering logic 265 being configured to determine that a first user's device supports only digital components having a data format X (e.g., JavaScript), while a different second user's device supports only digital components having a data format Y (e.g., Dart).
The generated set of future queries may correspond to the target representation. For example, the prediction system 150 is configured to generate a targeted representation of digital marketing in response to information about a set of users (e.g., male, 18-25 years old) for a plurality of future query processing requests 118. The target representation is generated using target logic 270 in the instruction set of the prediction system 150. In some embodiments, target logic 270 is derived from a set of predefined invertible data structures. In some implementations, the target representation can include a qualification value that controls the transmission of one or more digital components of the digital marketing indicated by the request 118.
Score generator 275 is configured to generate score data, such as similarity or match scores, for each future query stored for one or more future marketing data structures 255. The score data may indicate a similarity metric between the targets and filtering requirements included in the request 118 and the user information of each respective future query. In some implementations, the similarity between the request 118 and the future-ized queries (e.g., stored as the future marketing data structure 255) is characterized by a respective match score (e.g., a score of 1.0) or a respective similarity score (e.g., a score ranging from 0.6 to 0.9).
For example, the score generator 275 may generate a similarity score based on matching or substantially similar data items that exist between the request 118 and information in future queries. The matching or substantially similar data items may be the result of comparing the filtering constraints and the target requirements included in the request 118 using the filtering logic 265 and the target logic 270. In some cases, score generator 275 generates a corresponding match score (1.0) to indicate an exact match between the data in request 118 and the data included in each future query. For example, the filtering logic 265 may determine that the request 118 includes age-limited content that is only suitable for consumption by a user of at least 21 years of age. The filtering logic 265 may identify or determine whether the user information in the future query indicates that the user is at least 21 years old. In this case, the score generator 275 generates a 1.0 match for this discrete data item related to age-restricted content, because the user data of the future query indicates that the user satisfies the filtering constraint.
In other cases, the score generator 275 generates a corresponding similarity score (e.g., 0.8) to indicate similar or substantially similar relevance between the data in the request 118 and the data included in each future query. For example, target logic 270 may determine that the target requirement of request 118 is a user that is 20-25 years old and interested in professional basketball. Goal logic 270 may identify or determine that user information for future queries indicates that the user is 25 years old and is interested in college basketball, semi-professional basketball, or developing basketball leagues affiliated with professional basketball teams. In this case, the score generator 275 may generate an overall similarity score of 0.8 for these discrete data items, as the user data of the future query indicates that the user only partially meets the target requirements in the request 118. In some embodiments, score generator 275 and filter logic 265 and target logic 275 are logical constructs shared between supply code 142 and forecast code 155. For example, each of the score generator 275, filter logic 265, and target logic 275 may be configured to provide computing functionality that is shared between the provisioning system 140 and the prediction system 150.
In some implementations, the content platform 130 uses an example log data extraction routine of the predicted code 155 to obtain and load a future query 165 into the memory 160. Based on the filtering logic 265 and targeting logic 270, the prediction system 150 may extract advertisement/content query data from the future-style marketing data structure 255 to build or generate an appropriate future-style query file. When the outputs of the filter logic 265 and the target logic 270 are processed or scored by the prediction system 150 using the score generator 275, a future query file may be generated. In some embodiments, the future query file is generated by an offline computing process that analyzes the historical log using seasonal logic to predict trends and/or data patterns for projecting data from the historical log into the future. The future-ized query file may be generated by an offline computing process without invoking the retrieval logic of provisioning code 142, thereby conserving resources of provisioning code 142. In some embodiments, the future Query file represents advertisement or content Query data that is stored using a data structure that allows for quick or fast Query data-to-campaigns matches when the prediction system 150 is used to predict when a particular marketing will perform when executed using the provisioning system 140. In some cases, the future marketing data structure 255 interacts with various planned or future digital marketing 280 to predict how a particular marketing will perform with reference to the requirements of one or more marketing 280 that have been planned (e.g., using the supply system 140) to execute.
The prediction system 150 may store the advertisement query data in RAM using a root-leaf architecture to allow for fast matching of the query data to marketing. In some cases, future queries corresponding to the ad query data may be stored within a plurality of respective data fragments in memory 160. The prediction system 150 may populate a plurality of assigned impressions for a given requested marketing based on the calculated outputs of the filter logic 265, the target logic 270, and the score generator 275.
Fig. 3 illustrates an example process 300 associated with predicting performance of digital marketing. Process 300 may be implemented using one or more of the computing elements of system 100 described above, as well as other components and instructions described in this document.
As described above, the provisioning system 140 is configured to perform existing digital marketing using the provisioning code 142 that directs the digital components of the existing digital marketing to the set of users. For example, the provisioning system 140 may provision or transmit a digital component including motion-related images and video depicting prominent male and female athletes as the reply 124. The reply may be in response to a query 122 received at the content platform 130 from the client device 104 that links to women identified as current or previous college athletes between the ages of 18 and 23.
For a particular prospective query, prediction system 150 determines that the similarity metric indicates that the similarity between the prospective query and the request exceeds a threshold similarity (340). Prediction system 150 uses prediction code 155 to determine that future queries and requests exceed a threshold similarity. In some implementations, the corpus 260 determines, using the score generator 275, that the similarity between the respective future queries and the requests exceeds a threshold similarity (e.g., indicated by a 0.7 threshold similarity score). For example, as described above, the prediction code 155 uses the score generator 275 to calculate a similarity or match score based on the output of the filter logic 265 or the target logic 270. These outputs indicate whether the user information of the future query satisfies the goal or filtering constraints included in the request 118.
In response to the request 118 and based on the particular future query, the prediction system 150 generates a prediction output (350). The predicted output includes data describing future execution of the digital marketing and is used to determine an expected performance of the digital marketing. The prediction system 150 determines an expected performance of the digital marketing based on data values included in the prediction output, such as a user reach estimate or user demographics (360). The expected performance indicates the number of users to which the digital marketing will be directed during the execution of the digital marketing by the provisioning system 140. The forecasting system 150 is configured to forecast the performance of the digital marketing indicated by the request 118 by using the same (e.g., substantially the same) data structure used by the provisioning system 140. In some embodiments, system 100 generates reach report output 170 using the data values of the prediction output. The reporting output 170 may be provided for output at a display of a computing device, such as a laptop or tablet computing device. The reporting output 170 can be used to render the expected performance data for digital marketing at a display of the computing device.
The prediction system 150 may also analyze historical or bid price values of a set of prospective queries to suggest a price value for controlling the transmission of digitally marketed advertising content, and to determine an accurate prediction of the amount (volume) or reach of user queries to which the marketed content may be transmitted in return. For example, the predictive code 155 can scan the future marketing data structure 255 to identify bids for various values or clicks that other content managers have used to control the transmission of their content or that the content manager has previously spent (e.g., paid for) to cause the user to interact with the numerical component of their marketing.
Fig. 4 illustrates another example process 400 associated with predicting performance of digital marketing. Process 400 may be implemented using one or more of the computing elements of system 100 described above, as well as other components and instructions described in this document.
The prediction system 150 filters a plurality of future queries for information about the set of users in the request based on filtering constraints specified by the request (420). The plurality of future queries are filtered using filtering logic in the instruction set of the prediction system 150 and filtering constraints of the request 118. The filtering logic may be derived from a set of predefined invertible data structures that match the data structure of the provisioning system 140.
For example, the targeting requirements may specify that the content of the digital marketing must be directed to a user query 122 for males between 18 and 25 years of age and residing in the United states. However, the filtering requirement may specify that the content to be directed to the user query 122 contains data items related to alcohol and dirty words. In this example, the provisioning system 150 will filter out user queries 122 that indicate that the source of the query is a user between 18 and 20 years of age and below the legal age of alcohol consumption.
The prediction system 150 generates a target representation for digital marketing in response to information about the set of users for the plurality of future query processing requests 118 (430). In some embodiments, the target representation is generated using target logic in the instruction set of the prediction system 150 and based on the target requirements specified by the request 118. The target logic may be derived from a set of predefined invertible data structures that match the data structure of the provisioning system 140.
The targeting representation of digital marketing may include information describing demographic attributes of the number of users, a geographic area including the number of users, and a time frame in which to perform digital marketing. In some embodiments, the targeted representation of digital marketing includes a qualification value that controls transmission of one or more digital components of digital marketing.
The prediction system 150 generates a corresponding match score based on the similarity metric determined for the query (440). In some implementations, the similarity metric between the request and each respective future query is characterized by a respective match score. A respective similarity or match score may be generated for each future query obtained using data from the historical supply log 144. In some cases, score generator 275 generates a corresponding match score to indicate an exact match between the data in request 118 and the data included in each future query. For example, the respective similarity scores may indicate substantial correlation between a plurality of first parameters of the request 118 and a plurality of second parameters of a particular future query obtained from the historical supply logs.
