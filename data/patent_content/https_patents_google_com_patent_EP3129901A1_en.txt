Definitions
- the disclosed subject matter relates to methods, systems, and media for searching for video content. More particularly, the disclosed subject matter relates to searching for and presenting video content responsive to a search query based on audio content associated with the video content.
- Conventional video search systems allow a user to search for videos responsive to a search query based on textual metadata associated with each video (e.g., titles, tags, descriptions, etc.). For example, if a user inputs a search query "Laplace,” a conventional video search system returns a list of links to videos with the word "Laplace" contained in their metadata, such as a video entitled "Laplace.”
- a conventional video search system may not provide a user with a satisfactory search experience for several reasons.
- a conventional search system may return irrelevant search results by searching for videos using textual metadata that is not representative of the content of the video.
- a user may intend to search for video content in which the word "Laplace” is spoken, such as a video clip including a lecture on the Laplace transform.
- search results generated based on textual metadata of videos, such as videos entitled "Laplace” may be irrelevant to the search query inputted by the user.
- a conventional video search system may return the same results responsive to a particular search query when a user resubmits the search query. That is, the user may have to continuously modify the search query and resubmit the modified search query to the video search system to view different search results. This can be a time consuming and frustrating procedure for the user, especially when the user is unaware of the search terms that may lead to the video content that the user is looking for.
- a system for searching for video content comprising: at least one hardware processor that is configured to: receive a search query including at least one search term; identify a plurality of video segments that match the search query, wherein each of the plurality of video segments is associated with a transcript that includes the search term; select a first set of video segments from the plurality of video segments; generate a first composite video by combining the first set of video segments; and cause the first composite video to be presented.
- a method for searching for video content comprising: receiving a search query including at least one search term; identifying a plurality of video segments that match the search query, wherein each of the plurality of video segments is associated with a transcript that includes the search term; selecting a first set of video segments from the plurality of video segments; generating, using a hardware processor, a first composite video by combining the first set of video segments; and causing the first composite video to be presented.
- a non- transitory computer-readable medium containing computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the process to perform a method for searching for video content comprising: receiving a search query including at least one search term; identifying a plurality of video segments that match the search query, wherein each of the plurality of video segments is associated with a transcript that includes the search term; selecting a first set of video segments from the plurality of video segments; generating a first composite video by combining the first set of video segments; and causing the first composite video to be presented.
- a system for searching for video content comprising: means for receiving a search query including at least one search term; means for identifying a plurality of video segments that match the search query, wherein each of the plurality of video segments is associated with a transcript that includes the search term; means for selecting a first set of video segments from the plurality of video segments; means for generating a first composite video by combining the first set of video segments; and means for causing the first composite video to be presented.
- the system further comprises: means for receiving a request to generate an updated composite video; means for selecting a second set of video segments from the plurality of video segments; means for generating a second composite video by combining the second set of video segments; and means for causing the second composite video to be presented on the display.
- the system further comprises: means for associating the search query with a plurality of keywords based at least in part on the search term; means for identifying a portion of a transcript that includes at least one of the plurality of keywords; means for identifying a first timestamp that is associated with the portion of the transcript; means for identifying a video associated with the transcript; and means for identifying a segment of the video based at least in part on the first timestamp.
- the system further comprises: means for identifying a second timestamp that is associated with the portion of the transcript; and means for identifying the segment of the video based at least in part on the second timestamp, wherein the first timestamp corresponds to a start time of the segment of the video and wherein the second timestamp corresponds to an end time of the segment of the video.
- the segment of the video is one of the plurality of video segments that match the search query.
- the system further comprises: means for determining a matching score for each of the plurality of video segments; and means for selecting the first set of video segments from the plurality of video segments based at least in part on a plurality of matching scores associated with the plurality of video segments. [0016] In some embodiments, the system further comprises means for selecting the first set of video segments based on a pseudorandom function.

- mechanisms (which can include methods, systems, and media) for searching for video content are provided.
- the mechanisms can be used in a variety of applications.
- the mechanisms can be used to search for video content responsive to a textual search query based on audio content associated with the video content.
- the mechanisms in response to receiving a search query "vector image,” the mechanisms can access a database and identify a set of video segments in which the phrase "vector image(s)" is mentioned.
- the mechanisms can receive a user selection of one or more videos (e.g., a video including a lecture on graphics) and identify portions of the videos in which the search query or keywords associated with the search query are mentioned (e.g., "vector image").
- these mechanisms can be used to present search results responsive to a search query for video content in the form of a video including multiple video segments that match the search query.
- the mechanisms can combine the set of video segments into a single video and, in some embodiments, can automatically playback the video as a search result that is responsive to the search query.
- these mechanisms can receive a search query for video content.
- the mechanisms can launch a client application on a computing device, such as a mobile phone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a wearable computer, a television, etc.
- the mechanisms can then present multiple user interfaces that allow a user to input a search query using a keypad, a user input device (e.g., a microphone, a keyboard, a remote control, a directional pad, etc.), and/or any other suitable input mechanism.
- the mechanisms can associate a search query with one or more keywords upon receiving the search query. For example, the mechanisms can analyze the search query and parse the search query into multiple search terms. The mechanisms can then identify each of the search terms as a keyword associated with the search query. Additionally or alternatively, the mechanisms can identify a synonym and/or acronym of a search term, and/or any other suitable terms relating to one or more of the search terms as keywords associated with the search query.
- the mechanisms can search for video segments that match the search query.
- a video segment can be regarded as a match to a search query and thus a matching video segment when a transcript corresponding to the video segment contains one or more keywords associated with the search query.
- the mechanisms can access a database storing transcripts associated with video content and can identify portions of the transcripts that contain one or more keywords associated with the search query.
- the mechanisms can identify one or more timestamps associated with that portion of the transcript, such as a timestamp that indicates the portion of the transcript that a particular word is spoken in a video, a timestamp that indicates the start or the end of the presentation of a video segment corresponding to the portion of the transcript, etc.
- the mechanisms can then identify a matching video segment based on the timestamp(s) associated with the portion of the transcript. For example, the mechanisms can identify a video corresponding to the transcript that matches the search query based on an index system that maps the transcripts to the videos. The mechanisms can then identify a segment of the video that is defined by the timestamp(s) as a matching video segment.
- the mechanisms can select a subset of matching video segments upon identifying a set of video segments that match the search query. For example, the mechanisms can select the subset of matching video segments based on relevance, popularity, recency, ordering of the search terms within the search query, and/or any other suitable criterion or criteria. As another example, the mechanisms can allow a user to select a subset of matching video segments by presenting one or more suitable user interfaces using the client application.
- the mechanisms can generate a composite video by combining the subset of matching video segments.
- the mechanisms can combine a first matching video segment and a second matching video segment by concatenating the last frame of the first matching video segment and the first frame of the second matching video segment, adding a blank frame between the last frame of the first matching video segment and the first frame of the second matching video segment, and/or in any other suitable manner.
- the mechanisms can present the composite video to the user as a search result responsive to the search query.
- the mechanisms can cause the composite video to be played automatically upon generating the composite video.
- the mechanisms can present an image or a snippet representative of the composite video and/or any other suitable information about the composite video.
- the mechanisms can then cause the composite video to be presented in response to receiving a request to playback the composite video (e.g., a user selection of a "play" button using a user input device).
- the mechanisms can provide a user with updated search results responsive to a search query without receiving the same search query from the user. For example, in response to receiving a user request for an updated search result, the mechanisms can select an updated set of matching video segments and generate an updated composite video by combining the updated set of matching video segments.
