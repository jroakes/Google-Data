Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to methods and systems for information retrieval.
- the present invention relates particularly to methods and systems for ranking implicit search results.
- Conventional search engines receive a search query from a user and execute a search against a global index. Such conventional search engines typically use one or more conventional methods for performing a search. For example, one known method, described in an article entitled “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, assigns a degree of importance to a document, such as a web page, based on the link structure of the web.
- the search results are often presented in a list format, comprising article identifiers and brief snippets about the documents in a web page that can be resized.
- the user has access to other information stored on the user's local machine or on other storage media accessible via a network that is relevant to the user's current contextual state. For example, if a user is working on a document regarding a particular subject, information about the subject may be stored on the user's hard drive or in a global index accessible to the user. In order to access this information, the user issues an explicit search query in an application, such as a web search page. The information is provided to the user as a result set. Thus, the user shifts focus from the document that the user is working on to perform the search.
- the user may be unaware or may not remember that information is available regarding a particular subject. In such a case, the user may not perform an explicit search and thus, will not have access to the potentially relevant information.
- Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for ranking implicit search results.
- a method comprising receiving an event, the event comprising user interaction with an article on a client device, wherein the article is capable of being associated with at least one of a plurality of client applications, extracting at least one keyword from the event, generating a query based at least in part on at least that one keyword, performing a search based at least in part on the query to determine a result set, wherein the result set comprises one or more article identifiers associated with articles comprising the at least one keyword, and determining a ranking for each of the one or more article identifiers comprising the result set is described.
- Another embodiment of the present invention comprises receiving an event, the event comprising user interaction with an article on a client device, wherein the article is capable of being associated with at least one of a plurality of client applications, extracting at least one keyword from the event, generating a query based at least in part on the at least one keyword, performing a search based at least in part on the query to determine a result set, wherein the result set comprises one or more article identifiers associated with articles comprising the at least one keyword, filtering the article identifiers in the result set based on a threshold, and causing the display of the result set.

- the result set 134 comprises one or more article identifiers.
- An article identifier may be, for example, a uniform resource locator (URL), a file name, a link, an icon, a path for a local file, or anything else that identifies an article.
- an article identifier comprises a URL associated with an article.
- the server device 150 has previously performed a crawl of the network 106 to locate articles, such as web pages, stored at other devices or systems connected to the network 106 , and indexed the articles in memory 162 or on another data storage device.
- server device 104 may comprise a single physical or logical server.
- the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and is used to explain the exemplary methods shown in FIG. 2 .
- Methods according to the present invention may be implemented by, for example, a processor-executable program code stored on a computer-readable medium.
- Embodiments of the present invention are capable of generating implicit queries based on a user's contextual state.
- the results of an implicit query are displayed to the user in a content display window.
- the results may be updated periodically as the user's contextual state changes.
- the user is working on a word document concerning budgeting.
- a query implicit builder (“QUIB”) one component of the query system 132 shown in FIG. 1 , requests and receives events related to the document.
- the QUIB generates queries from the events and presents the results of the queries to the user.
- Events comprise historical, contextual, and real-time events.
- contextual events are time sensitive and may be of higher significance even after an elapsed period of time.
- Contextual events relate to actions that are occurring now or have occurred within a short time frame, e.g., the last ten words that the user typed.
- real-time events are less time-sensitive, e.g., the user printed or opened a file.
- Events may be tracked over multiple sessions. For example, in one embodiment, if a user has opened a web page repeatedly during the last several times the user has used a client machine, the query system 132 tracks the usage for each of those sessions by tracking the events associated with the usage. In one such embodiment, access during a particular session is down-weighted or promoted based on the period of time that has elapsed since the session. In other words, events associated with more recent accesses of a specific article are weighted more heavily than those occurring less recently.
- the events may include information, such as the last twenty words the user typed, the last sentence the user typed, the text nearby the cursor (e.g. the text up to x words before and y words after), the currently active buffer (e.g., the entire active document), the selected or highlighted buffer, the buffer in the clipboard, or other information relevant to the user's context.
- the query system 132 extracts keywords from the information and generates a search query to be submitted to a search engine.
- the query system 132 creates and executes the query as if the user had explicitly typed the keywords in a search interface.
- the query system 132 learns from a user's behavior whether or not certain data streams or keywords are particularly relevant.
- the query system 132 may rely on click-throughs within the content display window to determine results in which the user exhibits particular interest. For example, if the content display includes a link that has been shown to a user multiple times but has not been clicked, the link may be eliminated from the content display.
- the data streams, query types, or keywords that resulted in the link being displayed may be down-weighted in subsequent analysis.
- the user clicks the link this typically indicates that the user is interested in the article, and can result in promoting the data streams, query types, or keywords that resulted in the link being displayed.
- click-through data can be used to identify a type preference for the user 112 a .
- a type preference can comprise, for example, a file format preferred by the user 112 a .
- the query system 132 can promote future identifiers associated with articles in HTML format and down-weight articles in PDF format.
- Click-through data can also be used to identify a preference for a particular method of generating keywords.
- the query system 132 can promote future identifiers associated with articles generated from the most recently typed 10 words, and down-weight articles associated with text from the clipboard.
- the query system 132 shown in FIG. 1 utilizes multiple data streams as sources for generating search queries. For example, if the user is editing a document, the query system 132 may use the last 20 words that were typed, as well as the entire document to extract keywords and generate search queries. The query system 132 generates a search query for each data stream and combines the result sets corresponding to each search query for display to the user.
- one embodiment comprises receiving an event, the event comprising user interaction with an article on a client device, wherein the article is capable of being associated with at least one of a plurality of client applications, extracting at least one keyword from the event generating a query based at least in part on the at least one keyword performing a search based at least in part on the query to determine a result set, wherein the result set comprises one or more article identifiers associated with articles comprising the at least one keyword, and determining a ranking for each of the one or more article identifiers comprising the result set.
- ranking the article identifiers can be based at least in part on a user preference.
- the user preference can be based at least in part on click-through data or file type.
- ranking the article identifiers can be based at least in part on meta-data.
- the meta-data can comprise at least one of bolding, highlighting, italicizing, font color, or heading data.
- ranking the article identifiers is based at least in part on a term frequency and a document frequency.
- the ranking can be proportional to the log of the sum of a first constant plus the term frequency and inversely proportional to the log of the sum of a second constant plus the document frequency.
- both the first and second constants have the value one. In another embodiment, they have different values.
- the document frequency is not used directly but is hashed into a pre-defined table which maps ranges of document frequency into constants used for ranking article identifiers.
- the ranking is based at least in part on a number data.
- the number data can comprise a number of letters in the keyword or whether a keyword comprises numbers.
- the ranking is based at least in part on capitalization data.
- the ranking is based at least in part on source data.
- the keywords can be associated with keyword ranking scores.
- the ranking of article identifiers can be based at least in part on the keyword ranking scores.
- ranking the article identifiers can comprise assigning a higher ranking to article identifiers associated with articles containing higher ranked keywords.
- extracting at least one keyword from an event comprises extracting a keyword from at least one of recently typed words, an entire document, a selected portion of a document, or words surrounding a cursor.
- extracting at least one keyword from an event comprises determining names. Determining names can comprise crawling at least one article.
- a method comprises receiving an event, the event comprising user interaction with an article on a client device, wherein the article is capable of being associated with at least one of a plurality of client applications, extracting at least one keyword from the event, generating a query based at least in part on the at least one keyword, performing a search based at least in part on the query to determine a result set, wherein the result set comprises one or more article identifiers associated with articles comprising the at least one keyword, filtering the article identifiers in the result set based on a threshold, and causing the display of the result set.
- the threshold can comprise a number of keywords or a minimum weighting score.
- the minimum weighting score can be based at least in part on a number of keywords multiplier, a source multiplier, and a time multiplier.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method 200 for processing an implicit query.
- the method 200 begins in block 202 , wherein the query system 132 receives a contextual event 202 .
- the contextual event is an occurrence that is captured by the capture processor 124 and can be used to update the user's contextual state and can be indexed and stored in the event database in data store 140 to provide information for future queries.
- the method 200 proceeds to block 204 , wherein the query system 132 extracts keywords from the event in order to generate one or more search queries.
- the keywords may comprise, for example, words that the user has recently typed, words that occur in a document or buffer, words that are highlighted or selected, words placed into the clipboard, words that are identified as proper names, words that are typed as explicit queries by the user, or may comprise any other type of keyword that the system is able to identify.
- the keywords may comprise all of the words in the event.
- the query system 132 may extract keywords from any of a number of data streams.
- Data streams can comprise, for example, sources of implicit query keywords including one or more of the following: the most recently typed n words where n is on the order of ten; the n words around the user's cursor where n is around ten; words in the current selection; words from the current document (e.g., one such method selects the most frequently occurring words); previous explicit queries executed by the user or submitted by the user; clipboard content; and a list of all the names of people with which the user has communicated; a list of e-mail addresses and/or instant messenger “buddy names”; and a list of important terms or phrases for the user.
- sources of implicit query keywords including one or more of the following: the most recently typed n words where n is on the order of ten; the n words around the user's cursor where n is around ten; words in the current selection; words from the current document (e.g., one such method selects the most frequently occurring words); previous explicit queries executed by the user or submitted by the user; clipboard content; and
- Words from a current document can comprise, for example, words from an entire buffer, e.g., an entire Microsoft Word document.
- the query system extracts keywords from explicit queries that are captured by an application on the client 102 a , such as a Winsock Layered Service Provider (“LSP”).
- LSP Winsock Layered Service Provider
- the Winsock LSP captures the query as an event and provides a query, either the original or a modified version, to another search engine application, such as search engine 122 on the client 102 a .
- the local search engine 122 processes the query substantially simultaneously with the global search engine.
- the query system 132 may use identified terms to generate search queries.
- An identified term is a term which the user uses in a manner that has been noted as being particularly relevant to the user's contextual state.
- an identified term may comprise the name of a person to which the user recently directed an e-mail.
- the names need not be recent or popular; for example, the names may include all e-mail addresses, etc. captured for a user. Even old, rare names may be useful to identify. For example, if a user has only sent or received a single message to a particular person several years ago, it may still be desirable to recall the message when the sender/recipient e-mail address is recognized.
- the names are limited to recent and/or popular names to limit the amount of data required to store the names.
- the query system 132 can examine the user's e-mail system and determine the names of users to which the user recently or often sends e-mail messages. The query system can extract all names associated with the user's e-mail system, or can extract names based on recipients of an e-mail or names appearing in the e-mail, for example. In another embodiment, the query system also correlates this information with the subject and/or text of e-mail or other correspondence.
- the query system can identify the organization and content of interest to the person.
- the query system 132 can extract names from a list of contacts comprising, for example, a set of names and associated telephone numbers and e-mails.
- the query system 132 can extract keywords based on identified proper names.
- the query system 132 can identify proper names, for example, by identifying capitalized words not at the beginning of a sentence.
- the query system can also search for proper names by crawling articles located on the client device 102 a or on the network 106 . After determining proper names by crawling articles, the query system 132 can store a list of proper names in the data store 140 or other suitable location. The names can then be used by the query system 132 to identify keywords to extract from an article.
- the query system 132 may also extract keywords from a selection or from a clipboard buffer.
- a selection can comprise, for example, the text or objects that are highlighted in the currently active application.
- the user 112 a can select a portion of text to modify and the query system 132 can extract keywords from the selected or highlighted portion of text.
- the clipboard buffer can comprise, for example, information that was previously selected and copied or cut by the user 112 a.
- the query system 132 can also extract keywords based on a list of common words. For example, the query system 132 can extract the following sentence from a text document: “What is the budget for the second quarter of 2003?” Not all the words that appear in this sentence are necessary for a search query. For example, many of the words in the sentence are filler words. Filler words include words such as “the” which are determiners and are not necessarily relevant to any particular query. These words are filtered out before the search query is submitted to the search engine 122 . The original sentence may be maintained to compare to future content extracts. According to some embodiments, filtering words can comprise, for example, comparing words to a list of common words.
- the list of common words can comprise, for example, a list of words determined to appear frequently and be of little value in ranking search results.
- a list of common words can comprise the words “is,” “of,” “to,” “it,” and other common words.
- the query system 132 can compare words extracted from a string or document to the list of common words and filter out words that appear in the list.
- a list can contain common words which are not be excluded as keywords, but which are down-weighted. For example, such words can be made less likely to appear as keywords, but may still be selected as keywords if they appear frequently within an article.
- keywords can be associated with keyword ranking scores. Keyword ranking scores can reflect, for example, the relative importance or lack of importance of keywords.
- common keywords can have low keyword ranking scores associated with them while proper name keywords can have high keyword ranking scores associated with them.
- the keyword ranking scores can be used in ranking an article containing the keyword ranking scores. For example, articles containing keywords associated with high keyword ranking scores can receive high ranking scores themselves. Likewise, articles containing keywords associated with low keyword ranking scores can receive low ranking scores themselves.
- the method 200 proceeds to block 206 , wherein the query system 132 generates a search query 206 .
- the search query that the query system 132 generates may comprise keywords extracted from a single data stream or may comprise keywords extracted from multiple streams.
- the query system 132 can extract keywords from a selected portion of text within a document and from the entire contents of the document. Whether a word extracted from more than one source continues to be used in an implicit query may be determined in various ways. For example, if the word “budget” occurs with some frequency (e.g. fifty times) in a document but the user has not recently typed the word budget, budget may continue to be included in a query generated by the query system 132 .
- the method 200 proceeds to block 208 , wherein the query system 132 transmits the search query to a search engine, for example, search engine 122 .
- the query system 132 transmits the query to other search engines, for example, a search engine running on a server device 150 , such as the GoogleTM search engine.
- the search engine 122 performs a search of one or more indices, either local or global, and provides at least one article identifier associated with a relevant article as a result set.
- the method 200 proceeds to block 210 , wherein the query system 132 ranks the article identifiers in the result set based on ranking scores.
- the ranking scores may be related to previous events that were recorded by the query system 132 or another component or may be based on other criteria.
- the query system 132 can determine ranking scores based at least in part on meta-data associated with articles in the result set. Meta-data can include, for example, bolding, highlighting, underlining, italicizing, font color, heading data, or any other formatting or meta-data associated with a portion of an article. Heading data can comprise, for example, whether a portion of an article is designated as a heading in a text document.
- the query system 132 can determine the meta-data associated with an article in the result set by determining the meta-data associated with the keywords in the search query. For example, if the search query comprises the terms “budgeting meeting” the query system can identify a result set containing articles comprising the words “budgeting meeting.” One such article can be, for example, a spreadsheet with a title “budgeting meeting” appearing in bold. A second such article can be an e-mail with the words “budgeting meeting” appearing in the text. The query system 132 can determine meta-data associated with the keywords “budgeting meeting” in the spreadsheet indicating that the words are bolded. The query system can then boost a ranking score associated with the spreadsheet to reflect the likelihood that the spreadsheet titled “budgeting meeting” is more responsive to the search query than the e-mail simply containing these words in the body of the e-mail.
- the query system 132 can further rank the article identifiers based at least in part on capitalization data associated with the articles in the result set.
- Capitalization data can comprise, for example, data indicating whether one or more letters in a word are capitalized. For example, if the words “budgeting meeting” in the spreadsheet from the example above are capitalized, this is a further indication that they are of greater significance in the article and thus that the article is more closely related to the search query “budgeting meeting.” Additionally, capitalized letters can indicate the proper names of people and places. Keywords associated with names and places can be a better indicator that an article containing such keywords is responsive to a search query.
- the query system 132 can determine key words “meet,” “with,” “Bob,” “Jones,” and “lunch” from the sentence. The query system 132 can then identify an article containing the keywords “lunch” and “with” and an article containing the keywords “Bob” and “Jones.” The article containing the keywords “Bob” and “Jones” can be more likely to interest the user 112 a , and so the query system 132 can rank the identifier associated with the article containing the capitalized words “Bob” and “Jones” higher based at least in part on the capitalization. According to some embodiments, the query system can assign a higher ranking to capitalized keywords that do not begin a sentence as these more likely reflect proper names or places.
- the query system 132 can determine a ranking score based at least in part on term frequency (TF) and a document frequency (DF) or an inverse document frequency (IDF) associated with a key word.
- TF can comprise, for example, the frequency with which a keyword appears in a single article.
- a DF can comprise, for example, the frequency with which a keyword appears in all documents, and an IDF can comprise, for example, the inverse of the frequency with which the keyword appears in all documents.
- TF can comprise, for example, the frequency with which a keyword appears in a single article.
- a DF can comprise, for example, the frequency with which a keyword appears in all documents
- an IDF can comprise, for example, the inverse of the frequency with which the keyword appears in all documents.
- a common keyword can appear frequently within any one particular document and thus have a high TF. The same common keyword can also appear frequently in all documents and thus have a high DF and consequently a low IDF.
- the query system can compensate for keywords appearing frequently in one document when the keywords also appear frequently in all documents.
- a unique keyword that appears a few times in one particular document may have a relatively low TF but can have a very high IDF and thus the composite for such a keyword can be high.
- the query system can determine a ranking score for an identifier in the result set proportional to: Log(TF+A)/log(DF+B) Where TF denotes the term frequency of a term, DF denotes the document frequency of a term, A denotes a first constant, and B denotes a second constant.
- A can have the value of 1, and B can have the value of 1.
- A can have the value of 0.5, and B can have the value of 0.
- the logarithm of the DF may not be used, and the DF may be hashed into a lookup table which maps ranges of DF values into constants.
- the ranking score can be proportional to: Log(TF+A)/mapping function(DF)
- the query system 132 can further determine a ranking score based at least in part on number data associated with articles in the result set.
- Number data can comprise, for example, whether a keyword comprises numbers. For example if the user 112 a types a date into a document, a keyword “2004” can be determined by the query processor 132 .
- the query processor can further determine number data indicating that the keyword “2004” comprises numbers and determine a ranking score for the article containing the keyword “2004” based at least in part on the number data. For example, keywords containing numbers can be less likely to indicate important portions of an article and thus less likely to be associated with search results of interest to the user 112 a .
- number data can comprise, for example, a number of letters comprising a keyword.
- the query system 132 can determine that a keyword “the” comprises three letters and that a keyword “antidisestablishmentarianism” contains 28 letters.
- a keyword containing a high number of letters can be more likely to be unique and thus more likely to indicate unique results interesting to the user 112 a.
- the query system 132 can further determine a ranking score based at least in part on preference data.
- Preference data can comprise, for example, data indicating the user's 112 a preference for a particular article or for a particular file type.
- the query system 132 can receive click-through data indicating the user 112 a has selected an article identifier displayed in a content display window.
- the query system 132 evaluates the article identifier to determine a content type associated with the article identifier.
- the file type may be a web page, e-mail, text file, image, or any other content type.
- the user 112 a can be presented with multiple article identifiers of different types as the result of an implicit query.
- the user can be presented with e-mails, web pages, and text documents.
- the user can demonstrate a preference by selecting a particular article type more frequently than any other.
- the user 112 a can select e-mails when presented and ignore results associated with text documents.
- the query system 132 can rank subsequent e-mail articles higher to reflect the user's 112 a preference for e-mail documents.
- the query system 132 can use the click-through data to adjust the ranking scores both within and across result sets before displaying the combined result set to the user.
- the present invention utilizes content type, source, keyword, and other data related to items that the user did not click on. The query system 132 of one such embodiment reduces the relevancy score of article identifiers corresponding to content types and sources that the user has not clicked as frequently as other types of content.
- the query system 132 can rank article identifiers based on the number of results sets in which the articles are located.
- the user 112 a can view a web page and edit a text document.
- Four queries are generated from the user context.
- the first query comprises information from the web page.
- the second query comprises the last ten words that the user types.
- the third query comprises the sentence that the user just pasted in the document.
- the fourth query comprises the words that the user is currently selecting with the mouse.
- the query system 132 can submit the queries to one or more search engines and receive four result sets in response.
- the query system 132 can merge the results and can present the first five article identifiers from the merged result set to the user 112 a in a contextual display window for example.
- the first query can produce a results set comprising articles A, B and C.
- the second query can produce a result set comprising articles C, D, and E. Because article C appears in both result sets, it can receive a higher ranking score when displayed in the
- the query system 132 can further determine a ranking score based at least in part on source data.
- Source data can comprise, for example, data indicating the source of keywords contained in an article.
- query results based on keywords extracted from recently typed words receive a higher ranking score than results based on keywords extracted from an entire document.
- Source data may further include data indicating the relevancy of a source of keywords.
- a ranking score can be based on a how frequently the keywords appear in a document, the document frequency of the keywords, or how long an application from which the keywords are extracted has been in the foreground.
- the method 200 proceeds to block 212 , wherein the query system 132 transmits the result set to the display processor 128 and the display processor 128 causes the output of the article identifiers.
- the display processor 128 may output the result set in a format similar to a format used for global result sets such as those provided by a search engine utilizing a global index, e.g., GoogleTM search engine.
- the display processor 128 may alternatively output the result sets in a small window superimposed over another application that the user is currently using.
- the display processor 128 creates a window based on the amount of available screen space on the user's 112 a display and outputs the result sets from the query system 132 in the window that it created.
- the window of an active application may be modified to include the result set.
- the results can be stored in memory and the query system informs the display processor 128 .
- the query system 132 can execute additional queries to retrieve results until the minimum threshold of results has been exceeded.
- the query system 132 may execute a single query or may execute multiple queries based on multiple data streams in order to return result sets that are relevant to the current user context.
- article identifiers can be presented to the user 112 a based on a threshold determined for occurrences of keywords in an article associated with the article identifier.
- a threshold can be determined to exclude articles from the result set that contain fewer than three occurrences of one or more keywords.
- the display processor 128 can present only those results above a weighted score threshold.
- the query system 132 can determine a weighted score for each article in a result set.
- the weighted score can comprise, for example, number of keywords multiplier, a source multiplier, and a time multiplier.
- the number of keywords multiplier can comprise, for example, a weighting factor based on the number of keywords within a result and a normalizing factor based on a total number of keywords.
- the normalizing factor can be used to compare results associated with different numbers of keywords.
- the source multiplier can comprise, for example, a weighting factor based on the source of a keyword.
- the source multiplier can boost a ranking score for the first article.
- the query system 132 can compare the weighted score to a threshold and the display processor 128 can receive this data and present only results exceeding the threshold. For example, the query system can determine two articles associated with a search query and can further determine a weighted score for each article.
- the query system 132 can transmit this data to the display processor 128 and the display processor 128 can present to the user 112 a an article identifier associated with the first article and not present an article identifier associated with the second article. Once the article identifiers are presented to the user 112 a , the method 200 ends.
