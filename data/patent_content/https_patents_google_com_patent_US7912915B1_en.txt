- a standard company logo on a web site may be modified or customized with one or more animated objects for a special occasion, such as a holiday or special event.
- the animated object(s) may be separate from the company logo or may be integrated therewith.
- the special event logo may be generated using conventional techniques and software and stored as a single object file or as multiple object files on the server 120 ( FIG. 1 ).
- the object file(s) may be downloaded to the server 120 at one time or over a period of time using, for example, a computer-readable medium, such as a removable memory or a network transmission.
- the server 120 may identify a home page for a document, such as a web site, on a network, such as the Internet. The server 120 may then locate the standard logo used on the home page to identify the operator of the web site. The server 120 may modify the standard logo with one or more animated objects.
- the server 120 may associate one or more search terms with the special event logo [act 1020 ]. For Valentine's Day, for example, the search terms of “valentine's day” may be associated with the special event logo. In an alternative implementation consistent with the present invention, the server 120 may associate a document, such as a web page, or search results with the special event logo.
- the server 120 may upload the special event logo to the web page [act 1030 ]. For example, the server 120 may upload the special event logo when the special occasion corresponding to the special event logo occurs. The server 120 may leave the special event logo on the web page for one or more days corresponding to the special occasion or may periodically change the special event logo during the one or more days of the special occasion.
- a user may select the special event logo by, for example, clicking on the logo using an input device, such as a mouse [act 1040 ]. If user selection occurs, the server 120 may use the associated search term(s) to generate a search query. The server 120 may use the search query to search an index, a directory, or a network, such as the Internet. The server 120 may then provide search results relating to the special event logo to the user [act 1050 ].
- the server 120 uses the document or search results previously associated with the special event logo as the search results relating to the special event logo. In this case, the server 120 may simply retrieve the document or search results from memory.
- the foregoing processing may be performed automatically by the server 120 or one or more devices connected directly or indirectly (i.e., via a network) to the server 120 .
- some of the acts may be performed by one or more human operators.
- Systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide mechanisms to entice users to return to a web page by presenting animated objects that change in time to tell a story and/or a company logo modified or customized for a special occasion. In this manner, users are encouraged to access the web page to view the story and/or the special event logo.
