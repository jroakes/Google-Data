Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to wireless communications in a heterogeneous wireless network and, more particularly, to carrier aggregation and management of interference among the uncoordinated deployment of Home eNode-Bs (HeNBs) within a wireless network of eNode-Bs (eNBs).
- HeNBs Home eNode-Bs
- eNBs eNode-Bs
- OFDM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
- eNB base unit
- UE wireless communication device
- OFDM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
- orthogonal subcarriers are modulated with a digital stream, which may include data, control information, or other information, to form a set of OFDM symbols.
- the orthogonal subcarriers may be contiguous or non-contiguous frequency bands, and the downlink data modulation may be performed using quadrature phase shift-keying (QPSK), 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM), or 64QAM.
- QPSK quadrature phase shift-keying
- 16QAM 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation
- 64QAM 64QAM
- OFDM symbols are configured into a one millisecond (1 ms) downlink subframe for transmission from the base unit in the normal Cyclic Prefix (CP) case (and twelve OFDM symbols for the extended CP case).
- CP Cyclic Prefix
- PDSCH Physical Downlink Shared CHannel
- PDCCH Physical Downlink Control CHannel
- Control information in the PDCCH is transmitted using scheduling messages of different predefined downlink control information (DCI) Formats. These scheduling messages inform a UE of the downlink control information (e.g., modulation and coding scheme, transport block size and location, pre-coding information, hybrid-ARQ (HARQ) information, UE identifier, etc.) that is required to decode the downlink data transmissions in the PDSCH or to transmit the uplink data on the Physical Uplink Shared CHannel (PUSCH).
- This control information is protected by channel coding (typically, a cyclic-redundancy check (CRC) code for error detection and convolutional encoding for error correction), and the resulting encoded bits are mapped on the time-frequency resources of the downlink subframe.
- channel coding typically, a cyclic-redundancy check (CRC) code for error detection and convolutional encoding for error correction
- the smallest time-frequency resource unit for transmissions is denoted a resource element (RE), which is one OFDM symbol (smallest time unit) by one subcarrier (smallest frequency unit).
- a group of four REs (or four REs plus two reference signal REs) is called a resource element group (REG).
- REG resource element group
- Nine REGs can make a Control Channel Element (CCE).
- the encoded PDCCH bits are typically mapped onto 1, 2, 4, or 8 CCEs, which are referred to as aggregation levels 1, 2, 4, and 8.
- the UE searches different hypotheses (i.e., hypotheses on the aggregation level, DCI Format size, etc.) by attempting to decode downlink transmissions using a finite number of allowable configurations.
- This process is referred to as “blind decoding”.
- a UE performs blind decoding using the starting CCE locations allowed for that particular UE.
- This UE-specific search space is typically configured during initial set-up of a radio link and can be modified using a Radio Resource Control (RRC) message.
- RRC Radio Resource Control
- a common search space is also defined that is valid for all UEs being served by the same eNB and might be used to schedule broadcast downlink information like Paging, Random Access Response, or others.
- a particular UE must locate the CCEs corresponding to each PDCCH candidate it is to monitor (i.e., blindly decode for each subframe control region).
- the CRC of each PDCCH is typically masked (e.g., using an exclusive-OR operation) by an identifier corresponding to the user equipment that the base unit is trying to schedule.
- the identifier is assigned to the UE by its serving base unit. This identifier is known as a radio network temporary identifier (RNTI).
- RNTI radio network temporary identifier
- a UE When a UE decodes a PDCCH, it must apply the appropriate RNTI in the form of a mask to the PDCCH CRC for successful PDCCH decoding to occur.
- a UE successfully decodes a PDCCH of a particular DCI Format type it uses the control information from the decoded PDCCH to determine, for example, the resource allocation, hybrid-ARQ information, and power control information for the corresponding scheduled downlink data transmission.
- a control region of a downlink subframe also includes a Physical Hybrid-ARQ Indicator CHannel (PHICH) that is used to transmit hybrid-ARQ acknowledgements, reference signals, and a Physical Control Format Indicator CHannel (PCFICH).
- PHICH Physical Hybrid-ARQ Indicator CHannel
- PCFICH Physical Control Format Indicator CHannel
- each eNB-to-UE downlink has 1, 2, or 3 OFDM symbols at the beginning of each subframe for control signals.
- the number of OFDM symbols in this control region may vary each subframe and is signaled via the PCFICH in that same subframe.
- the value of PCFICH may be signaled via higher layer signaling or may be fixed.
- PDSCH transmissions can be mapped into one or more resource blocks (RBs).
- RB resource blocks
- an RB is a set of subcarriers and a set of OFDM symbols.
- an RB may contain 12 subcarriers (with a subcarrier separation of 15 kHz) and 7 OFDM symbols, with some resource elements being assigned to carry pilot signals, etc.
- PDSCH allocations for a UE are typically scheduled in pairs of RBs, with each RB pair spanning a single subframe and indexed using a single RB identifier.
- HeNBs also called femto-cells, pico-cells, or closed subscriber group (CSG) cells
- HeNBs can be deployed to operate in regions where at least part of the femto-cell's bandwidth is shared with eNB macro-cells. Due to the shared bandwidth, this type of deployment is considered to be high risk from an interference point-of-view. For example, a downlink of a macro-cell eNB can severely interfere with a downlink of a femto-cell HeNB thereby degrading the quality of service for UEs served by either the eNB or the HeNB.
- LTE Release 8 is expected to evolve into LTE-A to support spectrum aggregation wherein a base unit can transmit data on multiple component carriers in a single subframe and a user terminal can receive multiple component carriers in a single subframe.
- a base unit can transmit data on multiple component carriers in a single subframe and a user terminal can receive multiple component carriers in a single subframe.
- FIG. 1 illustrates wireless downlink communications in a heterogeneous network.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a downlink radio subframe on an anchor carrier with various resources allocated for signaling a front-truncation time period of a front-truncated subframe component on an additional component carrier.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a flow diagram for a base unit indicating, in a control region of a subframe on an anchor carrier, a front-truncation time period and transmitting a front-truncated subframe component on an additional component carrier.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a flow diagram for a remote terminal receiving, in a control region of a subframe on an anchor carrier, front-truncation time period information and using this front-truncation time period information to access a front-truncated subframe component on an additional component carrier.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a wireless communication remote terminal that supports carrier aggregation with at least an anchor carrier and an additional component carrier.
- a base unit can assist a UE in avoiding subframe decoding errors related to the additional component carrier.
- cross-carrier notifications can provide other control information for the additional component carrier. Note that truncation information can also be repeated on the additional component carrier itself.
- a macro-cell base unit is operating using an anchor carrier CC 1 and an additional component carrier CC 2
- a femto-cell base unit is operating in an overlapping geographic region using the second component carrier CC 2
- the control region of a macro-cell subframe component transmitted on CC 2 may overlap with the control region of a femto-cell subframe also transmitted on CC 2 and result in UEs being unable to decode either control region properly.
- the macro-cell base unit can truncate a subframe component on the shared component carrier CC 2 to avoid overlapping control regions. Even if the macro-cell is unaware of a femto-cell's control region, the macro-cell may truncate a subframe component on a dynamic basis in an attempt to reduce interference with the femto-cell transmissions.
- the macro-cell base unit can transmit the truncation information to its UEs so that the UEs can properly detect a boundary of the macro-cell subframe component on the additional component carrier CC 2 .
- FIG. 1 illustrates wireless downlink communications in a heterogeneous wireless network 100 .
- a first base unit 102 (sometimes called a base unit, access point, or eNB) supports carrier aggregation with an anchor carrier 110 using an anchor carrier CC 1 and an additional component carrier 120 using a second component carrier CC 2 .
- This first base unit 102 represents a macro-cell that has a geographic coverage area overlapping a femto-cell (sometimes called a pico-cell, a closed subscriber group (CSG) cell, an access point, or an HeNB).
- the femto-cell (second) base unit 105 transmits on a femto-cell component carrier 130 using the second component carrier CC 2 .
- the macro-cell and the femto-cell share the second carrier component CC 2 but only the macro-cell uses the anchor carrier component CC 1 . Due to the shared second component carrier CC 2 , there is a significant risk of interference between the macro-cell and the femto-cell wireless transmissions. Also, the macro-cell could use additional component carriers CC 3 , CC 4 , CC 5 , etc. that may potentially interfere with additional femto-cells using those same component carriers CC 3 , CC 4 , CC 5 or overlapping carriers.
- a heterogeneous network 100 is generally implemented with more than two base units, and only two are shown for the sake of simplicity.
- the wireless communication system 100 also includes management functionality including data routing, admission control, subscriber billing, terminal authentication, etc., which may be controlled by other network entities (not shown), as is known generally by those having ordinary skill in the art.
- the femto-cell base unit 105 is shown serving a remote terminal 107 within a serving area (or hot spot) that overlaps the serving area of the macro-cell base unit.
- Remote terminals may also be referred to as subscriber units, mobile stations, user equipment (UE), user terminals, or by other terminology. Due to the overlapping geographic coverage and the overlapping frequency usage, this scenario has high risk for wireless transmission interference. Note that, although the hot spot is shown as fully contained within the macro-cell, alternate configurations may have the hot spot only partially overlapping the macro-cell.
- the macro-cell base unit 102 is shown serving remote terminals 104 , 108 , 109 within a serving area (or cell) or within a sector of the base unit.
- the macro-cell base unit 102 communicates wirelessly with remote terminals 104 , 108 , 109 to perform functions such as scheduling the remote terminals to receive or transmit data using available PDSCH radio resources.
- Two of the remote terminals 104 , 108 support carrier aggregation and could receive signals on both the anchor carrier 110 and at least one additional component carrier 120 .
- the macro-cell base unit 102 serves another remote terminal 109 that does not support carrier aggregation and thus cannot receive PDSCH transmissions across multiple downlink component carriers.
- the macro-cell base unit 102 transmits downlink (DL) communication signals to remote terminals 104 , 108 using both an anchor carrier 110 and at least one additional component carrier 120 .
- DL downlink
- Each subframe 150 , 160 transmitted on an anchor carrier 110 generally includes a control region 151 , 161 and a data region 152 , 162 .
- the control region 151 , 161 can vary in time span and can be one, two or three OFDM symbols in duration.
- This variable (whether the control region 151 , 161 contains 1, 2, or 3 OFDMA symbols) is signaled in the control region of the current subframe 150 , 160 on a Physical Control Format Indicator CHannel (PCFICH) as will be explained in more detail in conjunction with FIG. 2 .
- PCFICH Physical Control Format Indicator CHannel
- the macro-cell base unit 102 can also transmit DL communication signals on an additional component carrier 120 .
- a front-truncated subframe component 154 , 164 contains signals to remote terminals 104 , 108 in a PDSCH.
- the front-truncated subframe component 154 , 164 does not contain signals that might overlap with a control region 171 , 181 in subframes 170 , 180 sent on an overlapping component carrier 130 by an uncoordinated second base unit 105 .
- the reduced subframe components 154 , 164 on the additional component carrier 120 are shortened at the front of the subframe component by a front-truncation time period 159 , 169 .
- This time period 159 , 169 can be measured in OFDM symbol time spans and is expected to be 1, 2, or 3 OFDM symbols in duration. Other implementations, however, could allow for different time periods and different truncation timing (e.g., back-truncation).
- the macro-cell avoids transmitting on the same component carrier CC 2 frequencies (or overlapping carrier frequencies) during the DL subframe control regions of the geographically overlapping femto-cell, and downlink signal interference can be reduced.
- each subframe 170 , 180 also includes a control region 171 , 181 and a data region 172 , 182 .
- the control region 171 , 181 of each subframe 170 , 180 on the femto-cell component carrier 130 can be 1, 2, or 3 OFDM symbols in duration.
- the control region 171 , 181 of the femto-cell subframes 170 , 180 may vary in duration
- the front-truncation time period 159 , 169 of the reduced subframe components 154 , 164 on the additional component carrier 120 may also vary.
- the femto-cell control region 171 in the first subframe 170 has a duration of two OFDM symbols while the femto-cell control region 181 in the second subframe 180 has a duration of three OFDM symbols.
- the front-truncation time period 159 of the first front-truncated subframe component 154 is two OFDM symbols in duration and the front-truncation time period 169 of the second front-truncated subframe component 164 is three OFDM symbols in duration.
- the front-truncation is dynamic on a subframe basis.
- front-truncation can be dynamic on a radio frame basis (e.g., the same front-truncation time period is used for all ten subframe components in a radio frame, or all downlink subframes in a radio frame in the case of TDD deployments) or semi-static basis (e.g., between two RRC reconfiguration messages).
- the front-truncation time periods 159 , 169 need not match exactly to the corresponding femto-cell subframe control regions 171 , 181 . As long as the truncation time period 159 , 169 prevents the macro-cell base unit 102 from transmitting on the additional component carrier 120 at the same time as a control region 171 , 181 of the femto-cell, interference can be reduced.
- the remote terminals 104 , 108 being served by the base unit 102 must know when to detect the first OFDM symbol of the front-truncated subframe components 154 , 164 . If the first OFDM symbol is not correctly detected, the UE will store incorrect data in its buffer and feed back NACK to the macro-cell base unit 102 , which may propagate errors through subsequent HARQ combining. Therefore a CRC code may be used to check the correct detection of the first OFDM symbol—or the data should be mapped to the invariant resources first, followed by the resources that are variable.
- the data can be mapped to the OFDM symbol 14 , followed by OFDM symbol 13 , and so on to the first OFDM symbol in the truncated subframe component (which would most likely be OFDM symbol 4 , 3 , or 2 ).
- the first OFDM symbol in the truncated subframe component which would most likely be OFDM symbol 4 , 3 , or 2 .
- FIG. 2 illustrates a downlink radio subframe 200 on an anchor carrier 110 (see FIG. 1 ) with various resources allocated for signaling a front-truncation time period 159 , 169 of a front-truncated subframe component 154 , 164 on an additional component carrier 120 .
- This downlink subframe 200 constitutes a portion of a radio frame (not shown).
- a radio frame generally has a concatenated continuum of subframes.
- the subframe 200 includes a control region 201 and a data region 202 akin to the subframes 150 , 160 , control regions 151 , 161 , and data regions 152 , 162 shown in FIG. 1 .
- This subframe 200 shows three OFDM symbols 211 , 212 , 213 in the control region 201 .
- Other subframes may have 1, 2, or 3 OFDM symbols in their control regions.
- resource elements (REs) in the control region 201 are used to signal control information to remote terminals in the network.
- resource element groups (REGs) are used for mapping control channels to REs.
- a REG may have REs that are mapped to only control channels or REs that are mapped to both control channels and reference signals.
- REGs in a first OFDM symbol 211 contains REs that are mapped to both control channels and reference signals.
- REGs in the second OFDM symbol 212 and the third OFDM symbol 213 are mapped to only control channels.
- REG 280 in the first OFDM symbol 211 has six REs where, REs 290 , 291 , 292 , 293 are mapped to a control channel and REs 225 and 226 are mapped to reference signals.
- REG 281 in the second OFDM symbol 212 has four REs where REs 294 , 295 , 296 , 297 are mapped to a control channel and no REs are mapped to other signals.
- One or more REGs 231 , 232 , 233 , 234 are reserved for Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH) signaling.
- the PCFICH carries information about the number of OFDM symbols used for transmission of a control region in a subframe.
- the PCFICH is transmitted when the number of OFDM symbols for the control region is greater than zero.
- REGs 241 , 242 , 243 , 244 , 245 , 246 , 247 , 248 , 249 are reserved for Physical Hybrid-ARQ Indicator CHannel (PHICH) signaling as directed by higher network layers of the base unit.
- PHICH Physical Hybrid-ARQ Indicator CHannel
- default PHICH resources on REGs 241 , 242 , 243 provisioned by LTE Release 8 provisioning mechanisms can be utilized to support ACK/NACK for default Physical Uplink Shared CHannel (PUSCH) transmissions by served remote terminals 104 , 108 , 109 .
- PUSCH Physical Uplink Shared CHannel
- the additional reserved REGs 244 , 245 , 246 , 247 , 248 , 249 can be used to broadcast or multicast the front-truncation time period 159 of a front-truncated subframe component 154 on the second component carrier 120 (shown in FIG. 1 ).
- the signals on the default PHICH REGs carry the hybrid-ARQ ACK/NAK for uplink physical resource blocks signaled using the one or more assigned physical uplink shared channels.
- multiple PHICHs mapped to the same set of resource elements constitute a PHICH group, where PHICHs within the same PHICH group are separated through different orthogonal sequences.
- a single PHICH group can require a plurality of REGs.
- a PHICH group is commonly assigned three REGs, which are REGs 241 , 242 , 243 in this subframe 200 .
- the over-provisioned PHICH REGs 244 , 245 , 246 , 247 , 248 , 249 can also be grouped, and spreading and repetition in accordance with PHICH groups as described previously can be used to promote low errors rates when these PHICH REGs are used to signal truncation information for a second component carrier CC 2 .
- resources on all the PHICH REGs 241 , 242 , 243 , 244 , 245 , 246 , 247 , 28 , 249 can be shared for both default PHICH signaling and signaling of front-truncation information.
- default PHICH signaling and signaling of front-truncation information are separated through different orthogonal sequences.
- the sequence used for front-truncation information in one subframe may be used for HARQ feedback signaling in another subframe.
- the front-truncation information can be limited to an indication of whether the front-truncation is 1, 2, or 3 OFDM symbols in duration. Because this is similar to the information carried in a PCFICH (i.e., whether a control region of a particular subframe is 1, 2, or 3 OFDM symbols in duration), PCFICH-like signaling and encoding can be used on the over-provisioned PHICH resources to indicate whether the front-truncation time period 159 , 169 in a reduced subframe component 154 , 164 is 1, 2, or 3 OFDM symbols in duration.
- PCFICH-like signaling and encoding can be used on the over-provisioned PHICH resources to indicate whether the front-truncation time period 159 , 169 in a reduced subframe component 154 , 164 is 1, 2, or 3 OFDM symbols in duration.
- the front truncation information signaled on reserved PHICH resources can be encoded with an error detection code, such as a CRC code, that will allows the front-truncation information to be read only by UEs that are using the same CRC code to properly decode the truncation time period information on those resources.
- an error detection code such as a CRC code
- REGs 241 , 242 , 243 , 244 , 245 , 246 , 247 , 248 , 249 reserved for PHICH signaling will carry both PHICH signaling and front-truncation signaling for at least one additional component carrier.
- a base unit that supports carrier aggregation such as base unit 102 shown in FIG.
- PHICH resources can be reallocated on a dynamic basis (e.g., every subframe or every radio frame) or on a semi-static basis (e.g., between two RRC reconfiguration messages). The set of PHICH resources that are reallocated may change or hop (e.g., on a subframe basis or on a radio frame basis) for interference randomization.
- RRC Radio Resource Control
- An implicit indication could be a particular downlink bandwidth of an anchor carrier, a particular Physical Cell IDentifier (PCID) of an anchor carrier, or a particular subframe index of a subframe transmitted on an anchor carrier.
- PHICH resources can be reallocated on a dynamic basis (e.g., every subframe or every radio frame) or on a semi-static basis (e.g., between two RRC reconfiguration messages). The set of PHICH resources that are reallocated may change or hop (e.g., on a subframe basis or on a radio frame basis) for interference randomization.
- the RRC signaling can directly specify the PHICH group indices, or a subset of PHICH indices within each PHICH group, that have been reallocated to front-truncation signaling.
- the RRC signaling can merely indicate the quantity of PHICH groups, or the quantity of PHICH resources within each PHICH group, that have been reallocated directly using a number or indirectly using a scaling factor or modulo function.
- a remote terminal can use a predefined conversion function to calculate the set of REGs, or the orthogonal codes within each PHICH group, used to signal the front-truncation information.
- the remote terminal can verify one received data point using the other received data point. Alternately, if the remote terminal receives both the quantity of PHICHs with each PHICH group and the subset of PHICH indices within each PHICH group, the remote terminal can verify one received data point using the other received data point.
- Legacy remote terminals that do not support carrier aggregation (such as remote terminal 109 shown in FIG. 1 ) will be configured by the eNB to receive their PHICH information only on the default PHICH resources and not on any additional PHICH resources.
- the default PHICH reception mechanism (either the default PHICH group or the orthogonal codes in each PHICH group) corresponding to default PUSCH transmissions remains unchanged, so the PHICH reception of remote terminals that do not support carrier aggregation will be mostly unaffected.
- a Physical Downlink Control CHannel (PDCCH) carries scheduling assignments and other control information.
- a physical downlink control channel is transmitted on an aggregation of one or several consecutive control channel elements (CCEs), where a CCE corresponds to multiple interleaved REGs.
- CCEs control channel elements
- interleaved REGs 251 , 252 , 253 , 254 , 255 , 256 , 257 , 258 , 259 correspond to a first CCE 221 that is reserved for PDCCH signaling.
- REGs within a CCE can be mapped in non-contiguous time and frequency locations within the control region 201 for increased time and frequency diversity. Such mapping can be achieved by applying a mapping function. Further, the mapping function could be conditioned on an interleaver that permutes the REGs corresponding to the CCE.
- one or more CCEs are mapped such that the REGs corresponding to the reallocated CCE can be utilized for signaling the front-truncation time period 159 , 169 of a reduced subframe component 154 , 164 on an additional component carrier 120 (see FIG. 1 ).
- CCE 222 corresponding to interleaved REGs 261 , 262 , 263 , 264 , 265 , 266 , 267 , 268 , 269 is reallocated to support front-truncation signaling.
- the reallocated CCE can be encoded such that selected remote units can properly decode the CCE REGs, using blind decoding, to obtain truncation information. If cross-carrier grants are not present in a particular subframe, this can also be signaled in the control region of the anchor carrier to reduce blind decoding. Also, the control region of the anchor carrier can include a value that indicates whether the DCI Format size for a particular cross-carrier grant is based on partial additional carrier bandwidth utilization (e.g., one-quarter, one-half, or full additional carrier bandwidth utilization).
- FIG. 2 illustrates a CCE 223 corresponding to interleaved REGs 271 , 272 , 273 , 274 , 275 , 276 , 277 , 278 , 279 that were mapped for truncation signaling in a previous subframe(not shown), and has been reverted back to PDCCH use in the current subframe 200 .
- Remote terminals that do not support carrier aggregation will be unaware of the CCE 222 reallocation from PDCCH signaling to truncation signaling. If the remote terminal monitors a reallocated CCE 222 while searching for its PDCCH, signaling on the reallocated CCE 222 will not correspond to a valid PDCCH signal (because it is being used by the base unit to signal truncation information). The remote terminal will then simply skip the reallocated CCE 222 and monitor other CCEs in search of its PDCCH signals.
- Remote terminals that support carrier aggregation will need to receive an indication regarding CCEs reallocated to truncation signaling in order to properly decode the truncation signals.
- a base unit that supports carrier aggregation informs its remote terminals that support additional component carriers (such as remote terminals 104 , 108 ), via dedicated Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling, broadcast RRC signaling, or an implicit indication, that one or more CCEs have been reallocated to truncation signaling.
- RRC Radio Resource Control
- CCEs can be reallocated on a dynamic basis (e.g., every subframe or every radio frame) or on a semi-static basis (e.g., between two reconfiguration messages).
- An implicit indication could be a particular downlink bandwidth of an anchor carrier, a particular Physical Cell IDentifier (PCID) of an anchor carrier, or a particular subframe index of a subframe transmitted on an anchor carrier.
- the set of CCEs that are reallocated may change or hop (e.g., on a subframe basis or on a radio frame basis) for interference randomization or so as to avoid blocking a PDCCH signaled on a particular set of aggregated CCEs.
- the dedicated and/or broadcast RRC signaling can directly specify the CCE indices that have been reallocated from PDCCH signaling to truncation signaling.
- the three CCEs with the highest index numbers could support truncation signaling for an additional component carrier, and the two CCEs with the next-highest index numbers could support truncation signaling for another additional component carrier.
- the RRC signaling can merely indicate the quantity of CCEs that have been reallocated directly using a number or indirectly using a scaling factor.
- a remote terminal can use a predefined conversion function to calculate the set of CCE REGs used to signal the truncation information. If the remote terminal receives both the quantity of reallocated CCEs and the CCE indices, the remote terminal can verify one received data point using the other received data point.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a flow diagram 300 for a first base unit 102 indicating, in a control region 151 , 161 of a subframe 150 , 160 on an anchor carrier 110 , a front-truncation time period 159 , 169 and transmitting a front-truncated subframe component 154 , 164 on an additional component carrier 120 (see FIG. 1 ).
- a first base unit (such as base unit 102 shown in FIG. 1 ) that supports carrier aggregation receives 310 information regarding a control region duration in a subframe on a downlink component carrier being shared with an uncoordinated second base unit (such as base unit 105 shown in FIG. 1 ).
- the control region duration information can be provided on a dynamic (e.g., subframe or radio frame) basis by, for example, the HeNB using a wired backhaul to the eNB to transmit the HeNB subframes' control region duration.
- the control region duration information can be provided on a semi-static basis (e.g., between two internetworking messages from the second base unit's network to the first base unit). Because control region durations may change on a dynamic (e.g., every subframe or every radio frame) or semi-static (e.g., using RRC configuration messages) basis, step 310 is optional in some instances.
- the eNB may dynamically vary the truncation information in an attempt to reduce interference on the shared component carrier CC 2 .
- the first base unit determines 320 a front-truncation time period in order to create a front-truncated subframe component on the second component carrier CC 2 that does not interfere with the control region of the second base unit's subframe on the same or overlapping second component carrier CC 2 .
- the front-truncation time period references the number of OFDM symbols in a 1 ms subframe where the base unit would not transmit in order to limit interference with the control region of a subframe simultaneously-transmitted by the second base unit.
- the first base unit then transmits 330 a front-truncated subframe component 154 , 164 (see FIG. 1 ) on the additional component carrier CC 2 and simultaneously transmits 340 front-truncation time period information within a control region of an anchor carrier CC 1 .
- the front-truncation time period information can be transmitted using 343 over-provisioned PHICH resources and/or using 346 reallocated CCE resources as described with reference to FIG. 2 . If the front-truncation time period is equivalent to 1, 2, or 3 OFDM symbols, PCFICH-like signaling can be used on the over-provisioned PHICH resources or the reallocated CCE resources.
- FIG. 4 illustrates a flow diagram 400 for a remote terminal 104 , 108 receiving, in a control region 151 , 161 of a subframe 150 , 160 on an anchor carrier 110 , front-truncation time period information and using this front-truncation time period information to access a front-truncated subframe component 154 , 164 on an additional component carrier 120 .
- a remote terminal (such as remote terminal 104 , 108 shown in FIG. 1 ) that supports carrier aggregation receives 410 notification that resources in the control region of an anchor carrier subframe carry front-truncation information for an additional component carrier. This notification can be sent via dedicated Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling from the serving base unit, broadcast RRC signaling, or using an implicit indication.
- RRC Radio Resource Control
- An implicit indication could be a particular downlink bandwidth of an anchor carrier, a particular Physical Cell IDentifier (PCID) of an anchor carrier, or a particular subframe index of a subframe transmitted on an anchor carrier.
- PCID Physical Cell IDentifier
- step 410 is optional in some instances.
- the serving base unit uses RRC signaling to indicate that front-truncation information is being transmitted on resources in the control region of an anchor carrier subframe
- the RRC signaling can directly specify either the PHICH groups indices, the PHICH resource indices within each PHICH group, or the CCE indices that carry this information.
- the RRC signaling can merely indicate the quantity of PHICH groups, the quantity of PHICH resources within each PHICH group, or the quantity of CCEs that carry the front-truncation information directly using a number or indirectly using a scaling factor.
- the remote terminal can use a predefined conversion function to calculate the set of resources (e.g., the set of PHICH REGs, the set of PHICH resources within each PHICH REG, or the set of CCEs) used to signal the front-truncation information. If the remote terminal receives both the quantity and indices, the remote terminal can verify one received data point using the other received data point. Further redundancy can be obtained by using both PHICH resources and CCE resources for transmitting front-truncation information.
- the set of resources e.g., the set of PHICH REGs, the set of PHICH resources within each PHICH REG, or the set of CCEs
- the remote terminal Based on the notification, the remote terminal knows to search 420 , in the control region 151 , 161 of a subframe 150 , 160 on an anchor carrier 110 (see FIG. 1 ), for front-truncation information within a set of over-provisioned resources reserved for PHICH signaling 423 and/or from a set of REGs corresponding to a reallocated CCE 426 . After the front-truncation information is extracted from the appropriate resources, the remote terminal uses 430 the front-truncation information to determine when a first OFDM symbol used for receiving a PDSCH on an additional component carrier 120 will begin.
- the remote terminal can determine the boundary for proper PDSCH decoding by waiting for the front-truncation time period starting from the beginning time boundary of a standard 1 ms subframe. Then, the remote terminal receives 440 a PDSCH signal on the additional downlink component carrier in the first and subsequent OFDM symbols of a front-truncated subframe component.
- a remote terminal that does not support carrier aggregation receives a downlink subframe with CCEs reallocated to front-truncation signaling, the CCEs that are reallocated to front-truncation information will not form a valid PDCCH signal for the remote terminal 109 , so the remote terminal will simply monitor other CCEs in search of its own PDCCH.
- a remote terminal 109 that does not support carrier aggregation will be unaware that certain CCEs have been mapped for use as resources to convey front-truncation information for subframes on an additional component carrier.
- a remote terminal that does not support carrier aggregation receives a downlink subframe with additional PHICH resources that are allocated for front-truncation information signaling, the remote terminal will only decode the default PHICH resources and will not decode the additional PHICH resources.
- the wireless base unit e.g., base unit 102 shown in FIG. 1 ) configures the default and additional PHICH resources such that indices (e.g., either the PHICH group indices or the PHICH indices within each PHICH group) of default and additional PHICH resources do not overlap.
- FIG. 5 illustrates a wireless communication remote terminal 500 that supports carrier aggregation with at least an anchor carrier and an additional component carrier.
- the terminal 500 may be implemented as remote terminal 104 , 108 shown in FIG. 1 .
- the remote terminal 500 includes an antenna 501 , a transceiver 510 coupled to the antenna 501 , a processor 520 (or controller) coupled to the transceiver 510 , a memory 530 coupled to the processor 520 , and a user interface 540 coupled to the processor 520 .
- the transceiver 510 is capable of communicating through the antenna 501 with user terminals and base stations pursuant to a wireless communication protocol such as LTE Release 8 evolutions that supports carrier aggregation with at least an anchor carrier and an additional component carrier.
- a wireless communication protocol such as LTE Release 8 evolutions that supports carrier aggregation with at least an anchor carrier and an additional component carrier.
- the processor 520 is implemented as a programmed processor; however, the functionality described may alternately be implemented on a general-purpose or special-purpose computer, a programmed microprocessor or microcontroller, peripheral integrated circuit elements, an application-specific integrated circuit (or other integrated circuits), hardware logic elements such as a discrete element circuit, a programmable logic device such as a programmable logic array, field-programmable gate array, or the like.
- the memory 530 may include volatile and nonvolatile data storage, including one or more electrical, magnetic, or optical memories such as a random access memory (RAM), cache, hard drive, read-only memory (ROM), firmware, or other memory device.
- RAM random access memory
- ROM read-only memory
- the memory may have a cache to speed access to specific data. Data may be stored in the memory in a database format or another format.
- the I/O device interface 540 connects to one or more input devices that may include a keyboard, keypad, mouse, touch screen, microphone, voice-recognition device, or any other device that accepts input.
- the I/O device interface may also connect to one or more output devices, such as a monitor or display, printer, disk drive, audio speakers, or any other device provided to output data.
- the processor 520 is configured to implement the flow diagram 400 of FIG. 4 with the interaction of software stored in memory 530 .
- One or more software, hardware, or combination hardware-and-software modules may be developed to perform each step 410 , 420 (including steps 423 and/or 426 ), 430 , 440 to properly receive data on an additional component carrier.
- a base unit supporting carrier aggregation can instruct served remote terminals supporting carrier aggregation regarding boundaries for receiving data in the truncated subframe component on the additional downlink component carrier.
- the disclosed PHICH resouces and CCE reallocation techniques support such truncation signaling without affecting much any served remote terminals that do not support carrier aggregation.
- Transmitting truncated subframe components on additional downlink component carriers promotes interference management in heterogeneous wireless networks by allowing a base unit that supports carrier aggregation to avoid transmitting during a control region of a subframe transmitted on the same or overlapping component carrier frequencies by an uncoordinated second base unit. Notifying served remote terminals that support carrier aggregation of the truncation time period assists in reducing errors caused by improperly determining OFDM symbols of a reduced subframe component PDSCH.
- the base unit may also transmit a control message on the anchor carrier for indicating downlink control information regarding assigned resources on the additional component carrier.
- the truncation time period information and the control message containing the additional grant information such as Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), hybrid-ARQ information, etc., helps the remote unit to determine the boundary of the PDSCH on the additional component carrier.
- MCS Modulation and Coding Scheme
- the front-truncation time period information and the downlink control information may be jointly protected with CRC coding.
- a format indicator may be signaled on PHICH resources to indicate the format of a particular downlink or uplink control region, to indicate whether (and which) additional Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) resources are available in an uplink subframe, to indicate whether a particular uplink or downlink resource is available or not, to enable/disable transmission of uplink control or data information from the UEs, or whether (and where) additional reference symbols are present in a particular subframe or not, etc.
