Embodiment
As mentioned above, WO 2004/049263 provides a kind of for the system that makes virtual movie.This system is included in movable platform (transform) mobile in the place.Whenever this platform surpasses the displacement of minor increment D, when perhaps changing its orientation and reaching angle above Δ °, just catch photo.And, when the rotation of this platform of camera intrinsic surpasses angle δ °, just catch photo.
At least the Several Parameters that comprises x, the y of this platform in this place and the orientation when catching photo (° to be the deflection of unit) is associated with each photo, and this photo is stored in the memory stores portion.Then, after catching all images, the system of WO 2004/049263 can handle all data, in order to automatically make virtual movie.
The system of WO 2004/049263 can be by relatively fast and automatically, accurate and professional mode is come Making Movies.Yet the system of WO 2004/049263 is quite complicated and expensive, because it needs quite complicated software and powerful processor.The present inventor finds, with many slightly human-edited's time be " cost ", can by much simple and significantly cheap system make not too professional virtual movie.Illustration of the present invention the structure of this simplification system, and provide the method for operating this simplification system.
Fig. 1 schematic illustration according to the basic structure of the simplification scanister 1 of one embodiment of the present invention.This scanister consists essentially of: the video camera 2 and tripod 3 of this video camera is installed.Among tripod leg 3a, 3b and the 3c each all is installed on the corresponding wheel 4, makes this tripod to move.Leg 3a, the 3b of tripod 3 and 3c comprise for displacement encoder 10a, the 10b and the 10c that measure each angle rotation of taking turns at their place, bottom.Then, the angle wheel measuring of the wheel of correspondence is transferred to controller 5 via the cable 8a-8c of correspondence.Tripod 3 also comprises camera base 6, and this camera base 6 comprises two parts according to this specific implementations, with respect to the static 6a of first of this tripod and can be with respect to second foundation of described first rotation.Described second portion also has be used to the fixed bar 7 that bears video camera 2.Described second portion also has makes that video camera can be around the handle of central shaft z rotation perpendicular to the ground basically.Described second portion 6b (and video camera) is measured by scrambler 9 with respect to the angle rotation of the described 6a of first.The measurement result of angular encoder 9 also is transferred to controller 5.This scanister also comprises the control panel 11 for the user alternatively, and this control panel 11 is used for activation or inactive this scanister, is used for providing the value of setting, and is used for providing order to this device.
Before this scanister of operation, the user limits one group of minimal condition that this video camera is caught photo in controller 5.This minimal condition comprises that at least the least displacement of tripod 3 and video camera 2 rotate around the minimum angles of central shaft x.Receive from the input 8a-8c of displacement encoder 10a-10c with from the controller 5 of the input 19 of angular encoder 9, start the triggering 14 to video camera 2, this video camera 2 is then caught photo.
Fig. 2 shows the synoptic diagram of the office 10 with two corridors (C1, C2) and two rooms (A, B).An object of the present invention is, make a kind ofly making that the user can be at office's virtual movie of current (that is, " walking ") everywhere.As seen from the figure, when beginning at point 11 places, the user goes to node J1, and at this node J1 place, he can turn right and enter room B, perhaps continues straight line and goes ahead.Similarly be that when arriving at node J2 place, the user can turn right and enter room A or go ahead along corridor C1 straight line.When arriving at node J3 place, the user can turn right or turn left in the C2 of corridor.And when walking along the corridor, the user need have the limited relatively ken usually.At node J1, J2 and J3 place, the user needs the wideer ken, and in room A and B, he needs 360 ° the ken usually.For example, at node J1 place, the user can select to move on along the corridor, and sees the corridor end, and perhaps he can select to turn in room B, and checks the scene of room B, perhaps he in addition can determine in some cases backward then return along corridor C1.
According to the present invention, by producing by 1 pair of office of the scanister of taking pictures up to 360 ° the ken.This scanister moves forward along route, lights along the relevant ken from production simultaneously and catches photo.For example, this scanister can be every the range acquisition image of 10cm.
The a plurality of points that to carry out in Fig. 3 on the route that scanning (production) handles are expressed as node 133.Node 133 is shown schematically in each specific node position and is in the mode that this point scans, and can provide this node distinctive other parameter.
Before the production stage, make and the general plan that the route of producing is relevant.Along the route of cooking up, as scanister process preset distance D (it for example can be every 5-50cm), perhaps when changing its angular orientation, create node by predetermined angular Δ ° (for example 5 °).And, at the static node place of device, when video camera field of view direction (that is, the center of the video camera ken) changes above δ ° with respect to this device, create node.
Cook up on the whole after the route, limit described distance B between the node and described two parameter Δs relevant with change in angular orientation ° and δ °.It should be noted that for simplicity, the measurement of distance B refers to the displacement at the center of scanister 1 at this.Yet, can be with respect to any other qualified point measuring distance D of device.Because device 1 has several the wheel, thereby controller 5 conversions are followed the displacement D at the center of calculation element from the displacement of discrete wheel measurement.
Fig. 4 shows production by the overall plan of the part of the office of dotted line 124 (Fig. 3) mark.In principle, there is the production of two types (patterns)." ring clap (ring filming) " be wherein install static, camera intrinsic central shaft z rotation, and video camera whenever with respect to this device δ ° angle takes place and rotates a kind of production of just catching photo.Second type production is " route production (route filming) ", in this route production, the place ahead of camera points device, device moves along a route, and whenever this device through the D that surpassing to limit apart from the time, perhaps when the device change in orientation surpasses angle delta °, just catch photo.It should be noted that the checking of when having caught a photos, just reset δ °, D and Δ °.
In an embodiment of the invention, video camera 2 is the still cameras that for example have 60 ° the ken.When operation, scanister 1 is initially positioned at the starting point place, for example the some A place among Fig. 4.In the example of Fig. 4, some A is node, and camera intrinsic axle x rotation, thus, catches a photos by " ring is clapped " mode every δ °.For example, video camera 2 can rotate 360 °, and can create 72 photos (suppose δ ° and be restricted to 5 °).In Fig. 4, for the purpose of brief, show several photos at the node place; For example, caught photo 240 to 247 at node A place.Next, scanister 1 advances along the corridor.When the displacement that detects device whenever controller 5 surpassed predetermined distance B, controller just started the triggering to video camera 2, so that video camera 2 is caught photo.In such a way, after moving to node B from node A, caught photo 150 to 156 in " route production " mode.Then, produce node B similarly " to encircle and to clap " mode with the mode of carrying out at node A place, thereby obtain photo 260-267.From node B, production " route production " mode of can pressing again continues along the route photographs 190 to 197 up to node C.Then, produce the node C that comprises photo 250 to 257 by " ring is clapped " mode.After finishing node C, can continue production in opposite direction, at first sequence of photographs 200 to 207, then sequence of photographs 210 to 216.
During production is handled, the storage captured pictures, and for simplicity, preferably carry out index.After finishing the production processing, the photograph collection of storage comprises several route photograph sequences and several ring photograph sequences.Next, need divide chaining captured pictures.A chain is a photo sequence, wherein, for the photo in this sequence, defines last photo in the sequence and next photo in the sequence.Open chain is such chain, wherein has two photos (also being called " shining first on sheet " and " tail photo " at this) only to have being connected at next or last photo respectively.The open chain of a particular type is " chain " of the single width photo of unqualified last or next photo, and this single width photo not only serves as " shining first on sheet " but also serve as " tail photo " in chain.Closed chain is such sequence, that is, each photos in this sequence all have definitely at last photo be connected at two of next photo.Therefore, be clear that those sequence photos of catching at the specific node place (for example, at the captured pictures 240-247 of node A place) form closed chain, and form open chain along those photos (for example, photo 150-156) that a route is caught.
For example can divide chaining with the set of catching photo by following several modes:
A, indexed mode: supposition is during production is handled, and comparison film sequentially carries out index, and the first index of each sequence and pygochord are drawn with sequence type (manually or automatically) record.Like this, the connection between the chain photo (previous and next) is unimportant, because it is the directly differentiation and next of sequence order from production.The situation of clapping at ring is the last photos that shines first on sheet in this sequence and shine first on next photos that sheet is the tail photo in this sequence in the sequence conversely by limiting tail photo in the sequence, and has formed closed chain.This is to make it possible to realize the optimal way of separate mode the most easily.
B, non-indexed mode: at during producing, there not being comparison film to carry out the situation of index, can visually or by the application image Processing Algorithm separate chaining.The net result of this processing is identical with above-mentioned indexed mode basically; Yet non-index process is not too effective usually.
After separating chaining, now, there are several open chains and several closed chain, each open chain all comprises many irradiation sheet of catching with route along altogether, and each closed chain is included in the multiple photos that a common node place catches.In order to make continuous film, must connect these disengaging latches.In general, the tail in each open chain and/or shine first on sheet and must be connected to a photos in the corresponding closed chain.For example, and with reference to Fig. 4, comprise shining first on sheet 150 and must be connected to a photos among the closed chain 240-247 in the open chain (hereinafter, for the purpose of brief, this chain being called " chain 150-156 ") of photo 150-156.As general rule, the photo of selecting from chain 240-247 that is connected to photo 150 is the photo that has maximum comparability (that is, having high correlation with photo 150) or have immediate field of view direction.In some cases, can carry out combination (hereinafter, the situation that satisfies described one or both considerations is referred to herein as " optimum matching ") between described two kinds of considerations.Especially when moving, expect this optimum matching to (perhaps opposite situation) between the closed chain photo that is connected to it at the particular end photo of open chain the spectator, watch in order to guarantee " smoothly " of film.Therefore, at the situation of Fig. 4, the sheet 150 that shines first among the photo among the chain 240-247 244 and the chain 150-156 has optimum matching as can be seen, because the both sees (being 12 o'clock direction among this figure) to equidirectional.Equally, the tail photo 216 among the photo among the chain 240-247 240 and the chain 210-216 has optimum matching.Therefore, be connected at photo 244 and photo 150 with between photo 216 and the photo 240, in order to form continuous and level and smooth vidclip.Equally, for identical consideration, photo 197 is connected to photo 257 (both sees basically to 3 o'clock direction), and photo 253 is connected to photo 200 (both sees basically to 9 o'clock direction).In a comparable manner, connect all disengaging latches, to form the continuous and complete virtual movie that the user can pass through therein.It should be noted that this film can comprise a plurality of uncrosslinking chains, that is, and the complete chain that separates with all other chains.
For example can carry out connection between the aforesaid chain by following three kinds of optional modes:
A, manual type: when the end photograph (that is, must be connected to head and the tail photo of the photo in the closed chain accordingly) of limited number, this task can manually be carried out.In this case, want the move edit person who connects end photograph from relevant (candidate) closed chain, relatively easily to find the photo of hope by visual means, thereby connect.For example, with reference to Fig. 4, the user can show end photograph 150 on his picture right side, and in the picture left side, he can alternatively replace node A place (namely, closed chain 240-247) all photos are in order to find optimum matching photo (most probable causes selecting photo 244, and it satisfies described optimum matching standard) according to his best intuition in the middle of them.
B, automated manner: can also automatically carry out same task by correlator.At the given end photo with a chain with comprise under the situation of adjacent closed chain of multiple photos, this correlator is sought in this closed chain and described appointment photo has a photos of high correlation, thereby connects.And, when the x that has recorded the place of catching each photo alternatively, y coordinate, and even when more preferably also having recorded field of view direction at each photo, the robotization that utilizes these data further to simplify to handle (yet, as mentioned above, this may make complex system).This automation process can be carried out during producing in real time, perhaps carries out immediately after the photo that produces a film.
C, automatic and artificial hybrid mode: the some parts of move edit can manually be carried out by visual means, and other parts can automatically perform by correlator.
Each width of cloth end photograph that foregoing description has been mentioned open chain all is connected to a photos of closed chain.This rule is normally correct for the situation of using conventional video camera.Exception is to use the situation of 360 ° of field of view camera.In this case, device is only made open chain, and can have the photo that is connected to several other photos in the open chain, and each described other photo all belongs to another corresponding chain.Connection between the photo can be by a kind of execution the in above-mentioned three kinds of modes.
As mentioned above, the present invention supposes that virtual movie is the set of photo, and the some of them photo is caught along route, and other photo is then caught at the node place in physics place.This is converted into the connection layout of picture in the present invention, and wherein, each photos is all represented the specific ken that an ad-hoc location from this place is seen.Connection between the photo makes can move on to another photos from a photos by smooth manner.
As mentioned above, in an embodiment of the invention, the tripod 3 that will have wheel is used for supporting video camera and related system component.It should be noted that this fulcrum arrangement needn't have the form of tripod, and can have other form, start the triggering 14 of catching new photo as long as x, the y displacement measurement of the wheel of this device gone out and offer controller 5 to determine when.
