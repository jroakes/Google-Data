- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of cellular communication system 100 .
- Communication system 100 comprises a seven cell system having base stations 110 , 120 , 130 , 140 , 150 , 160 and 170 .
- Each base station serves a subset of mobiles.
- Base station 110 serves mobiles 112 , 114 , 116 and 118 .
- Base station 120 serves mobiles 122 , 124 , 126 and 128 .
- Base station 130 serves mobiles 132 , 134 , 136 and 138 .
- Base station 140 serves mobiles 142 , 144 , 146 and 148 .

- Base station 170 serves mobiles 172 , 174 , 176 and 178 .
- Each mobile in the base station will communicate with the base station within its cell. For example, mobile 142 is requesting bandwidth from base station 140 ; mobile 144 is sending a channel sounding signal to base station 140 ; mobile 144 is sending an initial access request to base station 140 ; and mobile 148 is acquiring base station 140 by detecting it's pilot signal. As discussed, cross cell communication may occur between mobiles in base station 140 's cell and the adjacent cells.
- base station 120 may receive mobile 142 's bandwidth request; base station 130 may receive mobile 144 's channel sounding signal; base station 170 may receive mobile 146 's initial access request; and mobile 148 may receive base station 160 's pilot signal.
- FIG. 2 shows frame structure 200 used by the cellular communication system 100 .
- TDD Time Division Duplex
- the frame is divided into a downlink interval ( 220 ) and an uplink interval ( 230 ).
- Each interval may be composed of a number modulation symbols. These symbols could be Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex signals or other modulation methods. In fact, they can be a mix of modulation symbols.
- One of these symbols in downlink interval might be used as base station pilot signal 240 .
- one of these symbols on the uplink may be used as an initial access signal or channel sounding signal 250 .
- a synchronization function that synchronizes multiple communication units in time and/or frequency to a common reference.
- Another example is a channel estimation function for use by a receiver for coherent receiver processing and demodulation.
- the system acquisition function whereby a cellular base station (BS) transmits a reference signal to assist a subscriber station (SS) in the initial process of joining the cell.
- SS subscriber station
- Still another example is the practice of a SS transmitting a reference signal to the BS in a Time Division Duplexing (TDD) system for the purpose of enabling the BS to determine the downlink (DL) channel response for the purpose of employing coherent transmit antenna array processing on the DL.
- TDD Time Division Duplexing
- Cellular systems generally employ a set or series of reference signals or reference signal sequences that are transmitted during one or more resource intervals within the physical transmission resources (e.g., time, frequency, code) of the communication system.
- the set or series of reference signals is generally chosen to have one or more of the following desirable properties: auto-correlation properties, cross-correlation properties, peak-to-average power ratio properties
- Cellular systems generally have a need to assign one or more reference signals to a particular transmitter in one cell while assigning different reference signals to transmitters in nearby cells to prevent cross-cell communication.
- One solution to this problem is to pre-plan upon construction of the cellular system which cells will use which subset of reference signals. This solution is undesirable because this type of cell planning adds to the overall cost of the cellular system.
- the problem of assigning a reference signal to a particular transmitter becomes an especially difficult problem in situations where the total number of possible sequences is small or limited.
- the number of available sequences is generally equal to the sequence length, which is generally determined by the available transmission resources (time/frequency/code) assigned for reference signal transmission.
- the probability of two communication units being assigned the same sequence is high enough to seriously degrade the performance of the system functions that exploit reference signal transmissions.
- a collision in reference signal assignments will continue to occur indefinitely.
- it is particularly critical for communication units to change their reference signals over time so that if a collision occurs in one transmission resource interval, then a collision will not keep occurring over and over again.
- assignment of one or more reference signals to communication units (e.g., BS or SS) within a cellular system occurs in a pseudo-random manner that requires no real-time coordination between the cells.
- the solution employed by the present invention also avoids the need to coordinate or plan upon system construction which cells or transmitters will employ which reference signals.
- collisions can occur whereby a communication unit in one cell transmits with the same reference signal or signals as transmitted by a communication unit in the same or a different cell.
- the performance of the function employing the reference signal is generally degraded from the performance when no collision occurred.
- it is desirable to minimize the likelihood of a collision i.e., the likelihood that two communication units will use the same reference signal. It is also desirable to minimize the likelihood of subsequent collisions given that a collision has occurred.
- Operation of communication system 100 occurs by first predetermining a set of reference signals having properties desirable for enabling various functions in a cellular communication system.
- One embodiment of the present invention uses the Generalized Chirp-Like (GCL) sequences, which are known for their excellent auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties.
- GCL Generalized Chirp-Like
- the invention selects one or more reference signals from the predetermined limited set of reference signals for use by communication units according to a pseudo-random process that has the following characteristics. First the reference signal assigned to a particular communication unit changes from one resource interval to the next in a pseudo-random fashion.
- different communication units are assigned reference signals by means of different pseudo-random processes, so as to minimize not only the likelihood of a collision, but also to minimize the likelihood that collisions are repeated in subsequent resource intervals.
- This aspect of the invention minimizes the persistence of the use, by two communication units, of a same reference signal selected by the communication units from a limited set of reference signals.
- collisions are not persistent and are not continual over time, and the interference from a reference signal assignment collision becomes effectively randomized over the plurality of transmission resources (i.e., over time/frequency, etc.)
- the pseudo-random process is easily determined by the transmitting and receiving communication units based on pre-determined rules. As a result, no real-time coordination between cells is required in the process of assigning reference signals.
- the receiving unit knows the total available set of reference signals that could be used during the reserved physical transmission resources.
- Limiting the actual number of reference signals that can be assigned to a particular set of reserved physical transmission resources means the receiver processing need only consider the limited number of reference signals rather than the entire set, which can reduce complexity considerably. Therefore, a method is required for assigning a subset of the total set of available reference signals to the one or more communication units to choose from when transmitting during the physical transmission resources reserved for reference signal transmission.
- the invention provides a method of assigning to one or more communication units a subset of sequences that can be chosen from for transmission during the transmission resource intervals in which reference signals are transmitted.
- Ranging or timing-advance functions are examples of system functions that can exploit the practice of partitioning the total available set of reference signals into subsets.
- each cell is assigned a subset of reference signals and the communication units within the cell will pseudo-randomly transmit one of the reference signals belonging to the subset of reference signals assigned to the cell to which the communication units belong.
- the receiving unit the BS in this case
- the invention partitions the predetermined set of reference signals into subsets according to their relative quality measure according to some known criteria. For example, reference signals could be grouped according to their peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). One subset could then consist of the set of all reference signals having a low PAPR relative to the other reference signals. As another example, reference signals could be grouped into subsets according to their auto-correlation properties. As a third example, reference signals could be grouped into subsets where all reference signals in the subset have good cross-correlation properties. In an embodiment of the present invention incorporates a strategy for allocating to one or more communication units a subset of the total set of available reference signals for possible use during the resource interval devoted to reference signal transmission.
- PAPR peak-to-average power ratio
- the reference signals are chosen to be the Generalized Chirp-Like (GCL) waveforms, which are non-binary unit-amplitude sequences. (Other embodiments of the invention employ other types of reference signals.)
- GCL Generalized Chirp-Like
- N G is the length of a GCL sequence (chosen as a prime number as explained below) and u is referred as the class index that is a non-zero integer chosen between 1 and N G .
- u is referred as the class index that is a non-zero integer chosen between 1 and N G .
- the GCL sequence has the following important properties:
- Property 3 The absolute value of the cyclic cross-correlation function between any two GCL sequences is constant and equal to 1/ ⁇ square root over (N G ) ⁇ , when
- the cross-correlation 1/ ⁇ square root over (N G ) ⁇ at all shifts is actually the minimum achievable value for any two sequences that have the ideal autocorrelation property (i.e., the maximum value of the cross-correlation at all shifts is minimized which is equal to 1/ ⁇ square root over (N G ) ⁇ ).
- This property is important when a number of potential interfering sequences are received, either in a single sector or in a multi-sector environment.
- the cross correlation property provides some suppression of the interfering signals during a channel estimation process for example. Hence, the channel of the desired transmitter can be detected more reliably.
- the complete set of available sequences must be identified.
- the length of the GCL sequence is first identified in order to determine the specific set of GCL sequences that are available for use by transmitters in the cellular system.
- the required length of the reference signal is determined by the physical layer transmission resources (time and frequency resources) allocated for the transmission of the reference signals. For example, in a channel estimation application, specific time-frequency resources are allocated for transmitting the reference signal that is used by the receiver for channel estimation. In a synchronization application, specific time-frequency resources are allocated for transmitting the reference signal that is used by the receiver for synchronization. The resources allocated for transmitting the reference signal determine the required length of reference signal.
- N G is determined to be the smallest prime number that is larger than the desired length, and the GCL sequences computed according to (1) are then truncated to the desired length.
- N G is chosen to be the largest prime number that is smaller than the desired length, and the sequences computed according to (1) are then cyclically extended to the desired length. Note that when either modification is performed, the three properties identified above will only hold approximately, but will hold very well when the sequence is long.
- N G available GCL sequences for the particular application (e.g., channel estimation, synchronization).
- the next problem is to assign one or more of these GCL sequences to communication units in a cellular system.
- a strategy must be in place for determining which reference signal or signals is to be used for transmission on a particular set of assigned transmission resources by one or more communication units.
- a set of physical transmission resources are reserved in a plurality of successive frames for the purpose of transmitting reference signals to aid in functions such as synchronization, channel estimation, and other functions known in the art for maintaining a high quality communications link.
- one or more communication units may transmit using one or more reference signals.
- the range of possibilities for the parameter u in (1) directly determines the set of possible sequences available to the system. In other words, once L and N G are determined, the specific sequence is determined by choosing the value of u in (1).
- An embodiment of the present invention determines the value of u with a pseudo-random number generator initialized with the Base ID (also called cell identification value or CellID)) of the cell to which the communication system is associated. In other words, the reference signal is pseudo-randomly selected with a function that is initialized with a value that is unique to the first cell.
- Another embodiment determines the value of u with a pseudo-random number generator initialized with the combination of both the Base ID of the cell and the numeric identifier corresponding to the current frame.
- the pseudo-random process used to determine the specific reference signal to use is a function of the Base ID of the current cell plus some measure of the current time within the current cell (e.g., frame number, time offset, time the cell was operating, etc.)
- a collision occurs in which two communication units (either within the same cell or from different cells) are assigned the same reference signal, then it is highly likely that this type of collision will not occur in subsequent resource intervals devoted to reference signal transmission.
- PRBS pseudo-random binary sequence
- the specific sequence to be chosen i.e., choosing the exact value of u for equation (1) for when GCL sequences are used
- the sequence chosen is determined as a function of the output bits of the PRBS.
- the sequence chosen is equal to one plus the decimal equivalent of the first ceil(log 2 (Ls)) output bits of the PRBS, where the ceil operator rounds to the next highest integer and Ls is the number of possible sequences to choose from.
- the PRBS in this case is initialized with a bit sequence consisting of the 6 least significant bits of the CellID and the eight least significant bits of the Frame Number, which numerically identifies the frame in which the reference signal is to be transmitted.
- This has the benefit of assigning with high probability different GCL sequences to different BS IDs. Also the assigned GCL sequence will change pseudo-randomly from frame to frame, so that a collision in the CGL sequence assigned to different CellIDs in one frame will likely not occur in subsequent frames.
- Another aspect of the invention is the selection of subsets of the total set of available reference signals and the assignment of those subsets to groups of communication units (e.g., all of the users located in a particular cell).
- this functionality there are two instantiations of this functionality: For the first instantiation, the total set of available reference signals is subdivided or partitioned into predetermined subsets or partitions that do not overlap, meaning that a particular reference signal belongs to one and only one subset/partition.
- An embodiment of this technique simply divides beforehand (i.e., in a pre-defined fashion) the set of predetermined limited set of reference signals into non-overlapping subsets in a manner that is known.
- the partitioning does not change with time, and in another alternative, the partitioning actually changes with time, wherein the manner in which the partitioning changes in known to both the transmitting communication unit and the receiving communication unit.
- the total set of available reference signals are pseudo-randomly subdivided or partitioned into sets that because of the pseudo-random partitioning may or may not overlap.
- the pseudo-random partitioning in one alternative can change as a function of time in a manner that can be determined in real time by both the transmitting communication unit and the receiving communication unit.
- An embodiment of this functionality uses the outputs of a PRBS generator initialized with the BS ID and the frame number in order to determine the current partitioning of the total set of available reference signals.
- the output bits of the PRBS generator are grouped into blocks wherein the number of blocks equals the number of reference signals in the subset and each block of output bits, when converted to decimal, corresponds to one of the reference signals that belongs to the subset.
- the result is a random uniform selection of the reference signals that belong to the reference signal subset at any given time.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart 300 showing a method for selecting a series of reference signals in a cell of a multi-cell wireless communication system.
- the first step 301 selects a first reference signal in a first cell from a predetermined limited set of reference signals, where the predetermined limited set of reference signals is common among the first cell and at least a second cell. Since the set is common, the elements of the set are available for use in both the first cell and the second cell, and preferably additional cells in the system as well. The selection is preferable performed pseudo-randomly.
- the selected reference signal is for transmission on a first channel resource, such as a time interval in a particular frame, a set of subcarriers of a multicarrier (e.g., OFDM) system, time-frequency combinations, or other such communication resources as known in the art.
- the selected reference signal is transmitted in step 303 .
- the next step 305 selects a second reference signal for the a first cell from the predetermined limited set of reference signals. The selection is preferable performed pseudo-randomly.
- the selected reference signal is for transmission on a second channel resource.
- the selected reference signal is transmitted in step 307 .
- the step of pseudo-randomly selecting in the first cell can be based on a function that is initialized with a value that is unique to the first cell. Additionally, the step of pseudo-randomly selecting can be based on a function that is initialized with a value that is based at least one of a cell identification value (e.g., CellID) and a frame number.
- a cell identification value e.g., CellID
- the reference signals in the predetermined limited set are preferably chosen based on their desirable properties for use in a wireless system, such as desirable cross correlation characteristics between different reference signals in the predetermined set (e.g., low cross correlation values), desirable autocorrelation characteristics for each reference signal in the predetermined set (e.g., close to an impulse function), or moderate peak-to-average power ratios.
- the reference signals can be based on GCL sequences in order to provide reference signals with desirable properties for use in a wireless system.
- the selected reference signal when transmitted, can be used to facilitate synchronization (e.g., ranging, downlink timing acquisition), or for channel estimation, or for other purposes.
- FIG. 4 is a flow chart 400 showing a method for selecting reference signals in a cell of a multi-cell wireless communication system that differs from the FIG. 3 by first selecting only a subset of the predetermined limited set of reference signals and then selecting a reference signal from within the subset. This method is particularly useful for ranging or random access, where multiple remote/mobile/subscriber units need to pseudo randomly select a reference signal to transmit, and where the selection of the reference signal is made at the remote unit rather than at the base station.
- 401 selects a first subset of reference signals from a predetermined limited set of reference signals in a first cell, where the predetermined limited set of reference signals is common among the first cell and at least a second cell.
- 403 pseudo-randomly selects a first reference signal from a the first subset, for transmission on a first channel resource.
- 405 selects a second subset of reference signals from the predetermined limited set of reference signals in the first cell.
- 407 pseudo-randomly selects a second reference signal from a the second subset, for transmission on a second channel resource.
- the selection the first subset of reference signals in the first cell is based on a function that is initialized with a value that is unique to the first cell, or can be based on a function that is initialized with a value that is based at least one of a cell identification value and a frame number.
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart 500 showing an embodiment of the invention for reducing the persistence of the use, by two communication units, of a same reference signal selected by the communication units from a limited set of reference signals with desirable properties. For example, if two communication units have selected and are transmitting the same reference signal on the same channel resource (or resource interval), it is difficult for a receiver to distinguish between the two units. To resolve this problem, a new reference signal should be selected periodically such as every frame, or at least occasionally.
- a communication unit selects a first reference signal from a predetermined limited set of reference signals, preferably with desirable properties, for use in transmission during a first resource interval; where the first reference signal is selected based on a first output of a reference signal selection function (e.g., a pseudo-random function such as a PRBS), and wherein the reference signal selection function output is dependent on at least an initialization value (e.g., CellID) known to the communication unit.
- the communication unit selects a second reference signal from the predetermined limited set of reference signals with desirable properties, for use in transmission during a second resource interval, where the second reference signal is selected based on a second output of the reference signal selection function.

Abstract
Description
-
- Cell Selection—a mobile must select the most appropriate cell and then retain connection to that cell. Therefore a mobile must be able to distinguish between signals received from multiple cells and uniquely identify the most appropriate cell.
- Association—once selecting an appropriate cell the mobile must clearly associate itself with that cell. As a result, the mobile must transmit a signal that allows a base station receiving these signals to differentiate between a signal that is intended for it or another base station.
- Protocol Consistency—as stated protocols are defined for a single base station and a sub-set of mobiles. Cross-cell communication can often intermingle the transmissions of several mobiles, associated with different cells, resulting in a protocol error. For example, the address space used to communicate with the sub-set of mobiles is re-used for cell-to-cell. Therefore, directives intended for one mobile may be interpreted by another mobile in an adjacent cell.
