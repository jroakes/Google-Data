Definitions
- Implementations provide personalized action suggestions in a mobile app environment. Specifically, implementations identify actions potentially helpful to the user in data provided by a third party via an application programming interface (API). Because the data is provided by the third party, it can include information unavailable via screen scraping, which improves the quality of the personalized suggestions. Implementations use the data to determine one or more action predictions, e.g., actions determined to likely be helpful to the user given the data provided, and provide the actions in a semantic record, which includes information that the third party application can use to display in an interface for initiating the actions.
- the semantic records can include a title, a subtitle, a thumbnail, and a target for each action.
- secondary targets are also provided in the semantic record as alternatives to the primary target.
- sub-actions may be provided in the semantic record.
- the target is a link, such as an intent for a target application or another type of deep link into the target application, that transfers data and control from one mobile application to another or switches data and control to a different user interface within the same application.
- the third party application may use the semantic record(s) to generate an action suggestion interface in any manner desired.
- the system may require authentication from the third party as part of the API, and may use the authentication information to select an appropriate prediction model and/or to rank predictions.
- a system includes at least one processor and memory storing instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the system to perform operations.
- the operations may include receiving a request for a suggested action from a third-party, the request including content information and context information, the content information representing information to be displayed on a mobile device as part of a source mobile application operated by the third party and the context information including information specific to the source mobile application not for display on the mobile device.
- the operations may also include predicting at least one action for the content information based on analysis of the content information in view of the context information, and providing the at least one action with a title and an image to the third-party, the action identifying a target mobile application that differs from the source mobile application.
- a method includes receiving content information and context information from a source mobile application, the content information representing information to be displayed on a mobile device as part of a source mobile application administered by a third party, the context information being information specific to the third party and unavailable to a screen scraper.
- the method also includes predicting an action based on the content information and the context information, the action representing a deep link for a target mobile application.
- the method further includes providing the action to the source mobile application with a title and a thumbnail, the source mobile application using the title and thumbnail to display a selectable control that, when selected, causes the mobile device to initiate the action.
- a method includes providing content information and context information to an action suggestion application program interface, the content information representing information to be displayed on a mobile device as part of a source mobile application administered by a third party, the context information including information specific to the third party that is not for display on the mobile device.
- the method may also include receiving at least one semantic record, the semantic record identifying an action predicted using the content information and the context information, the semantic record including a title and a thumbnail for the action.
- the method may further include initiating display of the title and the thumbnail as a selectable control that is displayed with the content information on the mobile device.
- the action may be an action that is unavailable to a screen scraper.
- a computer program product embodied on a computer-readable storage device includes instructions that, when executed by at least one processor formed in a substrate, cause a computing device to perform any of the disclosed methods, operations, or processes.
- Another general aspect includes a system and/or a method for providing personalized assistance actions to a third party mobile application, substantially as shown in and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, and as set forth more completely in the claims.
- implementations provide a way for a user to seamlessly transfer information between mobile applications, enabling a user to lookup additional information with minimal effort and usage of system resources.
- implementations improve the quality of suggested actions by providing both content and context for analysis, the context including information specific to the third-party application or third-party that is not available via a screen-scraping process.
- the actions suggested may be customized for the user of the mobile device, making it more likely that the user finds the interface helpful.
- the suggestions can help the user find/handle information, even though the user may not have knowledge of the application for handling the information.
- implementations help the user discover more effective or popular tools.
- improved device performance is a facet of implementations.
- the reduction of user interaction with the device i.e., fewer inputs from the user

- the content and context is provided via an API to an action suggestion engine.
- the content may be a text.
- the content may also be an image.
- the context provided by the third-party application is metadata about the content that is not displayed on the screen of the mobile device. Thus, the context is information that is unavailable to a screen-scraper, but is valuable to the action suggestion engine for predicting the best actions.
- the context information may be considered proprietary to the third-party application or the third-party.
- the action suggestion engine uses the content information and context information to determine one or more actions that may be most helpful to the user of the mobile application.
- the action suggestion engine provides information about the one or more actions to the third-party mobile application in a semantic record.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a third-party action suggestion system in accordance with an example implementation.
- the system 100 may be used to provide suggested actions based on content displayed by a third-party mobile application and context for the content. Both the content information and the context information are provided by the third-party application to an action suggestion engine.
- the action suggestion engine provides information for displaying and triggering one or more suggested actions.
- the third-party mobile application determines how to display the provided information.
- the third-party mobile application may use the services of the action suggestion engine through an authorization process used by the action suggestion engine.
- the actions may represent intents (e.g., standard or nonstandard) for other mobile applications, and can include mobile applications the user has not yet installed on the mobile device. In some implementations, the actions may also launch a web mirror for the mobile application.
- system 100 in FIG. 1 is a client-server system, with some data processing occurring at a server 110 .
- the data processing may occur exclusively on the mobile device 170 .
- a user of the mobile device 170 may indicate that portions of the processing be performed at the server 110 .
- implementations are not limited to the exact configurations illustrated.
- the action suggestion system 100 may include a server 110 , which may be a computing device or devices that take the form of a number of different devices, for example a standard server, a group of such servers, or a rack server system.
- server 110 may be implemented in a distributed manner across multiple computing devices.
- server 110 may be implemented in a personal computer, for example a laptop computer.
- the server 110 may be an example of computer device 600 , as depicted in FIG. 6 , or system 700 , as depicted in FIG. 7 .

- the modules of the third-party action suggestion system 100 may include an action suggestion engine 120 .
- the action suggestion engine 120 may be configured to generate one or more suggested actions when provided content and context from authorized third-party applications.
- the authorized third-party applications are also referred to as source applications.
- the action suggestion engine 120 may be configured to identify entities in the content and the context. Entities may be entities in a knowledge base 130 . A single entity in the content may match more than one entity in the knowledge base 130 , which means the entity is ambiguous.
- the context information may provide clues to the correct disambiguation.
- the knowledge base 130 may be stored on the mobile device 170 and may be a subset of entities and relationships from a larger knowledge base.
- the entity may be identified in text, e.g., a word that identifies an entity.
- the entity may also be identified in an image, e.g., a logo or picture that represents the entity.
- the entity may also be identified by a pronoun that refers to the entity.
- the entity may also be identified using the context information.
- Context information includes information specific to or proprietary to the third-party mobile application or the third-party. In other words, the context information includes information that the third-party has access to that is not otherwise accessible, e.g., by the operating system, a screen-scraper, or other mobile applications not administered by the third party.
- Context information may be used to disambiguate entity mentions, e.g., when the content matches more than one entity in a knowledge base 130 .
- the context may also be used to provide entities for a complete query.
- the content which is to be displayed on the screen, may reference other entities that are needed to complete a question.
- one of the users may type “what are the fares?”
- the action suggestion engine 120 can determine which cites are the likely destination and end points. These cities are entities needed to form a complete action, e.g., searching for airline fares from city X to city Y.
- the context may also provide information that enables the action suggestion engine 120 to determine whether “fares” refers to airline, train, bus, or taxi fares.
- the context information provided to the action suggestion engine 120 enables the action suggestion engine 120 to provide higher quality suggestions.
- the action suggestion engine 120 may use known or later-discovered entity resolution techniques to recognize entities in the content provided by the third-party application given the context.
- the action suggestion engine may include an entity action map 126 .
- the entity action map 126 may be a trained machine-learning model that converts the content and context to features and predicts one or more actions based on the features.
- the model may be trained to predict a mobile application given a particular query (e.g., an entity or phrase).
- the query may be an entity identified in the content.
- the context may provide additional features for the model to provide a better suggested action.
- the model may be any type of machine-learning algorithm, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, feed-forward neural network, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, a deep learning network, etc., that can predict one or more actions (e.g., mobile applications) given a query.
- the model may accept the query character by character and the model may make a prediction only when the end of input character is encountered.
- the model uses a very small vocabulary making it compact and suitable for storage and execution on a mobile device.
- the model may include a character embedding layer, two LSTM layers with 64 nodes each, and a softmax classification layer.
- the model may be trained to take words as input instead of characters.
- the model may be trained or customized for a particular third-party application.
- the entity action map 126 may include multiple models and the system may use authentication information to select a corresponding model.
- the action suggestion engine 120 may issue a query for entities identified in the screen content and may send the query to a search engine (not shown).
- the search engine may generate a search result from which the action suggestion engine 120 can generate one or more actions.
- the entity action map 126 may map entity types to actions. For example, movies may map to a ticket-buying mobile application or to a movie database mobile application, where restaurant entities may be mapped to a reservation application.
- the entity type may be a property of the entity in the knowledge base 130 .
- the user may set the default mobile application for different types of entities.
- the entity action map 126 of the action suggestion engine 120 may include a table that maps entities or entity types to an action (i.e., a deep link) to a mobile application.
- the entries/entity types in the table may be provided by a developer of the mobile application, by an emulator that discovers the deep link and its associated entity/entity type. Implementations of the action suggestion engine 120 are not limited to these examples, but may include these and/or other methods of determining a suggested action for the content and context provided via an action suggestion application program interface (API) 122 .
- API action suggestion application program interface
- the action suggestion engine 120 may have access to various data sources that can be used as input into the action suggestion engine 120 .
- the server 110 may include search records 132 and document collection 134 .

- the search records 132 may be stored on a different computing device that is accessible to server 110 .
- the search records 132 may be distributed across a plurality of computing devices.
- the document collection 134 may be documents obtained using known or later developed web-crawling techniques, for example.
- the document collection 134 represents documents available over the Internet and may be an indexed form of the documents.
- the server 110 may include knowledge base 130 .
- the knowledge base 130 stores information about entities.
- a knowledge base 130 stores information about entities in the form of relationships between entities.
- entities in a knowledge base 130 may be related to each other by labeled edges that represent relationships.
- the knowledge base 130 may also store attributes of an entity.
- Some knowledge bases are large, sometimes including millions of entities. A knowledge base with a large number of entities and even a limited number of relationships may have billions of connections.
- the knowledge base 130 may also include image recognition entities that can be used to identify an entity in an image.
- the knowledge base 130 may include entities that represent known images of the entity and/or characteristics of the image and are used in image recognition processes (e.g., using image similarity techniques) to identify entities in images.
- the characteristics may be features provided to an image recognition model (e.g., machine learning algorithm).
- the knowledge base 130 may represent a single knowledge base, a combination of distinct knowledge bases, image recognition entities, and/or a combination of a knowledge base and image information.
- knowledge base 130 may be stored in an external storage device accessible to server 110 .
- the knowledge base 130 may be distributed across multiple storage devices and/or multiple computing devices, for example multiple servers.
- the entities and relationships in the knowledge base 130 may be searchable, e.g., via an index.
- the index may include text by which an entity has been referred to.
- reference to the knowledge base may be understood to include an index that facilitates finding an entity using a text equivalent.
- the action suggestion engine 120 may use one or more of the knowledge base 130 , the search records 132 , and the document collection 134 to predict actions given content information and context information.
- the action suggestion engine 120 may include the action suggestion API 122 , which enables third-party mobile applications to access the action suggestion engine 120 .
- the action suggestion API 122 may take as input content, context, and authorization information from the third-party application, e.g., third-party application 175 .
- the content information includes text or images to be displayed or being displayed on a screen of the mobile device 170 .
- the content information represents data the user is able to view and about which the user has requested assistance and is capable of being detected by a screen-scraper.
- Context represents data that the user is not currently able to view.
- Context can include historical information kept by the third-party application. For example, in a messaging application the context can include messages previously sent and received between the participants in the chat. As another example, the context can include previous searches performed in the third-party application. Other previously entered or viewed data may be kept by the third-party application in accordance with the terms and conditions set by the third-party and accepted by the user. Context can also include interests known to the third-party application. For example, the user may have a user profile that includes interests either expressly provided by the user or derived from previous user interaction with the third-party application, e.g., based on popular searches or operations performed by the user using the third-party application.
- Context may also include attributes about how the user uses the third-party application, such as how long the user has been using the application, how long the current session has been in use. Context may also include user preferences, such as language, region, default location, etc. that are set by the user. Context information is thus metadata about the session and may include any information that is not currently visible to the user of the mobile device 170 that the third-party application 175 provides with the content, which is information visible to the user.
- the action suggestion API 122 may also include third-party application authentication information. This is data that the third-party application uses to authenticate itself to the action suggestion engine 120 .
- the action suggestion engine 120 may only accept requests from authorized third-party applications.
- the action suggestion engine 120 can include models (e.g., machine-learning models) customized for the particular third-party application and the authentication information enables the action suggestion engine 120 to select an appropriate model for the third-party application.
- the action suggestion engine 120 may include an authentication engine 124 .
- the authentication engine 124 may use the authentication information provided by the third-party application 175 via the action suggestion API 122 to determine whether or not the action suggestion engine 120 should respond to the third-party application 175 request.
- the authentication engine 124 may use known or later developed authentication techniques to verify whether a particular request made via the action suggestion API 122 is authorized.
- a semantic record includes information about an action that the third-party application 175 can choose to display.
- the semantic record lacks layout information.
- the semantic record may include a title.
- the title provides a short text description of the action.
- the semantic record may also include a subtitle.
- the subtitle can include properties about an entity that is the subject of the action, e.g., the address of a location, the phone number of a restaurant, birthdates for a person, etc.
- the subtitle can also include a longer description of the action.
- the semantic record may also include a thumbnail.
- the thumbnail is a small image that can be displayed as a selectable control for the action.
- the semantic record may also include a target for the action.
- the target may be a deep link into the third-party application or into a target application that differs from the third-party application.
- a deep link may be similar to parameters that, when provided to a target mobile application, cause the target mobile application to display particular content.
- the deep link may be an identifier that encodes the application identifier and data used to start the application in a particular state.
- the deep links may be a list of variable-value pairs (e.g., XML, elements) that, when provided to the mobile application, cause the mobile application to display the particular content.
- the deep link can be a single variable-value pair (e.g., XML element) with a regular expression.
- Such a deep link may be referred to as a deep link template.
- the deep link template may also specify or be associated with an entity type.
- the deep link can also be an intent for the mobile application.
- the semantic record may also include one or more secondary targets.
- the secondary target may be an alternate target that the third-party application can use.
- a secondary target may take the user to a shopping application to search for an entity.
- a secondary target may enable the user to purchase an item that is the subject of the semantic record automatically.
- the secondary target may enable a user to save the information from the semantic record for later recall, e.g., to bookmark the information, or to save it as part of a reminder.
- the secondary target may enable the user to send information from the semantic record to a clipboard.
- Such a copy target action may provide text recognized in an image that was provided as part of the content to a clipboard.
- a sub-target may enable the user to share the information in the semantic record with another mobile device or another user.
- the semantic record may also include one or more sub-targets.
- the sub-target is a target action that is related to but different from the main target action.
- a sub-target may automatically download the target application associated with the main action.
- the sub-target may take the user to a web-mirror for the target in a browser application. Implementations include other possible sub-target actions.
- the third-party application 175 may decide whether or not to make such sub-actions or secondary targets available to the user. This may be used by the third-party application 175 to suggest the application to the user.
- the third-party application 175 may use the information provided in the one or more semantic records to decide how to display the action with the content that it generates for display.
- the action suggestion engine 120 uses a ranking engine to determine which suggested actions to provide to the third-party application 175 as semantic records. For example, the action suggestion engine 120 may choose a quantity (e.g., 3 or 4 ) of the top ranking, e.g., most probable or any action with a score higher than a specified threshold, to provide to the third-party application 175 .
- the quantity or threshold may be dependent on metadata about the device, e.g., a lower quantity or higher threshold when the device is moving.
- the display of the suggested actions may be scrollable, e.g., to allow the user to select from more actions than are initially displayed.
- the context information may be used to rank predicted actions.
- all suggested actions may be provided to the third-party application 175 and the third-party application 175 may select which actions from the semantic records to display to the user.
- the system may push the action suggestion engine 120 to one or more mobile devices, e.g., mobile device 170 and mobile device 190 .
- the action suggestion engine 120 can be part of the operating system functionality or may be a stand-alone mobile application.
- Mobile device 170 may be any mobile personal computing device, such as a smartphone or other handheld computing device, a tablet, a wearable computing device, etc., that operates in a closed mobile environment rather than a conventional open web-based environment.
- the mobile device 170 may also be any personal computing device.
- Mobile device 170 may be an example of computer device 600 , as depicted in FIG. 6 .
- Mobile device 170 may be one mobile device used by user 180 .
- User 180 may also have other mobile devices, such as mobile device 190 .
- Mobile device 170 may include one or more processors formed in a substrate configured to execute one or more machine executable instructions or pieces of software, firmware, or a combination thereof.
- the mobile device 170 may thus include one or more computer memories configured to store one or more pieces of data, either temporarily, permanently, semi-permanently, or a combination thereof.
- the mobile device 170 may include mobile applications, such as third-party application 175 and target application 172 , which represent machine executable instructions in the form of software, firmware, or a combination thereof.
- the third-party application 175 and the target application 172 may be mobile applications developed for a mobile processing environment. Conventionally, mobile applications operate in a closed environment, meaning that the user employs separate applications to perform activities usually performed in a web-based browser environment.
- a user of the mobile device 170 can use a mobile application provided by bookit.com.

- FIG. 4 illustrates a flow diagram of an example process 400 for suggesting actions based on content and context from a third party application, in accordance with disclosed implementations.
- Process 400 may be performed by an action suggestion system, such as system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- Process 400 may be used to determine suggested actions based on content and context provided by a third-party application.
- Process 400 may begin when the third-party application provides content, context, and authentication information to an action suggestion engine ( 405 ).
- the content represents elements currently displayed or that will be displayed to the user, e.g., the text and images of displays 200 a or 300 a .
- the context represents information not currently available for display to the user. Such context can include information in a user profile, information in a user history, device information, etc.
- the context information can be proprietary to the third-party or the third-party application.
- the context can also include a selection of content made by the user as part of initiating process 400 , e.g., a selection of text or an image.
- the authentication information includes data that enables the action suggestion engine to determine whether the third-party application is authorized to use the services of the action suggestion engine.
- the authentication data may identify the third-party application so the action suggestion engine can select and use an appropriate model for the action suggestion.
- the action suggestion engine can include multiple models for predicting actions depending on features provided, and the features may be customized to a particular third-party application.
- the content data, the context data, and the authentication data may be provided by the third-party application via an API.
- the system may determine whether the third-party is authenticated based on the authentication data provided ( 410 ). In other words, the system may verify the authentication data to determine whether the request by the third-party is valid. If the authentication data is not valid the third-party application is not authenticated ( 410 , No), and the system may return an error ( 435 ) to the third-party application and process 400 ends. Otherwise ( 410 , Yes), the system may predict at least one action based on analysis of the content data in view of the context data ( 415 ). This may be done in several ways, as explained above with regard to FIG. 1 .
- the action represents an intent or other deep link for a target mobile application.
- the target mobile application can be the same third-party application that made the request.
- the action may be a deep link into another user interface or display within the same third-party application. Such a deep link reduces the use of system resources by reducing the user input needed to arrive at the user interface represented by the target.
- the system may select a thumbnail for the action ( 420 ). If multiple actions are predicted, the system may select a respective thumbnail for each action. In implementations that provide a secondary action, the system may select a thumbnail for the secondary action.
- the thumbnail may be an icon associated with a mobile application that is the target of the action or may be another icon that represents the action, e.g., a magnifying glass for a search intent within the third-party application.
- the system may select a title for the action ( 425 ).
- the title may be a short description of the action or of an entity that is the subject of the action.
- the subtitle may include a longer description about the action, additional details about the subject entity, a description of the application, etc.
- the system may select one or more sub-targets for the action.
- a sub-target is an alternative action, such as a web-mirror or other web-friendly URL that the user can open in a browser when the user does not have the application installed.
- the system may provide the title, the thumbnail, and the action via a semantic record to the third-party application.
- the format of the semantic record is defined by the API.
- the semantic record can also include additional fields, such as the sub-target, a secondary action and secondary thumbnail, content related to the semantic record, etc.
- the system may predict several actions for the content and the system may use the context information to rank the actions. For example, the system may recognize the word ‘blackbird’ in the content.
- the system may identify two actions for the content; playing a song titled ‘blackbird’ and opening a knowledge-application (e.g., a wiki, encyclopedia, or knowledge base UI) about blackbirds.
- the system may use context information to determine which of the two actions to provide, or to provide both but in a ranked order.
- the context may include an interest in ornithology, which would result in the system ranking the knowledge-application action higher than the song action.
- the context may include a mention of Paul McCartney, which would result in the system ranking the song action higher.
- both actions may have a probability score that meet a threshold and both actions may be provided in the semantic record.
- the context information can be used to both determine actions and to rank actions.
- FIG. 5 is one example of a format for a semantic record.
- the third-party application receives the semantic records for one or more suggested actions.
- the third-party application may include operations that rank or select from among several actions, or among primary and secondary actions.
- the third-party application generates an interface that includes a control for at least one action ( 440 ).
- the control may include the thumbnail, the title, or both, from the semantic record for the action.
- the control is selectable and, when selected ( 445 , Yes), causes the third-party application to initiate the deep link for the target application ( 450 ).
- process 400 may include a feedback loop. In the feedback loop, the third-party application provides data to the action suggestion engine identify which actions the user selected and which the user cancelled. Such feedback may be used by the action suggestion engine to improve future predictions, e.g., by generating or adjusting positive or negative training examples. Process 400 then ends.
- capabilities may be provided to determine whether provision of actions is consistent with rights of use of content, layout, functionality or other aspects of the image being displayed on the device screen, and set capabilities accordingly.
- settings may be provided that limit content or selection where doing so could be in contravention of terms of service, content license, or other limitations on use.
- Such settings may be manually or automatically made, such as by a user when establishing a new service or device use permissions, or by an app installation routine or the like.

Abstract
Systems and methods provide an application programming interface to offer action suggestions to third-party applications using context data associated with the third-party. An example method includes receiving content information and context information from a source mobile application, the content information representing information to be displayed on a mobile device as part of a source mobile application administered by a third party, the context information being information specific to the third party and unavailable to a screen scraper. The method also includes predicting an action based on the content information and the context information, the action representing a deep link for a target mobile application. The method further includes providing the action to the source mobile application with a title and a thumbnail, the source mobile application using the title and thumbnail to display a selectable control that, when selected, causes the mobile device to initiate the action.
Description
This application is a non-provisional of and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/413,174, filed Oct. 26, 2016, titled “Providing Contextual Actions for Mobile Onscreen Content,” the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Due to the use of mobile devices, such as smart phones, wearable devices, and tablets, user interaction with mobile applications has been increasing. As users move away from web-based browsers to using mobile devices they often lose the ability to easily transfer data from one mobile app to another. In general, mobile applications are single purpose and very good at one specific thing, but moving information between mobile applications can be cumbersome. Providing actions for content displayed on a screen can improve the usability of mobile applications but predicting actions for displayed content is challenging.
Implementations provide personalized action suggestions in a mobile app environment. Specifically, implementations identify actions potentially helpful to the user in data provided by a third party via an application programming interface (API). Because the data is provided by the third party, it can include information unavailable via screen scraping, which improves the quality of the personalized suggestions. Implementations use the data to determine one or more action predictions, e.g., actions determined to likely be helpful to the user given the data provided, and provide the actions in a semantic record, which includes information that the third party application can use to display in an interface for initiating the actions. The semantic records can include a title, a subtitle, a thumbnail, and a target for each action. In some implementations, secondary targets are also provided in the semantic record as alternatives to the primary target. In some implementations, sub-actions may be provided in the semantic record. The target is a link, such as an intent for a target application or another type of deep link into the target application, that transfers data and control from one mobile application to another or switches data and control to a different user interface within the same application. The third party application may use the semantic record(s) to generate an action suggestion interface in any manner desired. The system may require authentication from the third party as part of the API, and may use the authentication information to select an appropriate prediction model and/or to rank predictions.
According to certain aspects of the disclosure, a system includes at least one processor and memory storing instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the system to perform operations. The operations may include receiving a request for a suggested action from a third-party, the request including content information and context information, the content information representing information to be displayed on a mobile device as part of a source mobile application operated by the third party and the context information including information specific to the source mobile application not for display on the mobile device. The operations may also include predicting at least one action for the content information based on analysis of the content information in view of the context information, and providing the at least one action with a title and an image to the third-party, the action identifying a target mobile application that differs from the source mobile application.
According to certain aspects of the disclosure, a method includes receiving content information and context information from a source mobile application, the content information representing information to be displayed on a mobile device as part of a source mobile application administered by a third party, the context information being information specific to the third party and unavailable to a screen scraper. The method also includes predicting an action based on the content information and the context information, the action representing a deep link for a target mobile application. The method further includes providing the action to the source mobile application with a title and a thumbnail, the source mobile application using the title and thumbnail to display a selectable control that, when selected, causes the mobile device to initiate the action.
According to certain aspects of the disclosure, a method includes providing content information and context information to an action suggestion application program interface, the content information representing information to be displayed on a mobile device as part of a source mobile application administered by a third party, the context information including information specific to the third party that is not for display on the mobile device. The method may also include receiving at least one semantic record, the semantic record identifying an action predicted using the content information and the context information, the semantic record including a title and a thumbnail for the action. The method may further include initiating display of the title and the thumbnail as a selectable control that is displayed with the content information on the mobile device. The action may be an action that is unavailable to a screen scraper.
In one general aspect, a computer program product embodied on a computer-readable storage device includes instructions that, when executed by at least one processor formed in a substrate, cause a computing device to perform any of the disclosed methods, operations, or processes. Another general aspect includes a system and/or a method for providing personalized assistance actions to a third party mobile application, substantially as shown in and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, and as set forth more completely in the claims.
One or more of the implementations of the subject matter described herein can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. As one example, implementations provide a way for a user to seamlessly transfer information between mobile applications, enabling a user to lookup additional information with minimal effort and usage of system resources. As another example, implementations improve the quality of suggested actions by providing both content and context for analysis, the context including information specific to the third-party application or third-party that is not available via a screen-scraping process. The actions suggested may be customized for the user of the mobile device, making it more likely that the user finds the interface helpful. The suggestions can help the user find/handle information, even though the user may not have knowledge of the application for handling the information. Thus implementations help the user discover more effective or popular tools. It will be appreciated that improved device performance is a facet of implementations. For example, the reduction of user interaction with the device (i.e., fewer inputs from the user) to transfer from a source application to a specific user interface in a target application reduces demands on computation resources, memory usage, and battery usage in a client or mobile device.
The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.
Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.
Implementations include systems and methods that predict mobile applications for content provided by a third-party mobile application in view of context for the content. The content and context is provided via an API to an action suggestion engine. The content may be a text. The content may also be an image. The context provided by the third-party application is metadata about the content that is not displayed on the screen of the mobile device. Thus, the context is information that is unavailable to a screen-scraper, but is valuable to the action suggestion engine for predicting the best actions. The context information may be considered proprietary to the third-party application or the third-party. The action suggestion engine uses the content information and context information to determine one or more actions that may be most helpful to the user of the mobile application. The action suggestion engine provides information about the one or more actions to the third-party mobile application in a semantic record. The third-party mobile application can use the semantic record decide how to display an interface for initiating the action.
The action suggestion system 100 may include a server 110, which may be a computing device or devices that take the form of a number of different devices, for example a standard server, a group of such servers, or a rack server system. For example, server 110 may be implemented in a distributed manner across multiple computing devices. In addition, server 110 may be implemented in a personal computer, for example a laptop computer. The server 110 may be an example of computer device 600, as depicted in FIG. 6 , or system 700, as depicted in FIG. 7 . Server 110 may include one or more processors formed in a substrate configured to execute one or more machine executable instructions or pieces of software, firmware, or a combination thereof. The processors can be semiconductor-based—that is, the processors can include semiconductor material that can perform digital logic. The server 110 can also include one or more computer memories. The memories, for example, a main memory, may be configured to store one or more pieces of data, either temporarily, permanently, semi-permanently, or a combination thereof. The memories may include any type of storage device that stores information in a format that can be read and/or executed by the one or more processors. The memories may include volatile memory, non-volatile memory, or a combination thereof, and store modules or engines that, when executed by the one or more processors, perform certain operations. In some implementations, the modules may be stored in an external storage device and loaded into the memory of server 110.
The modules of the third-party action suggestion system 100 may include an action suggestion engine 120. The action suggestion engine 120 may be configured to generate one or more suggested actions when provided content and context from authorized third-party applications. The authorized third-party applications are also referred to as source applications. In some implementations, the action suggestion engine 120 may be configured to identify entities in the content and the context. Entities may be entities in a knowledge base 130. A single entity in the content may match more than one entity in the knowledge base 130, which means the entity is ambiguous. The context information may provide clues to the correct disambiguation. In some implementations, the knowledge base 130 may be stored on the mobile device 170 and may be a subset of entities and relationships from a larger knowledge base. The entity may be identified in text, e.g., a word that identifies an entity. The entity may also be identified in an image, e.g., a logo or picture that represents the entity. The entity may also be identified by a pronoun that refers to the entity. The entity may also be identified using the context information. Context information includes information specific to or proprietary to the third-party mobile application or the third-party. In other words, the context information includes information that the third-party has access to that is not otherwise accessible, e.g., by the operating system, a screen-scraper, or other mobile applications not administered by the third party.
Context information may be used to disambiguate entity mentions, e.g., when the content matches more than one entity in a knowledge base 130. The context may also be used to provide entities for a complete query. For example, the content, which is to be displayed on the screen, may reference other entities that are needed to complete a question. For example, in a messaging application, one of the users may type “what are the fares?” With context that includes a history of the message stream, the action suggestion engine 120 can determine which cites are the likely destination and end points. These cities are entities needed to form a complete action, e.g., searching for airline fares from city X to city Y. The context may also provide information that enables the action suggestion engine 120 to determine whether “fares” refers to airline, train, bus, or taxi fares. Thus, the context information provided to the action suggestion engine 120 enables the action suggestion engine 120 to provide higher quality suggestions. The action suggestion engine 120 may use known or later-discovered entity resolution techniques to recognize entities in the content provided by the third-party application given the context.
In some implementations, the action suggestion engine may include an entity action map 126. In some implementations, the entity action map 126 may be a trained machine-learning model that converts the content and context to features and predicts one or more actions based on the features. For example, the model may be trained to predict a mobile application given a particular query (e.g., an entity or phrase). The query may be an entity identified in the content. The context may provide additional features for the model to provide a better suggested action. The model may be any type of machine-learning algorithm, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, feed-forward neural network, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, a deep learning network, etc., that can predict one or more actions (e.g., mobile applications) given a query. In some implementations, the model may accept the query character by character and the model may make a prediction only when the end of input character is encountered. In such implementations, the model uses a very small vocabulary making it compact and suitable for storage and execution on a mobile device. In some implementations, the model may include a character embedding layer, two LSTM layers with 64 nodes each, and a softmax classification layer. In some implementations, the model may be trained to take words as input instead of characters. In some implementations, the model may be trained or customized for a particular third-party application. In such implementations, the entity action map 126 may include multiple models and the system may use authentication information to select a corresponding model.
In some implementations, the action suggestion engine 120 may issue a query for entities identified in the screen content and may send the query to a search engine (not shown). The search engine may generate a search result from which the action suggestion engine 120 can generate one or more actions. In some implementations, the entity action map 126 may map entity types to actions. For example, movies may map to a ticket-buying mobile application or to a movie database mobile application, where restaurant entities may be mapped to a reservation application. The entity type may be a property of the entity in the knowledge base 130. In some implementations, the user may set the default mobile application for different types of entities.
In some implementations, the entity action map 126 of the action suggestion engine 120 may include a table that maps entities or entity types to an action (i.e., a deep link) to a mobile application. For example, the entries/entity types in the table may be provided by a developer of the mobile application, by an emulator that discovers the deep link and its associated entity/entity type. Implementations of the action suggestion engine 120 are not limited to these examples, but may include these and/or other methods of determining a suggested action for the content and context provided via an action suggestion application program interface (API) 122.
The action suggestion engine 120 may have access to various data sources that can be used as input into the action suggestion engine 120. For example, the server 110 may include search records 132 and document collection 134. The search records 132 may include search logs, aggregated data gathered from queries, or any other data based on queries. In some implementations, the search records 132 may be generated by a search engine in the normal process of generating search results. In some implementations, the search records 132 may be stored on a different computing device that is accessible to server 110. In some implementations, the search records 132 may be distributed across a plurality of computing devices. The document collection 134 may be documents obtained using known or later developed web-crawling techniques, for example. In some implementations, the document collection 134 represents documents available over the Internet and may be an indexed form of the documents.
As another example, the server 110 may include knowledge base 130. The knowledge base 130 stores information about entities. In some implementations, a knowledge base 130 stores information about entities in the form of relationships between entities. For example, entities in a knowledge base 130 may be related to each other by labeled edges that represent relationships. The knowledge base 130 may also store attributes of an entity. Some knowledge bases are large, sometimes including millions of entities. A knowledge base with a large number of entities and even a limited number of relationships may have billions of connections.
The knowledge base 130 may also include image recognition entities that can be used to identify an entity in an image. For example, the knowledge base 130 may include entities that represent known images of the entity and/or characteristics of the image and are used in image recognition processes (e.g., using image similarity techniques) to identify entities in images. For example, the characteristics may be features provided to an image recognition model (e.g., machine learning algorithm). The knowledge base 130 may represent a single knowledge base, a combination of distinct knowledge bases, image recognition entities, and/or a combination of a knowledge base and image information. In some implementations, knowledge base 130 may be stored in an external storage device accessible to server 110. In some implementations, the knowledge base 130 may be distributed across multiple storage devices and/or multiple computing devices, for example multiple servers. The entities and relationships in the knowledge base 130 may be searchable, e.g., via an index. For example, the index may include text by which an entity has been referred to. Thus, reference to the knowledge base may be understood to include an index that facilitates finding an entity using a text equivalent. The action suggestion engine 120 may use one or more of the knowledge base 130, the search records 132, and the document collection 134 to predict actions given content information and context information.
The action suggestion engine 120 may include the action suggestion API 122, which enables third-party mobile applications to access the action suggestion engine 120. The action suggestion API 122 may take as input content, context, and authorization information from the third-party application, e.g., third-party application 175. The content information includes text or images to be displayed or being displayed on a screen of the mobile device 170. The content information represents data the user is able to view and about which the user has requested assistance and is capable of being detected by a screen-scraper.
The context information represents data that the user is not currently able to view. Context can include historical information kept by the third-party application. For example, in a messaging application the context can include messages previously sent and received between the participants in the chat. As another example, the context can include previous searches performed in the third-party application. Other previously entered or viewed data may be kept by the third-party application in accordance with the terms and conditions set by the third-party and accepted by the user. Context can also include interests known to the third-party application. For example, the user may have a user profile that includes interests either expressly provided by the user or derived from previous user interaction with the third-party application, e.g., based on popular searches or operations performed by the user using the third-party application. Context may also include attributes about how the user uses the third-party application, such as how long the user has been using the application, how long the current session has been in use. Context may also include user preferences, such as language, region, default location, etc. that are set by the user. Context information is thus metadata about the session and may include any information that is not currently visible to the user of the mobile device 170 that the third-party application 175 provides with the content, which is information visible to the user.
The action suggestion API 122 may also include third-party application authentication information. This is data that the third-party application uses to authenticate itself to the action suggestion engine 120. The action suggestion engine 120 may only accept requests from authorized third-party applications. In some implementations, the action suggestion engine 120 can include models (e.g., machine-learning models) customized for the particular third-party application and the authentication information enables the action suggestion engine 120 to select an appropriate model for the third-party application.
The action suggestion engine 120 may include an authentication engine 124. The authentication engine 124 may use the authentication information provided by the third-party application 175 via the action suggestion API 122 to determine whether or not the action suggestion engine 120 should respond to the third-party application 175 request. The authentication engine 124 may use known or later developed authentication techniques to verify whether a particular request made via the action suggestion API 122 is authorized.
When a request is authorized, the action suggestion API 122 returns one or more semantic records to the requesting third-party application 175. A semantic record includes information about an action that the third-party application 175 can choose to display. The semantic record lacks layout information. In some implementations, the semantic record may include a title. The title provides a short text description of the action. The semantic record may also include a subtitle. The subtitle can include properties about an entity that is the subject of the action, e.g., the address of a location, the phone number of a restaurant, birthdates for a person, etc. The subtitle can also include a longer description of the action. The semantic record may also include a thumbnail. The thumbnail is a small image that can be displayed as a selectable control for the action. The semantic record may also include a target for the action. The target may be a deep link into the third-party application or into a target application that differs from the third-party application. A deep link may be similar to parameters that, when provided to a target mobile application, cause the target mobile application to display particular content. In some implementations, the deep link may be an identifier that encodes the application identifier and data used to start the application in a particular state. In some implementations, the deep links may be a list of variable-value pairs (e.g., XML, elements) that, when provided to the mobile application, cause the mobile application to display the particular content. In some implementations, the deep link can be a single variable-value pair (e.g., XML element) with a regular expression. Such a deep link may be referred to as a deep link template. In some implementations, the deep link template may also specify or be associated with an entity type. The deep link can also be an intent for the mobile application.
In some implementations, the semantic record may also include one or more secondary targets. The secondary target may be an alternate target that the third-party application can use. For example, a secondary target may take the user to a shopping application to search for an entity. As another example, a secondary target may enable the user to purchase an item that is the subject of the semantic record automatically. As another example, the secondary target may enable a user to save the information from the semantic record for later recall, e.g., to bookmark the information, or to save it as part of a reminder. As another example, the secondary target may enable the user to send information from the semantic record to a clipboard. Such a copy target action may provide text recognized in an image that was provided as part of the content to a clipboard. As another example, a sub-target may enable the user to share the information in the semantic record with another mobile device or another user. In some implementations, the semantic record may also include one or more sub-targets. The sub-target is a target action that is related to but different from the main target action. For example, a sub-target may automatically download the target application associated with the main action. As another example, the sub-target may take the user to a web-mirror for the target in a browser application. Implementations include other possible sub-target actions. The third-party application 175 may decide whether or not to make such sub-actions or secondary targets available to the user. This may be used by the third-party application 175 to suggest the application to the user. The third-party application 175 may use the information provided in the one or more semantic records to decide how to display the action with the content that it generates for display.
In some implementations, the action suggestion engine 120 uses a ranking engine to determine which suggested actions to provide to the third-party application 175 as semantic records. For example, the action suggestion engine 120 may choose a quantity (e.g., 3 or 4) of the top ranking, e.g., most probable or any action with a score higher than a specified threshold, to provide to the third-party application 175. In some implementations, the quantity or threshold may be dependent on metadata about the device, e.g., a lower quantity or higher threshold when the device is moving. In some implementations, the display of the suggested actions may be scrollable, e.g., to allow the user to select from more actions than are initially displayed. In some implementations, the context information may be used to rank predicted actions. In some implementations, all suggested actions may be provided to the third-party application 175 and the third-party application 175 may select which actions from the semantic records to display to the user.
In some implementations, the system may push the action suggestion engine 120 to one or more mobile devices, e.g., mobile device 170 and mobile device 190. In such implementations, the action suggestion engine 120 can be part of the operating system functionality or may be a stand-alone mobile application. Mobile device 170 may be any mobile personal computing device, such as a smartphone or other handheld computing device, a tablet, a wearable computing device, etc., that operates in a closed mobile environment rather than a conventional open web-based environment. The mobile device 170 may also be any personal computing device. Mobile device 170 may be an example of computer device 600, as depicted in FIG. 6 . Mobile device 170 may be one mobile device used by user 180. User 180 may also have other mobile devices, such as mobile device 190.
The third-party application 175 may include data 177. The data 177 may include historical data about the user's use of the third-party application 175. For example, the data 177 may include a history, such as a chat history, a search history, etc. The data 177 may also include information about usage of the third-party application 175, e.g., the length of a current session, settings the user selected, etc. The data 177 may also include user profile information, which may have been provided directly by the user or inferred by the third-party application 175. The data 177 is collected and stored with user permission in accordance with any user agreement associated with the third-party application 175. Although illustrated as stored on the device 170, in some implementations, the data 177 may be stored at a server, e.g., as part of a user account.
The third-party application 175 may submit requests to the action suggestion engine 120 via the action suggestion API 122. The request can be submitted in response to a specific action by the user. For example, the third-party application 175 may provide a suggestion control, which may be a specific input, a gesture, or action, that triggers the request. As one example, the suggestion control may be a long hold, a swipe left or right, a right-click, a two finger click, or any other input combination determined by the third-party application. The suggestion control can also be a menu option or an icon selected by the user. The menu may appear after some gesture/action performed by the user (e.g., a menu that appears after a swipe up or swipe down). In some implementations, the suggestion control may include dragging a control to the screen, or a portion of the screen to be selected. In some implementations, the suggestion control may be voice activated. For example, the user may speak a command to initiate sending the request to the API 122. The suggestion control may also include enabling the user to make a selection of content on the screen as part of the gesture/action.
In response to selection/actuation/activation of the suggestion control, the third-party application 175 may generate an API request for the action suggestion engine 120. The request includes content data, i.e., the data the third-party application 175 will display to the user as part of a current screen. If a selection of part of the content is made via the selection control, the third-party application 175 may provide the selection as content or context with the API request. The request also includes context information, which includes any metadata the third-party application 175 has that may provide context for the content. The context information is used to disambiguate entities in the content and determine entities missing from the content but needed to complete a request. The context information can be obtained from data 177. The context information can also be obtained from the device 170, e.g., the current time, the current location, acceleration of the device, etc. In some implementations, the data 177 or another data store on the mobile device 170 may include an action suggestion model pushed to the mobile device 170 from the server 110.
The mobile device 170 may be in communication with the server 110 and with other mobile devices 190 over network 160. Network 160 may be for example, the Internet, or the network 160 can be a wired or wireless local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), etc., implemented using, for example, gateway devices, bridges, switches, and/or so forth. Network 160 may also represent a cellular communications network. Via the network 160, the server 110 may communicate with and transmit data to/from mobile devices 170 and 190, and mobile device 170 may communicate with other mobile devices 190 (not shown).
The action suggestion system 100 represents one example configuration and implementations may incorporate other configurations. For example, one or more of the components of the action suggestion engine 120 may be performed at the mobile device 170, while one or more of the components of the third-party application 175 may be performed at a server. As another example one or more of the data stores, such as knowledge base 130, document collection 134, and search records 132, may be distributed across multiple computing devices, or may be stored as a partial copy at the mobile device 170. Likewise, the data 177 may be stored at a server or another location specified by the user. One or more of these data stores may be associated with a user account or profile. In addition, the data stores, e.g., data 177 may be copies of or subsets of data stored on a server.
To the extent that the action suggestion system 100 collects and stores user-specific data or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect the user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, search records may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined and/or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by an action suggestion system 100.
The target action associated with thumbnail 225 may be a deep link into a wiki mobile application that includes more information on the Jones theater, a deep link into a browser application for the home page of the Jones theater, or a deep link into a mobile application that lists current or future scheduled events at the Jones Theater. The title or subtitle may include common details about the theater, such as the address and/or phone number. These details may be displayed when the user performs the first action on the thumbnail 225. The thumbnail 225 may be placed next to content that represents the subject of the associated action. The specific actions illustrated in FIG. 2B are selected based on the context information provided by the third-party application 205 in addition to the content illustrated in display 200 a. For example, the third-party application 205 may include a topical interest for the user, which indicates the user has been interested in news items about Senator White in the past. This enables the action suggestion engine to select an action related to Senator White over an action related to Governor Smith. In addition, the third-party application 205 may provide the location of the user as Dallas, Tex.
The system may determine whether the third-party is authenticated based on the authentication data provided (410). In other words, the system may verify the authentication data to determine whether the request by the third-party is valid. If the authentication data is not valid the third-party application is not authenticated (410, No), and the system may return an error (435) to the third-party application and process 400 ends. Otherwise (410, Yes), the system may predict at least one action based on analysis of the content data in view of the context data (415). This may be done in several ways, as explained above with regard to FIG. 1 . The action represents an intent or other deep link for a target mobile application. The target mobile application can be the same third-party application that made the request. In other words, the action may be a deep link into another user interface or display within the same third-party application. Such a deep link reduces the use of system resources by reducing the user input needed to arrive at the user interface represented by the target.
The system may select a thumbnail for the action (420). If multiple actions are predicted, the system may select a respective thumbnail for each action. In implementations that provide a secondary action, the system may select a thumbnail for the secondary action. The thumbnail may be an icon associated with a mobile application that is the target of the action or may be another icon that represents the action, e.g., a magnifying glass for a search intent within the third-party application. The system may select a title for the action (425). The title may be a short description of the action or of an entity that is the subject of the action. The subtitle may include a longer description about the action, additional details about the subject entity, a description of the application, etc. In addition, the system may select one or more sub-targets for the action. A sub-target is an alternative action, such as a web-mirror or other web-friendly URL that the user can open in a browser when the user does not have the application installed. The system may provide the title, the thumbnail, and the action via a semantic record to the third-party application. The format of the semantic record is defined by the API. The semantic record can also include additional fields, such as the sub-target, a secondary action and secondary thumbnail, content related to the semantic record, etc. In some implementations, the system may predict several actions for the content and the system may use the context information to rank the actions. For example, the system may recognize the word ‘blackbird’ in the content. The system may identify two actions for the content; playing a song titled ‘blackbird’ and opening a knowledge-application (e.g., a wiki, encyclopedia, or knowledge base UI) about blackbirds. The system may use context information to determine which of the two actions to provide, or to provide both but in a ranked order. For example, the context may include an interest in ornithology, which would result in the system ranking the knowledge-application action higher than the song action. On the other hand, the context may include a mention of Paul McCartney, which would result in the system ranking the song action higher. In some implementations, both actions may have a probability score that meet a threshold and both actions may be provided in the semantic record. Thus, the context information can be used to both determine actions and to rank actions. FIG. 5 is one example of a format for a semantic record.
The third-party application receives the semantic records for one or more suggested actions. In some implementations, the third-party application may include operations that rank or select from among several actions, or among primary and secondary actions. The third-party application generates an interface that includes a control for at least one action (440). The control may include the thumbnail, the title, or both, from the semantic record for the action. The control is selectable and, when selected (445, Yes), causes the third-party application to initiate the deep link for the target application (450). In some implementations, process 400 may include a feedback loop. In the feedback loop, the third-party application provides data to the action suggestion engine identify which actions the user selected and which the user cancelled. Such feedback may be used by the action suggestion engine to improve future predictions, e.g., by generating or adjusting positive or negative training examples. Process 400 then ends.
It is noted here, yet also applicable to variations of the embodiments described herein, that capabilities may be provided to determine whether provision of actions is consistent with rights of use of content, layout, functionality or other aspects of the image being displayed on the device screen, and set capabilities accordingly. For example, settings may be provided that limit content or selection where doing so could be in contravention of terms of service, content license, or other limitations on use. Such settings may be manually or automatically made, such as by a user when establishing a new service or device use permissions, or by an app installation routine or the like.
