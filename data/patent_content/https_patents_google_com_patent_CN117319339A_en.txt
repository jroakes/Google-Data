Abstract
Systems, methods, and apparatuses for controlling the provision of notifications based on the source of the notifications are disclosed. Methods, apparatus, systems, and computer-readable media are provided herein for minimizing distraction caused by notifications. Notifications may be limited by scoring the sources of the notifications according to the activities involved by the recipient, previous interactions between the user and the sources of the notifications, and/or any other data that may be associated with the notifications. For example, a driving user may limit the sources from which notifications may be received unless the score of a particular source meets a notification threshold while driving. Otherwise, if the score does not meet the notification threshold, the notification may be presented to the user at a different time or via a less distracted form than is typical for presenting notifications. When the user indicates preferences for receiving notifications from particular sources, the score for those sources may be dynamically adapted to the user's preferences for the particular sources and/or notifications.
Description
Description of the division
The present application belongs to the divisional application of the Chinese patent application 201880038733.0 with the application date of 2018, 11, 15.
Technical Field
The present application relates to systems, methods, and apparatus for controlling the provision of notifications based on the source of the notifications.
Background
Humans may conduct human-machine conversations using an interactive software application referred to herein as an "automated assistant" (also referred to as a "digital agent," "chat robot," "interactive personal assistant," "intelligent personal assistant," "conversation agent," etc.). For example, humans (which may be referred to as "users" when they interact with an automated assistant) may provide commands and/or requests by using (i) spoken natural language input (i.e., utterances), which in some cases may be converted to text and then processed, and/or (ii) by providing textual (e.g., typed) natural language input. When a user is engaged in an activity (such as driving), the user may not be able to pay much attention to the automated assistant due to the awareness that the user needs to navigate the vehicle. Thus, the automated assistant may provide various notifications to the user, but the user does not then remember what notifications were provided. Furthermore, in the case where the user is participating in group chat or subscribing to various services, if the user is too distracted while driving, the number of messages incoming to the user may be too large and may lead to dangerous consequences. If providing a notification is generally ineffective for eliciting a response from the user, then computing resources are wasted when the notification is repeated to the user. Furthermore, it is time consuming for users who may have confirmed some notifications despite participating in some other activity to repeat the notification without selection.
Disclosure of Invention
Embodiments described herein relate to systems, methods, and apparatuses for dynamically determining whether, when, and/or how to present those notifications to a user based at least in part on the sources of various electronic notifications. Dynamically adjusting the provision of notifications to users may reduce distraction caused by certain notifications (e.g., by suppressing their provision and/or providing them in a less distracted form) and/or may reduce consumption of various computing resources associated with providing certain notifications. For example, computing resources may be reduced by reducing the number and/or scope of notifications provided and/or by suppressing the immediate provision of certain notifications, but rather providing such notifications at a later time when the user is less distracted (thereby alleviating the provision of notifications to the user that occurs when the user is distracted and again at a later time).
In various implementations, distraction associated with a received notification can be mitigated by using data related to an identity of a source of the notification and/or context (context) data associated with the notification. For example, whether and/or how the notification is provided to the user may be based on a score of the source associated with the source of the notification. The score of the source may be user specific and may be based on: past computer-based interactions of a user with a source; current context data associated with the user; context data associated with the source; explicit user interface input from the user and/or other data. As used herein, a "source" may refer to a person (e.g., "bob"), an application (e.g., "Messaging App 1"), or a combination of applications (such as a media application, messaging application, navigation application, and/or other application (s)). Notifications initialized by an application may be processed (e.g., provided or suppressed) according to the importance of the notification to the user and/or the activity the user is engaged in (e.g., driving a vehicle). In some implementations, the sources of notifications can be ranked by an automated assistant according to how users typically interact with the sources and/or their notifications and/or any other context data (e.g., calendar data, location data, etc.) associated with the sources and/or users. Further, the ranking may be adjusted over time to continually modify the provision of notifications received by the user from the source.
Techniques are implemented by one or more computing devices that involve selectively suppressing and/or otherwise adjusting the provision of inbound notifications according to the source and/or context data of the notifications. For example, a user may operate a vehicle including a vehicle computing device, and the vehicle computing device may be paired with a portable computing device including various applications (e.g., via bluetooth, "wired" connection and/or other communication protocol (s)). An application may communicate with remote server device(s) over a network (e.g., LTE, wi-Fi, bluetooth, or any other network connection) to receive data from the remote server device(s). Adjustments to the provision of the inbound notification may be performed at the portable computing device, the remote server device(s), and/or the vehicle computing device. For example, the portable computing device and/or the vehicle computing device may perform all or some aspects of the processing that involves selectively suppressing notification to the user, thereby enabling such processing to be performed even when the remote server device is not available (e.g., due to a network disruption).
In some implementations, the portable computing device can initially filter the notifications according to their attributes and then transmit all or some aspects of the remaining notifications to the remote server device. In these and other ways, only those notifications that satisfy the initial filtering of the portable computing device are transmitted to the remote server device, thereby mitigating consumption of network resources. The remote server device may then process each of the remaining notifications and determine a score for each of the remaining notifications. These scores may be based on the content of the notification (e.g., natural language content), the content of the message corresponding to the notification, contextual data associated with the notification, behavioral data associated with the user, and/or any other data that may be used to score the relevance or importance of the notification. In some versions of those implementations, the remote server device provides the score to the portable computing device, and when the portable computing device receives the score, the portable computing device may compare the score to one or more thresholds in order to determine how and/or when to present the notification to the user. For example, the score provided for the first notification may satisfy a partial notification threshold, thereby causing the portable computing device to present the notification as a graphic on the display device. Continuing with the example, the score provided for the second notification may satisfy a full notification threshold and thereby cause the portable computing device to present the notification in audible form as well as a query as to whether the user wants to respond to the query. Still continuing with the example, the score provided for the third notification may not satisfy any notification threshold, thereby causing the portable computing device to refrain from immediately providing any content related to the third notification. In some additional and/or alternative versions of those embodiments, the remote server device determines whether and/or how to provide the notification based on the score, and provides an indication of whether and/or how to provide the notification to the portable computing device (e.g., instead of the score). The portable computing device may then use the indication of whether and/or how to provide the notification in determining whether and/or how to present the notification.
In some implementations, notifications can be restricted by using a hash that allows an automated assistant to identify applications associated with the notification. The automated assistant may execute at least in part on and/or communicate with the portable computing device. Using the hash to identify an application associated with the notification may allow the automated assistant to process the provision of the notification based on the application associated with the notification. For example, the automated assistant may enable immediate provision of notifications with hashes corresponding to messaging applications, while suppressing immediate provision of notifications corresponding to certain other notifications (e.g., notifications regarding sales, gaming applications, tickets, etc.). In some implementations, the inbound notification may be included in a data packet that includes a data string based on the name of the application that initiated the inbound notification. The data string may be compared to a hash table to determine the application and/or score or priority of the application to which the inbound notification corresponds.
When an inbound notification corresponding to the messaging application is received at the portable computing device or the vehicle computing device, the automated assistant may cause further processing to be performed on the inbound message or the inbound notification. For example, in connection with other contextual data (e.g., location of the user, location of the source, calendar data, relationship of the source to the user, related notifications, and/or any other data), the content of the message (e.g., title, subject, body, recipient, sender, etc.) may be used to determine whether to notify the user of the message or to limit the notification in some manner. In some implementations, notifications may be limited based on whether the user is driving or whether the user has explicitly indicated that they do not want to be disturbed while driving. For example, the automated assistant may be accessed through a vehicle computing device, and the vehicle computing device may include an audio interface capable of receiving voice commands from a user. When the automated assistant begins to indicate that a notification has been received (e.g., "you have received a message from klen. You want … (You have received a message from karen. Would you like.)"), the user can interrupt the automated assistant and indicate that they do not want to be disturbed (e.g., "Please now do not disturb me. (plase don't disturb me right no.)"). In response, the automated assistant can collect contextual data about the responses provided by the user in order to limit similar notifications that would otherwise be provided in similar circumstances.
Additionally or alternatively, the automated assistant may use the score of the source to query the user as to whether to limit notifications from the source. For example, if multiple notifications are being received from an application that is relatively low scoring (e.g., a shopping application that is not accessed by the user frequently (such as once a week)), the automated assistant may query the user as to whether the user wants to receive those notifications at this time of receipt (e.g., while driving). If the user indicates that they do not want to receive notifications, the source score may be further reduced based on the user's response and any contextual data (e.g., vehicle-related data) collected at the time of receipt.
The source scoring may be performed by one or more processes. In some implementations, source scoring may be performed by a context scoring engine and a score adjustment engine. The context scoring engine may use the context data to score sources of data being used by the automated assistant as a basis for notifications. The context scoring engine may operate at one or more of a vehicle computing device, a portable computing device, and/or a remote server device. For example, the automated assistant may run at least at a remote server device, and the context scoring engine may run at a portable computing device. When the portable computing device receives a notification from the automated assistant, the context scoring engine may limit the notifications that will be provided to the user according to the manner in which the context scoring engine scores the sources. The source score may be established and/or adjusted at the context scoring engine by using context data and/or user behavior data available to the portable computing device. For example, the score of a source designated as a user's spouse may be made higher than most other contacts in the contact list, based at least on the contact list stored at the portable computing device. In this way, distraction can be alleviated based on data that the user has explicitly provided, as well as any other contextual data and/or behavioral data collected by the automated assistant.
The source score may be further adjusted by a score adjustment engine that may operate in conjunction with a context scoring engine. The score adjustment engine may update the score of the source (e.g., person and/or application) based on learned behavior of the user as observed by the automated assistant and/or any other device with which the user interacts. Such learned behavior may be based on how the user responds to the source, whether the user chooses to receive notifications from the source, previous interactions between the user and the source, and/or any other actions that may be associated with the user and/or the source. For example, a user may have requested an automated assistant to call a particular contact (i.e., source) while driving his vehicle. Thus, the score adjustment engine may increase the score of a particular contact during a telephone call based on the user's willingness to talk to the particular contact while operating the vehicle.
In some implementations, the automated assistant can explicitly query the user for the importance of a particular source, so that the automated assistant can cause the score for the particular source to be adjusted accordingly. For example, the first time a message is received from a particular source during an activity (e.g., driving), the automated assistant may ask the user if they want to know the content of the message (e.g., "do you want to hear the message from south. If the user is actively responding (e.g., "of course"), the score for a particular source may be set to be above a particular notification threshold in order to receive notifications from the source during the activity. If the user responds negatively (e.g., "does Not now want"), the score for a particular source may be set below a particular notification threshold so that in the future the user is Not distracted by messages from the source until the score for the source increases above the threshold.
Although the score is initially set below a particular threshold, the score for the source may be modified to exceed the particular threshold. For example, if the user receives a notification about an incoming message from a new contact while the user is driving his vehicle, and the user refuses to receive the content of the message, the score of the new contact may be set to be below the notification threshold. Thereafter, if the user has added an event in their calendar and the new contact is identified as a participant in the event, the score of the new contact may be increased by the score adjustment engine. If the score of the new contact eventually meets or exceeds a notification threshold, a notification regarding a message from the new contact may be received while the user is engaged in an activity (e.g., driving), at least until the user again indicates that he dislikes receiving such notification while engaged in the activity.
In some implementations, scoring the source may be based on interaction(s) between the source and the user immediately prior to the user engaging in the activity. For example, the source and user may participate in a conversation via a messaging application, and before the conversation ends, the user may decide to subsequently enter his vehicle and drive to a location. If during driving, the vehicle computing device or a portable computing device carried by the user receives a notification indicating that a message was received from the source, the score for the source may be adjusted based on the most recent context data. The latest context data may identify the time of the latest session between the user and the source and, thus, indicate that the session immediately precedes the user's start driving. If the score of the source increases such that the score of the source is above the notification threshold, the user may receive a notification or message during his driving. However, if the score increase does not increase the score above the notification threshold, the user may be notified of the message after the user has completed his or her driving or at some other time when the user is less active.
The restriction on providing notifications may be based on one or more notification thresholds, such as a full notification threshold and/or a partial notification threshold. When a notification is provided to a computing device (e.g., a vehicle computing device and/or a portable computing device), a score for each source associated with the notification may be compared to each threshold to determine how the notification should be presented to the user. For example, the context scoring engine may initially establish the score of the source as being below both the full notification threshold and the partial notification threshold. Thus, when the user is driving or performing a particular activity, no notification associated with the source is provided to the user. If the score of the source increases beyond a partial notification threshold, at least a portion of the notification or a message associated with the notification may be presented to the user as the user is active due to explicit indications from the user and/or other data collected by the automated assistant. If the score of the source further increases beyond the full notification threshold, the entire notification or a message associated with the notification may be presented to the user as the user is active.
In some implementations, a method implemented by one or more processors is set forth as including operations such as, at a first computing device, receiving notifications from a remote server device that are accessible to an application on which the notifications are based. The operations may further include: a first source of a first one of the notifications and a second source of a second one of the notifications are identified. The first source may correspond to a first entity controlling a first one of the applications and the second source may correspond to a second entity controlling a second one of the applications. Operations may further include: it is determined that the first score of the first source meets the notification threshold and the second score of the second source does not meet the notification threshold. The first score may be based on a first previous interaction instance between a user of the first computing device and the first source. The second score may be based on a second previous interaction instance between the user and the second source. Operations may further include: context data is received from the second computing device based on one or more attributes of an activity in which the second computing device is participating. The second computing device may be configured to provide certain notifications according to the score of the source associated with the notification. Further, the operations may include: modifying the second score based on the context data; determining that the modified second score meets a notification threshold; and causing the second computing device to provide the first notification and the second notification based on the first score and the modified second score meeting the notification threshold.
The second computing device may be a vehicle computing device integrated in the vehicle and paired with the first computing device. The activity may be navigating a vehicle including the vehicle computing device. The context data may identify how the vehicle navigates based on one or more attributes. Navigating the vehicle may include: the vehicle is navigated by dictating (dictation) a route at an audio interface of the vehicle computing device, and the vehicle computing device may include a navigation application corresponding to a third score meeting the notification threshold. Modifying the second score based on the activity may further cause the second score to temporarily meet the notification threshold until the second computing device ceases to participate in the activity. The notification threshold may be associated with a particular form that provides the first notification and the second notification. Particular forms may include one or both of the following: audio form and visual form.
In other embodiments, a method implemented by one or more processors is set forth as comprising the steps of: receiving a notification at a client computing device of a user during performance of an activity by the user; and identifying, at the client computing device, a source of the notification. Operations may further include: at the client computing device and based on the source of the notification, it is determined that the notification is a candidate for providing to the user during execution of the activity. In response to determining that the notification is a candidate for providing to the user during performance of the activity, the operations may further include: transmitting, by the client computing device, notification data based on the notification to the remote server device; receiving, from a remote server device, provisioning (provisioning) data indicating whether to provision a notification in response to the transmission; and providing, by the client computing device and based on the provisioning data, notification content based on the notification to the user during the activity. Such that providing notification content may include: such that the notification content is provided via at least one of the client computing device and an additional computing device paired with the client device. In some implementations, the operations may include: receiving, at the client computing device, an additional notification during execution of the activity; and identifying, at the client computing device, an additional source of the additional notification. Operations may further include: at the client computing device and based on an additional source of the additional notification, it is determined that the additional notification is not a candidate for providing to the user during the activity. Operations may further include: based on determining that the notification is not a candidate for providing to the user: refraining from transmitting additional notification data to the remote server, wherein the additional notification data is based on the additional notification; and refraining from providing the additional notification during the activity. Transmitting the notification data to the remote server device may be further based on determining that the user is active at the client device.
The provisioning data received from the remote server device in response to the transmission further indicates a particular form via which to provision the notification. Such that providing notification content may include: the notification content is caused to be provided via the particular form based on the provision data indicating the particular form. The specific form may be one of the following: audio-only, graphics-only, and combined audio and graphics. The particular form may indicate whether the notification content is provided via the client computing device only, the additional computing device only, or both the client computing device and the additional computing device. The activity may be related to a vehicle and the additional computing device may be integrated with the vehicle. Further, causing the notification content to be provided may include: the additional computing device is controlled by the client device to provide the notification content. The notification may be a message from a source and include natural language content formulated (formulated) by the source. Further, determining that the notification is a candidate for providing to the user at the client computing device may be based on a source of the notification and may be independent of natural language content. The provisioning data may be determined at the remote server device based on the natural language content. The notification content may include a subset of the notification or an override of the notification, and the provisioning data that may be received from the remote server device further includes the notification content. The providing data may include a score for the notification, and causing the providing of the notification data based on the providing data may include: the notification data is caused to be provided based on the score meeting a threshold.
In still other embodiments, a method implemented by one or more processors is set forth that includes operations such as receiving one or more pre-activity messages in a messaging session between participants. The participants may include a user and one or more additional users. Each of the participants may conduct an information transceiving session through a corresponding information transceiving application using a corresponding computing device. The pre-activity message may be received before the user performs a particular activity. Operations may further include: after receiving the one or more pre-activity messages, determining that the user is performing a particular activity; and in response to determining that the user is performing a particular activity: a modified notification mode is activated that selectively suppresses the provision of electronic notifications to the user. The operations may further include: additional messages provided by one of the one or more additional users in the messaging session are received while the user is engaged in a particular activity and while the modified notification mode is activated.

Detailed Description
FIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 for restricting notifications provided to a user based on scores generated for the notifications and/or the source of the notifications. The system 100 can include a remote device 114 (such as the server device 102) that can host the automated assistant 104. In some implementations, the automated assistant 104 can be hosted at the server device 102 and/or at one or more computing devices capable of hosting an assistant application. For example, in some implementations, the automated assistant 104 may be hosted at the personal computing device 118, the vehicle computing device 134, and/or the remote device 114. The processes and/or functions performed by the automated assistant 104 may be performed by the server device 102 or may be distributed across separate devices. For example, a user may provide input (such as voice commands or text input) at an assistant interface of the personal computing device 118. Input from a user may be transmitted from the personal computing device 118 to the server device 102 over a network 116, such as a private network (e.g., peer-to-peer network) or a public network (e.g., the internet). When the input is a voice command or other audible input from the user, the input may be received at a voice-to-text engine 108, which voice-to-text engine 108 may be part of the automated assistant 104 or independent of the automated assistant 104. The speech-to-text engine 108 may convert the input into text that the automated assistant 104 may parse to determine how well the automated assistant 104 may respond to the input from the user.
Interactions between one or more users and the automated assistant 104 may be stored as assistant interaction data 106. The assistant interaction data 106 can, for example, provide corresponding data identifying input received from the one or more users and one or more responses generated from the automated assistant 104. The automated assistant 104 may employ one or more machine learning algorithms to learn or otherwise adapt to user requests, preferences, and/or the manner in which a user interacts with the automated assistant 104. In some implementations, the server device 102 and/or the automated assistant 104 can include a server scoring engine 110. The server scoring engine 110 may be an application, script, and/or other executable data capable of determining or otherwise estimating a score for the source of the notification 112 to be received by the user.
The notification may be generated at the server device 102 and/or the notification may be provided from a separate device and/or application to the server device 102 or the personal computing device 118. For example, data from a separate server device may cause the server device 102, the personal computing device 118, and/or the automated assistant 104 to receive or generate the notification 112. In addition, data from other devices operated by other users 140 (such as portable computing devices) may also cause the server device 102, the personal computing device 118, and/or the automated assistant 104 to receive or generate notifications 112. In this manner, a plurality of different applications from a plurality of different sources (e.g., people or machines) may cause the notification 112 to be stored at any device provided in the system 100.
In some implementations, the system 100 may include a vehicle apparatus 130 (such as a vehicle computing device 134), the vehicle device 130 being part of a vehicle 132 and may be in communication with the personal computing device 118 and/or the server device 102. For example, other users 140 may cause messages to be transmitted from messaging applications on their portable computing devices 142 to the vehicle computing device 134 and/or the personal computing device 118. Initially, when other users 140 send messages over the network 116, the automated assistant 104 may be aware of the message transmission and generate notifications 112. For example, the automated assistant 104 may communicate with a messaging application associated with the user, and the user's messaging application may provide the automated assistant 104 with an indication that a message was received from the other user 140. Alternatively, messages transmitted from the portable computing device 142 may be transmitted by a network carrier (network carrier) over the network 116 to the personal computing device 118, which personal computing device 118 may include an assistant application 120 in communication with the automated assistant 104. The personal computing device 118 can generate a notification 122 regarding the received message and provide an indication to the automated assistant 104 at the server device 102 that the message was received from the other user 140. The personal computing device 118 may also provide notifications to the vehicle computing device 134 for presentation at the vehicle application 138, audio interface, and/or display interface of the vehicle computing device 134. However, because presenting notifications may distract the user while driving or performing other activities, notifications may be limited according to certain attributes of the notifications.
For example, as the vehicle 132 is navigated along a route, a navigation application at the personal computing device 118 may provide audible instructions regarding various turns to be made during route navigation. The client scoring engine 124 operating at the personal computing device 118 may filter and/or score notifications or sources of notifications to limit the degree of distraction that the user will experience (an amount of distractions). The source of notifications may include a navigation application that may be scored to meet one or more thresholds, whereby the one or more thresholds allow notifications from the navigation application to be presented to the user while driving. Scoring the navigation application may be based on the fact that: the user opens the application while driving his vehicle, or the user pairs his personal computing device 118 with the vehicle computing device 134 (e.g., by establishing a communication link or communication session between his personal computing device 118 and the vehicle computing device via any suitable wired or wireless communication protocol). Alternatively, scoring the navigation application to meet the one or more thresholds may be based on the context data 136, which context data 136 may provide information about the operation of the vehicle, the environment of the vehicle, other activities performed by the user within the vehicle, other vehicle applications 138 being accessed at the vehicle 132, and/or any other information related to the activities being performed by the user.
The score assigned to a particular notification source may be modified based on the context data 136. For example, when the context data 136 indicates that the vehicle 132 is in motion, the score of the navigation application may be increased. Further, because the context data 136 indicates that the vehicle 132 is in motion and/or has reached a threshold speed, the client scoring engine 124 may reduce the score assigned to applications unrelated to navigation.
In some instances, notifications 122 from multiple different sources may be received at the personal computing device 118, and the client scoring engine 124 may score the sources such that only the score of sources that is less than the total number of sources meets the notification threshold. For example, the notification 122 may be based at least in part on data provided by a messaging application (e.g., such as a messaging application on the portable computing device 142) and a gaming application. The client scoring engine 124 may score the messaging application and/or the source of the message using the messaging application such that the score meets the notification threshold. Further, the client scoring engine 124 may score the gaming application such that the score of the gaming application does not meet the notification threshold. Thus, sources having scores that meet the notification threshold will be associated with notifications that make up a subset of the notifications. Thereafter, a subset of the notifications may be presented to the user via an interface 126 of a computing device 128 (such as the personal computing device 118) or provided to the server device 102 for further processing.
In some implementations, notification data corresponding to the subset of notifications can be provided to the automated assistant 104 and/or the server scoring engine 110 for further processing. In particular, the server scoring engine 110 can provide a score for each source of each notification in the subset of notifications. For example, the server scoring engine 110 may access the assistant interaction data 106, which assistant interaction data 106 may provide an indication of who the user has a conversation with while driving and who the user has refused to respond while driving. The server scoring engine 110 may use the assistant interaction data 106 to increase the score of the source from which the user has previously selected to receive messages while driving, and decrease the score of the individual source from which the user has previously refused to receive messages while driving. Alternatively or in addition, the score of a source may be based on the relationship of the source (e.g., spouse, relative, acquaintance, colleague, etc.). For example, sources corresponding to a user's spouse may be assigned a higher score than individual sources corresponding to the user's friends. Alternatively or in addition, sources of participants that are events the user is driving to may be assigned a higher score than individual sources that are not identified as participants, based at least on calendar data accessible to the automated assistant 104.
The score for the source corresponding to the subset of notifications may be transmitted back to the personal computing device 118, and the personal computing device 118 may compare the score to a notification threshold stored by the personal computing device 118 or otherwise accessible to the personal computing device 118. Thereafter, messages corresponding to sources having scores meeting the notification threshold may be presented to the user at the personal computing device 118 and/or at the vehicle computing device 134. Other messages corresponding to sources having scores that do not meet the notification threshold may be prevented from being presented to the user at least until, in a subsequent instance, the scores of the sources meet the notification threshold.
In some implementations, the score of the source may be compared to a plurality of different notification thresholds stored by the personal computing device 118 or otherwise accessible to the personal computing device 118. For example, the score may be compared to a full notification threshold, and when the score meets the full notification threshold, the notification corresponding to the source to which the score was assigned may be presented in full or complete form. For example, if the notification is associated with a text message, the assistant application 120 may cause the text message to be audibly or visually presented to the user. Further, in some implementations, if the score meets the full notification threshold and the notification is associated with a text message, the assistant application 120 can be presented with an option to respond to the text message. In other implementations, the notification threshold may include a partial notification threshold, and when the score meets the partial notification threshold, a notification corresponding to the source to which the score was assigned may be partially presented to the user. For example, if the notification is associated with an email, the assistant application 120 presents the subject line of the email to the user audibly or visually. Alternatively, if the score of the source of the email meets the partial notification threshold, the assistant application 120 may cause graphics to be displayed at the personal computing device 118 and/or the vehicle computing device 134 to mitigate distraction while the user is driving.
In some implementations, other users 140 may operate a portable computing device 142, the portable computing device 142 also including an automated assistant, or the automated assistant may access the portable computing device 142. The score of a user may be set by the client scoring engine 124 and/or the server scoring engine 110 when the user sends messages to other users 140 while driving the vehicle 132. The score of the user may be set to be below one or more notification thresholds based at least on the context data 136 indicating that the user is driving the vehicle 132. Such scoring may be performed in response to selecting a preference at its portable computing device 142 so as not to receive messages from people while they are driving. In this way, the user will not receive response messages from other users 140, at least until they complete driving, because other users 140 will not receive messages from the user while the user is driving. In some implementations, the assistant application associated with the other user 140 can communicate such preferences of the other user 140 to the automated assistant 104, and the automated assistant 104 can cause the user to notice the preferences of the other user 140. This may further encourage the user not to send a short message while driving, as the user will be aware that: messages they send while driving are not actually received by other users 140 until the driving user completes driving.
FIG. 2 includes a state diagram 200 illustrating the manner in which notification scores may be adjusted to reduce distraction to a user. The state diagram 200 may be embodied as one or more processes executing at one or more computing devices, such as a personal computing device, a server computing device, and/or any other computing device capable of processing notifications. The state diagram 200 illustrates how the first user 204 and the second user 208 engage in communications that cause their respective score data to dynamically change. In particular, the score data may be adjusted to reduce distraction experienced by the first user 204 and/or the second user 208, at least when one of the users is engaged in an activity. This may allow important communications to be transmitted to the user and delay, omit, or otherwise present less important communications to the user in a less distracting format or form.
The state diagram 200 includes a remote device 202, which remote device 202 may be a server device (e.g., a scoring engine) hosting an assistant application and/or any other application capable of processing notifications. The remote device 202 may communicate with a first computing device 206 operated by a first user 204 and a second computing device 210 operated by a second user 208. Each of the remote device 202, the first computing device 206, and the second computing device 210 may generate and/or modify scores that may be used to define the source of data as sufficiently relevant or important as a basis for providing notifications to the user. The state diagram 200 provides an example scenario in which the score of a source is modified due to specific circumstances affecting the first user 204 and the second user 208.
The second user 208 may initially enter contact information 212 into the second computing device 210. The contact information 212 may be transmitted to the remote device 202, and the remote device 202 may score the source corresponding to the contact information 212 based on the data provided in the contact information 212 and/or any other data associated with the second user 208. For example, the contact information 212 may be associated with a colleague with which the second user 208 has previously corresponded through electronic communication. After acquainting with the colleague, the second user 210 may add contact information 212 to the second computing device 210 and the remote device 202. Thereafter, as provided in state diagram 200, first user 204, which may be the colleague, may send message 214 to second user 208.
The message 214 may be received by the second computing device 210 and/or the remote device 202. However, depending on the situation in which the second user 208 receives the message 214, the second user 208 may not be notified of the message 214 until the score corresponding to the first user 204 has met the notification threshold. In some implementations, the second computing device 210 can generate score data associated with the first user 204. In other implementations, the message 214 may be initially received at the second computing device 210, and the second computing device 210 may provide the notification data 216 to the remote device 202.
Notification data 216 may be processed by remote device 202 so that remote device 202 may identify the source of message 214 and/or any other data related to the context of the message. For example, the remote device 202 may process the notification data 216 to determine interaction data 218. The interaction data 218 may identify or describe previous instances of the first user 204 and the second user 208 interacting or otherwise communicating. The interaction data 218 may also identify other data associated with the first user 204, such as calendar data, location data, social network data, message data, phone data, purchase data, and/or any other data that may be associated with the source of the information. The notification data 216 may be used as a basis for the remote device 202 to generate the first score data 220, which first score data 220 may be transmitted from the remote device 202 to the first computing device 10. The first computing device 206 may perform a process of modifying the first score data 222. The modified first score data 222 may be based on the first score data 220 and/or based on any other information available to the first computing device 206. For example, the first computing device 206 may be aware of one or more applications that the second user 208 is accessing, and may modify the first score data according to the type of application that the second user 208 is using.
The modified first score data 222 may be compared to one or more notification thresholds to determine whether to present notifications regarding the message 214 to the second user 208. If the modified first score data 222 meets the notification threshold, a notification (i.e., the notification 224) of the related message 214 may be presented at the second computing device 210 and/or at a separate computing device associated with the second user 208. If the modified first score data 222 does not meet the notification threshold, the notification may be provided in a different format, in a different form, or omitted entirely at another time.
If the second user 208 receives notification regarding the message 214, the second user 208 may send a response message 226 to the first user 204. In particular, the second user 208 may instruct the automated assistant to provide the response message 226 to the first user 204. When the automated assistant is hosted at the remote device 202, the remote device 202 will have a record of the second user 208 responding to the first user 204. If the second user 208 is performing an activity when sending the response message 226, the automated assistant may perform a process of modifying the first score data 228. In particular, the automated assistant may modify the first score data 228 to reflect the willingness of the second user 208 to communicate with the first user 204 during the activity. For example, the first score may be increased such that when the second user 208 is involved in (involve) activity and a message is received from the first user 204, the first computing device 210 may present the message to the first user 204 based at least on how high the first score is.
In response to receiving the response message 226, the first computing device 206 may provide notification data 230 to the remote device 202. The remote device 202 may perform a process of determining the activity 234 of the second user 208. The remote device 202 may process the notification data 230 as well as any data related to the activity being performed by the second user 208 to provide second score data 232. In some implementations, the second score data 232 can be based on a relationship between the first user 204 and the second user 208. In other implementations, the second score data 232 may be based on the preferences of the second user 208 as well as data identifying the content of the response message 226 and/or any other data related to the second user 208.
When the second score data 232 meets a notification threshold associated with the first user 204, the first computing device 206 may perform a process of presenting the notification 236. The first user 204 may then provide a response message 238 to the second user 208. The remote device 202 may acknowledge the response message 238 and perform a process of modifying the second score data 240. The second score data 240 may reflect the willingness of the first user 204 to communicate with the second user by modifying the second score data 240 in view of the second user being engaged in an activity, in view of the second user having a particular relationship with the first user 204, and/or in view of any other circumstance or information related to the second user 208 and the first user 204.
FIG. 3 illustrates a method 300 for restricting notifications provided to a user based on the score assigned to the source of the notification. The method 300 may be performed by one or more computing devices and/or any other apparatus capable of processing notifications to be received by a person or machine. The method 300 may include an operation 302: at a first computing device, notifications are received from a remote server device that is accessible to applications on which the notifications are based. For example, the first computing device may be a cellular telephone including an automated assistant interface for interacting with an automated assistant application via the automated assistant interface. Further, the applications accessible to the remote server device may be messaging applications, gaming applications, media applications, web applications, health applications, navigation applications, and/or any other applications that may operate at the computing device.
The method 300 may further include an operation 304 of: a first source of a first one of the notifications and a second source of a second one of the notifications are identified. The first source and the second source may correspond to separate entities that respectively control a certain one of the applications. For example, the first source may correspond to a person who is a spouse of the user, as indicated by a contact list accessible by the first computing device. The second source may correspond to a colleague of the user. In some implementations, the first source and the second source may each be associated with a separate server that communicates data associated with the notification to the remote server device.
Further, the method 300 may include an operation 306: it is determined that the first score of the first source meets the notification threshold and the second score of the second source does not meet the notification threshold. The notification threshold may be stored by the first computing device or otherwise accessible by the first computing device. The notification threshold may be associated with how notifications are provided to the user. Further, the notification threshold may be one of a plurality of different notification thresholds that may be used to filter notifications according to their corresponding scores or according to scores of their corresponding sources. For example, the notification threshold in operation 306 may be provided to initially filter the source according to who the source is or the application associated with the source. Thereafter, the score of the source meeting the notification threshold may be updated based on other criteria, such as, for example, interaction data, contextual data, and/or any other information that may be associated with the source.
Further, the method 300 may include an operation 308 of: context data associated with an activity in which the second computing device is participating is received from the second computing device. The second computing device may be a vehicle computing device that collects data related to the operation of the vehicle and any other information related to the context in which the vehicle is operated. For example, the context data may include vehicle speed, route data, weather data, vehicle maintenance data, passenger data, and/or any other data that may be derived from the context of the computing device. In some implementations, the contextual data may be based on signals from one or more sensors on the vehicle or one or more remote devices in communication with the vehicle computing device. For example, the context data may correspond to route data provided by a navigation application operating at the vehicle computing device. The route data may identify the destination of the route as a work meeting location associated with a second source (e.g., colleague). In this way, the context data may be compared to sources having scores that have previously met the notification threshold to determine how to further adjust the scores.
The method 300 may include an operation 310: the second score is modified based on the context data such that the second score meets the notification threshold. For example, the second source may be a colleague and the destination identified by the context data may be a job conference site or other work related site. Thus, the score of the second source may be adjusted based on the correlation of the second source with the context data. In this way, the score of the source may dynamically change as the context of the notification changes. In some implementations, the second score can be modified such that the second score temporarily meets the notification threshold. For example, when the context data indicates that the user has arrived at the destination or subsequently left the destination after arriving, the second score may again be modified to not satisfy the notification threshold.
The method 300 may further include an operation 312: the method further includes causing the second computing device or controlling the second computing device to provide the first notification and the second notification based on both the first score and the second score meeting the notification threshold. In some implementations, causing the second computing device to provide the first notification and the second notification may include: a display device connected to a second computing device of the vehicle is caused to display graphics and/or text corresponding to the first notification and the second notification.
FIG. 4 illustrates a method 400 for restricting notifications to a subset of notifications based at least in part on score data generated at a remote device. The method 400 may be performed by one or more computing devices and/or any other apparatus capable of processing notifications to be received by a person or machine. The method 400 may include an operation 402: at the client device, notifications are received from a remote server device that is accessible to applications on which the notifications are based. The notification may come from a number of different applications, web services, automated assistants, third party agents, and/or any other program capable of providing data to the device.
The method 400 may further include an operation 404: the source of the notification is identified. These sources may correspond to entities controlling the application. For example, the applications may include messaging applications and third party proxy applications. Thus, the sources of the control messaging application and the third party proxy application may be one or more persons, devices, and/or any other entity capable of controlling the application or device. The source may be identified by using data included with or otherwise associated with the received notification. For example, the data may include a header or other string text that may be compared to a lookup table to determine the name of the source of the notification. In some implementations, the lookup table may include or be associated with a score list of sources. The score may include a dynamic score that changes over time as the user interacts with the source and/or as the context of the user and/or source changes over time.
The method 400 may further include an operation 406: a subset of notifications is determined based on the identified sources and/or interaction data indicating one or more instances of interactions between the user and one or more of the identified sources that initiated the subset of notifications. For example, a subset of notifications may be limited to notifications provided by a source corresponding to a messaging application. Further, in some implementations, a subset of notifications may be limited to notifications provided by sources corresponding to people with whom users frequently interact via messaging applications. The determination of who the user is often engaged with may be based on assistant interaction data that tracks how often the user uses the assistant application to contact the source, how recently the user contacted the source, other application data identifying the source, and/or any other information that may be used to determine how much the user will receive notifications from the source. In some implementations, determining the subset of notifications can be based on the identity of the identified source and independent of the content of the notifications.
The method 400 may further include an operation 408: notification data identifying a subset of the notifications is provided to a remote server device. The notification data may identify the source of the subset of notifications and/or any other data associated with the subset of notifications. For example, when the subset of notifications includes notifications related to messages from one or more sources, the notification data may include content from the message, other recipients of the message, subject lines in the message, time of receipt and/or transmission of the message, and/or any other data that may be associated with the message.
The method 400 may further include an operation 410: score data is received from the remote server device, the score data indicating (i) a score for each notification in the subset of notifications or (ii) a score for each of the one or more sources that originated the subset of notifications. The score data may represent the relevance of each notification to the user and/or the user's current context. For example, a first source of a first notification in the subset of notifications may correspond to a user's spouse, while a second source of a second notification in the subset of notifications may correspond to an acquaintance with whom the user rarely communicates. Thus, the score of the first source may be made higher than the second score based at least on the relationship of the first source and the second source to the user, as indicated by the data available to the remote server device. It should be noted that the client device may initially determine a subset of notifications from the received notifications, regardless of the content of the notifications (e.g., natural language message content). In other words, the client device may initially filter notifications based on sources and/or scores of sources to generate a subset of notifications. Meanwhile, the remote server device may determine the score data based on the content of the notification. In this way, computing resources may be saved at the client device while a greater amount of processing (e.g., processing of natural language content) may be left to the remote server device.
Further, the method 400 may include an operation 412: one or more notifications in the subset of notifications are caused to be provided to the user based on the score data. In some implementations, the form of the offer notification may also be identified based on the score data, or in other ways, in the offer data received from the remote server device. For example, since a first source (e.g., spouse) has been assigned a higher score than a second source (e.g., acquaintance), the first notification may be presented to the user differently than the second notification. For example, the first notification may be presented in audio form and in video form, while the second notification may be presented in video form. In this way, user distraction will be alleviated, as notifications will be filtered based only on the importance of the source of the notification to the user or relevance to the user. In addition, the remote server device may provide the provisioning data that also details the content of the notification to be presented to the user. For example, the remote server device may provide the provisioning data detailing text to be displayed for the user and/or audio to be spoken to the user to elicit a response from the user.
FIG. 5 illustrates a method 500 for dynamically modifying a score of a source of notifications to reduce distraction experienced by a user based at least on one or more activities in which the user is engaged. The method 500 may be performed by one or more computing devices and/or any other apparatus capable of processing notifications to be received by a person or machine. The method 500 may include an operation 502: one or more messages corresponding to a chat session between a user and one or more participants are received. Each of the one or more participants may conduct a chat session using a computing device that includes an messaging application. Further, each messaging application operated by the participant may communicate directly or indirectly with an automated assistant accessible to the user. In this way, the automated assistant can be aware of (privy) the communications that occur between the user and the participant.
The method 500 may further include an operation 504: during the chat session, determining that the user is involved in engaging the user in an activity other than the chat session. The activity may include one or more activities such as, for example, driving a vehicle. Alternatively, the activity may be: participate in audio or video calls, walk on stairs, swim, record audio or video, work outside the user's home, play games and/or any other activity requiring some cognition of the user. An activity (e.g., driving) may be identified, and interaction data associated with the activity may be used to determine the engagement that a user typically exhibits when involved in the activity. For example, if the user generally refuses to receive a video call during an activity, an automated assistant or other application may determine that the activity is at least partially visually affecting the user. Thus, any scoring of the source of notifications received during an activity may be based on the activity, and in particular on the manner in which the user is engaged in the activity.
The method 500 may include an operation 506: a notification is received indicating that one of the one or more participants has sent a message to be received by the user to facilitate the chat session when the user is involved in the activity. In other words, the chat session has continued until some time after the user initially involved in the activity. For example, when the activity is driving, a notification will be received when the user drives his vehicle.
The method 500 may include an operation 508: causing the remote server device to determine a score for the participant sending the message. The score may be generated by using at least interaction data that identifies instances of interactions between the participant and the user when the user is involved in an activity or at any other time the user interacts with the participant. Alternatively or in addition, the interaction data may indicate information relating the participant to an activity involved by the user. For example, the activity may be driving, and the participant may be identified in the interaction data as someone with whom the user has previously communicated while driving. Alternatively or in addition, the interaction data may indicate an amount of time since the user has communicated with the user. If the amount of time meets the communication threshold, a score may be increased or otherwise generated such that notifications from the participants are presented to the user during the activity. However, if the amount of time does not meet the communication threshold, the score may be reduced or otherwise generated such that notifications from the participants are presented in a partial format (e.g., only a portion of the corresponding messaging), or delayed until the user is no longer involved in the activity.
The method 500 may further include operation 510: the notification is caused to be presented to the user based on the score of the participant at least temporarily meeting the notification threshold. For example, the user's personal computing device may cause the user's vehicle computing device or control the user's vehicle computing device to present notifications via an audiovisual interface of the vehicle computing device. Alternatively, the personal computing device may present the notification to the user in full or partial format, depending on the notification threshold that the score has met.
