Definitions
- aspects of the example implementations relate to authorship identification of electronic content, and more specifically, original content provided with author identification information, and initial traffic associated with the original content being controlled by the author, and applied to associate the original content with the author.
- Authorship identity can be lost not only through electronic distribution, but may also be obscured. Many people have the same or similar names, making it difficult to ascertain the true source of published content. An author may accordingly be erroneously associated with publications originating with others as well has having his/her own work erroneously attributed to others.
- Example implementations, described herein relate to apparatus and methods for establishing and maintaining authorship identification information of electronic content such as content associated with the Web.
- An example method includes providing an original piece of content on a content source, inserting a unique content ID into content information associated with the original piece of content, associating the original piece of content with an author profile, following hyperlinks between the original piece of content and a second piece of content, detecting the following of the hyperlinks with a content aggregation system that communicates with the content source via a network including interconnected computer networks and a web index, applying a timestamp to the original piece of content, and sending the original piece of content to the web index.
- An example system includes a network including interconnected computer networks, one or more content sources, and a web index.
- An author profile database including author information is connected to the network.
- a first content source is operatively associated with the network and configured to publish first content and to insert a unique content ID and the author information into content information associated with the first content, the first content source being further configured to create traffic directed to the first content.
- a web server operatively associated with the first content source is provided for disseminating content via the network.
- a content aggregator is configured to detect traffic directed to the first content, to receive content via the network including the first content from the first content source, timestamp the first content, and aggregate content including the unique content ID.
- a web index is operatively associated with the content aggregator.
- a method comprising providing original content on a content source; inserting a unique content ID into content information associated with the original content; associating the original content with an author profile; detecting a following of the hyperlinks between the original content and a second content, via a content aggregation based on communication with the content source via a web index; applying a timestamp to the original content, and providing the original content having the timestamp to the web index.
- a system comprising a network including interconnected computer networks, one or more content sources, and a web index; an author profile database including author information communicatively coupled to the network; a first content source operatively associated with the network and configured to publish first content and to insert a unique content ID and the author information into content information associated with the first content, the first content source being further configured to create traffic directed to the first content; a web server operatively associated with the first content source for disseminating content via the network; a content aggregator configured to detect traffic directed to the first content, to receive content via the network including the first content from the first content source, timestamp the first content, and aggregate content including the unique content ID, and a web index operatively associated with the content aggregator.
- a non-transitory computer readable medium having executable instructions comprising providing original content on a content source; inserting a unique content ID into content information associated with the original content; associating the original content with an author profile; detecting a following of the hyperlinks between the original content and a second content, via a content aggregation based on communication with the content source via a web index; and applying a timestamp to the original content, and providing the original content having the timestamp to the web index.
- facilitating an action may include, but is not limited to, performing the action, making the action less burdensome, helping to carry the action out, or causing the action to be performed.
- instructions executing on one processor might facilitate an action carried out by instructions executing on a remote processor, by sending appropriate data or commands to cause or aid the action to be performed.

- the website statistics technology discussed above may be employed by many website owners operating in environments 100 .
- the technology allows basic website record-keeping as well as customized record-keeping relating to any web page or web application that can execute JavaScript through use of a code.
- Users of the website statistics technology have an ID code which they can optionally insert into HTML on their website which will reference back so that the website statistics technology can collect information relating to the website.
- An administrator is required to insert the ID code.
- Such a code could also be used in a manner that proves that a certain person or entity created certain content or otherwise controls the content. This information is correlated with the first time the new content appears in an index.
- a block of new text when a block of new text is first detected, it could be hashed and then stored with the author's profile (e.g., a profile stored in a social media account). This would allow its identification any time it has been copied in the future.
- Content ID could foreseeably be embedded into the social media account or other post with indication of AUTHOR ID as part of it (e.g., CONTENT 12345 from AUTHOR 1234). The author is known separately from the content.
- the website statistics system provides real time updates.
- the web crawler takes time, sometimes days or weeks, to go through the web and identify new content.
- a web page may be associated with a unique content ID as discussed above, it does not necessarily follow that the content on the page belongs to the ID.
- the identity of who first posted the content and when the content was first posted is obtained and stays with the content regardless of how many times it is published and republished.
- a name or icon from an author's profile account may, for example, be caused to appear in association with content when search results are displayed.
- a blogger or a user having a website and operating within the environment 100 may have a unique content ID, referred to as an account ID for the website statistics provider, if the user is employing the website statistics technology and possibly measuring traffic for the site.
- an author has created content 105 including Draft A 512 .
- Draft A For CMS (content management system) systems, a draft to publish model may exist, but this depends on the publishing site.
- the social media account may provide logging.
- the content page Draft A has referrer links and outbound links. When those links are followed, the website statistics technology collects records of such activity.
- the links in this example implementation are hyperlinks.
- the author then makes a second draft, shown as Draft B 514 in FIG. 5A , having a link going back to Draft A. The second draft will have no records of traffic on or leaving that page.
- the author creates an inbound link from an unpublished draft page (Draft A), visible only to the author to content B and back out to the same unpublished draft page.
- the author follows the link using ordinary hyperlinks.
- the website statistics technology captures this activity and timestamps it. This proves that the content was created by the author.
- the date stamped content goes to a clustering engine and then a web index. Here the content itself is marked and sorted in a variety of ways that will make it identifiable.
- the web index server is responsive to queries received via web servers and causes stored documents to be retrieved from document servers (not shown).
- FIG. 5B diagrammatically illustrates the mechanisms involved in associating an author with content through the use of an electronically stored profile.
- the profile 522 can be, for example, a social media account and/or other electronic profile(s) created by or on behalf of the author.
- Content 105 is the same in both FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B .
- the unique ID code is embedded at the content source prior to detection by the website statistics technology and the unique ID is the account ID for the website statistics account in this example.
- the author optionally selects which information from his profile should be included in the content as metadata.
- the content 105 can be, for example, a blog hosted on “WordPress dot com” wherein space_dot_space is used rather than “.” to avoid inclusion of browser-executable code. Both the profile and content are associated with the Web 590 .
- the author who is the only person having access to the link, follows the link, which results in a communication designated by arrow 526 to Website Statistics Visits 528 .
- Unique ID codes 530 are assigned to users of website statistics and are stored electronically in computer readable code. The ID codes may be a user's account number or other identifier.
- the Referrer and Traffic Clustering Engine 518 is a distinct module that is part of the verification system. It groups together all instances of the same piece of content which allows for the referring chain to be constructed, allowing the identities of the original poster of the content and the person who just copied it to be ascertained.
- the web crawler 130 follows all links and discovers new parts of the web as discussed in detail above.
- the web crawler feeds that information into the web index 532 , which stores web pages.
- the web index is sorted based on keywords, facilitating access to documents that contain user query terms.
- the web index is accordingly created in part through operation of the crawler.
- Arrow 538 indicates that the crawler will eventually locate the content 105 and provide it to the web index, but this takes time as a page may or may not be revisited very frequently.
- index servers identify which pages contain words that match query terms selected by a user. Search results are generated and displayed to the user. In the event the search results include content 105 that has been processed as described above with reference to FIGS. 5A and 5B , the author's name, an icon representing the author, and/or a link to the author's profile will appear on the display in association with the content. The correct and original author will accordingly be identified whether the retrieved content is original or republished.
- FIGS. 7A AND 7B show a sequence of operations that may be followed in accordance with an example implementation.
- the first operation 702 is for a webmaster, blogger or other person or entity with access to the Internet to establish a bidirectional verified link to a content aggregation system.
- a web server that provides content in the form of web pages to the content aggregation system may be employed. Once such a link is established, protection of subsequently created content is facilitated.
- Access to the content aggregation system is may be optionally restricted to authorized persons or entities. Unauthorized persons and entities accordingly should not be able to readily gain access to the content sent to the content aggregation system until it is processed later by the web index 532 . Communications received from the content aggregation system are likewise restricted.
- the content provided to the content aggregation system includes a unique ID that remains with the content as it is published and republished.
- Draft A which may include text and/or pictorial subject matter and/or video, is created and provided with the unique ID as metadata. Draft A is further linked through the Web to the author's profile, which is also included in whole or part in Draft A. Draft B is created and optionally “hidden” links unobservable to third parties are established between Draft A and Draft B. The author follows the links (conventional hyperlinks) between Drafts A and B, at operation 708 . The content aggregation system is linked to Draft A and configured to detect traffic associated with Draft A, at operation 710 . The presence of the unique ID facilitates such detection.
- the content aggregation system detects such traffic and applies a timestamp as at operation 712 . Because Drafts A and B were not previously accessible to third parties, the earliest timestamp relating to Draft A is due to traffic created by the author rather than such third parties.
- Draft A Once Draft A is published on the author's website or blog, as at operation 706 , it becomes accessible to the web crawler, at operation 718 , as well as to third parties who access the site. Draft A may then be republished in whole or part.
- the unique ID in the metadata allows the author to measure a status of Draft A through the operation of the content aggregation system. Because author identification information also stays with Draft A, persons accessing Draft A are able to determine the correct author whether it is obtained from the original content source or republished by another content source.
- the author's name or an icon will appear on a search report obtained from a user query. For example, author identification information may be pulled from a directory or repository maintained by the social media account provider. The name or icon can be linked to the author's profile on the Web.
- Creating an original piece of content is one non-limiting specific example of providing an original piece of content.
- Other forms of content creation may substituted therefor, or used in parallel therewith, consistent with the example implementations described herein.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example computer system 600 in which certain parts of the system 100 may be implemented using computer-readable code.
- the components or modules of system 100 may be implemented in one or more computer systems 600 using hardware, software, firmware, tangible computer readable media having instructions stored thereon in a non-transitory manner, or a combination thereof.
