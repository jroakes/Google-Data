Definitions
- the disclosed implementations relate generally to systems, methods and devices configured to monitor information about media exposure and provide related content.
- advertising can be inefficient. But it is difficult for advertisers to specifically target the interests of particular users because advertisers have thus far not been able to collect detailed information about particular users with respect to how those users access and consume media. For example, it is difficult for an advertiser to determine if a particular consumer is currently looking to purchase a particular good (e.g. a car) or service (e.g. dine at a restaurant), and send that consumer relevant information or advertisements at a time when that particular user may be most receptive to the information or advertisement.
- a particular good e.g. a car
- service e.g. dine at a restaurant
- the systems, methods and devices described herein enable advertisers and/or media measurement companies to determine when a particular user is exposed to or consumes various forms of media, and in turn, determine when that user is likely to most receptive to receiving related content.
- a typical person is exposed to media and advertising throughout the day. For example, during a typical workday, a person may watch the morning news on television during breakfast, listen to the radio while driving to work, browse various websites while at work, and watch primetime television or streaming videos over the internet after work. On a weekend, that same person may alter their media exposure and consumption patterns. For example, that person may not, for example, access a website that is routinely accessed during the workday for work purposes, and instead access different websites based on personal interests, hobbies and/or for online shopping.
- aspects of the present disclosure describe implementations that are configured to monitor media exposure and consumption of particular individuals using, for example, client device such as a smart phone, a tablet computer, or the like utilized primarily by one respective user.
- client device such as a smart phone, a tablet computer, or the like utilized primarily by one respective user.
- related content is then provided to a particular user when that user is more likely to be responsive to the related content based on media exposure and consumption patterns derived from usage patterns of the respective client device.

- the media monitoring server 130 includes a front end server 134 that facilitates communication between the media monitoring server 130 and the communication network 104 .
- the front end server 134 receives content information 164 from the one or more client devices 120 .
- the content information 164 is a video stream, a portion thereof, and/or a reference to a portion thereof.
- a reference to a portion of a video stream may include a time indicator and/or a digital marker referencing the content of the video stream.
- the content information 164 is derived from a video stream being presented (i.e. playing) by the combination of the TV 110 and the client 102 .
- the front end server 134 is configured to send a set of instructions to the one or more client devices 120 .
- the front end server 134 is configured to send content files and/or links to content files.
- the term “content file” includes any document or content of any format including, but not limited to, a video file, an image file, a music file, a web page, an email message, an SMS message, a content feed, an advertisement, a coupon, a playlist, an XML document and/or location information.
- the front end server 134 is configured to send or receive one or more video streams.
- the front end server 134 is configured to receive content directly from the broadcast system 140 and/or the content provider 150 over the communication network 104 .
- a video or video stream is a sequence of images or frames representing scenes in motion.
- a video can be distinguished from an image.
- a video displays a number of images or frames per second. For example, a video displays 20 to 60 consecutive image frames per second. In more common implementations, video is defined using 24 or 25 frames per second.
- an image is not necessarily associated with any other images.
- a content feed is a resource or service that provides a list of content items that are present, recently added, or recently updated at a feed source.
- a content item in a content feed may include the content associated with the item itself (the actual content that the content item specifies), a title (sometimes called a headline), and/or a description of the content, a network location or locator (e.g., URL) of the content, or any combination thereof.
- the content item may include the article itself inline, along with the title (or headline), and locator.
- a content item may include the title, description and locator, but not the article content.
- some content items may include the content associated with those items, while others contain links to the associated content but not the full content of the items.
- a content item may also include additional meta data that provides additional information about the content.
- the meta data may include a time-stamp or embedded selectable website links.
- the full version of the content may be any machine-readable data, including but not limited to web pages, images, digital audio, digital video, Portable Document Format (PDF) documents, and so forth.
- PDF Portable Document Format
- a content feed is specified using a content syndication format, such as RSS.
- RSS is an acronym that stands for “rich site summary,” “RDF site summary,” or “Really Simple Syndication.” “RSS” may refer to any of a family of formats based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) for specifying a content feed and content items included in the feed.
- XML Extensible Markup Language
- other content syndication formats such as the Atom syndication format or the VCALENDAR calendar format, may be used to specify content feeds.
- the media monitoring server 130 is configured to receive content information 164 in the form of one or more media exposure reports from each client device 120 , which possibly includes information that enables the media monitoring server 130 to determine the location of the client device when each of the one or more media exposure reports was generated. Upon receiving the content information, the media monitoring server 130 matches the content information to a content fingerprint in the fingerprint database 132 . The media monitoring server 130 also determines the location of the client device 120 when the content information was generated, and in some cases also determines the type of location. For example, in some implementations, the media monitoring server 130 determines whether the content information received from the client device 120 was created in a residential location, in a retail location, a business location, etc.
- the media monitoring server 130 based on the matched fingerprint and location information, identifies patterns associated with the usage of one ore more client devices 120 and exposure to the various forms and content of media sources as user exposed to. In turn, the media monitoring server 130 retrieves correlated content that can be push to the one or more client devices 120 at various times. In some implementations, the content is chosen based on speculation as to when and what a user will be particularly receptive to based on the indentified patterns.
- a smart phone is used to determine which radio station (or radio stations) a user listens to while driving to work. Advertisements delivered to the smart phone would likely be ignored while the user is driving. As such, based on the patterns of usage, related advertisements are pushed to the smart phone when the smart phone is believed to be stationary for extended periods, which may correspond to times when the user has time to consider the advertisements. Moreover, the type of advertisements delivered may be adjusted based on viewing habits during the day. For example, based on the browsing history of a particular user, a user may be more receptive to advertisements for new sports apparel during a mid-day break when the user is exercising or taking a break.

Abstract
Based on the type of media consumed and when it is accessed, it is possible to identify times during which a particular user will likely be more receptive to particular types of related content. Aspects of the present disclosure, describe implementations that are configured to monitor media exposure and consumption of particular individuals using, for example, client device such as a smart phone, a tablet computer, or the like utilized primarily by one respective user. In some implementations, related content is then provided to a particular user when that user is more likely to be responsive to the related content based on media exposure and consumption patterns derived from usage patterns of the respective client device
Description
- The disclosed implementations relate generally to systems, methods and devices configured to monitor information about media exposure and provide related content.
- People are regularly exposed to advertising throughout the day through various forms of media, including print, television, radio and the Internet. However, advertising tends to be broadcast to a wide audience, rather than individually tailored to what a particular user may be currently responsive to. For example, a billboard or poster in a subway station will be viewed by a diverse urban audience, but may only advertise a product or service that a small portion of the audience may be interested in. As a result, the billboard or poster will be ignored by most of the people that see it. The same may be true for magazine advertisements, radio spots and television commercials.
- In order words, advertising can be inefficient. But it is difficult for advertisers to specifically target the interests of particular users because advertisers have thus far not been able to collect detailed information about particular users with respect to how those users access and consume media. For example, it is difficult for an advertiser to determine if a particular consumer is currently looking to purchase a particular good (e.g. a car) or service (e.g. dine at a restaurant), and send that consumer relevant information or advertisements at a time when that particular user may be most receptive to the information or advertisement.
- The aforementioned deficiencies and other problems are reduced or eliminated by the disclosed systems, methods and devices. Various implementations of systems, methods and devices within the scope of the claims each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for the desirable attributes described herein. Without limiting the scope of the claims, some prominent features of example implementations are described herein. After considering this description one will understand how the features of various implementations are configured to enable various systems, methods and devices to monitor information about how and when a particular user is exposed to various forms of media, and provide related content at times that the user may be more responsive to the related content.
- More specifically, in some implementations, the systems, methods and devices described herein enable advertisers and/or media measurement companies to determine when a particular user is exposed to or consumes various forms of media, and in turn, determine when that user is likely to most receptive to receiving related content. A typical person is exposed to media and advertising throughout the day. For example, during a typical workday, a person may watch the morning news on television during breakfast, listen to the radio while driving to work, browse various websites while at work, and watch primetime television or streaming videos over the internet after work. On a weekend, that same person may alter their media exposure and consumption patterns. For example, that person may not, for example, access a website that is routinely accessed during the workday for work purposes, and instead access different websites based on personal interests, hobbies and/or for online shopping.
- Based on the type of media consumed and when it is accessed, it is possible to identify times during which a particular user will likely be more receptive to particular types of related content. Aspects of the present disclosure, describe implementations that are configured to monitor media exposure and consumption of particular individuals using, for example, client device such as a smart phone, a tablet computer, or the like utilized primarily by one respective user. In some implementations, related content is then provided to a particular user when that user is more likely to be responsive to the related content based on media exposure and consumption patterns derived from usage patterns of the respective client device.
- So that the manner in which features of the present disclosure can be understood in detail, a more particular description, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to aspects, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings. It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate only certain typical aspects of this disclosure and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for the description may admit to other effective aspects.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a simplified example client-server environment 100 according to some implementations. While certain specific features are illustrated, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that various other features have not been illustrated for the sake of brevity and so as not to obscure more pertinent aspects of the implementations disclosed herein. To that end, the client-server environment 100 includes aclient device 102, a television (TV) 110, one ormore client devices 120, acommunication network 104, amedia monitoring server 130, abroadcast system 140, acontent provider 150, aradio broadcaster 180 and aradio 170. Theclient device 102, the one ormore client devices 120, themedia monitoring server 130, thebroadcast system 140, thecontent provider 150, theradio broadcaster 180 and theradio 170 are capable of being connected to thecommunication network 104 in order to exchange information with one another and/or other devices and systems. - In some implementations, the
media monitoring server 130 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. Solely for convenience of explanation, themedia monitoring server 130 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Similarly, in some implementations, thebroadcast system 140 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. Solely, for convenience of explanation, thebroadcast system 140 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Similarly, in some implementations, thecontent provider 150 is implemented as a single server system, while in other implementations it is implemented as a distributed system of multiple servers. Solely, for convenience of explanation, thecontent provider 150 is described below as being implemented on a single server system. Moreover, the functionality of thebroadcast system 140 and thecontent provider 150 can be combined into a single server system. Additionally and/or alternatively, while only one broadcast system and only one content provider is illustrated inFIG. 1 for the sake of brevity, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that fewer or more of each may be present in an implementation of a client-server environment. - The
communication network 104 may be any combination of wired and wireless local area network (LAN) and/or wide area network (WAN), such as an intranet, an extranet, including a portion of the Internet. It is sufficient that thecommunication network 104 provides communication capability between the one ormore client devices 120 and themedia monitoring server 130. In some implementations, thecommunication network 104 uses the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) to transport information using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). HTTP permitsclient devices communication network 104. However, the various implementations described herein are not limited to the use of any particular protocol. - In some implementations, the
media monitoring server 130 includes afront end server 134 that facilitates communication between themedia monitoring server 130 and thecommunication network 104. Thefront end server 134 receivescontent information 164 from the one ormore client devices 120. As described in greater detail below with reference toFIGS. 3A-4B , in some implementations, thecontent information 164 is a video stream, a portion thereof, and/or a reference to a portion thereof. A reference to a portion of a video stream may include a time indicator and/or a digital marker referencing the content of the video stream. In some implementations, thecontent information 164 is derived from a video stream being presented (i.e. playing) by the combination of theTV 110 and theclient 102. - In some implementations, the
front end server 134 is configured to send a set of instructions to the one ormore client devices 120. In some implementations, thefront end server 134 is configured to send content files and/or links to content files. The term “content file” includes any document or content of any format including, but not limited to, a video file, an image file, a music file, a web page, an email message, an SMS message, a content feed, an advertisement, a coupon, a playlist, an XML document and/or location information. In some implementations, thefront end server 134 is configured to send or receive one or more video streams. In some implementations, thefront end server 134 is configured to receive content directly from thebroadcast system 140 and/or thecontent provider 150 over thecommunication network 104. - According to some implementations, a video or video stream is a sequence of images or frames representing scenes in motion. A video can be distinguished from an image. A video displays a number of images or frames per second. For example, a video displays 20 to 60 consecutive image frames per second. In more common implementations, video is defined using 24 or 25 frames per second. By contrast, an image is not necessarily associated with any other images.
- A content feed (or channel) is a resource or service that provides a list of content items that are present, recently added, or recently updated at a feed source. A content item in a content feed may include the content associated with the item itself (the actual content that the content item specifies), a title (sometimes called a headline), and/or a description of the content, a network location or locator (e.g., URL) of the content, or any combination thereof. For example, if the content item identifies a text article, the content item may include the article itself inline, along with the title (or headline), and locator. Alternatively, a content item may include the title, description and locator, but not the article content. Thus, some content items may include the content associated with those items, while others contain links to the associated content but not the full content of the items. A content item may also include additional meta data that provides additional information about the content. For example, the meta data may include a time-stamp or embedded selectable website links. The full version of the content may be any machine-readable data, including but not limited to web pages, images, digital audio, digital video, Portable Document Format (PDF) documents, and so forth.
- In some implementations, a content feed is specified using a content syndication format, such as RSS. RSS is an acronym that stands for “rich site summary,” “RDF site summary,” or “Really Simple Syndication.” “RSS” may refer to any of a family of formats based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) for specifying a content feed and content items included in the feed. In some other implementations, other content syndication formats, such as the Atom syndication format or the VCALENDAR calendar format, may be used to specify content feeds.
- In some implementations, the
media monitoring server 130 is configured to receivecontent information 164 in the form of one or more media exposure reports from eachclient device 120, which possibly includes information that enables themedia monitoring server 130 to determine the location of the client device when each of the one or more media exposure reports was generated. Upon receiving the content information, themedia monitoring server 130 matches the content information to a content fingerprint in thefingerprint database 132. Themedia monitoring server 130 also determines the location of theclient device 120 when the content information was generated, and in some cases also determines the type of location. For example, in some implementations, themedia monitoring server 130 determines whether the content information received from theclient device 120 was created in a residential location, in a retail location, a business location, etc. - The
media monitoring server 130, based on the matched fingerprint and location information, identifies patterns associated with the usage of one oremore client devices 120 and exposure to the various forms and content of media sources as user exposed to. In turn, themedia monitoring server 130 retrieves correlated content that can be push to the one ormore client devices 120 at various times. In some implementations, the content is chosen based on speculation as to when and what a user will be particularly receptive to based on the indentified patterns. - For example, in one implementation, a smart phone is used to determine which radio station (or radio stations) a user listens to while driving to work. Advertisements delivered to the smart phone would likely be ignored while the user is driving. As such, based on the patterns of usage, related advertisements are pushed to the smart phone when the smart phone is believed to be stationary for extended periods, which may correspond to times when the user has time to consider the advertisements. Moreover, the type of advertisements delivered may be adjusted based on viewing habits during the day. For example, based on the browsing history of a particular user, a user may be more receptive to advertisements for new sports apparel during a mid-day break when the user is exercising or taking a break.
- To that end, as described in greater detail below, in some implementations the
media monitoring server 130 includes a contentinformation extraction module 131 that is configured to to identify (i.e. fingerprint) the playing media content and provide information about the playing media content. In some implementations, the contentinformation extraction module 131 is a distributed network of elements. - In some implementations, the
media monitoring server 130 includes auser database 137 that stores user data. In some implementations, theuser database 137 is a distributed database. In some implementations, themedia monitoring server 130 includes acontent database 136. In some implementations, thecontent database 136 includes advertisements, videos, images, music, web pages, email messages, SMS messages, content feeds, advertisements, coupons, playlists, XML documents, and ratings associated with various media content or any combination thereof. In some implementations, thecontent database 136 includes links to advertisements, videos, images, music, web pages, email messages, SMS messages, content feeds, advertisements, coupons, playlists, XML documents and ratings associated with various media content. In some implementations, thecontent database 136 is a distributed database. - As noted above, in some implementations, the
media monitoring server 130 includes afingerprint database 132 that stores content fingerprints. A content fingerprint includes any type of condensed or compact representation, or signature, of the content of a video stream and/or audio stream. In some implementations, a fingerprint may represent a clip (such as several seconds, minutes, or hours) of a video stream or audio stream. Or, a fingerprint may represent a single instant of a video stream or audio stream (e.g., a fingerprint of single frame of a video or of the audio associated with that frame of video). Furthermore, since video content may changes over time, corresponding fingerprints of that video content may also change over time. In some implementations, thefingerprint database 132 is a distributed database. - In some implementations, the
rating server system 130 includes abroadcast monitor module 135 that is configured to create fingerprints of media content broadcast by thebroadcast system 140 and/or thecontent provider 150. - In some implementations, the
client device 102 is provided in combination with a display device such as aTV 110. Theclient device 102 is configured to receive avideo stream 161 from thebroadcast system 140 and pass the video stream to theTV 110 for display. While a TV has been used in the illustrated example, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that any number of displays devices, including computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, smart-phones and the like, can be used to display a video stream. Additionally and/or alternatively, the functions of theclient 102 and theTV 110 may be combined into a single device. - In some implementations, the
client device 102 is any suitable computer device capable of connecting to thecommunication network 104, receiving video streams, extracting information from video streams and presenting video streams for the display using the TV 110 (or another display device). In some implementations, theclient device 102 is a set top box that includes components to receive and present video streams. For example, theclient device 102 can be a set top box for receiving cable TV and/or satellite TV, a digital video recorder (DVR), a digital media receiver, a TV tuner, a computer, and/or any other device that outputs TV signals. In some implementations, theclient device 102 displays a video stream on theTV 110. In some implementations theTV 110 can be a conventional TV display that is not connectable to the Internet and that displays digital and/or analog TV content received via over the air broadcasts or a satellite or cable connection. - As is typical of televisions, the
TV 110 includes adisplay 118 andspeakers 119. Additionally and/or alternatively, theTV 110 can be replaced with another type of display device 108 for presenting video content to a user. For example, the display device may be a computer monitor that is configured to receive and display audio and video signals or other digital content from theclient 102. In some implementations, the display device is an electronic device with a central processing unit, memory and a display that is configured to receive and display audio and video signals or other digital content form theclient 102. For example, the display device can be a LCD screen, a tablet device, a mobile telephone, a projector, or other type of video display system. The display device can be coupled to theclient 102 via a wireless or wired connection. - In some implementations, the
client device 102 receives video streams 161 via aTV signal 162. As used herein, a TV signal is an electrical, optical, or other type of data transmitting medium that includes audio and/or video components corresponding to a TV channel. In some implementations, theTV signal 162 is a terrestrial over-the-air TV broadcast signal or a sign distributed/broadcast on a cable-system or a satellite system. In some implementations, theTV signal 162 is transmitted as data over a network connection. For example, theclient device 102 can receive video streams from an Internet connection. Audio and video components of a TV signal are sometimes referred to herein as audio signals and video signals. In some implementations, a TV signal corresponds to a TV channel that is being displayed on theTV 110. - In some implementations, a
TV signal 162 carries information for audible sound corresponding to an audio track on a TV channel. In some implementations, the audible sound is produced by thespeakers 119 included with theTV 110. - In some implementations, the
radio broadcaster 180 provides radio transmissions. In various implementations the radio transmissions may include for example, satellite radio transmissions, internet radio transmissions, AM radio transmissions and/or FM radio transmissions. Theradio 170 is configured to receive the radio transmissions and provide a corresponding audio output as would be known to those skilled in the art. To that end, theradio 170 includesspeakers 179 configured to provide the audio output from theradio 170. - Each
client device 120 may be any suitable computer device that is capable of connecting to thecommunication network 104, such as a computer, a laptop computer, a tablet device, a netbook, an internet kiosk, a personal digital assistant, a mobile phone, a smart phone, a gaming device, or any other device that is capable of communicating with themedia monitoring server 130. In some implementations, eachclient device 120 includes one ormore processors 121,non-volatile memory 122 such as a hard disk drive, adisplay 128,speakers 129, and amicrophone 123. Eachclient device 120 may also have input devices such as a keyboard, a mouse and/or track-pad (not shown). In some implementations, theclient device 120 includes a touch screen display, a digital camera and/or any number of supplemental devices to add functionality. - In some implementations, each
client device 120 is connected to and/or includes adisplay device 128. Thedisplay device 128 can be any display for presenting video content to a user. In some implementations, thedisplay device 128 is the display of a television, or a computer monitor, that is configured to receive and display audio and video signals or other digital content from theclient device 120. In some implementations, thedisplay device 128 is an electronic device with acentral processing unit 121,memory 122 and a display that is configured to receive and display audio and video signals or other digital content. In some implementations, thedisplay device 128 is a LCD screen, a tablet device, a mobile telephone, a projector, or any other type of video display system. In some implementations, theclient device 120 is connected to and/or integrated with thedisplay device 128. In some implementations, thedisplay device 128 includes, or is otherwise connected to, speakers capable of producing an audible stream corresponding to the audio component of a TV signal or video stream. - In some implementations, each
client device 120 is connectable to theclient device 102 via a wireless or wired connection 103. In some implementations where such connection exists, theclient device 120 may optionally operate in accordance with instructions, information and/or digital content provided by theclient device 102. In some implementations, theclient device 102 issues instructions to theclient device 120 that cause theclient device 120 to present on thedisplay 128 and/or thespeaker 129 digital content that is complementary, or related to, digital content that is being presented by theclient 102 on theTV 110. - In some implementations, the
client device 120 includes amicrophone 123 that enables the client device to receive sound (audio content) from, for example, thespeakers 119 of theTV 110 or thespeakers 179 of theradio 170. Themicrophone 123 enables theclient device 120 to store the audio content/soundtrack that is associated with the video content as it is presented. Theclient device 120 can store this information locally and then send to themedia monitoring server 130content information 164 that is any one or more of: fingerprints of the stored audio content, the audio content itself, portions/snippets of the audio content, fingerprints of the portions of the audio content or references to the playing content. - In this way, the
media monitoring server 130 can identify the content playing on the television or radio even if the electronic device on which the content is being presented is not an Internet-enabled device, such as an older TV set; is not connected to the Internet (temporarily or permanently) so is unable to send thecontent information 164; or does not have the capability to record or fingerprint media information related to the video content. Such an arrangement (i.e., where theclient device 120 stores and sends thecontent information 164 to the media monitoring server 130) allows a user to receive from themedia monitoring server 130 content triggered in response to thecontent information 164 no matter where the user is watching TV or listening to on the radio. - In some implementations, the
client device 120 includes acamera 124 that enables the client device to record images or video from, for example, thedisplay 118 of theTV 110 or a computer display, or from printed media, including newspapers, books, magazines, posters and billboards. Thecamera 124 enables theclient device 120 to store images or video associated with various media sources that a user encounters through the day. Theclient device 120 can store this information locally and then send it to themedia monitoring server 130 at preset times, periodically or as it is acquired, based on the preferences of a user or network operator. - In some implementations, the
client device 120 includes a radio frequency (RF)frontend 125. The RF frontend 125 includes anantenna 125 a, which allows theclient device 120 to wirelessly access a communication network, such as a WiFi network or cellular network. - In some implementations, the
client device 120 includes one ormore applications 122 b and/or sets ofinstructions 122 b stored in thememory 122. As discussed in greater detail below, theprocessor 121 executes the one or more applications in accordance with a set of instructions received from themedia monitoring server 130. -
FIG. 2A is a block diagram of a client-server environment 201 according to some implementations. The client-server environment 201 illustrated inFIG. 2A is similar to and adapted from the client-server environment 100 illustrated inFIG. 1 . Elements common to both share common reference indicia, and only the differences between the client-server environments - As a non-limiting example, within the client-
server environment 201, theclient 102, theTV 110 andclient device 120 are present together in a firstresidential location 201 during one portion of the day, and theradio 170 and client device are present together in avehicle 205 during another portion of the day. In operation, theclient device 102 receives a TV signal or some other type of streaming video signal or audio signal. Theclient device 102 then communicates at least a portion of the received signal to theTV 110 for display to theuser 221. As described above, theclient device 120 is configured to detect the media content playing on theTV 110 and report content associated with the media content playing on theTV 110 to themedia monitoring server 130. Similarly, in thevehicle 205, theclient device 120 is configured to detect the media content playing on theradio 170 and report content associated with the media content playing on theradio 170 to themedia monitoring server 130. Moreover, while a residential location and a vehicle have been used in this particular example, those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that client devices and the like can be located in any type of location, including commercial, residential, public and transportation locations. More specific details pertaining to how media exposure measurements are recorded and processed are described below with reference to the remaining drawings and continued reference toFIGS. 1 , 2A and 2B. -
FIG. 2B is a block diagram of a client-server environment 202 according to some implementations. The client-server environment 202 illustrated inFIG. 2B is similar to and adapted from the client-server environment 201 illustrated inFIG. 2A . Elements common to both share common reference indicia, and only the differences between the client-server environments - As a non-limiting example, within the client-
server environment 202, theclient device 120 is included in a firstresidential location 201, as described above. In operation, theclient device 102 uploads media exposure measurements to themedia monitoring server 130. In turn, themedia monitoring server 130 operates to identify access and exposure patterns associated with the use of theclient device 102 based on the media exposure measurements provided by theclient device 102. Themedia monitoring server 130 links the patterns to demographic information associated withuser 221, and identifies other users and/or residences with similar and/or overlapping demographic information. For example, users with similar and/or overlapping demographic information may reside atresidential locations media monitoring server 130, having identifiedresidential locations user 221, pushes correlated content at various times based on the identified patterns based on media exposure measurements provided byclient device 120. In other words, theclient device 120 serves as a proxy for theuser 221 and theuser 221 servers as a representative member of a group of users with similar and/or overlapping demographic information. For example, if based on the media exposure measurements, it is determined that a particular user regularly searches for restaurants during particular days of the week before what is customarily dinner time, advertisements or coupons for local restaurants may be pushed to the client devices of all users that share similar and/or overlapping demographic information withuser 221. -
FIG. 3A is a block diagram of a configuration of themedia monitoring server 130 according to some implementations. In some implementations, themedia monitoring server 130 includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 302, one or more network or other communications interfaces 308,memory 306, and one ormore communication buses 304 for interconnecting these and various other components. Thecommunication buses 304 optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications between system components.Memory 306 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices.Memory 306 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU(s) 302.Memory 306, including the non-volatile and volatile memory device(s) withinmemory 306, comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. In some implementations,memory 306 or the non-transitory computer readable storage medium ofmemory 306 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or a subset thereof including anoperation system 316, anetwork communication module 318, a contentinformation extract module 131, acontent database 136, afingerprint database 132, auser database 137, andapplications 138. - The
operating system 316 includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks. - The
network communication module 318 facilitates communication with other devices via the one or more communication network interfaces 308 (wired or wireless) and one or more communication networks, such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on. With further reference toFIG. 1 , thenetwork communication module 318 may be incorporated into thefront end server 134. - The
content database 136 includes content files 328 and/or links to content files 230. In some implementations, thecontent database 136 stores advertisements, videos, images, music, web pages, email messages, SMS messages, a content feeds, advertisements, coupons, playlists, XML documents and any combination thereof. In some implementations, the content database 1376 includes links to advertisements, videos, images, music, web pages, email messages, SMS messages, content feeds, advertisements, coupons, playlists, XML documents and any combination thereof. Content files 328 are discussed in more detail in the discussion ofFIG. 3B . - The
user database 137 includesuser data 340 for one or more users. In some implementations, the user data for a respective user 340-1 includes auser identifier 342 and demographic information 344. Theuser identifier 342 identifies a user. For example, theuser identifier 342 can be an IP address associated with aclient device 102 or an alphanumeric value chosen by the user or assigned by the server that uniquely identifies the user. The demographic information 244 includes the characteristics of the respective user. The demographic information may include may be one or more of the group consisting of age, gender, income, geographic location, education, wealth, religion, race, ethic group, marital status, household size, employment status, and political party affiliation. - The
fingerprint database 132 stores one or morecontent fingerprints 332. Afingerprint 332 includes aname 334,fingerprint audio information 336 and/orfingerprint video information 338, and a list of associated files 339. Thename 334 identifies therespective content fingerprint 332. For example, thename 334 could include the name of an associated television program, movie, or advertisement. In some implementations, thefingerprint audio information 336 includes a fingerprint or other compressed representation of a clip (such as several seconds, minutes, or hours) of the audio content of a video stream or an audio stream. In some implementations, thefingerprint video information 338 includes a fingerprint of a clip (such as several seconds, minutes, or hours) of a video stream.Fingerprints 332 in thefingerprint database 132 are periodically updated. - The content
information extraction module 131 receivescontent information 164 from theclient device 120, generates a set ofinstructions 132 and sends a set ofinstructions 132 to theclient device 120. Additionally and/or alternatively, themedia monitoring server 130 can receivecontent information 164 from theclient device 102. The contentinformation extraction module 131 includes aninstruction generation module 320, afingerprint matching module 322, acontent correlation engine 323, and an optical character recognition (OCR) andcode recognition module 327. In some implementations, the contentinformation extraction module 131 also includes afingerprint generation module 321, which generates fingerprints from thecontent information 164 or other media content saved by theserver 130. - In some implementations, the
content correlation engine 323 content correlated with information extracted from media exposure measurements. In some implementations, the OCR andcode recognition module 327 is configured to apply an optical character recognition technique to the image of the receipt to determine what was purchased and create a corresponding record that can be used to identify correlated content, goods/and/or services. In some implementations, the OCR andcode recognition module 327 is also configured identify barcodes, quick response (QR) codes, logos or covers so that themedia monitoring server 130 can be used to identify magazines, books, catalogues or the like. - The
fingerprint matching module 322 matches at least a portion of the content information 164 (or a fingerprint of thecontent information 164 generated by the fingerprint generation module) to afingerprint 332 in thefingerprint database 132. The matchedfingerprint 342 is sent to theinstruction generation module 320.

Theuser identifier 329 identifiers a user associated with at least one of theclient device 102 and theclient device 120 120. For example, theuser identifier 329 can be an IP address associated with a client device 102 (or 120) or an alphanumeric value chosen by the user or assigned by the server that uniquely identifies the user. In some implementations, theadvertisements 324 include advertisements related to goods and/or services associated with the media content the user is exposed to, based on the media exposure measurements. In some implementations, thecoupons 326 include discounts related to goods and/or services associated with the media content the user is exposed to, based on the media exposure measurements. - The
instruction generation module 320 generates a set ofinstructions 332 based on the matchedfingerprint 342. In some implementations, theinstruction generation module 320 generates the set ofinstructions 332 based on information associated with the matchedfingerprint 342 and theuser data 340 corresponding to theuser identifier 329.

In some implementations, theinstruction generation module 320 determines one ormore content files 328 based on the matchedfingerprint 342 and sends thedetermined content files 328 to theclient device 120. - In some implementations, the set of
instructions 332 includes instructions to execute and/or display one or more applications on theclient device 120. For example, when executed by theclient device 120, the set ofinstructions 332 may cause theclient device 120 to display an application that was minimized or running as a background process, or the set ofinstructions 132 may cause theclient device 120 to execute the application. In some implementations, the set ofinstructions 332 include instructions that cause theclient device 120 to download one ormore content files 328 from the server system 106. - The
applications 138 include one or more applications that can be executed on theclient device 120.

In some implementations,
memory 306 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore,memory 306 may store additional modules and data structures not described above. - Although
FIG. 3A shows a rating server,FIG. 3A is intended more as functional description of the various features which may be present in a set of servers than as a structural schematic of the implementations described herein. In practice, and as recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated. For example, some items (e.g.,operating system 316 and network communication module 318) shown separately inFIG. 3A could be implemented on single servers and single items could be implemented by one or more servers. The actual number of servers used to implement themedia monitoring server 130 and how features are allocated among them will vary from one implementation to another, and may depend in part on the amount of data traffic that the system must handle during peak usage periods as well as during average usage periods. -
FIG. 3B is a block diagram of an example of contentfile data structures 328 stored in thecontent database 136, according to some implementations. Arespective content file 328 includesmeta data 346 andcontent 354. Themeta data 346 for arespective content file 328 includes a content file identifier (file ID) 348, a content file type 250, targeted demographic 352, one or more associatedfingerprints 353,metrics 355 and optionally, additional information. In some implementations, thefile ID 348 uniquely identifies arespective content file 328. In other implementations, thefile ID 348 uniquely identifies arespective content file 328 in a directory (e.g., a file director) or other collection of documents within thecontent database 136. Thefile type 350 identifies the type of thecontent file 328. For example, thefile type 350 for arespective content file 328 in thecontent database 136 indicates that therespective content file 328 is a video file, an image file, a music file, a web page, an email message, an SMS message, a content feed, an advertisement, a coupon, a playlist and an XML document. The associatedfingerprint 353 identifies one or more fingerprints in thefingerprint database 136 that are associated with therespective content file 328. In some implementations, the associated fingerprints for a respective content file are determined by a broadcaster or creator of the document. In some implementations, the associated fingerprints are extracted by a module associated with themedia monitoring server 130 or a third party device/system. The targeted demographic 352 data represents the document provider's targeted demographic for thecontent file 328. The target demographic data represents the population of users, with particular demographic characteristics, that the document provider wishes to target with the file. The characteristics may be one or more of: age, gender, income, geographic location, education, wealth, religion, race, ethic group, marital status, household size, employment status, and political party affiliation. The target demographic data may be represented in absolute terms (e.g., “females between 18 and 25 years in age”) or, in some implementations, probabilistically (e.g., “84% male, 16% female, 5% 0-10 years old, 15% 11 to 20 years in age, 80% 20 to 45 years in age”). Themetrics 355 provide a measure of the importance of afile 328. In some implementations, themetrics 355 are set by the creator or owner of the document. In some implementations, themetrics 355 represent popularity, number of views or a bid. In some implementations, multiple parties associate files with a content fingerprint and each party places a bid to have their file displayed when content corresponding to the content fingerprint is detected. In some implementations, themetrics 355 include a click through-rate. For example, a webpage may be associated with a content fingerprint. -

FIG. 4B shows a client device,FIG. 4B is intended more as functional description of the various features which may be present in a client device than as a structural schematic of the implementations described herein. In practice, and as recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, items shown separately could be combined and some items could be separated. -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart representation of a method according to some implementations. In some implementations, the method is performed by a client device (e.g. client device 120 ofFIG. 2 ) or a similarly configured device in order to collect and report media exposure measurements to a media monitoring server. As represented by block 5-1, the method optionally includes, at the discretion of an end user, the client device collecting information that can be used to determine the location of the client device. For example, in some implementations, the client device includes or has access to a navigation systems, such as GPS (global positioning system), that provides the client device with actual location information that the client device can link to a media exposure measurement. In another example, in some implementations, the client device collects information about one or more WiFi networks (or the like) that the client device can currently detect. The client device does not necessarily have to have access rights to such networks. Rather, in some implementations it is sufficient that the client device is merely able to detect and recognize the WiFi networks in the immediate vicinity of the client device. In turn, the client device or server system can access a lookup table to determine where the WiFi networks are likely located and based on signal strength and/or access rights and capabilities, estimate the location of the client device with respect to the location of the WiFi networks. Similarly, in some implementations the client device can collect information related to which cellular base stations or the like (e.g. femto nodes and pico nodes) are within the immediate vicinity of the client device. For example, based on training sequences or identification codes transmitted by the base stations of particular cellular wireless network operators and/or the relative power at which corresponding base station signals are received, a client device or a system server can determine by, for example, triangulation, where the client device is located and possibly how fast and in which direction the client device is travelling. - Additionally and/or alternatively, a camera on a client device (
e.g. camera 124 ofFIG. 1 ) can be used to scan barcodes, quick response (QR) codes, logos or covers so that the user can use the client device to record times when the user is reading a particular magazine, book, catalogue or the like. - Additionally and/or alternatively, the camera may be used to scan receipts in order to record purchase measurements. In some implementations, the server applies an optical character recognition technique to the image of the receipt to determine what was purchased and create a corresponding record that can be used to identify correlated content, goods/ and/or services. In some implementations, the client device performs applies an optical character recognition technique to the image of the receipt to create a record.
- As represented by block 5-2, the method includes recording and/or generating a reference to media content that the client device is exposed to along with a timestamp. In other words, the client device serves a proxy for the user, assuming that the client device remains co-located with the user throughout the day. The reference to the media content allows either a client device or a server system to determine the form and content of the media content. For example, a reference to a portion of a video stream may include a time indicator and/or a digital marker referencing the content of the video stream. With further reference to
FIG. 2 , thecontent information 164 is derived from a video stream being presented (i.e. playing) by the combination of theTV 110 and theclient 102. As noted above, each reference includes a timestamp so that the media exposure measurements can be analyzed according to time patterns, as well as location patterns derived from the location data. - As represented by block 5-3, the method includes the client device reporting the media exposure measurements to the server system for analysis. In some implementations, the client device reports media exposure measurements in real-time as the measurements are made. In some implementations, the client device reports a collection of media exposure measurements after a particular duration, such as, for example, after several hours, a day or a week, etc. As represented block 5-4, the method optionally includes the client device receiving feedback from a server monitoring application that has made one or more determinations based on the media exposure measurements reported by the client device.
- As represented by block 5-5, the method optionally includes determining whether the server system has requested the client device to make additional reports. If the server system has suggested that the client device make additional media exposure reports (“Yes” path from block 5-5), the method includes reiterating from the portion of the method represented by block 5-1. On the other hand, if the server system has not suggested that the client device make additional media exposure measurements (“No” path from block 5-5), as represented by block 5-6, the method includes the client device receiving content correlated to the media content consumed and/or exposed to the user based on the media exposure measurements reported by the client device.
-
FIG. 6 is a flowchart representation of a method according to some implementations. In some implementations, the method is performed by a media monitoring server (e.g. contentinformation extraction module 131 ofFIG. 1 ) in order to collect and analyze media exposure measurements on an individual client device basis (e.g. client device 120 ofFIG. 2 ). As represented by block 6-1, the method includes receiving one or more media exposure measurements from a particular client device associated with a particular user. Again, in some implementations, each client device serves as a proxy for a particular user. As such, the media exposure measurements from a particular client device can be used to determine the forms and content of media a user is exposed to or consume, and in some implementations, when the user is exposed to or consumes the media content. In some implementations, as the discretion of the user, location information can be used to determine where the user is when the user is exposed to or consumes various types of media content. To that end, as represented by block 6-2, the method optionally includes determining the location, and in some cases, the type of location associated with one or more of the media exposure measurements. As noted above, a client device may collect and/or detect various types of network data that allows the media monitoring server or another system to estimate where the client device was located when a particular media exposure measurement was taken. - As represented by block 6-3, the method includes identifying the form and content of media associated with each media exposure measurement. For example, the method includes determining the identity of the playing media content by comparing the reference to information in a fingerprint database. As represented by block 6-4, the method includes annotating each media exposure measurement with the location information (if determined) and with content correlated with the determined form and content associated with the media exposure measurement. As represented by block 6-5, the method includes identifying access and exposure patterns associated with the use of the client device based on the media exposure measurements.
- Additionally and/or alternatively, the media monitoring server correlates data across media exposure measurements from a number of client devices, each serving as a proxy for a particular user. In other words, the media exposure measurements are correlated across two or more users that share similar and/or overlapping demographic information to create a profile of a particular demographic of users having similar and/or overlapping demographic information.
- As represented by block 6-6, the method includes pushing correlated content at various times based on the identified patterns. For example, if based on the media exposure measurements, it is determined that a particular user regularly searches for restaurants during particular days of the week before what is customarily dinner time, advertisements or coupons for local restaurants may be pushed to the client device for the user to consider.
- Additionally and/or alternatively, the media monitoring server links the patterns to demographic information associated with the reporting user or users, and identifies other users with similar and/or overlapping demographic information. Further, the media monitoring server, having identified other users with similar demographic information, pushes correlated content to some or all such users at various times based on the identified patterns based on media exposure measurements provided reporting users. In other words, the client device serves as a proxy for a reporting user, and the reporting user servers as a representative member of a group of users with similar and/or overlapping demographic information. For example, if based on the media exposure measurements, it is determined that a particular user regularly searches for restaurants during particular days of the week before what is customarily dinner time, advertisements or coupons for local restaurants may be pushed to the client devices of some or all users that share similar and/or overlapping demographic information with reporting user.
-
FIG. 7 is a flowchart representation of a method according to some implementations. In some implementations, the method is performed by a media monitoring server (e.g. contentinformation extraction module 131 ofFIG. 1 ) in order to determine a location and possibly a location type estimate associated with each of one or more media exposure measurements received from a client device. As represented by block 7-1, the method includes parsing received media exposure measurements to identify location information collected by the client device at the discretion of the user. - As represented by block 7-2, the method includes determining whether or not the client device provided an actual location, such as from a navigation system, along with the media exposure measurement. If the client device provided an actual location (“Yes” path from block 7-2), as represented by block 7-8, the method includes determining the type of location based on, for example, access to a database or online service (e.g. Google Maps). On the other hand, if the client device did not provide an actual location (“No” path from block 7-2), as represented by block 7-3, the method includes determining if the client device provided WiFi network data measurements.
- If the client device provided WiFi network data measurements (“Yes” path from block 7-3), as represented by block 7-5, the method includes determining the associated location of the media exposure measurement by referencing a lookup table and/or correlated references. On the other hand, if the client device did not provide WiFi network data measurements (“No” path from block 7-3), as represented by block 7-4, the method includes determining if the client device provided wireless network operator data, such as for example, measurements of codes and/or received power from cellular base stations or the like.
- If the client device provided wireless network operator data (“Yes” path from block 7-4), as represented by block 7-6, the method includes determining the associated location, and possibly the trajectory of the client device, associated with the media exposure measurement by, for example, triangulation. On the other hand, if the client device did not provide wireless network operator data (“No” path from block 7-4), as represented by block 7-5, the method includes reporting that the location cannot be determined based on the information included with the media exposure measurement.
- According to the illustrated implementation, following the portion of the method represented by blocks 7-5 and 7-6, the method includes performing the portion of the method represented by block 7-8, as discussed above. Subsequently, as represented by block 7-9, the method includes annotating the media exposure measurement with the derived location information.
- With further reference to
FIGS. 1 and 2 ,FIG. 8 is a signaling diagram representation of some of the transmissions between components in the client-server environment 100. As represented byblock 801, theTV 110 plays a television program, such as, without limitation, a drama, a political debate, the nightly news, or a sporting event. Playing a television program includes displaying video on a display and outputting audio using speakers. As represented byblock 802,client device 120 generates a reference to the TV program playing on theTV 110, optionally recording location data at the discretion of the end user of theclient device 120. To that end, in some implementations, theclient device 120 records at least one of audio or video output by theTV 110. In some implementations, theTV 110 andclient device 120 or theclient device 102 and theclient device 120 share a data connection that allows theclient device 120 to retrieve content associated with the playing television program that can be used to generate the reference. As represented byblock 803, theradio 170 plays a radio program, such as, without limitation, music or talk radio. As represented byblock 804,client device 120 generates a reference to the radio program in a manner to similar to the manner in which the reference to the TV program was generated. - As represented by
block 805, the client device transmits the media exposure measurement data to the server. As represented byblock 806, thefront end server 134 of themedia monitoring server 130 receives the media exposure measurements from theclient device 120. As represented byblock 807, the contentinformation extraction module 131 optionally determines the location and location type associated with one or more of the media exposure measurements. As represented byblock 808, the contentinformation extraction module 131 optionally identifies access and exposure patterns associated with the use of the client device based on the media exposure measurements. As represented byblock 809, contentinformation extraction module 131 pushes correlated content to theclient device 120. As represented byblock 810, theclient device 120 receives correlated content at various times based on the identified usage and media exposure patterns. - The foregoing description, for purpose of explanation, has been described with reference to specific implementations.
