According to No. 35 the 119th (e) money of united states patent law (35U.S.C. § 119 (e)), the application requires in the right of priority of the U.S. Provisional Application sequence number 60/974,332 of submission on September 21st, 2007.
Technical field
The disclosure relates to cross-language search.
Background technology
The quantity of the webpage of writing with some language (for example, English) may be much larger than the quantity of the webpage of writing with other Languages.This species diversity say due to a great extent some language the people quantity and in saying the country of those language the wide in range availability of technology.In addition, compare with the page of other Languages, such page is usually safeguarded better, and the more accurate and up-to-date information relevant with many themes can be provided.Therefore, say that the people of widely used language still may be not interested in the information that finds on web on the available webpage of other Languages (for example, English).Therefore, because correlated results even may not be present in searchers's the language, so the webpage that search is write with the language that is used for submitting to search inquiry may not necessarily satisfy searchers's inquiry.
For example, the people of Egypt sometimes to the Middle East beyond place tourism, abroad university's study or to understand the information of relating to persons of famous non-Egypt interested.Yet, may be few of be used for submit Query language be the page relevant with these themes of user's native language.In addition, because the author of the page may not have sufficient access to such theme, so may be relatively low-quality with the page of user's native language.Extraly, because the user can not say another kind of language, so such user may not send inquiry with another kind of language.Therefore, these users may not find relevant and/or premium content.
Summary of the invention
An aspect of the theme of generally speaking, describing in this manual can be implemented in the system that comprises load module, evaluation module and output module.Load module can receive the initial search query of first language, and initial search query is the request to the document relevant with original search.Evaluation module can receive the first set of the relevance score that is associated with result from initial search query and the second set of the relevance score that is associated with result from the search inquiry of the translation of second language.Evaluation module can compare to determine initial search query to the first and second set of relevance score or the search inquiry of translation produces maximally related result.Output module can be based on being that initial search query or the inquiry of translation have maximally related result, provides to the user to comprise from the result of initial search query or from one or at least part of Search Results among both among the result of the search inquiry of translation.Other embodiment of this aspect comprises corresponding method, device and computer program.
The exemplary method that is used for the execution cross-language search can comprise: the initial search query that receives first language; Obtain the search inquiry of the translation that is associated with initial search query, the search inquiry of translation is with the second language form; The relevance score that is associated based on the result of search inquiry with translation, the translation that is associated with translation are put the letter score value or are comprised the search inquiry of the entity that is associated with first or second language, and the search inquiry of assessment translation determines that the search inquiry translated is whether for the candidate of cross-language search; And based on the assessment the result distribute result of page searching.
With below accompanying drawing with set forth the one or more embodiments of the detail of the theme of describing in this instructions in describing.The further feature of theme, aspect and advantage will become apparent from description, accompanying drawing and claim.

Embodiment
In some embodiments of this instructions, the webpage of realizing receiving search inquiry and definite foreign language from client device is whether to the system and method for the matched well of inquiry.For example, if in the user of Egypt input about the inquiry such as the Arabic of the theme of rugby, then may few of query language provide the webpage of correlated results for this inquiry.Yet, may have the related pages of other Languages.For example, the query translation from the Arabic of previous example can be become the inquiry of English, and compare with the English index of webpage.If there is in this example the more relevant result who finds in the webpage of English, then the tabulation of related pages can be translated and offer the user.In some embodiments, select webpage based on the user from the tabulation of related pages, related web page can be translated and offer the user.In some embodiments, the tabulation of correlated results can comprise translation the result and untranslated as a result both.
Figure 1A is the block diagram of describing the architecture of cross-language search system 100.Cross-language search system 100 can receive search inquiry (Q) 10a of first language.In some embodiments, first language (for example, search language) can be identified based on the input pattern that is associated with client device.In other embodiments, first language can be identified based on just accessed specific country codes TLD.For example, the Google in mountain scene city, California provides many different webpages to many different countries, and the country code TLD can be used to identify customer end expectation reception from the input of which kind of language (or which language).In such example, if the user accesses " google.ru " country code TLD, then the client expectation receives the input of Russian.In other embodiment, the user can use the client to bring in the appointment first language.For example, the user can select in a plurality of language of supporting one with drop-down menu, and wherein the user is intended to this language inputted search inquiry.
In some embodiments, cross-language search system 100 can send to search inquiry search engine 20.Search engine 20 can receive inquiry and identification Search Results.For example, search engine 20 can be from the index of the document index of webpage (for example, from) retrieve relevant search results.The extracts of the text that Search Results can comprise the tabulation of web page title for example, extract from those webpages and the hypertext link of pointing to those webpages, and the Search Results that can be grouped into predetermined quantity (for example 10).
In some embodiments, search engine 20 can resolve to component sign (Q with search inquiry (Q) 10a
1, Q
2..., Q
n) 10b.In some embodiments, sign is the word that forms inquiry (or group of words, wherein group of words forms single concept, such as " New YorkCity ").Component sign (Q
1, Q
2..., Q
n) 10b can be used to identify the webpage relevant with search inquiry (Q) 10a of first language.In some embodiments, related web page is comprising more than component sign (Q of first language
1, Q
2..., Q
n) those webpages of one among the 10b.Such webpage can for example find in the index 30 of the webpage that is limited in first language.In some embodiments, search engine 20 can be derived the relevance score that is associated with related pages.In other embodiment, search engine 20 can derive with as the page rank score value that is associated by the quality of the webpage of the takeoff of other website that is linked to the page.Search engine 20 can also be derived the score value relevant with Search Results (for example, information retrieval (IR) score value).In some embodiments, the IR score value can calculate from such as dot product, page rank score value and/or the IR score value of the proper vector corresponding with inquiry and document relevance and the combination of page rank score value etc.
In some embodiments, cross-language search system 100 determines component sign (Q
1, Q
2..., Q
n) more any whether local entity 40 among the 10b, and from cross-language search, get rid of any search inquiry (Q) 10a that comprises local entity.Entity is those words or the phrase of identification people, place or things.Local entity is those entities that are associated with the language of input inquiry, and the cradle of this language is wherein mainly said in people, place or things indication.Can there be the physics indication of the cradle of wherein mainly saying this language, the logic display of cradle or the history indication of cradle.For example, Eiffel Tower is positioned at France, and therefore inquiry " la Tour Eiffel " is the local entity about French.In another example, large ground force indicates both in logic and history that the U.S. has the cradle, so it is the local entity about English.In other example, because word " М о с κ в а " identification is positioned at Muscovite Moscow: City, so it is the local entity about Russian.
The tabulation of such entity can from derivation such as encyclopedia, location server, public filings, maybe can provide from the third party.Independent general word is typically got rid of in the tabulation of local entity, even general word is the formation word in brand name.Yet the many words brand name that comprises general word can be included in the tabulation of local entity (for example, " AuburnUniversity (Auburn University) ").
The tabulation of local entity is also typically got rid of and is comprised external entity.In one embodiment, external entity is that the language for input inquiry is not those entities of local entity.In other embodiments, external entity can be to be the translation of entity and those entities of this locality for another kind of language.Entity can be local for a kind of language, and can be external for another kind of language.For example, sign " Vladimir Putin " has defined the local entity of Russian, and identical sign will define the external entity of English.Therefore, if Russian user is with the part input of (Russian) " Vladimir Putin " as search inquiry 20a, then will in the local entity of Russian, find entity " Vladimir Putin ", and search can be got rid of and carry out outside the cross-language search.In another example, " М о с κ в а " (for example " Moscow ") is the local entity of Russian.
In some embodiments, comprise that the search inquiry of the sign that is complementary with local entity is not suitable for cross-language search, therefore search can be to be used for submitting to the language of search inquiry to provide.For example, if (for example receive search " Al-Qahira ", " Cairo " is interrelated with Egyptian entity), then since local entity of sign " Al-Qahira " and Arabic be complementary, so can provide search inquiry from the index of the webpage of Arabic.Therefore, can suppose to compare with the webpage of writing with another kind of language (for example, the webpage that the English search inquiry " Cairo " of translation produces), more relevant with search inquiry with the webpage of Arabic creation.In addition, the webpage of writing with another kind of language may be difficult to understand after translation.For example, compare with the webpage of writing with Arabic, the webpage of writing with English that is translated into Arabic may more difficult reading for the people who innately says Arabic.
In some embodiments, can be with component sign (Q
1, Q
2..., Q
n) 10b and local entity 40 compare to determine component sign (Q
1, Q
2..., Q
n) any crossing degree of the set of 10b and the gathering of local entity 40.The degree that intersects between the gathering of component sign 10b and local entity 40 can be used to determine whether carry out cross-language search.
In other embodiments, subset (for example, n unit) and the gathering of local entity 40 of search inquiry can be compared.In such embodiment, whether any subset that cross-language search system 100 can compare the gathering of each and local entity 40 in the subset of search inquiry to determine to be included in the subset in the search inquiry is complementary with local entity from the gathering of local entity 60.For example, if cross-language search system 100 has received search inquiry " vacation homes finger lakes ", then cross-language search system 100 can comprise following any set to the gathering search of local entity 40: " vacation ", " vacation homes ", " vacation homes finger ", " vacation homes finger lakes ", " homes ", " homes finger ", " homes finger lakes ", " finger " and " finger lakes ".In some embodiments, if the first word of subdivision character string is not included in the coupling in the gathering of local entity 40, the cross-language search system 100 subdivision character string that can stop search then.In extra embodiment, cross-language search system 100 can end search after finding the subset that is complementary with entity from the gathering of local entity 40.For example, if cross-language search system 100 has received inquiry " Manhattan gourmet restaurants ", then cross-language search system 100 may find the word " Manhattan " that is complementary with local entity from the gathering of local entity 40 immediately.Therefore, can think that it is unnecessary that search is further mated.
In those situations of pending cross-language search, cross-language search system 100 can send to translater 25 with search inquiry (Q) 10a.Translater 25 uses search inquiry (Q) 10a to derive search inquiry (the Q ') 50a of the translation of second language.In some embodiments, translater can be the automatic machine translation device of inquiry (the Q ') 50a of the translation of search inquiry (Q) 10a that can operate to receive first language and output second language.
Search inquiry (the Q ') 50a of translation can be divided into component sign (Q by search engine 20
1', Q
2' ..., Q
n') 50b.In some embodiments, search engine 20 or cross-language search system 100 can be with component sign (Q
1', Q
2' ..., Q
n') gathering of 50b and external entity 60 compares.The gathering of external entity 60 can comprise those entities that are associated with second language.For example, if second language is Russian, then external entity (for example can comprise the position, Red Square, the Kremlin, Moscow or Siberia) and people (for example, Lenin, Stalin, Mikhail Gorbachev or Yeltsin) or the Russian brand name, product and the company that are associated with Russian.The component sign of second language (Q1 ', Q2 ' ..., Qn ') set of 50b comprises in some those situations that intersect with external entity 60, the inquiry of translation (Q ') 50a can be considered to carry out the good candidate of cross-language search.Whether in other embodiments, the inquiry of translation (Q ') can be divided into subset and be complementary with external entity with word that entity in the gathering of external entity 60 compares to determine to be included in the search inquiry.
In other embodiment, translater can produce the translation that is associated with the search inquiry of translating (Q ') 50a and put letter score value 70.Letter score value 70 is put in the translation that is associated with inquiry (the Q ') 50a of translation can be used to determine that the translation possibility produces correlated results.In such embodiment, translation can be put letter 70 and translation and put the letter threshold value and compare with the inquiry of determining translation (Q ') 50a whether be used for the candidate of cross-language search.For example, search inquiry (Q) 10a can have 100 or more translation potentially.The potential translation of larger quantity can produce larger uncertainty about the search inquiry of the translation selected (Q ') from possible translation.Therefore, have certain following possibility: selected translation is incorrect; Any result who uses such search inquiry to generate will be uncorrelated with initial search query 10a.Therefore, translation is put letter score value 70 and is not satisfied translation and put the search inquiry of the translation of letter threshold value (Q ') 50a and can be considered to for the bad candidate who carries out cross-language search.
In some embodiments, translater 25 can offer search engine 20 with a plurality of translations based on a plurality of translations of putting the letter threshold value above translation.In other embodiments, translater 25 can be with single translation (for example, search inquiry (the Q ') 50a of translation) offers cross-language search system 100, and stride language system and can determine that the translation that is associated with the search inquiry of this translation (Q ') 50a puts the letter score value and whether satisfy translation and put the letter threshold value.Get rid of from cross-language search and not satisfy translation and put the search inquiry of the translation of letter threshold value (Q ') 50a.
Put the letter threshold value if the search inquiry (Q ') of translation satisfies, then the search inquiry of translation (Q ') 50a can be sent to search engine 20 with search and the search inquiry of translating (the Q ') document (for example, webpage) that 50a is relevant.Search engine 20 can use search inquiry (the Q ') 50a of translation the component sign (Q ' 1, Q ' 2 ..., Q ' n) 50b looks for the related web page 80 of second language.As previously mentioned, search engine 20 can provide the IR that is associated with the related web page of second language score value to cross-language search system 100.
In some embodiments, the respective relevancy score value that is associated with the result of search inquiry (the Q ') 50a of translation can be compared to determine whether that with the relevance score threshold value webpage that will translate is used as the result of search inquiry (Q) 20a.For example, in some cases, the possibility of result of inquiry (the Q ') 50a of translation has so low relevance score, so that it can not be distributed to the searchers, even the result of search inquiry (the Q ') 50a of translation has the higher relevance score of result than search inquiry (Q) 20a.
In some embodiments, result's relevance score and the result's who is used for search inquiry (Q) 10a the relevance score that is used for search inquiry (the Q ') 50a of translation can be compared.More relevant result as a result of 90 can be distributed to the user.Have in the result of search inquiry (the Q ') 50a of translation in those situations of the relevance score higher than the result's of search inquiry (Q) 10a relevance score, the related web page of second language can be translated into first language and as a result of 90 distribute.In some embodiments, based on the possibility of the webpage ratio of translating with the more difficult reading of webpage of the original creation of first language, relevance score can be partial to hobby from the result of search inquiry (Q) 10a.
In some embodiments, the web results of the translation of the search inquiry of translation can comprise that translation puts the letter score value.In such embodiment, the translation that the translation with the webpage of translating can be associated is put letter score value or quality and translation and is put the result 90 that the letter threshold value compares to determine whether the webpage of translation to be used as search inquiry 10a.For example, in some cases, can determine that the translation of the related web page of second language or the part that is associated or extracts almost can not be read for the searchers.In such example, cross-language search system 100 may only distribute those results that the letter threshold value is put in and satisfied translation more relevant than local result.
Figure 1B is the block diagram of examples shown cross-language search system 100.In some embodiments, system 100 can comprise load module 110, query assessment module 120, solid data storage 130 and output module 140.Load module 110 can receive search inquiry from client device.In some embodiments, load module 110 can comprise and offer for example search-engine web page code of the subscriber equipment of computer equipment, and it presents at subscriber equipment makes the webpage that the user can the inputted search inquiry.In other embodiments, load module 110 can comprise the communication interface that makes system can receive from client device inquiry.
In some embodiments, query assessment module 120 can receive search inquiry from load module 110, and can assess the candidate of search inquiry to determine whether search inquiry is used for carrying out cross-language search.In these embodiments, query assessment module 120 can filtered search inquire about to identify those inquiries: with comparing of being used for that the webpage of language creation of input inquiry finds, more may have the more relevant result from the webpage of another kind of language.
In some embodiments, query assessment module 120 can be communicated by letter with translation service 122.Translation service 122 can receive the search inquiry of first language, and search inquiry can be translated into second language and generate the translation that is associated with the search inquiry of translation and put the letter score value.Search inquiry and the translation of translation can be put the letter score value and offered query assessment module 120.
In some embodiments, the sign that the entity (for example, local entity) that is associated from the same and first language (for example, search inquiry language) of search inquiry is complementary can be by query assessment module 120 coordinated entity data storage 130 identifications.In some embodiments, local entity can be and be the proper noun (for example, city, place etc.) that local zone is associated for being used for the language of inputted search inquiry.
In other embodiments, the search inquiry that comprises the sign that is complementary with local entity can still be fit to cross-language search based on the correlativity of the webpage of first language.In such embodiment, when search inquiry comprises the sign that is complementary with local entity, the result who is associated with local entity and the threshold value relevance score of the language of inquiry can be compared the poor quality whether with the result that determines first language.For example, search inquiry may comprise the sign that is complementary with local entity; Yet the webpage of the language that is associated with this this locality entity may be rare.Therefore, it can be useful that the webpage possibility of determining another kind of language has more relevant result.
In some embodiments, when cross-language search system 100 can identify the external entity of tag match from the search inquiry of translation.External entity is any entity (for example, " Cairo, Egypt " is the external entity of English) that is associated with language except first language.In some instances, be used for first or the encyclopedia of second language can be used to determine whether the inquiry of translation is used for the good candidate of cross-language search.In these examples, the sign that is complementary with entity (for example, local or external) that is included in the search inquiry of search inquiry or translation can use respectively the encyclopaedical website that is associated with first language or second language to identify.In other example, location server can be used to identify the position that is associated with the search inquiry of search inquiry or translation.
In some embodiments, stored 130 o'clock in the edit substance data, general word can be identified and remove from solid data storage 130, even represent at word in the situation in the trade mark that is associated with first or second language or city.For example, general word is those words that do not have any particular association with this language.Also making an example of city or trade mark general word associated therewith is " auburn ".In some cases, " auburn " typically refers to color, and in other cases, it can refer to Alabama State, city Austria originally or trade mark " AuburnUniversity ".In another example, word " apple " can refer to fruit usually, and it can refer to company in other cases.Owing to if the user is just attempting to input general word, rather than city or trade mark, then these words can cause incoherent result, so remove these words from solid data storage 130.
In some embodiments, query assessment module 120 can retrieve be included in encyclopedia in the relevant historical statistics of entity.Based on the statistics that is associated with entity, query assessment module 120 can be determined the frequency that is associated that comprises in the search inquiry that formerly receives with entity.For example, entity occurs more frequent in search inquiry, and the theme relevant with this entity is more welcome.Because as being inquired about indicated interest by the user usually by the interest reflection from the publisher, so more welcome theme more may have the related web page that joins with Topic relative.In addition, when the related content that do not exist about inquiry, because this inquiry do not produce correlated results, so can becoming, this inquiry is out of favour.Entity with the threshold frequency inquiry can be included in the solid data storage 130, has the related subject corpus aspect the webpage that is associated because can suppose such entity.
In other embodiment, query assessment module 120 can be determined the quality of the translation of search inquiry.The quality of translation can be used to determine whether search inquiry is used for the good candidate of cross-language search.For example, if translation is inferior, for example translation is put letter and is indicated this translation to have to be incorrect relatively high possibility, and then the result from the inquiry of inferior translation also may be inferior, or may be fully uncorrelated with initial search query.Various translation services are put the letter score value to determine which word the usage most probable relates to for translation provides.In some embodiments, translation service can come integral body translation for search inquiry to provide to put the letter score value based on the letter of putting that is associated with the translation of each word in the search inquiry.Therefore, search inquiry may be difficult to accurate translation, and the value of the confidence or mass value can be used to filter the search inquiry that uses such word and be not used to cross-language search.For example, certain words may have a plurality of translations of the foreign language translated into or may not have translation.Such word is difficult to translation, and causes low the put letter score value relevant with translation.
In some embodiments, can test the search inquiry of translation to determine whether the search inquiry of translating produces the related web page coupling.In such embodiment, query assessment module 120 can send to search engine 124 with the search inquiry of translation.Search engine 124 can be identified relevant documentation in the corpus of documents 126 (for example, the index of second language) with the search inquiry of translation.The document of identifying and the search inquiry of translation can be used to derive the relevance score that is associated with the result of the search inquiry of translating.In some embodiments, relevance score can comprise correlativity component and mass component.After receiving the relevance score that is associated with the result from the search inquiry of translation who receives from search engine 124, query assessment module 120 can will compare with definite search inquiry possibility and search inquiry of translating relevant with relevance threshold with relevance score that the result of search inquiry is associated.For example, so uncorrelated from the possibility of result of the search inquiry of translating in some cases, so that even do not provide described result to the searchers.
In other embodiment, the user can be used to determine the result of self similarity inquiry whether to be satisfied with for other users about the activity with the result of the previous inquiry that is complementary of inquiry of translation, thereby the inquiry of indication similarity has produced correlated results.For example, search engine 124 can in the client device request results, for example be charged to daily record when the login page that Search Results is clicked and arrived with this result is associated.If client device turns back to immediately searched page and inputs new inquiry after the access login page, then the possibility of result is incoherent.On the contrary, if client device resides in the one or more the preceding paragraph times in the results page, then the result more may be relevant with search inquiry.Therefore, query assessment module 120 can based on other users' that use the search inquiry that is complementary with the inquiry of translating activity, determine that the search inquiry possibility of translation produces quality results.
In other embodiment, whether the search inquiry that query assessment module 120 can be determined first language has more relevant result than the search inquiry of the translation of second language.In such embodiment, query assessment module 120 can send to the search inquiry of search inquiry and translation search engine 124.Search engine 124 can be derived the first set of the relevance score that is associated with the first set from the result of initial search query, and the second set of the relevance score that is associated with the second set from the result of the search inquiry of translation.In some embodiments, if as indicated by the first and second relevance score respectively, search inquiry produces the recently better result of any result in the result of the search inquiry of translating, and then the result from search inquiry can be distributed to the searchers.As an alternative, if as by relevance score is indicated separately, recently the result from search inquiry is more relevant from the result of the search inquiry of translation, then the result from the search inquiry of translation can be distributed to the searchers.Like this suppose that relatively it is commensurable that each corpus is striden in the correlativity measurement of different language.
In some embodiments, can translate to produce to the webpage (or a plurality of webpage) of second language the translated version of the webpage of this first language.For example, the translated version of the webpage of first language and the search inquiry of first language can be compared to derive relevance score.For example, the search inquiry of the Spanish that receives can be translated into English.If compare with the degree of correlation of the inquiry of Spanish with the webpage of the Spanish of high rank, the webpage of the English of high rank is more relevant with the English language query of translation, then the English web page translation can be become Spanish.In this example, after the English web page translation is become Spanish, the English webpage of Spanish inquiry with translation can be compared.If compare with the degree of correlation of Spanish inquiry with Spanish webpage, the English webpage of translation is still more relevant with Spanish inquiry, then the English webpage of translation as a result of can be provided.If compare with the degree of correlation of Spanish inquiry with Spanish webpage, the English webpage of translation is more not relevant with Spanish inquiry, then Spanish webpage as a result of can be offered the searchers.Therefore, the searched page of translation can be compared for the relevance score of original query and the relevance score of the webpage of writing with first language for initial search query.
In some embodiments, based on the relevance score that is associated with accordingly result, the result who is distributed to client device can comprise the webpage of translation and the webpage of writing with first language.For example, if the result from English language query has 10,9 and 2 relevance score, and have 8,8 and 6 relevance score from the result of Spanish inquiry, then the cross-language search system can provide two maximally related results from English language query, the result of the Spanish inquiry of heel, and with the most incoherent result's end from English language query.In other embodiments, the result's of initial search query relevance score polymerization can be produced the first polymerization relevance score, and the relevance score polymerization of initial search query can be produced the second polymerization relevance score.In some embodiments, polymerization can comprise the respective relevancy score value is sued for peace to produce the first and second polymerization relevance score.The first polymerization relevance score and the second polymerization relevance score can be compared to determine whether to distribute the result who is associated with the search inquiry of translating.
Fig. 1 C is the block diagram of the example embodiment of diagram query assessment module 120.Query assessment module 120 can receive the search inquiry (Q) of first language.Query assessment module 120 can send to search engine 124 with search inquiry (Q).Search engine 124 can be carried out search to the corpus of documents 126 that is associated with first language to produce the set of Search Results (RQ) based on search inquiry (Q).
