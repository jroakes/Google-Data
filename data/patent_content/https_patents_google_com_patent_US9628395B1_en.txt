- An example balloon network may provide various types of free and/or paid services to end users, such as wireless data service, voice service, location-based service, and/or weather-data service, among other possibilities. Accordingly, a web interface may be provided that allows users to access information relates to a balloon network's services, to request and/or obtain services from the balloon network, and/or to access various features and functions related to the balloon network.
- an example balloon network may have balloons that move dynamically throughout the coverage area of the network, which may lead to variability in the level of services and/or the availability of services over time.
- a web interface for the balloon network may provide various features that allow users to learn about the status of the balloon network and its services.
- a “web interface” for the balloon network may be any interface that allows for network-based interactions, such as a webpage, or a stand-alone desktop or mobile application.
- the balloons in an exemplary network may be configured move latitudinally and/or longitudinally relative to one another by adjusting their respective altitudes, such that the wind carries the respective balloons to the respectively desired locations.
- the balloons may communicate with one another using free-space optical communications.
- the balloons may be configured for optical communications using ultrabright LEDs or possibly lasers for optical signaling (although regulations for laser communications may restrict laser usage).
- the balloons may communicate with ground-based station(s) using radio-frequency (RF) communications and/or optical communications.
- RF radio-frequency
- a high-altitude-balloon network may be homogenous. More specifically, in a homogenous high-altitude-balloon network, each balloon is configured to communicate with nearby balloons via free-space optical links. Further, some or all of the balloons in such a network, may also be configured communicate with ground-based station(s) using RF communications. (Note that in some embodiments, the balloons may be homogenous in so far as each balloon is configured for free-space optical communication with other balloons, but heterogeneous with regard to RF communications with ground-based stations.)
- a high-altitude-balloon network may be heterogeneous, and thus may include two or more different types of balloons.
- some balloons may be configured as super-nodes, while other balloons may be configured as sub-nodes. (Note also that some balloons may be configured to function as both a super-node and a sub-node.)
- the super-node balloons may be configured to communicate with nearby super-node balloons via free-space optical links.
- the sub-node balloons may not be configured for free-space optical communication, and may instead be configured for, e.g., RF communications.
- a super-node may be further configured to communicate with nearby sub-nodes using RF communications.
- the sub-nodes may accordingly relay communications from the super-nodes to ground-based station(s) using RF communications.
- the super-nodes may collectively function as backhaul for the balloon network, while the sub-nodes function to relay communications from the super-nodes to ground-based stations.
- FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram illustrating a balloon network 100 , according to an exemplary embodiment.
- balloon network 100 includes balloons 102 A to 102 F, which are configured to communicate with one another via free-space optical links 104 . Configured as such, balloons 102 A to 102 F may collectively function as a mesh network for packet-data communications. Further, balloons 102 A to 102 B may be configured for RF communications with ground-based stations 106 via RF links 108 .
- balloons 102 A to 102 F are high-altitude balloons, which are deployed in the stratosphere.
- the stratosphere includes altitudes between approximately 10 kilometers (km) and 50 km altitude above the surface.
- the stratosphere starts at an altitude of approximately 8 km.
- high-altitude balloons may be generally configured to operate in an altitude range within the stratosphere that has lower winds (e.g., between 5 and 20 miles per hour (mph)).
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may generally be configured to operate at altitudes between 17 km and 22 km (although other altitudes are possible). This altitude range may be advantageous for several reasons.
- this layer of the stratosphere generally has mild wind and turbulence (e.g., winds between 5 and 20 miles per hour (mph)).
- winds between 17 km and 22 km may vary with latitude and by season, the variations can be modeled in a reasonably accurate manner.
- altitudes above 17 km are typically above the maximum flight level designated for commercial air traffic. Therefore, interference with commercial flights is not a concern when balloons are deployed between 17 km and 22 km.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may be configured to transmit an optical signal via an optical link 104 .
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may use one or more high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to transmit an optical signal.
- LEDs high-power light-emitting diodes
- some or all of balloons 102 A to 102 F may include laser systems for free-space optical communications over optical links 104 . Other types of free-space optical communication are possible.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may include one or more optical receivers. Additional details of balloons implementations are discussed in greater detail below, with reference to FIG. 3 .
- balloons 102 A to 102 B may utilize one or more of various different RF air-interface protocols for communication ground-based stations 106 via RF links 108 .
- some or all of balloons 102 A to 102 B may be configured to communicate with ground-based stations 106 using protocols described in IEEE 802.11 (including any of the IEEE 802.11 revisions), various cellular protocols such as GSM, CDMA, UMTS, EV-DO, WiMAX, and/or LTE, and/or one or more propriety protocols developed for balloon-to-ground RF communication, among other possibilities.
- an exemplary network may also include downlink balloons, which provide a high-capacity air-to-ground link.
- balloon 102 F is configured as a downlink balloon.
- a downlink balloon 102 F may be operable for optical communication with other balloons via optical links 104 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may also be configured for free-space optical communication with a ground-based station 112 via an optical link 110 .
- Optical link 110 may therefore serve as a high-capacity link (as compared to an RF link 108 ) between the balloon network 100 and a ground-based station 108 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may additionally be operable for RF communication with ground-based stations 106 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may only use an optical link for balloon-to-ground communications.
- an exemplary balloon network can also include multiple downlink balloons.
- a balloon network can also be implemented without any downlink balloons.
- a downlink balloon may be equipped with a specialized, high-bandwidth RF communication system for balloon-to-ground communications, instead of or in addition to a free-space optical communication system.
- the high-bandwidth RF communication system may take the form of an ultra-wideband system, which provides an RF link with substantially the same capacity as the optical links 104 .
- Other forms are also possible.
- Ground-based stations such as ground-based stations 106 and/or 112 , may take various forms.
- a ground-based station may include components such as transceivers, transmitters, and/or receivers for communication via RF links and/or optical links with a balloon network.
- a ground-based station may use various air-interface protocols in order communicate with a balloon 102 A to 102 F over an RF link 108 .
- a ground-based station 106 may be configured as an access points via which various devices can connect to balloon network 100 .
- Ground-based station 106 may have other configurations and/or serve other purposes without departing from the scope of the invention.
- ground-based stations such as ground-based station 106 may be configured as gateways between balloon network 100 and one or more other networks. Such a ground-based station 106 may thus serve as an interface between the balloon network and the Internet, a cellular service provider's network, and/or other types of networks. Variations on this configuration and other configurations of a ground-based station 106 are also possible.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may collectively function as a mesh network. More specifically, since balloons 102 A to 102 F may communicate with one another using free-space optical links, the balloons may collectively function as a free-space optical mesh network.
- each balloon 102 A to 102 F may function as a node of the mesh network, which is operable to receive data direct to it and to route data to other balloons.
- data may be routed from a source balloon to a destination balloon by determining an appropriate sequence of optical links between the source balloon and the destination balloon.
- These optical links may be collectively referred to as a “lightpath” for the connection between the source and destination balloons.
- each of the optical links may be referred to as a “hop” on the lightpath.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may employ various routing techniques and self-healing algorithms.
- a balloon network 100 may employ adaptive or dynamic routing, where a lightpath between a source and destination balloon is determined and set-up when the connection is needed, and released at a later time. Further, when adaptive routing is used, the lightpath may be determined dynamically depending upon the current state, past state, and/or predicted state of the balloon network.
- an exemplary balloon network 100 may apply a mesh protocol to update the state of the network as the topology of the network changes.
- balloon network 100 may employ and/or adapt various techniques that are employed in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Other examples are possible as well.
- MANETs mobile ad hoc networks
- a balloon network 100 may be configured as a transparent mesh network. More specifically, in a transparent balloon network, the balloons may include components for physical switching that is entirely optical, without any electrical involved in physical routing of optical signals. Thus, in a transparent configuration with optical switching, signals travel through a multi-hop lightpath that is entirely optical.
- the balloon network 100 may implement a free-space optical mesh network that is opaque.
- some or all balloons 102 A to 102 F may implement optical-electrical-optical (OEO) switching.
- some or all balloons may include optical cross-connects (OXCs) for OEO conversion of optical signals.
- OEO optical-electrical-optical
- Other opaque configurations are also possible.
- balloons in an exemplary balloon network 100 may implement wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which may help to increase link capacity.
- WDM wavelength division multiplexing
- physical lightpaths through the balloon network may be subject to the “wavelength continuity constraint.” More specifically, because the switching in a transparent network is entirely optical, it may be necessary to assign the same wavelength for all optical links on a given lightpath.
- An opaque configuration may avoid the wavelength continuity constraint.
- balloons in an opaque balloon network may include the OEO switching systems operable for wavelength conversion. As a result, balloons can convert the wavelength of an optical signal at each hop along a lightpath.
- exemplary balloons may apply or consider shortest-path routing techniques such as Dijkstra's algorithm and k-shortest path, and/or edge and node-diverse or disjoint routing such as Suurballe's algorithm, among others. Additionally or alternatively, techniques for improving QoS may be employed when determining a lightpath. Other techniques are also possible.
- a balloon network 100 may implement station-keeping functions to help provide a desired network topology. For example, station-keeping may involve each balloon 102 A to 102 F maintaining and/or moving into a certain position relative to one or more other balloons in the network (and possibly in a certain position relative to the ground). As part of this process, each balloon 102 A to 102 F may implement station-keeping functions to determine its desired positioning within the desired topology, and if necessary, to determine how to move to the desired position.
- the desired topology may vary depending upon the particular implementation.
- balloons may implement station-keeping to provide a substantially uniform topology.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may implement station-keeping functions to position itself at substantially the same distance (or within a certain range of distances) from adjacent balloons in the balloon network 100 .
- a balloon network 100 may have a non-uniform topology.
- exemplary embodiments may involve topologies where balloons area distributed more or less densely in certain areas, for various reasons.
- balloons may be clustered more densely over urban areas.
- the distribution of balloons may be denser over land than over large bodies of water.
- Many other examples of non-uniform topologies are possible.
- the topology of an exemplary balloon network may be dynamic and adaptable.
- station-keeping functionality of exemplary balloons may allow the balloons to adjust their respective positioning in accordance with a change in the desired topology of the network. For example, one or more balloons could move to new positions to increase or decrease the density of balloons in a given area.
- balloons may be in continuous or nearly continuous motion, and station-keeping may involve moving balloons so as to try to meet certain requirements for e.g., coverage in various areas.
- a balloon network 100 may employ an energy function to determine if and/or how balloons should move to provide a desired topology.
- the state of a given balloon and the states of some or all nearby balloons may be input to an energy function.
- the energy function may apply the current states of the given balloon and the nearby balloons to a desired network state (e.g., a state corresponding to the desired topology).
- a vector indicating a desired movement of the given balloon may then be determined by determining the gradient of the energy function.
- the given balloon may then determine appropriate actions to take in order to effectuate the desired movement. For example, a balloon may determine an altitude adjustment or adjustments such that winds will move the balloon in the desired manner.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a balloon-network control system, according to an exemplary embodiment.
- FIG. 2 shows a distributed control system, which includes a central control system 200 and a number of regional control-systems 202 A to 202 B.
- Such a control system may be configured to coordinate certain functionality for balloon network 204 , and as such, may be configured to control and/or coordinate certain functions for balloons 206 A to 206 I.
- central control system 200 may be configured to communicate with balloons 206 A to 206 I via number of regional control systems 202 A to 202 C.
- These regional control systems 202 A to 202 C may be configured to receive communications and/or aggregate data from balloons in the respective geographic areas that they cover, and to relay the communications and/or data to central control system 200 .
- regional control systems 202 A to 202 C may be configured to route communications from central control system 200 to the balloons in their respective geographic areas. For instance, as shown in FIG.
- regional control system 202 A may relay communications and/or data between balloons 206 A to 206 C and central control system 200

- the central control system 200 may coordinate certain mesh-networking functions for balloon network 204 .
- balloons 206 A to 206 I may send the central control system 200 certain state information, which the central control system 200 may utilize to determine the state of balloon network 204 .
- the state information from a given balloon may include location data, optical-link information (e.g., the identity of other balloons with which the balloon has established an optical link, the bandwidth of the link, wavelength usage and/or availability on a link, etc.), wind data collected by the balloon, and/or other types of information.
- the central control system 200 may aggregate state information from some or all the balloons 206 A to 206 I in order to determine an overall state of the network.
- the overall state of the network may then be used to coordinate and/or facilitate certain mesh-networking functions such as determining lightpaths for connections.
- the central control system 200 may determine a current topology based on the aggregate state information from some or all the balloons 206 A to 206 I.
- the topology may provide a picture of the current optical links that are available in balloon network and/or the wavelength availability on the links. This topology may then be sent to some or all of the balloons so that a routing technique may be employed to select appropriate lightpaths (and possibly backup lightpaths) for communications through the balloon network 204 .
- the central control system 200 may also coordinate certain station-keeping functions for balloon network 204 .
- the central control system 200 may input state information that is received from balloons 206 A to 206 I to an energy function, which may effectively compare the current topology of the network to a desired topology, and provide a vector indicating a direction of movement (if any) for each balloon, such that the balloons can move towards the desired topology.

- control functions may be provided by a single, centralized, control system, which communicates directly with one or more downlink balloons.
- control and coordination of a balloon network may be shared between a ground-based control system and a balloon network to varying degrees, depending upon the implementation. In fact, in some embodiments, there may be no ground-based control system. In such an embodiment, all network control and coordination functions may be implemented by the balloon network itself. For example, certain balloons may be configured to provide the same or similar functions as central control system 200 and/or regional control systems 202 A to 202 C. Other examples are also possible.
- control and/or coordination of a balloon network may be de-centralized.

This functionality may be utilized anytime the payload needs to be accessed on the ground, such as when it is time to remove balloon 300 from a balloon network, when maintenance is due on systems within payload 306 , and/or when power supply 326 needs to be recharged or replaced.
- a balloon may not include a cut-down system.
- the navigation system may be operable to navigate the balloon to a landing location, in the event the balloon needs to be removed from the network and/or accessed on the ground.
- a balloon may be self-sustaining, such that it theoretically does not need to be accessed on the ground.
- a balloon in an example network may be configured to change its horizontal position by adjusting its vertical position (i.e., altitude). For example, by adjusting its altitude, a balloon may be able to find winds that will carry the balloon horizontally (e.g., latitudinally and/or longitudinally) to a desired horizontal location.
- Wind speed and/or direction may vary with altitude, and since current wind velocities as well as weather forecasts are available, in principle, a balloon may be directed to a location by identifying an altitude at which a wind direction takes a balloon to along a desired trajectory.
- a balloon without other forms of propulsion may be constrained to follow the wind and there may not be a single altitude with winds taking the balloon along the desired trajectory.
- movement of the balloons should occur from one location above the surface of the Earth to another in a predictable manner.
- a high-altitude-balloon network may include super-node balloons, which communicate with one another via optical links, as well as sub-node balloons, which communicate with super-node balloons via RF links.
- the optical links between super-node balloons have more bandwidth than the RF links between super-node and sub-node balloons.

- Each of the sub-node balloons 420 may include a radio-frequency (RF) communication system that is operable for packet-data communication over one or more RF air interfaces. Accordingly, each super-node balloon 410 A to 410 C may include an RF communication system that is operable to route packet data to one or more nearby sub-node balloons 420 . When a sub-node 420 receives packet data from a super-node 410 , the sub-node 420 may use its RF communication system to route the packet data to a ground-based station 430 via an RF air interface.
- RF radio-frequency
- the super-nodes 410 A to 410 C may be configured for both longer-range optical communication with other super-nodes and shorter-range RF communications with nearby sub-nodes 420 .

- a larger number of balloons may then be configured as sub-nodes, which may communicate with ground-based Internet nodes at speeds on the order of approximately 10 MB/sec. Configured as such, the sub-nodes 420 may be configured to connect the super-nodes 410 to other networks and/or to client devices.
- the super-nodes 410 A to 410 C may function as a core network, while the sub-nodes 420 function as one or more access networks to the core network.
- some or all of the sub-nodes 420 may also function as gateways to the balloon network 400 .
- some or all of ground-based stations 430 may function as gateways to balloon network 400 .
- Various types of network-based interfaces may be provided to provide users with information related to a balloon network and/or to allow users to interact with a balloon network.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B show example screens 500 and 550 from a network-based interface for a balloon network.
- screens 500 and 550 provide interfaces via which a user can search for and/or view information related to the services provided by and/or status of a balloon network.
- a user may enter a location in a search bar 502 .
- the location may be, for example, an address, a zip code, a city, or a landmark, or may take another form.
- a server may search for information related to a balloon network at the entered location, and display some or all of the information located in the search.
- the user has entered the zip code “94043” in the search bar 502 .
- information related to the status of the balloon network and/or to services provided by the balloon network and/or at or near the “94043” zip code may be displayed in screen 500 (or in one or more different screens that are displayed after the search is initiated).
- the bandwidth that is available from the balloon network may vary from one location to another. Further, the available bandwidth at a particular location may vary over time. This may be particularly so in an example balloon network, where balloons can move dynamically throughout the network's coverage area. Dynamic movement of balloons may result in greater bandwidth fluctuations than occur in a network with fixed nodes, where the total bandwidth fluctuations at a given location result primarily from variations in usage. Accordingly, a web interface may include features to inform users of available bandwidth in different locations. (Note that herein, the term “bandwidth” should be understood to refer to uplink bandwidth, downlink bandwidth, or both, as appropriate.)
- an interface such as screen 500 may provide access to location- or area-specific bandwidth information.
- the search results include bandwidth information 504 .
- the bandwidth information 504 includes current bandwidth information such as: (a) the current average connection speeds 506 on the uplink and downlink, (b) the current total bandwidth 508 on the uplink and downlink (which may be the theoretical throughput of all balloons that are serving a location), and (c) current bandwidth in use 510 (e.g., the total bandwidth that is currently being used and/or currently reserved for devices that are connected at or near the location.

- bandwidth information 504 includes expected bandwidth information.
- a future time may be specified in box 519 , either by the server or via user input.
- the screen 500 may then display expected bandwidth information for the time indicated in box 519 , such as: (a) expected per-device connection speeds 518 on the uplink and downlink at the indicated time, (b) the expected total bandwidth 520 on the uplink and downlink at the indicated time (which may be based on balloons that are expected to be serving the location at the indicated time), and (c) expected bandwidth in use 522 at the indicated time.
- the expected bandwidth in use 522 may be determined based on historical bandwidth in use at, e.g., the same time of day, the same day of the week, and/or during the same type of event, among other possible factors.
- screen 500 includes a “bandwidth bar” graphic 524 .
- the bandwidth bar 524 may indicate the percentage of balloon-network resources that are currently in use at a location. For instance, in the illustrated search example, bandwidth bar 524 shows that 54% of the total bandwidth provided by balloons at the zip code “94043” is currently in use and/or is currently reserved for existing connections to the balloon network.
- screen 500 includes an hourly forecast feature 526 , which indicates expected or predicted bandwidth information in the 94043 zip code at hourly intervals.
- an interface for a balloon network may include a feature that provides expected or predicted bandwidth information over time by indicating expected bandwidth information at discrete intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, etc.).
- changes in expected bandwidth over time may be represented as a chronological list showing the expected bandwidth information at the particular location at discrete intervals, in the same or similar manner as hourly forecast feature 526 .
- changes in expected bandwidth over time could also be visually represented as a graph or histogram with time on one axis and the bandwidth level on the other axis.
- Other techniques for visually representing expected or predicted changes to bandwidth over time are also possible.
- an interface such as screen 500 may include information related to latency at various locations.
- an interface could indicate the one way and/or round-trip latency that is currently being experienced, that has historically been experienced, and/or that is expected at a future time, at a given location.
- screen 500 includes a feature 528 that indicates services that are available from the balloon network at the location indicated in the search bar 502 .
- Such services may include, for example, data connectivity (possibly for a number of wireless protocols), data backup services, and so on.
- an interface to a balloon network may include a search feature via which a user can search by location for information related to the particular balloons that are currently serving a location and/or that are expected to serve a location in the future.
- a search feature via which a user can search by location for information related to the particular balloons that are currently serving a location and/or that are expected to serve a location in the future.
- the search results include information related to the particular balloons that are currently serving the location.
- balloons A to C are currently providing service in the zip code “94043.”
- the displayed search results 552 A to 552 C include one search result for each balloon A to C.
- balloon-network information on screens 500 and 550 are non-limiting examples of the information that may be returned when a user searches for balloon-network information for a particular location.
- search results may only include some of the information shown in screens 500 and/or 550 .
- search results could include other types of information in addition or in the alternative to the information included in screen 500 and/or 550 .
- a web interface to a balloon network may include an interactive coverage map, which provides information related to coverage by the balloon network in a geographic area displayed on the map.
- Such an interactive coverage map might display bandwidth information, and in such case may also be referred to as a bandwidth map.
- an interactive coverage map could also include other coverage-related information, in addition or in the alternative to bandwidth information.
- a bandwidth map may be updated from time-to-time based on available bandwidth information.
- Bandwidth information may change based on a change in position of one or more balloons in the balloon network or the number of client devices operating in the coverage area, among other possibilities.
- time-to-time bandwidth map updates may refer to periodic updates of the bandwidth map, continuous (e.g., real-time) updates of the bandwidth map, or updates of the bandwidth map on an as-need basis, among other possibilities.
- the bandwidth map may be updated in real-time based on currently-available bandwidth information for the balloon network. For example, bandwidth information for a given location or area may be updated in real-time based on current connection speeds being experienced by client devices at the given location or area (as reported by the client devices and/or determined by the balloons serving the area), and/or based on which balloon or balloons are currently serving the location or area.
- FIGS. 6A and 6B show another screen 600 from a network-based interface, according to an example embodiment.
- screen 600 includes a map 602 , over which a number of bandwidth regions 604 A, 604 B, 606 A, 606 B, 608 , 610 , and 612 , are visually identified.
- Each bandwidth region 604 A-B, 606 A-B, 608 , 610 , and 612 may visually indicate a bandwidth level or a bandwidth range in the corresponding area of the map 602 .
- different colors and/or different patterns may be displayed to indicate different bandwidth levels in different areas on map 602 .
- the crosshatch pattern shown in regions 604 A and 604 B may indicate a first bandwidth level or a first bandwidth range in the areas of map 602 enclosed by regions 604 A and 604 B
- the horizontal-line pattern in regions 606 A and 606 B may indicate a second bandwidth level or a second bandwidth range in the areas of map 602 enclosed by regions 606 A and 606 B
- the vertical-line pattern in region 608 may indicate a third bandwidth level or a third bandwidth range in the area of map 602 enclosed by region 608
- the dot pattern in region 610 may indicate a fourth bandwidth level or a fourth bandwidth range in the area of map 602 enclosed by region 610
- the dot pattern in region 612 which is more sparse than the dot pattern in region 610 , may indicate a fifth bandwidth level or a fifth bandwidth range
- different colors could be used to indicate different amounts of bandwidth. For example, if four different bandwidth ranges are defined, then blue, red, yellow, and green could be used to represent the four bandwidth ranges.
- the interface may include a feature to “filter” the colors/patterns displayed based on a selected bandwidth level or range.
- user-input may be received (e.g., via search bar 502 ) requesting to display only colors/patterns indicating a particular bandwidth level or range. Other examples are also possible.
- the bandwidth levels or ranges that are indicated in the bandwidth map, such as screen 600 may be defined in various ways.
- displaying a particular color and/or pattern over a region of map 602 may indicate that the current per-client-device bandwidth (e.g., the current uplink and/or downlink data speeds) for client devices operating in the region is between a lower and an upper per-client-device bandwidth (i.e., a bandwidth range); or, in the case of the color or pattern representing the highest bandwidth range, above a particular lower per-client-device bandwidth (with no upper bound).
- the current per-client-device bandwidth may be represented as a bandwidth level.
- the current per-client-device bandwidth may be, for instance, an average current per-client-device bandwidth for client devices operating in the region at a specific point in time. For example, at a specific point in time (e.g., a current time of 2:13 PM), three client devices may be operating in a region at downlink speeds of 0.5 Mb/s, 1 Mb/s, and 1.5 Mb/s, respectively.
- displaying a particular color and/or pattern over the corresponding region of the map may indicate an average current per-client device bandwidth level of 1 Mb/s at 2:13 PM.
- the map may also display the time corresponding to the indicated average current per-client device bandwidth level.
- the bandwidth map may be animated over time to correspond to changes in bandwidth information.
- screen 600 may be updated from time-to-time (e.g., updated continuously or periodically), to reflect current per-client-device bandwidth (e.g., as a bandwidth range or as a bandwidth level). More specifically, screen 600 may be updated based on, e.g., real-time data indicating current uplink and/or downlink bandwidth being provided via balloon-network connections to client devices that are located in the area represented in map 602 .
- displaying a particular color and/or pattern over a region of map 602 may indicate that the average per-client-device bandwidth in the region, over a predetermined period of time, is between a lower and an upper bound (i.e., a bandwidth range); or, in the case of the color or pattern representing the highest bandwidth range, above a particular lower bound (with no upper bound).
- a lower and an upper bound i.e., a bandwidth range
- displaying a particular color and/or pattern over a region of map 602 may indicate the average per-client-device bandwidth in the region, over a predetermined period of time, as a bandwidth level.
- the bandwidth level may correspond to an average per-client-device bandwidth over the predetermined period of time. For example, between 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM, three client devices may be operating in a region. In this period of time, the three client devices may operate at downlink speeds of 1 Mb/s, 1.5 Mb/s, and 2 Mb/s, respectively (e.g., average downlink speed for each client device over the period of time). In this example, the average per-client-device bandwidth level between 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM is 1.5 Mb/s.
- screen 600 may be updated from time-to-time (e.g., updated continuously or periodically) in order to reflect average per-client-device bandwidth over a moving window of time (e.g., over the last ten minutes, hour, day, etc.).
- time-to-time e.g., updated continuously or periodically
- a moving window of time e.g., over the last ten minutes, hour, day, etc.
- Other example implementations may also be possible.
- a moving window of time over which the average bandwidth is measured may be selected in view of the dynamic movement of balloons throughout a coverage area of a balloon network. For example, available bandwidth may change more rapidly in a first area where balloons are moving faster with respect to the ground, than in a second area where balloons are moving slower with respect to the ground (as compared to the movement of balloons in the first area). Accordingly, the window of time over which bandwidth levels are averaged may be shorter for locations where balloon speeds relative to the ground are higher, in order to account for potentially-greater variations of available bandwidth in such locations.
- screen 600 might only display uplink or downlink bandwidth ranges at any given point in time.
- separate bandwidth ranges may be defined for the uplink and downlink.
- the particular ranges defined for the uplink may differ from those defined for the downlink.
- the downlink bandwidth ranges illustrated by different patterns include 100-300 kbps, 0.3-0.6 Mb/s, 0.6-1.0 Mb/s, 1.0-1.5 Mb/s, and over 1.5 Mb/s, and in FIG.
- the uplink bandwidth ranges illustrated by different patterns include 100-500 kbps, 0.5-1.0 Mb/s, 1.0-1.5 Mb/s, 1.5-2.0 Mb/s, and over 2.0 Mb/s.
- a user could toggle between uplink and downlink views on an interface such as screen 600 .
- the user may click an uplink/downlink toggle button 622 in screen 600 to switch between the uplink and downlink views shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B , respectively.
- the map 602 may display uplink information and downlink information simultaneously.
- screen 600 may further provide a mechanism for viewing bandwidth information at specific locations within a given bandwidth region. For example, if a user hovers an icon 628 over, clicks on, or otherwise identifies or selects a specific location 624 on map 602 , bandwidth information on the specific location 624 may be displayed. In the illustrated example as shown in FIG. 6B , a graphic is displayed indicating that the current per-client-device bandwidth is 1.21 Mb/s at location 624 . When a location on the map is selected, this may be processed in the same way as a search for the selected location via the search bar 502 .
- screen 600 may provide a mechanism for viewing bandwidth information at a selected area within a given bandwidth region. For example, if a user circles, draws, or otherwise identifies or selects an area on map 602 , bandwidth information for the selected area may be calculated and responsively displayed. Note that the user may draw (or identify in other ways) any shape on the screen 600 , for example, by clicking and dragging a cursor to define the selected area on the map 602 .
- screen 600 is described as providing information related to per-client-device bandwidth; e.g., information related to the uplink and/or downlink bandwidth that is currently, historically, and/or expected to be allocated to each individual client device in a given area. For instance, if a region of map 602 is a particular color or pattern, this may indicate to the viewer that the average uplink bandwidth provided to each client device in the region, as measured across all client devices or a sample set of client devices that are currently in the area, is within a certain range. However, a bandwidth map could indicate other measures of bandwidth, in addition or in the alternative to per-client-device uplink and/or downlink bandwidth.
- a bandwidth map could visually indicate different ranges of total bandwidth provided by a balloon network.
- a server may determine the total amount of uplink and/or the total amount of downlink bandwidth that is provided by the balloon network at a given location; e.g., by summing the bandwidth provided by all the balloons that serve the given location. For instance, if there are three balloons that are currently providing data service at a given location, and the total uplink bandwidth provided by each balloon is 1.0 Gbit/s, then the current total uplink bandwidth at the location may be determined to be 3.0 Gbit/s.
- the server may then repeat this calculation for number of locations throughout the coverage area of a balloon network, and to the extent necessary, interpolate between locations to determine regions on a map that fall within certain predefined total-bandwidth ranges.
- the bandwidth map may then display particular colors or patterns, which each correspond to a particular total-bandwidth range, to identify regions where the total bandwidth generally falls within the corresponding total-bandwidth ranges.
- a bandwidth map could visually indicate regions in a balloon network's coverage area having different in-use bandwidth levels; e.g., by displaying different colors and/or patterns to indicate regions in which in-use bandwidth levels falling within different in-use bandwidth ranges. For instance, a server may determine the total amount of in-use uplink and/or downlink bandwidth at each of a number of locations throughout a coverage area. A server may then group neighboring locations that have in-use bandwidth levels within the same bandwidth range, and use these groupings to define the bandwidth regions that are displayed on the map.
- a bandwidth map could visually indicate regions in a balloon network's coverage area having different unused bandwidth levels; e.g., by displaying different colors and/or patterns to indicate regions in which unused bandwidth levels falling within different unused bandwidth ranges.
- a server could determine the total amount of in-use uplink and/or downlink bandwidth, as well as the total bandwidth provided by the balloon network, at each of a number of locations throughout a coverage area. The server can then subtract the in-use bandwidth from the total bandwidth to determine the unused bandwidth at each location.
- a server may then group neighboring locations that have unused bandwidth levels within the same bandwidth range, and use these groupings to define the bandwidth regions that are displayed on the map.
- the interface may be configured to display bandwidth information corresponding to bandwidth levels or ranges expected (e.g., based on a determination or a prediction) to be allocated to client devices in a given area at a future point in time.
- bandwidth information corresponding to bandwidth levels or ranges expected (e.g., based on a determination or a prediction) to be allocated to client devices in a given area at a future point in time.
- Such future bandwidth information may be determined (or predicted) based on: historical bandwidth information, bandwidth service requests, event reporting, information received from client devices, and/or fleet-planning decisions for the balloon network, among others.
- historical bandwidth information may correspond to historical bandwidth data for a particular area at: (i) different times of the day, (ii) different times of a particular month, (iii) different times of the year, among others.
- Such historical bandwidth information may be stored, for example, on a remote server and may be accessible to the system upon request for use in determining and responsively displaying future bandwidth information.
- future bandwidth information may be determined based at least in part on the historical bandwidth information.
- information may be received from a client device related to an expected future position of the client device.
- Such information may include, for instance, calender event information associated with the client device and/or navigation information (e.g., GPS information) received from the client device, among other possibilities.
- the system may determine (or predict) whether a client device will be present in an area at a future point in time and responsively update the future bandwidth information.
- Other examples may also be possible.
- a system that supports an example interface may utilize various techniques in order to intelligently determine the boundaries of areas that fall within different bandwidth ranges. For example, bandwidth levels could be measured at a number of discrete locations (e.g., at a number of end-user devices that are connected to the balloon network or at a number of balloons). The system may then dynamically group the locations according to bandwidth ranges. In some implementations this may involve some interpolation of bandwidth levels between the levels measured at the discrete locations in order to define areas that fall within different bandwidth ranges. This process may then be repeated periodically or continuously in order to provide an up-to-date bandwidth map.
- bandwidth levels could be measured at a number of discrete locations (e.g., at a number of end-user devices that are connected to the balloon network or at a number of balloons).
- the system may then dynamically group the locations according to bandwidth ranges. In some implementations this may involve some interpolation of bandwidth levels between the levels measured at the discrete locations in order to define areas that fall within different bandwidth ranges. This process may then be
- the bandwidth ranges into which the discrete measurements are grouped could be dynamically determined based on the amount of variation in bandwidth that typically occurs in the area being shown on a bandwidth map. For example, there may be less variation in bandwidth in a smaller area (e.g., a city) than in a larger area (e.g., an entire country), and thus the bandwidth ranges into which the discrete bandwidth measurements are grouped may be adjusted to be more granular on a map showing a smaller area.
- the interface may include a feature to zoom in on a particular area of the map 602 or zoom out of a particular area of the map.
- the determined boundaries of areas that fall within different bandwidth ranges may be updated as user-input is received (e.g., by clicking on a + or ⁇ button) to zoom in or out on the map 602 .
- the system may determine boundaries corresponding to regions A, B, and C on the map 602 . Subsequently, user-input may be received from a viewer of the map 602 to zoom in on region A of the map 602 .
- the system may redetermine the boundaries of areas that fall within different bandwidth ranges and thereby display updated regions on the map 602 corresponding to the redetermined boundaries (e.g., as sub-regions of region A). Note that similar techniques may also be applied in the context of other changes to the map such as panning through the map, among others.
- a map interface may show variation of other performance measures throughout the coverage area of a balloon network in a similar way as the above examples show bandwidth variation.
- the other performance measures may include but are not limited to: latency data, throughput data, jitter data, and error data.
- a map interface could show geographic areas where the one way and/or round-trip latency falls within different latency ranges or levels. Further, a map could show current latency, historical latency, and/or latency levels that are expected in an area at a future time.
- map and “map interface” should be understood to include various types of graphical objects, images, and interfaces.
- a map could be a two-dimensional map; e.g., a map that includes a graphical projection of a spherical surface, such as the earth's surface, onto a flat surface, and/or that includes aerial photographs of the earth.
- a map could also be a 2.5D or 3D graphical object, which the user may be able to interact with.
- a map could be a spherical model of the earth that the user can rotate, zoom in and out on, and so on.
- a map may take on other forms as well, without departing from the scope of the invention.
- a map or map interface may include various interactive features. For example, a user may be able to interact with a map by zooming in and out and/or panning through the map. Further, a map could include layers, such as layers for radar imagery, storm patterns, cloud cover, animated balloon locations, bandwidth levels, network-usage levels, and/or traffic, among other possibilities. In some embodiments, a map interface may provide a feature that allows users to individually switch such layers on and off, so that the user has control over which layers are and are not displayed. A map may additionally or alternatively include other features, without departing from the scope of the invention.
- a web interface may include a map feature that shows the current locations of balloons, and possibly other information such as the expected trajectories for the balloons.
- FIGS. 7A to 7C shows a screen 700 from a network-based interface, according to an example embodiment.
- Screen 700 includes a map 702 , and a number of balloon icons 704 A to 704 Y that are displayed over the map.
- the locations of balloon icons 704 A to 704 Y on map 702 may indicate the current geographic locations of balloons in the area shown in map 702 .
- a web interface could include a feature for viewing expected balloon locations at a future time.
- screen 700 includes a time field 706 .
- a user might input a particular future time in time field 706 , and the map may responsively update such that balloon icons are displayed over map 702 at the expected locations of balloons in the area at the indicated future time.
- Other examples are also possible.
- a user may be able to select a given one of the balloon icons 704 A to 704 Y to bring up information related to the corresponding balloon and/or to access functionality related to the corresponding balloon.
- a user could select a given balloon icon 704 A to 704 Y to view information about the corresponding balloon, such as a balloon ID number, model number, balloon system information, balloon capabilities, etc.
- a user could select a given balloon icon 704 A to 704 Y to view data gathered by sensors on the balloon, such as temperature, wind speed, air pressure, speed, altitude, direction of travel, etc.
- the sensor data may be displayed for a single point in time or over a period time (e.g., as a graph). Further, in some embodiments, the displayed sensor data may be updated in real-time, based on a real-time data feed from the balloon.
- a user could click on a balloon icon to access a real-time feed from a camera on the balloon.
- FIG. 7B shows screen 700 after a balloon icon 704 C has been selected. More specifically, when balloon icon 704 is selected, a status box 710 may be displayed that includes information related to the corresponding balloon and/or based on sensor data from the balloon. In the illustrated example, box 710 includes an uplink bandwidth field 712 , a downlink bandwidth field 714 , and a trajectory field 716 indicating a direction and speed of the balloon.
- the map interface may display a current flight plan or a number of possible flight plans on the map (e.g., by displaying a line representing the path for each flight plan, with each line starting from the balloon's location on the map and extending along a path of travel).
- screen 700 includes a “Show Flight Plans” button 708 .
- Show Flight Plans button 708
- the screen 700 may be updated to show flight plans for the balloons in the area over a given period of time, as shown in FIG. 7C .
- a balloon-location map interface could also include some or all features of a bandwidth map as described above.
- a user view the bandwidth range for an area, and could select a particular balloon in the area to view more specific bandwidth information related to the balloon, such as the balloon's total bandwidth, in-use bandwidth, historically-available bandwidth, and/or forecasted total and/or available bandwidth.
- Such an interface might also allow a user to select a balloon icon on the map in order to access an interface feature for requesting service from the particular balloon, and possibly make or set up a payment for the requested service.
- temperature and wind data acquired by balloons in a balloon network could be used to update a stratospheric weather map in real-time.
- balloons could also provide such weather-related data to existing weather services for use in their corresponding web interfaces.
- a web interface may include features that allow users to make requests and/or purchase various types of services related to the balloon network. Such an interface feature might be accessible via a search interface such as that shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B , via a map interface such as that shown in FIGS. 6A-6B and/or FIGS. 7A-7C , or accessed in another away.
- a web interface may allow users to request a service for a particular location. Additionally, service could be requested immediately/as soon as possible, or requested for a future time. In some cases, the web interface may also include a feature to allow a user to specify the duration of time for using the requested service. Further, a particular quality of service may be requested by specifying desired performance in the form of, for example, a particular bandwidth level or a request for latency reduction, among others. Specifying the particular location, a requested time, the duration, and/or quality of service may allow the balloon network to carry out fleet-planning decisions accordingly.
- the interface may allow for requests in various ways. For example, a user could access a dedicated screen where they could enter the information needed to request service at a particular location (from any balloon or balloons that are available), and possibly make a payment for the requested bandwidth. Such an interface could be similar to interface 850 as further discussed below in association with FIG. 8B , without the features related specifically to event reporting, or could take on another form.
- FIG. 8A shows an interface 800 for requesting a service from a balloon network, according to an example embodiment.
- the user may have logged on to their account, indicated a type of service they desire (e.g., ground data service—high bandwidth), the location the service is desired (e.g., the 94043 zip code), and/or the time the service is desired (e.g., now or a future time).
- the interface may then display a cost for the requested service (e.g., $0.10 per minute), which the user can then elect to pay for by clicking a “request service” button.
- the cost for the requested service may be determined (or predicted) based on various factors such as, for example, expected resource availability at the specified time and location. Other examples are also possible.
- a user may specify a localized area (e.g., a user's home), a large local area (e.g., a park or a bike path), or a large non-local area (e.g., a highway over which a user is traveling on a road trip), among other possibilities.
- a localized area e.g., a user's home
- a large local area e.g., a park or a bike path
- a large non-local area e.g., a highway over which a user is traveling on a road trip
- interface 800 may include a feature to remember a user's service request (not shown).
- interface 800 may include a checkbox that a user can select to allow the system to store information associated with the request. Such stored information may be accessible by the user via interface 800 at a future time, thereby allowing the user make the same or a similar request in the future. Additionally, the information may be stored on a remote server and may be accessible via one or more client devices associated with a user-account.
- interface 800 may also include a feature to allow for requesting automatic initiation of a requested service based on various selected factors.
- a user's service request may indicate to the balloon network to automatically provide coverage to the user's mobile device at any time that the user (or more specifically, the user's mobile device) is determined to be present at a specified location. Such a determination can be made, for example, based on information received by the balloon network from the mobile device (e.g., GPS coordinates).
- a user's service request may indicate to the balloon network to automatically provide coverage to the user's mobile device at specified times (e.g., in addition to a specified location).
- the specified times may indicate specific times of the day, specific days of the week, or specific times of the year, among other possibilities. Note that a time may be specified without specifying a location, thereby allowing for automatic initiation of a requested service at specified times but independent of location (assuming sufficient resource availability at the location of the mobile device during the specified times).
- a user could click on a balloon icon on a map interface, such as those shown in FIGS. 7A to 7C , in order access an interface feature via which the user can submit information needed to request service from a particular balloon (e.g., a time, the location, desired bandwidth level or quality of service, etc.), and possibly make a payment for the requested service.
- information needed to request service from a particular balloon e.g., a time, the location, desired bandwidth level or quality of service, etc.
- a user could select a particular location on a map interface, such as on the bandwidth map interface shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B , in order access an interface feature via which the user can submit information needed to request service at or near the particular location. For example, using a mouse, a user could click on a location on a map to request service from the balloon network at or near the location.
- a map interface (e.g., a bandwidth map) may be configured to update based on a plurality of service requests. For instance, colors/patterns representing varying bandwidth levels or ranges in a geographic area may update from time-to-time as service requests are received requesting, for example, a desired bandwidth level. Requests for immediate service may result in instantaneous updates of the map (or updates within a predetermined time period). In contrast, requests for service at a future time may result in updates of the map at or around the specified time. Alternatively, requests for service at a future time may be reflected on the map when user-input is received to view, for example, future bandwidth information on the map.
- colors/patterns representing varying bandwidth levels or ranges in a geographic area may update from time-to-time as service requests are received requesting, for example, a desired bandwidth level.
- Requests for immediate service may result in instantaneous updates of the map (or updates within a predetermined time period).
- requests for service at a future time may result in
- the map interface may include features to allow a user to view an impact of a service request on the bandwidth information in the map prior to execution of the service request.
- the interface 800 shown in FIG. 8A may include a “preview bandwidth information” button (not shown), which may allow a user to access a map interface previewing the impact (e.g., based on the desired quality of service) of the service request at the requested location and time.
- the map interface may display colors/patterns indicating determined (or predicted) bandwidth levels or ranges at or near the location and time of the desired service request. Such a feature may allow a user viewing the interface to know if the balloon network has sufficient resources (at or near the specified location and at the specified time) prior to execution and payment for the service request.
- an interface may be provided via which a user could request that service be provided to a particular device or group of devices (e.g., a device or devices that are associated with the user's account with the balloon network).
- a particular device or group of devices e.g., a device or devices that are associated with the user's account with the balloon network.
- the request may be made generally, without specifying any particular location.
- the user may effectively be requesting that balloons move so that coverage follows the user (or more specifically, the user's mobile device) as it moves throughout a coverage area.
- a user may specify a starting point in the interface as the first city, a destination point as the second city, a start time for the road trip, and/or a specified route, among others. Subsequently, the user may specify, on the interface, a request for service over the whole (or part of the) specified route.
- balloons in the balloon network may move to provide coverage during the road trip by receiving location updates from a device (e.g., a device installed in the user's car, or a user's cell phone).
- the user may provide, in the interface, additional information related to the user's travel plans (e.g., estimated speed (mph), anticipated rest stops, etc.) such that balloons in the balloon network can move to provide coverage along the route using the additional information.
- the coverage area may be large enough to provide a buffer such that the user can, for example, get ahead or fall behind (i.e., based on the travel speed) by some amount without falling outside of the moving coverage area.
- the interface may provide features to allow the user to pay more for a larger buffer area. Other examples may also be possible.
- an interface may include one or more features for specifying a priority level for the request.
- the interface may include a checkbox that a user can select to indicate a particular priority level.
- the priority level could represent, for instance, an emergency or non-emergency priority. Accordingly, balloons near the specified area where the bandwidth is needed could provide services preferentially (or only) to those with specific ‘emergency’ priority-level access. ‘Emergency’ priority-level access could be provided to first-responders, fire-fighters, police, dispatchers, other emergency personnel, news organizations, witnesses, or survivors, etc.
- the priority level could be associated with various pricing levels (e.g., pay a higher rate for priority access to Internet bandwidth, etc.).
- a basic level of communication services e.g., limited download speeds, capped bandwidth, etc.
- a higher level of services could be provided.
- the higher level of services could represent access to, or privileges for, higher data rates, removal of data cap amounts, etc.
- Other types of priority levels are possible.
- the interface may include one or more feature for indicating/displaying current or future priority levels.
- a user may access a map interface, such as the map interfaces shown above in association with FIGS. 6A-6B and 7A-7C .
- the map interface may indicate current or future priority levels for various regions in the geographic area displayed on the map.
- the priority levels may be indicated based on, for example, colors/pattern on the map and/or a priority level rating in the corresponding region (e.g, “10” representing high priority and “1” representing low priority), among other possibilities.
- Such interface features may allow a user to see information relevant to priority levels of the balloon network at specified times and locations. Other examples may also be possible.
- a balloon-network interface may include a feature that allows users to report a location where an event is occurring, so that a balloon network may provide services related to the event or take the event into account in a fleet-planning process. Such an event-reporting feature may be evaluated by the balloon network as a request and/or a vote for services (e.g., bandwidth) in a time and location associated with the reported event.
- services e.g., bandwidth
- FIG. 8B illustrates an interface 850 for reporting an event, according to an example embodiment.
- a user may describe an event in an event field 802 , and indicate a location of the event in location field 804 .
- interface 850 may include a checkbox 806 that a user can select to allow location information (e.g., GPS coordinates) of the device on which they are viewing interface 850 to be used for purposes of locating the event.
- location information e.g., GPS coordinates
- an example interface 850 may include a checkbox 808 that a user can select to agree to terms and conditions associated with reporting an event via the interface 850 .
- a report event button 810 may be selected to submit the information provided in fields 802 and 804 .
- interface 850 may include features that allow the user to include media content associated with the event when the user reports the event.
- interface 850 includes: (a) a photo button 812 , which may be selected to bring up an interface feature via which a user can submit a photo of the event, and (b) a video button 814 , which may be selected to bring up an interface feature via which a user can submit a video of the event.
- a photo button 812 which may be selected to bring up an interface feature via which a user can submit a photo of the event
- a video button 814 which may be selected to bring up an interface feature via which a user can submit a video of the event.
- Other types of features that support user-provided media content are also possible.
- interface 850 may include features that allow the user to specify additional individuals with client devices that are (or will be) present at the reported event. Such a specification may be done by indicating, for example, user-accounts associated with the additional individuals' client devices. As such, a user indicating the additional individuals may allow the control system to adjust the fleet-planning process based on the number of client devices expected at the reported event.
- a network control system may then aggregate the information received from a number of users via an interface 850 to, e.g., determine a location where a breaking event is occurring. For instance, when the control system determines that there are more than a threshold number of event reports at or near a particular location, the control system may interpret this as an indication that there may be an important event (e.g., a breaking news story) occurring at the particular location.
- an important event e.g., a breaking news story
- the control system may adjust its fleet plan for the balloon network in an effort to send resources to the location where the event is believed to be occurring. For example, the control system could make efforts to increase the number of balloons at or near the location in order to increase the bandwidth available at the location. More generally, in a balloon network with different types of balloons (e.g., a heterogeneous network), the control system may adjust its fleet planning process to adjust the mixture of different types of balloons, and/or the number of a particular type of balloons, in an effort to provide appropriate resources and/or functionality in a particular location. Other examples are also possible.
- a balloon network with different types of balloons e.g., a heterogeneous network
- interface 850 is designed for a “breaking” event (e.g., an event that is currently happening)
- a similar interface may be used to allow users to indicate future events.
- features may be added that allow a user to indicate timing information related to when the event is scheduled or is expected to occur (e.g., a timeframe, a start time, and/or an end time).
- the locations of reported events may be displayed on a map, such as the bandwidth map discussed above in association with FIGS. 6A and 6B .
- a bandwidth map may display locations of reported events overlaying the colors/patterns indicating varying bandwidth levels or ranges in the geographic area displayed on the map.
- An indication of a reported event location may be in the form of, for example, a dot or a pin displayed at the appropriate location on the map.
- Such an implementation may allow a user viewing the map to associate varying bandwidth levels or ranges with the locations of reported events.
- any information related to the reported event may be accessible via the map by, for example, receiving user-input selecting the event location specified on the map (e.g., by clicking on or hovering a cursor over the location on the map).
- the system may be configured to receive an indication that the reported event is a private event. In this case, location of the private event (as well as other information related to the event) may not be displayed on the map or accessible via the interface to users not associated with the private event.
- a map indicating reported event locations may alternatively display other performance measures as discussed above (e.g., latency).
- a balloon-network interface could also facilitate group-based control of a balloon network by providing voting features.
- users could vote on respective areas where the users would like certain services to be provided and/or where enhanced service is desired (e.g., increased bandwidth and/or reduced latency).
- a voting interface could be provided for real-time (e.g., current) service and/or future service. Based on the distribution of the votes received via such a web-based voting interface, a fleet planner could determine the relative demand for a service in different areas and incorporate the demand in different areas into fleet-planning decisions for the balloons (e.g., in an effort to move more balloons to an area where a service is in higher demand).
- votes may be received in various ways.
- the interface may include a polling feature to allow users to vote on, for example, one of several regions in a geographic area where users would like certain services to be provided. Additionally or alternatively, the polling feature may allow users to vote on, for example, one of several bandwidth levels to be provided in a specific region. Polls may be initiated by users or may be automatically initiated by the balloon network to receive additional information for fleet-planning decisions. Further, such polls may be accessible, for example, to client devices operating in the coverage area relevant to the initiated polls.
- votes may be received via a map interface, such as the bandwidth maps discussed above in association with FIGS. 6A and 6B .
- the map interface may allow users to select particular locations or region on the map where users would like certain services to be provided.
- the map interface may display a vote count for one or more regions (e.g., overlaying bandwidth information) on the map indicating, for example, a number of votes for a service in the region over a predetermined period of time (e.g., over the last two hours). Other examples may also be possible.
- a web interface may facilitate an auction process for bidding on, e.g., bandwidth, and/or other services provided by the balloon network. Note that these may also be implemented for other services provided by the network.
- An auction interface could be provided to allow users to bid on service in real-time (e.g., to bid on immediate service) and/or to bid on future service.
- auctions may be initiated by a user or may be automatically initiated by the balloon network to receive additional information for fleet-planning decisions and for determining service costs.
- a fleet planner for the balloon network could adjust a fleet-planning process in an effort to provide the services that are purchased via such an auction interface.
- an auction interface may be provided in the form of a group auction.
- users in different regions may specify a payment amount for a service (e.g., the average amount among all users in a region) and the balloon network may responsively allocate services to different regions based on, for example, the average payment amount in each region.
- a payment amount for a service e.g., the average amount among all users in a region
- the balloon network may responsively allocate services to different regions based on, for example, the average payment amount in each region.
- Such allocation of services may be in the form of increased probability/priority level for regions with a higher average payment amount. Other examples may also be possible.
- a web interface may include features that allow a user to allocate a portion of their reserved bandwidth for sharing.
- the interface may allow the user to specify, for example: (a) a time when they wish to make their bandwidth available, (b) an amount of bandwidth being offered (uplink and/or downlink), (c) pricing parameters for the bandwidth, (d) constraints on the content or communications for which the bandwidth can be used, and/or (e) qualifications that must be or preferably are met by the eventual purchaser of the bandwidth.
- the bandwidth may be offered to the general public, to a public group, to a private group, or to a specific individual.
- a web interface may include features via which potential buyers can view and/or search for shared bandwidth being offered by other users.
- Examples of such interfaces include: (a) an auction interface for a location-based auction process in which users to bid on shared bandwidth that currently available or available in the future near their current location or near a location specified by the user, (b) a map interface, where users can see the locations of nearby devices that are sharing bandwidth, and/or (c) a location-based search interface for browsing shared-bandwidth that is available at or near a user's location (e.g., an interface that lists nearby bandwidth shares that are available).
- users may create users-accounts to facilitate offering/selling and/or acquiring/purchasing shared bandwidth. Accordingly, the web interface may also allow users to access and/or edit their account information.
- a balloon's payload may be brought down to the ground, such as a servicing, recovering hardware and/or data from the balloon, and/or an emergency removal from the balloon network. While some control over a balloon's descent may be possible, accuracy in predicting a landing location may be variable. Further, there may be situations where a balloon is brought down unexpectedly, so that deployment of a recovery vehicle and/or personnel may be difficult. Accordingly, balloon-retrieval work may be crowd-sourced via the web interface.
- a web interface may provide access to information about when and where balloons are expected to be brought down. For example, a user could access a screen where they are shown a list of balloons that are expected to land near the user's current location, and/or where the user can perform a location-based search for balloons that are expected to land near a user-specified location.
- the list of recoverable balloons may be displayed in a typical search-result layout where users can, e.g., click-through for more information and/or functionality related to recovery of a particular balloon.
- An example of such an interface is shown in FIG. 9A .
- a user could select a balloon or balloons (e.g., by clicking on and/or hovering over listing for the balloon) to learn information and/or access functionality relevant to recovering the balloon.
- a user could view or access: (a) geographic coordinates of an expected landing location or an actual geographic location where the balloon has landed; (b) a standard error from an estimated landing location (e.g., a one-standard-deviation radius around the expected landing location, which might be displayed on the map when the icon is selected); (c) information related to the particular balloon being brought down; (d) a timing estimate for landing, (e) a feature via which the user can sign up for automatic updates as the balloon descends; (f) reward information for recovery of the balloon; and (g) instructions for returning a balloon and receiving a reward.
- a map interface may display icons at ground locations where balloons are expected to land.
- FIG. 9B provides an example of such an interface. Specifically, as shown in FIG. 9B , landing locations 952 A to 952 C for a number of balloons may be shown on a map interface 950 .
- the map interface 950 may also show an estimated date and/or time that a balloon is expected to land at each expected landing location 952 A to 952 C, and possibly information about the particular balloon that is expected to land at or near each expected landing location 952 A to 952 C. Further, a user could then select a given landing location 952 A to 952 C (e.g., by clicking on and/or hovering over the respect “x” icon) to learn information and/or access functionality relevant to recovering a balloon at the given landing location.
- a given landing location 952 A to 952 C e.g., by clicking on and/or hovering over the respect “x” icon
- Various types of rewards may be offered, such as monetary payment, goods, credit for services, points, P2P currency, etc.
- an interface screen may also be provided via which a user can redeem a reward, show proof of recovery and return, etc.
- a unique reward ID may be physically printed on each balloon (which, theoretically, can only be obtained when a user is in physical possession of the balloon). Accordingly, a web interface may be provided to enter the reward ID from a recovered balloon and request the reward. A server may cross-check the reward ID to make sure that the balloon has been returned to the balloon-network operator (e.g., at a designated drop-off location), and if it has been returned, credit the user's account with the reward or otherwise provide the reward to the user.
- the balloon-network operator e.g., at a designated drop-off location
- a balloon-recovery interface may simply provide information to facilitate recovery, without pre-assigning recovery to any specific user (e.g., a “free-for-all” recovery system).
- This arrangement essentially makes balloon-recovery an open competition, which could give rise to “balloon hunters” that try to be the first to locate and arrive at landing sites.
- recovery duties for a particular balloon may be pre-assigned to only one user.
- a balloon-recovery interface may further allow a user to request that recovery of specific balloons be pre-assigned to them.
- a reward for the return of a balloon may only be collected by the user to which recovery was pre-assigned.
- recovery of a specific balloon may be pre-assigned to a capped number of users (e.g., up to three users may be pre-assigned to recover one balloon). This may be desirable as competition incentivizes quicker recovery of the balloon than if recovery is pre-assigned to only one user, but too much competition (e.g., a free-for-all) may deter users from participating due to a low perceived probability of being the first to reach landing sites.
- the balloon-recovery interface might allow a user to indicate their availability to recover balloons.
- the user could provide times when and/or locations where the user is available to recover balloons.
- the user could indicate their generally availability to collect any balloon that lands in the area during a given time period, or could indicate their availability to recover a specific balloon.
- a control system for the balloon network could take user-availability for recovery into account when determining when and where balloons should be brought down.
- an auction interface might allow user's to bid to have balloon recovery work assigned to them.
- an auction process may assign recovery to the user that offers to recover a balloon at the lowest price.
- assignment of recovery duties may take other criteria into account, in addition or in the alternative to the amount of the reward. For example, assignment of recovery duties may be based at least in part on a user's recovery history (e.g., success rate, average time between landing and return, etc.). Other factors may also be considered.
- a user could opt to install a stand-alone application, or run a web application, for balloon-recovery notification. Further, the user could give such an application permission to access and use their current location. Such an application may then run in the background and send notifications to the user (e.g., e-mails, text messages, or push notifications) when balloons are scheduled to land within some specified period of time within some specified distance from the user's current location.
- notifications e.g., e-mails, text messages, or push notifications
- an interface may be provided that allows the user to manually request that a balloon be removed from the balloon network and/or brought down to the ground.
- an example web interface may provide a screen where a government official can log in, and possibly provide further information for purposes of authenticating the official. Once the government official is authenticated, an interface may be provided that allows the government official to identify a balloon to bring down to the ground, and/or to indicate a location where a balloon should be brought down (e.g., a landing location).
- a properly-authenticated government user could be provided with a map that shows balloons that are located in a geographic area where the government user has authority (e.g., a country or state).
- a map that shows balloons that are located in a geographic area where the government user has authority (e.g., a country or state).
- Such an interface may be the same or similar in appearance to the map interface shown in FIGS. 7A to 7C , or could take on a different form.
- the user could then select a balloon that is shown on the map (e.g., by clicking on a balloon icon) to bring the balloon down for inspection.
- Other examples are also possible.
- an interface may be provided that allows the user to request control of and/or to control sensors and systems on balloons for functions that are unrelated to the general operation of the balloon network.
- a service provider could provide services where users could pay for the use of balloons, to the extent it does not interfere with a fleet-planning process for the balloon network, to collect data and conduct experiments of the users' own devise. For example, users could pay for acquisition and/or access to high-bandwidth sensor data from balloons' sensors, which may be analyzed and used for various purposes.
- a web interface may allow users to upload experiments or applications that run on balloons in a balloon network and/or on a control system for a balloon network.
- a balloon-network web interface may include features that allow a user to purchase naming rights for a balloon.
- the naming rights may be purchased on a temporary or permanent basis.
- there may be interface features that allow a user to follow and/or share information about the balloon or balloons they have named.
- Other balloon-naming features and functions are also possible.
- a server systems that provides or support a balloon-network interface may implement some form of differential access control.
- users may be required to log in to access balloon-network interfaces, and the information and/or features that are accessible via such interfaces may vary between different users. For example, there may be certain information and/or features that are only accessible to certain government officials who have been authenticated in some way by the server system. Other examples are also possible.
- differential access control to information and/or features of a web interface could involve varying the timing with which different users can access different information. For example, some users may only be provided with certain data after a certain amount of time has passed since the balloon network acquired the data. However, other users, who may have special privileges based on some form of authentication, may be provided with earlier access to the data via a web interface.
- a server system supporting a web interface for a balloon network may also implement other types of differential access control, without departing from the scope of the invention.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features do or do not collect such user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location). Further, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether and/or how such user information can be used to, e.g., send content and/or provides services that may be more relevant to the user.
- programs or features e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether and/or how such user information can be used to, e.g., send content and/or provides services that may be more relevant to the user.
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- a client device such as a tablet, mobile phone, or personal computer
- the data may be formatted and/or processed such that the data may be linked to the client device, but not the user of the client device.
- the data that is sent to a server by a given client device may be identified by an identifying code, such as a cryptographically strong hash code, which may be referred to as a “client ID.”
- client IDs may not be associated with any user or user-account, and may simply indicate that data associated with the same client ID was provided by the same client device.
- each block and/or communication may represent a processing of information and/or a transmission of information in accordance with example embodiments.
- Alternative embodiments are included within the scope of these example embodiments.
- functions described as blocks, transmissions, communications, requests, responses, and/or messages may be executed out of order from that shown or discussed, including substantially concurrent or in reverse order, depending on the functionality involved.
- more or fewer blocks and/or functions may be used with any of the ladder diagrams, scenarios, and flow charts discussed herein, and these ladder diagrams, scenarios, and flow charts may be combined with one another, in part or in whole.
