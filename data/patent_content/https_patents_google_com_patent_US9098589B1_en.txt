Definitions
- This specification relates to annotating electronic resources with geographic information.
- Electronic resources can be associated with certain locations.
- the strength of the association can be quantified by assigning a score to an association between a resource and a location. For example, a web page for the New York Subway is likely more related to New York than it would be to Los Angeles. Additionally, that web page is typically more interesting to residents of and visitors to New York than it would be to people in Los Angeles, although it could be useful for someone in Los Angeles planning a trip to New York. Thus, the strength of association between the web page for the New York Subway and New York is stronger than with the location of Los Angeles.
- the degree to which a resource is associated with, or related to, a particular location can be conventionally determined and quantified by direct analysis of the resource. For example, for the web page for the New York Subway, the number of appearances of the word “New York” can be counted and used to determine a relatedness score for the page. Similarly, techniques that mine keywords from images and videos can be used to attempt to determine the relatedness of those resources to locations.
- a computer system creates a spatial index associating resources with geographic regions.
- Resources are associated with geographic regions based on requests for the resources.
- Weights can be assigned to the associations, e.g., so that geographic regions having a large number of requests for a resource are weighted higher than geographic regions having a small number of requests for a resource.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of generating a spatial index for a plurality of resources from a plurality of distinct publishers, including, for each resource of the plurality of resources: receiving a plurality of location data points for the resource, each location data point corresponding to one of a plurality of requests for the resource, and assigning each location data point for the resource to a spatial cluster of a plurality of spatial clusters, each spatial cluster corresponding to a particular geographic region; and storing the spatial index, wherein the spatial index is used to identify a plurality of address locations for resources assigned to a spatial cluster corresponding to a first geographic region in response to a request from a requester to identify resources associated with the first geographic region.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the requester is a local search service, and the local search service uses the address locations to boost one or more search results corresponding to one or more of the address locations for a user associated with the first geographic region.
- the requester is a user associated with the first geographic region.
- the requester is a service that builds a visual representation of the addressed resources overlaid on a map showing at least the first geographic region.
- the actions further include: in response to a request for regional information related to a particular resource in the plurality of resources, sending a plurality of identifiers of geographic regions corresponding to spatial clusters associated with the particular resource.
- the actions further include: for a particular resource in the plurality of resources, ranking the spatial clusters associated with the particular resource based on the number of location data points assigned to each spatial cluster.
- Ranking includes normalizing each spatial cluster according to a population associated with the geographic region corresponding to the spatial cluster.
- Assigning each location data point to a spatial cluster comprises using one of the following clustering techniques: k-means clustering, fuzzy c means clustering, and quality threshold clustering.
- a first location data point is annotated by a client system to a request for a resource.
- Receiving a plurality of location data points for the resource comprises receiving at least one location data point from a search system.
- the search system determined that a search result referencing the resource was selected by a user associated with the at least one location data point.
- Receiving a plurality of location data points for the resource comprises receiving at least one location data point from a publisher.
- a resource can be associated with one or more locations or regions.
- the resource itself does not have to be directly analyzed in order to determine associated locations; consequently, the associated locations and regions can be determined for all resources regardless of their nature (web page, image, video, and so on).
- Resources can be associated with various locations and regions. Each location associated with a resource can have a score indicating the strength of the association between the resource and the location. Given a certain region or location, associated resources can be identified and ranked.
- the associations can be used for various purposes, for example, improving local search results, building visual panoramic images of resources based on their associated locations, suggesting resources near a user, various analytics (e.g., determining interest in news articles), and so on.
- the associations can be used to create location-based news feeds. For example, news articles associated with a location can be distributed to users who have expressed interested in the location, for instance, using a Really Simple Syndication (RSS) news feed.
- RSS Really Simple Syndication
- a relative weight can be assigned that indicates the relative importance of one location versus another for the given resource.
- the relative weights of all the regions can be normalized so that they add up to a fixed value, e.g, one.
- an absolute weight can be assigned that allows two regions to be compared for the relative strengths of their association with the resource. This is useful, for example, for applications that use local ranking.

- FIG. 6B is a flow diagram of an example process for using a spatial index to determine geographic regions associated with a resource.
- FIG. 1 shows an example map 100 illustrating location data points associated with requests for a resource.
- each location data point represents a location of a user when the user sent a request for the resource.
- a circle e.g., circle 102
- the map illustrates two geographic regions, a left region 108 and a right region 110 .
- a location data point specifies a particular location (e.g., a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates) or a range of locations (e.g., a zip code including many city blocks).
- the size of a circle on the map 100 represents the size of the range of locations specified by the location data point indicated by the circle.
- the largest circle 102 a can indicate a location data point for a city
- the smallest circle 102 b can indicate a location data point of a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates
- the middle sized circle 102 c can represent a location data point of a particular zip code.
- the requests for the resource are associated with different size ranges of locations because different location information is available for each request.
- the request associated with the large circle 102 a in the left region 108 can be from a user on a desktop computer, where the only location information is based on the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the desktop computer.
- IP Internet Protocol
- the IP address is associated with a location identified as a city (or similar region).
- the request associated with the small circle 102 b can correspond to a user on a mobile device that provides Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates.
- the request associated with the middle sized circle 102 c can be from a user on a WiFi network that is accessible over several city blocks.
- GPS Global Positioning System
- Various techniques can be used to determine a location data point for a request, and some of these techniques (e.g., cellular triangulation) are discussed further with reference to FIG. 3 .
- clustering techniques are used to assign each location data point to a spatial cluster corresponding to a geographic region.
- the circles 102 a - c on the left are entirely within the region 108 on they left, so in typical clustering techniques, they are assigned to a spatial cluster for the left region 108 .
- the circles 104 a - c on the right are assigned to a spatial cluster the right region 110 .
- the circle 106 in the middle straddles region 108 and region 110 .
- Various clustering techniques can also be used to assign that circle 106 to a spatial cluster.
- the circle 106 is closer in the Y direction to circles 104 a - c , it would be assigned to a spatial cluster with those circles.
- circles are used in FIG. 1 to illustrate the areas associated with particular location data points, various types of ranges of locations (geographic regions) are possible and could be illustrated using squares, rectangles, irregular shapes, and the like.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example geographic annotation service 202 , publishers 204 and 206 , a search service 208 , and a user device 210 .
- the geographic annotation service 202 , publishers 204 and 206 , search service 208 , and user device 210 communicate using a network 212 , e.g., the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or a combination of them.
- a network 212 e.g., the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or a combination of them.
- a publisher is any web site that hosts and provides electronic access to one or more resources.
- a web site is generally a collection of one or more resources associated with a domain name.
- An example web site is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that contains text, graphic images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Resources can be HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, videos, feed sources, and the like.
- the resources may include content, e.g., text, pictures, and other media content.
- Resources may also include embedded information, e.g., meta (or metadata) information and hyperlinks and/or embedded instructions (e.g., JavaScript scripts).
- An Internet addressable resource can be identified by a uniform resource identifier (URI), which can be a universal resource locator (URL) that can be used as an Internet address (a network location) of the resource.
- URI uniform resource identifier
- URL universal resource locator
- a user device 210 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network 212 .
- Example user devices 210 include personal computers, laptop computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smart phones and personal digital assistants), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 212 .
- a user device 212 typically includes a user application, e.g., a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 212 .
- User devices 210 sends requests 214 for resources to the publishers 204 and 206 , and the publishers 204 and 206 return resources 216 in response to the requests 214 .
- the publishers 204 and 206 can use a request 214 to determine a location data point for the requested resource. Processes for a publisher to determine a location data point from a requested resource are described below with reference to FIG. 3 .
- the publishers 204 and 206 can submit location data points 222 to the geographic annotation service 202 .
- the search system 208 includes a search engine.
- the system includes a crawler that identifies resources by crawling the accessible resources of publishers 204 and 206 and indexing the resources.
- the user device 210 submits search requests 218 to the search system 208 .
- the search system 208 identifies resources that the search engine determines to be responsive to the query in the search request.
- the search system 208 generates search results 220 that identify the responsive resources, and returns the search results 220 to the user device 210 .
- a search result 220 identifies a resource that was determined to be responsive to the query and includes a resource locator for the resource (generally in a hyperlink).
- An example search result 220 for a web page can include a title, a snippet (or portion) of text extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- the search system 208 uses a search request 218 to determine a location data point for a resource, e.g., a resource identified as responsive to a query.
- a location data point for a resource e.g., a resource identified as responsive to a query.
- Example processes for a search system 208 to perform to determine a location data point for a resource are described below with reference to FIG. 4 .
- the search system 208 can submit location data points 224 to the geographic annotation service 202 .
- the geographic annotation service 202 receives location data points 222 and 224 for resources.
- the geographic annotation service 202 assigns each location data point for a resource to a spatial cluster corresponding to a geographic region. Assigning a location data point for a resource to a spatial cluster is discussed above with reference to FIG. 1 and further below with reference to FIG. 5 .
- the geographic annotation service 202 receives requests to identify resources associated with a particular geographic region. In response, the geographic annotation service 202 provides a group of address locations for resources assigned to the spatial cluster corresponding to the particular geographic region.
- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example process 300 for providing location information for a request for a resource to a geographic annotation service (e.g., geographic annotation service 202 ).
- a geographic annotation service e.g., geographic annotation service 202
- the process 300 will be described with respect to a system including one or more computing devices that performs the process 300 .
- the process 300 is performed by a server system associated with a publisher (e.g., one of publishers 204 and 206 ).
- the system receives 302 a request for a resource.
- the request is from a user device (e.g., user device 210 ) at a location.
- the request can be received from a mobile device in response to an action by a user, from a desktop computer, or other device though a particular application, e.g., through a web browser on the user device.
- the system determines 304 a location data point for the resource using the request.
- the location data point can be determined using various techniques. For example, if the user device is a mobile device, WiFi or Cell ID-based localization can be used to estimate the location of the user device.
- WiFi localization involves determining an identifier for a WiFi device (typically a wireless router) and using the identifier to determine a location for the WiFi device (e.g., by comparing the identifier to a list of known identifiers and locations).
- Cell ID-based localization involves identifying a cellular signal provider (typically an antenna tower) and determining the location of the signal provider. In those cases, the radio signals, a list of WiFi access points (APs), or a list of cellular base-stations can be included with the request for the resource.
- APs WiFi access points
- some mobile devices can directly provide location information from a GPS receiver within the mobile device.
- Some mobile devices include location information with the request, for example, using a web browser, plug-ins installed in the browser, or through web-page based functionalities, e.g., JavaScript components.
- the system determines the location data point by tracking user information. For example, if the request for the resource came from a user device with a known user (e.g., where the user has logged into a service), then the location data point can be based on information determined from information provided by the user (e.g., by analyzing the user's search history, or user information provided when signing up for a user service).
- the system determines a relevance measure for the request.
- the relevance measure is based on an amount of time that the user device reports the user spent viewing or interacting with the resource. For example, if the resource is a video, the relevance measure can be based on the amount of time the video was actually played on the user device, or on the fraction of the total time of the video that was streamed to the user device.
- the system determines the relevance measure so that individual user data is not identifiable to protect users' privacy.
- appropriate controls may be provided on a per-application and/or per-function basis.
- the relevance measure is based on explicit feedback from users.
- the publisher can provide a web page to a user device asking, “how helpful [or useful, relevant, or the like] was this for your city [or town, location, or the like]?”
- a user at the user device can provide a rating for the relevance of the resource to the user's location.
- the resource is sent to trusted human raters (e.g., paid persons or volunteers) who provide explicit feedback about the relevance of a resource to a geographic region. This quickly provides data for a newly published resource.
- the system sends 306 the location data point to a geographic annotation service (e.g., geographic annotation service 202 of FIG. 2 ). Where a relevance measure is determined, the system also provides the relevance measure to the geographic annotation service. In some other implementations, the request is sent to the geographic annotation service, and the geographic annotation service determines the location data point and optionally a relevance measure using the request (e.g., in a similar manner as described above).
- a geographic annotation service e.g., geographic annotation service 202 of FIG. 2
- the system also provides the relevance measure to the geographic annotation service.
- the request is sent to the geographic annotation service, and the geographic annotation service determines the location data point and optionally a relevance measure using the request (e.g., in a similar manner as described above).
- the system sends 308 the requested resource to the requestor.
- the system can send the requested resource to the user device for display on the user's browser.
- the requested resource can be downloaded to the user device, for example, as a file.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for providing location information for a request for a resource to a geographic annotation service (e.g., geographic annotation service 202 ).
- a geographic annotation service e.g., geographic annotation service 202
- the process 400 will be described with respect to a system including one or more computing devices that performs the process 400 .
- the process 400 is performed by a server associated with a search system (e.g., search system 208 ).
- the system receives 402 a search request.
- the search request is from a user device at a location.
- the system provides 404 search results are to the requesting user device (step 404 ).
- the search results can be provided to a browser application on the user device for display.
- the search results are obtained from a search engine, e.g., that is part of the search system.
- the system identifies 406 resources selected from the search results.
- the search results provided to the requesting user device include indirect references to the resources.
- a search result provided to the user device can include an initial URL that initially directs the user device to the search system. The appearance of the initial URL can be hidden.
- an example initial URL is http://www.searchsystem.com/redirect/www.example.com.
- the search result can still be presented on the user device as “www.example.com.”
- the search system determines that the resource referred to by that search result has been selected.
- the search system can then redirect the user device to the resource referred to by the search result, e.g., by providing a direct URL for the resource.
- the search system can send the user device the direct URL http://www.example.com.
- the system determines 408 a location data point for the search request.
- the system can determine the location data point using the techniques discussed with respect to step 304 of FIG. 3 .
- the system determines a relevance measure for the location data point.
- the relevance measure can be based on whether the selection of the search result was a “long click” or a “short click.”
- a click is a type of selection or interaction and can be, for example, a physical click, a gesture on a touch pad, a shake of a mobile device, and so on.
- the search service observes user behavior data including “click data”. Click data indicates how long a user interacts with a resource result after selecting it from the search results. For example, a longer time spent viewing a resource (e.g., greater than 1 minute), termed a “long click”, can indicate that a user found the resource to be relevant for the user's search request.
- a brief period viewing an image e.g., less than 30 seconds
- a “short click” can be interpreted as a lack of relevance.
- the system sends 410 the location data point to a geographic annotation service (e.g., geographic annotation service 202 of FIG. 2 ).
- the geographic annotation service associates the location data point with either a selected resource or one or more resources referred to by the search results (e.g., the top three search results).
- the system also sends the relevance measure to the geographic annotation service.
- the system sends the search request to the geographic annotation service, which can then determine the location data point using the search request.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an example process 500 for annotating resources with geographic information.
- the process 500 will be described with respect to a system including one or more computing devices that performs the process 500 .
- the process 500 is performed by a server associated with a geographic annotation service (e.g., geographic annotation service 202 ).
- the system identifies 502 a resource to be annotated from a collection of one or more resources.
- the resources or address locations for the resources can be received from, e.g., a search system (e.g., search system 208 ).
- the system receives 504 location data points for each resource, and assigns 506 each location data point to a spatial cluster corresponding to a geographic region as described above with respect to FIG. 1 .
- the resources can be published by various distinct publishers and optionally indexed by a search service. This results in a spatial index that can be used to provide address locations for resources associated with a geographic regions and to provide identifiers for geographic regions associated with a resource.
- the system identifies 502 a resource to be annotated, for example, according to a reference to the resource (e.g., a URL).
- a reference to the resource e.g., a URL
- the reference to the resource is received from a publisher (e.g., publisher 204 ).
- the reference is received from a search system (e.g., search system 208 ).
- the system receives 504 the location data points from publishers, a search system, or both.
- Publishers can provide location data points, for example, according to the process 300 illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- Search systems can provide location data points, for example, according to the process 400 illustrated in FIG. 4 .
- the system instead of receiving location data points, the system receives requests for the resource and search requests for the resource. In those implementations, a location data point is determined for each request for the resource or search request.
- the system assigns 506 each location data point to a spatial cluster corresponding to a geographic region. Assigning a location data point to a spatial cluster is discussed with respect to FIG. 1 .
- Clustering involves organizing objects into different groups based on characteristics of the objects. Various clustering techniques are possible, for example, k-means clustering, fuzzy c-means clustering, and quality threshold cluster can be used.
- the assigned location data points for the resources constitute a spatial index of resources and geographic regions. For a given geographic region, resources can be ranked based on, for example, the number location data points assigned to the geographic region's spatial cluster for each resource.
- geographic regions can be ranked using the number of location data points assigned to the region's corresponding spatial cluster.
- ranking geographic regions for a particular resource includes normalizing each spatial cluster according to a population associated with the geographic region corresponding to the spatial cluster. For example, if 1000 requests are received from both City A and City B, but City A has twice the population than City B, then City B is likely more related to the resource than City A even though the same number of requests are received from each city. Normalization can also be based on the proportion of requests received for each geographic region from the total number of requests received for the resource.
- a relevance measure is received for the location data point.
- the relevance measure is used to exclude some location data points from being assigned to a spatial cluster. For example, if the relevance measure fails to exceed a threshold relevance measure, then the location data point can be excluded (e.g., if a request for a video only resulted in 1% of the video being streamed to a client device, then the location data point for that request can be excluded).
- the relevance measure is used to rank resources for a geographic region, or to rank geographic regions for a resource. For example, when ranking resources for a given region, the number and relevance of location data points assigned to the spatial cluster for the region can be considered.
- the relevance measure is also associated with a time, e.g., a time of day or range of dates.
- a time e.g., a time of day or range of dates.
- each location data point for a resource is associated with a time and date for the corresponding request for the resource.
- Rankings of resources for a geographic region, or geographic regions for a resource can be based on time of day or days of the year.
- the spatial index is used to determine local information affinities, or “sister cities.” For example, if regions A and B have roughly similar proportions of requests to a resource, they have a local information affinity to that resource. If A and B have a local information affinity for enough resources (e.g., more than a threshold number of resources), an “interest affinity” can be inferred between the two regions. This could be used as a recommendation signal. For example, if users in A like certain resources, then users in B might also like those resources even if they have been requested infrequently from users in B.
- the recommendation signal can be sent, for example, to publishers or a search service.
- the system determines 508 whether more resources are to be annotated. If more resources are to be annotated, then the process 500 is repeated for those resources (e.g., when a publisher publishes a new resource). If no more resources are to be annotated, the system optionally stores the assigned location data points to a spatial index.
- FIG. 6A is a flow diagram of an example process 600 for using a spatial index to determine resources associated with a geographic region.
- the process 600 will be described with respect to a system including one or more computing devices that performs the process 600 .
- the process 600 is performed by a server associated with a geographic annotation service (e.g., geographic annotation service 202 ).
- the system receives 602 a request to identify resources associated with a geographic region.
- the request is from a requester, for example, a local search service or a user device (e.g., a mobile device located in the geographic region).
- a local search service is a search service that provides search results related to specified locations.
- the request can specify a number of resources to be identified.
- the system identifies 603 resources assigned to a spatial cluster corresponding to the geographical region.
- the system sends 604 a group of address locations for the identified resources to the requester.
- the resources can be ranked as described with respect to FIG. 5 .
- the group of address locations for resources is sent to a local search service.
- the local search service uses the address locations to adjust a score for one or more search results corresponding to one or more of the address locations for a user associated with the geographic region. For example, when a user in California submits a search request to a local search service, search results that reference resources that are more related to California can be boosted over search results that reference resources that are less related to California.
- the group of address locations is sent to a service that builds a visual representation of the referenced resources overlaid on a map showing at least the geographic region. For example, if the resources are images, the service can build a map showing each image over the geographic region most related to the image (e.g., the region having the most location data points assigned to its spatial cluster).
- the request is for global resources.
- Resources are global where requests for the resource do not exhibit strong locality (e.g., high numbers of location data points assigned to the same spatial cluster). Resources can be globally “famous” where they have a high total number of requests but those requests are distributed over a variety of geographic regions.
- address locations for global resources are sent to a search system (e.g., search system 208 ) so that global resources can be preferred for search results when there is no location associated with a search request.
- the request is from a user in a geographic region who is looking for pages related to the user's current location.
- the user can send the request using a web page for “pages near you” or similar.
- a list of web pages can be sent to the user for web pages most related to the user's location. This is useful, for example, for users who are interested in viewing pages that have a strong association with a particular location, e.g., a place of recreation, or a business or a place of historic interest.
- the request is from a user traveling to (or otherwise interested in) a location different from the user's current location.
- the request is from a local proxy system for a cellular network.
- Some cellular network providers use a local proxy system for faster web access, e.g., by mobile devices.
- the local proxy system caches resources at a computer system physically close to a cellular base station, e.g., to minimize the number of times the computer system has to request those resources.
- the local proxy system can determine resources associated with a geographic region including the cellular base station and cache those resources in an attempt to predict what resources will be requested at the cellular base station.
- the local proxy system can cache resources on other computer systems, for example, directly on a mobile device, or at a wireless router for a WiFi network.
- FIG. 6B is a flow diagram of an example process 606 for using a spatial index to determine geographic regions associated with a resource.
- the process 606 will be described with respect to a system including one or more computing devices that performs the process 606 .
- the process 606 is performed by a server associated with a geographic annotation service (e.g., geographic annotation service 202 ).
- the system receives 608 a request to identify geographic regions associated with a resource.
- the system identifies 609 a group of identifiers of geographic regions corresponding to spatial clusters having location data points assigned for the resource (e.g., by ranking the spatial clusters corresponding to the geographic regions as discussed with respect to FIG. 5 ).
- the system sends 610 the group of identifiers to the requester.
- Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
