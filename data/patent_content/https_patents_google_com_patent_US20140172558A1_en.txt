Abstract
Systems and methods of providing information via a computer network are provided. An indication of a transaction with a first merchant can be received via a computer network by a data processing system. The data processing system can create an index representing an inventory of a second merchant which is independent of the first merchant, and can identify a product from the inventory of the second merchant using the index and data associated with the indication of the transaction. The data processing system can provide content corresponding to the product for display at a computing device prior to completion of the transaction.
Description

- Referring now to
FIG. 1 and in brief overview, in some implementations a customer can use acomputing device 125 to interact with afirst merchant server 120 via acomputer network 105 to effect a transaction to purchase goods or services from a corresponding first merchant. Thefirst merchant server 120 can notify adata processing system 110 of this transaction. The notification may include a request for a content item (e.g., an advertisement) for display by thecomputing device 125 prior to completion of the transaction. The notification can include information about the transaction, such as a type of product or service being purchased, an identification of thefirst server 120 or corresponding first merchant, or a computing device identifier associated with thecomputing device 125 used to purchase the goods or services from the first merchant. - The
data processing system 110 can receive data from at least one of themerchant servers 120 to 124 and based on this data thedata processing system 110 can create at least one index representing product inventories of one or more merchants. Adatabase 140 associated with thedata processing system 110 can store the indices. Subsequent to receiving a request for a content item, thedata processing system 110 can communicate with thedatabase 140 and evaluate the index. Based on information included in the request for the content item, thedata processing system 110 can evaluate the index to identify products in the inventory of a second merchant that is a different merchant than the first merchant. Content items such as ads related to the identified products can be provided for display at thecomputing device 125 prior to completion of the transaction. - For example, when a customer is using the
computing device 125 for a transaction to purchase a toaster on a website hosted by thefirst merchant server 120, during the checkout process, (e.g., prior to completion of the transaction) the first merchant server 120 (or the computing device 125) can transmit a request to thedata processing system 110 for content items for additional goods or services to be displayed by thecomputing device 125. Thedata processing system 110 can access inventories of multiple merchants via indices stored in thedatabase 140, and can identify the additional good or service. For example, based on information included with the request for content items that indicates a toaster is being purchased from a first merchant, thedata processing system 110 might identify a toaster cover from the inventory of a second merchant as a suitable product, and can provide information about the toaster cover (e.g., a content item or ad) for display by thecomputing device 125 prior to completion of the transaction to purchase the toaster. - In this example, during a checkout process (e.g., online) to purchase an initial item, a consumer using the
computing device 125 can be presented with additional items available for purchase at thecomputing device 125. These additional items can be available from the merchant's own inventory or from inventories of other merchants as indicated in at least on index created by thedata processing system 110. To determine which additional items to offer, thedata processing system 110 can evaluate the transaction, the network activity of thecomputing device 125, indices created by thedata processing system 110 and representing third party merchant inventory, or activities ofother computing devices 125 to 129 used for purchases of the same initial item or similar items. From this evaluation, thedata processing system 110 can identify a product (e.g., good or service) or content (e.g., ad) representing the product, and the content can be provided for display at thecomputing device 125. - Referring to
FIG. 1 in more detail,FIG. 1 illustrates anexample system 100 of providing information via at least one computer network, such as anetwork 105. Thenetwork 105 can include computer networks such as the internet, local, wide, metro or other area networks, intranets, satellite networks, and other computer networks such as voice or data mobile phone communication networks. Thesystem 100 can include at least onedata processing system 110. Thedata processing system 110 can include at least one logic device such as a computing device having a processor to communicate via thenetwork 105, for example with a plurality of merchant servers (e.g., afirst merchant server 120, asecond merchant server 121 through an Nth merchant server 124), or with a plurality ofcomputing devices 125 to 129. Thedata processing system 110 can communicate with any number of merchant servers and computing devices. - The
data processing system 110 can include at least one server. For example, thedata processing system 110 can include a plurality of servers located in at least one data center. Thedata processing system 110 can include at least onecontent placement module 130, at least onecontent selection module 135, and at least onedatabase 140. Thecontent placement module 130 and thecontent selection module 135 can each include at least one processing unit or other logic device such as programmable logic arrays configured to communicate with thedatabase 140. Thecontent placement module 130 and thecontent selection module 135 can be separate components, a single component, application specific integrated circuit, one or more servers, gaming consoles, or part of thedata processing system 110. - The merchant servers, for example the
first merchant server 120, can include a computer having a server configured to host at least one web page or other information resource or online document. For example, themerchant servers 120 to 124 can include at least one FTP server, file sharing server, or web server, or a combination of servers such as a data center, or a cloud computing platform. In one implementation, themerchant servers 120 to 124 can host at least one web page for thecomputing devices 125 to 129 to purchase goods and services online through thenetwork 105. - The
computing devices 125 to 129 can include a computer, laptop, desktop, smart phone, tablet, personal digital assistant, or server device configured to communicate with other computing devices via thenetwork 105. Thecomputing device 125 can execute a software application (e.g., a web browser or other application) to send and receive data to and from other computing devices overnetwork 105. - Referring to
FIG. 1 . andFIG. 2 , in some implementations, thedata processing system 110 receives, via thenetwork 105, an indication of a transaction with a first merchant (BLOCK 205). Thedata processing system 110 can process data received from merchants (e.g., via themerchant servers 120 to 124) to create an index representing the inventory of at least one merchant (BLOCK 210). Thedata processing system 110 can create indices representing merchant inventory (BLOCK 210) before or after receiving an indication of the transaction (BLOCK 105). The indices can be updated periodically by thedata processing system 110 based on data received via thenetwork 105 from one of themerchant servers 120 to 124. Using the created index (BLOCK 210) and the received indication of the transaction (BLOCK 205), thedata processing system 110 can identify a product from an inventory of a merchant (BLOCK 215). For example, subsequent to receiving an indication of a transaction between thefirst merchant server 120 and thecomputing device 125, thedata processing system 110 can access thedatabase 140 to identify a product from an inventory of a second merchant (BLOCK 215). The second merchant may be associated with thesecond merchant server 121. Thedata processing system 110 can identify a content item corresponding to the identified product, such as an image of the product or an ad for the product, and can provide the content item for display at the computing device (BLOCK 220). In some implementations, thedata processing system 110 provides the content item for display at thecomputing device 125 prior to completion of the transaction. - In some implementations, the
content placement module 130 receives an indication of a transaction with the first merchant server 120 (associated with a first merchant) via the network 105 (BLOCK 205). The transaction can indicate an attempt to purchase a product of the first merchant using thecomputing device 125. Thefirst merchant server 120 can be associated with a first merchant, such as a business entity whose product is offered for sale at thefirst merchant server 120. In one implementation, thefirst merchant server 120 receives a purchase order from thecomputing device 125 and relays an indication of the order to thedata processing system 110, where it is received (BLOCK 205). - The
computing device 125 can access web pages hosted by thefirst merchant server 120 to purchase goods and services via thenetwork 105. A consumer or user can manipulate an interface of thecomputing device 125 to select a good or service for purchase, such as by clicking a link or a checkout interface of a display to initiate a checkout process. For example, responsive to a selection of a good or service for purchase, thecomputing device 125 may communicate with the web pages hosted by thefirst merchant server 120 to purchase a toaster from a merchant associated with thefirst merchant server 120. During the checkout process, thedata processing system 110 may receive an indication of the toaster purchase transaction from the first merchant server 120 (BLOCK 205). - In one implementation, the
data processing system 110 creates at least one index representing an inventory of at least one merchant (BLOCK 210). For example, thedata processing system 110 can receive data from a second merchant (via the second merchant server 121) to create an index representing the second merchant's inventory (e.g., products, goods, services, or items offered for sale by the second merchant) (BLOCK 210). The second merchant can be independent of the first merchant. For example the first merchant associated with thefirst merchant server 120 and the second merchant associated with thesecond merchant server 121 can be different and unrelated entities, neither of whom has access to the inventory, servers, or indices of the other. - The
data processing system 110 can store the indices in at least onedatabase 140. In some implementations, thefirst merchant server 120 and thesecond merchant server 121 do not have access to thedatabase 140. For example, thefirst merchant server 120 and thesecond merchant server 121 are third party servers that communicate with thedata processing system 110 via thenetwork 105 and that cannot access the indices stored in thedatabase 140 to determine their inventories. In this example, thefirst merchant server 120 and thesecond merchant server 121 may provide data to thedata processing system 110 that thedata processing system 110 uses to create indices (BLOCK 210), and the data processing system 110 (and not themerchant servers 120, 121) can access the indices via thedatabase 140 to identify product inventory. The third party merchants may or may not have their own, separate, proprietary inventories or indices. - The
data processing system 110 can create different indices representing inventories of different merchants and can store those indices in thedatabase 140. For example, merchants using the services of thedata processing system 110 to distribute content items for display on computingdevices 125 may participate in a content item distribution service provided by thedata processing system 110. - Merchants may be associated with more than one index. For example, the
data processing system 110 can create multiple indices that indicate different categories of inventory of one merchant (BLOCK 210), such as the second merchant associated with thesecond merchant server 121. For example, thedata processing system 110 can receive information from thesecond merchant server 121 that the second merchant offers for sale electronics and apparels and that this constitutes two inventory categories. From this information, thedata processing system 110 can create on index (BLOCK 210) having two categories (e.g., an apparel category and an electronics category) or two indices, one for apparel and one for electronics for the same second merchant. The categories can include subcategories. For example, the electronics category may include a computer subcategory and a camera subcategory. In one implementation, thedata processing system 110 may create indices (BLOCK 210) based on categories of products or goods. For example, an index representing an electronics inventory may include electronics products from different merchants with a mapping between particular products and particular merchants. - The
data processing system 110 can create indices representing inventories of multiple merchants (BLOCK 210), such as the first merchant associated with thefirst merchant server 120 and with a transaction taking place at thecomputing device 125, as well as a second merchant having a correspondingsecond merchant server 121 that is not initially part of the transaction between thefirst merchant server 120 and thecomputing device 125. - In one implementation, the
data processing system 110 can identify, using the index and data associated with the indication of the transaction, a product from the inventory of at least one merchant (BLOCK 215). The data associated with the indication of the transaction can include, for example, the product, good, or service purchased in the transaction conducted at thecomputing device 125. For example, a purchase transaction of a toaster may be conducted at thecomputing device 125 via thefirst merchant server 120. From this or other data indicatingcomputing device 125 activity, thedata processing system 110 may determine that thecomputing device 125 is associated with activity indicating an interest in a toaster cover or another peripheral product. In one implementation, thedata processing system 110 may identify the product (e.g., the toaster cover) from the second merchant using the index representing the inventory of the second merchant (BLOCK 215). For example, thedata processing system 110 may determine that the transaction or activity of thecomputing device 125 relates to a consumer product and responsive to this determination may search a consumer product category of the second merchant's index to identify a consumer product. In some implementations, thedata processing system 110 searches a subcategory of the electronics category of the index, such as a kitchen product accessories category, to identify a product (BLOCK 215) such as a toaster cover. - In some implementations, the
data processing system 110 determines a quality metric such as a click through rate or conversion rate associated with thecomputing device 125. For example, thedata processing system 110 can receive a computing device identifier (e.g., a number) representing thecomputing device 125 orother computing devices 129. Based on information associated with the computing device identifier, thedata processing system 110 can determine at least one of a click through rate and conversion rate associated with the computing device identifier. The data processing system 110 (or a component thereof such as the content selection module 135) can identify a product from the indexed inventory based at least in part on the click through rate or other quality metric. For example, thedata processing system 110 can identify a product (e.g., from information in the index) based on content items (e.g., ads) corresponding to the identified product that have a predicted or historical click through rate above a threshold level. - For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters). For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, users may have control over how information is collected about them and used by a content server.
- In some implementations, historical data (e.g., click through or conversion rates) associated with a computing device identifier over a previous time period can be stored in the
database 140 of thedata processing system 110 separately or as part of one or more index. Thedata processing system 110 can determine a quality metric (e.g., click through or conversion rate) associated with thecomputing device 125 from the historical data. For example, thecontent selection module 135 may determine from data associated with the computing device identifier that thecomputing device 125 has actively clicked (e.g., has a high click through rate or a click through rate above a threshold value) on content for consumer products during the past several weeks (or other time period). Based at least in part on this information, thecontent selection module 135 can identify a consumer product from an inventory represented by one or more indices stored in the database 140 (BLOCK 215). - In some implementations, data associated with computing device purchase patterns or other historical information can be stored in the
database 140. The historical data may indicate, for example, that a percentage of thecomputing devices 125 to 129 involved in a transaction to purchase a product from one of themerchant servers 120 to 124 were also involved the same or a different a transaction for another product. For example, historical data stored in thedatabase 140 may indicate that computing device identifiers associated with transactions involving toasters have a click through rate above a threshold value for content related to blenders. From this information, thecontent selection module 135 can identify blenders from an index of inventory (BLOCK 215) responsive to a received indication of a transaction (BLOCK 205) that indicates a transaction involving purchase of a toaster. - In some implementations, the
data processing system 110 can identify computer network activity of thecomputing device 125, and identify the product (BLOCK 215) based at least in part on the computer network activity. For example, historical data determined from a computing device identifier and indexed in thedatabase 140 may indicate that thecomputing device 125 frequently accesses web pages of video games or has accessed content about video games in the past month or other time period. From this information, thecontent selection module 135 may identify content related to video game consoles to provide for display at thecomputing device 125 prior to completion of a transaction for another product that is taking place at thecomputing device 125. - In one implementation, the
data processing system 110 provides an ad or other content corresponding to the product for display at a computing device prior to completion of the transaction (BLOCK 220). For example, thecontent placement module 130 may provide the content for display at thecomputing device 125 via thenetwork 105. With reference to the above example involving a toaster and toaster cover, thedata processing system 110 can provide (or instruct thesecond merchant server 121 to provide) an ad or other content such as an image of a toaster cover for display on a web page or other information resource at thecomputing device 125. - The content item (e.g., the toaster cover ad) can be provided to the
computing device 125 for display (BLOCK 220) prior to completion of the transaction (e.g., prior to completion of the purchase of the toaster during a checkout process at the computing device 125). In this example, the toaster cover can be purchased together with the toaster in the same or a subsequent transaction at thecomputing device 125, with the toaster (or other good or service) provided by the first merchant and the toaster cover (or other good or service) provided by the second merchant. - The
data processing system 110 can provide content corresponding to the one or more products for display at the computing device 125 (BLOCK 220) subsequent to receipt, by thedata processing system 110, of the indication of a transaction at thecomputing device 125 to purchase a good or service (BLOCK 205). For example, thecontent placement module 130 may provide one or more advertisements or images of a toaster cover to be displayed at the computing device 125 (BLOCK 220) after receiving an indication that thecomputing device 125 is involved in a transaction to purchase a toaster (BLOCK 205). In this example, thecontent placement module 130 can select the content (e.g., an ad for a toaster cover) from thedatabase 140 or from thesecond merchant server 121 for display at thecomputing device 125. - In some implementations, data included in the indication of the transaction received by the data processing system (BLOCK 205) includes a request for the
data processing system 110 to identify at least one of multiple products from one or more indices stored in the database. For example, during the toaster purchase transaction at thecomputing device 125, thefirst merchant server 120 may send a request to thedata processing system 110 for multiple content items identifying multiple additional goods or services associated with multiple different merchants to provide for display at thecomputing device 125. - In some implementations, subsequent to display of the advertisement or other content item (e.g., regarding the toaster cover identified from an index of inventory) at the
computing device 125, thedata processing system 110 can determine that thecomputing device 125 has clicked on that content item or been used to purchase a corresponding product (e.g., a conversion). This click through or conversion information can be stored in thedatabase 140 and used by thedata processing system 110 recursively to refine the content item selection process by influencing the selection of content to provide for display responsive to subsequent transactions at the same or adifferent computing device 125. For example, thedata processing system 110 can determine that click through or conversion rates of content items for the toaster cover are above a threshold value, and responsive to this information thedata processing system 110 can increase the frequency of selection of toaster cover related content items responsive to received indications of transactions for toasters or other products, goods or services. - In some implementations, the
data processing system 110 can identify a group of merchants. For example, merchants of the group can agree to provide thedata processing system 110 with provisions identifying the circumstances under which thedata processing system 110 may recommend the merchant's products or services to a customer. For instance, those provisions may relate to prices, quality and quantities, locations of the consumers, or the relationship between merchants. Continuing with this example, thecomputing device 125 can be part of a transaction to purchase a product or service (e.g., a toaster) from thefirst merchant server 120. Thecontent selection module 135 may select a product or service (e.g., a toaster cover) from a different merchant based on an interest determined from the transaction by thedata processing system 110. - In some implementations, the different merchants can collaborate to allocate payments for the different items to their respective merchants. For example, one merchant may collect payment for both items, and then credit another merchant directly or via the
data processing system 110. In this example, a merchant can aggregate payments from multiple transactions during a time period (e.g., monthly) and can reconcile credits or debits with other merchants periodically. In some examples, separate transactions can be made for items associated with different merchants, where the different merchants receive payment directly during each transaction without passing through an intervening merchant. - The transaction can be conducted using encrypted connections. For example, a third party (e.g., not the
data processing system 110, or themerchant servers 120 to 124 or thecomputing devices 125 to 129) on thenetwork 105 may be prevented from obtaining an indication of what products are bought by the customer or suggested by thedata processing system 110. For example, the transaction can be conducted through protocols such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) that can provide encrypted communication to prevent eavesdropping or unauthorized access and can securely identify the web server (e.g., the first merchant server 120) that communicates with thecomputing device 125. - In one implementation, the
data processing system 110 may indicate to one of themerchant servers 120 to 124 that a credit is owed to the corresponding merchant. Thedata processing system 110 can communicate withmerchant servers 120 to 124 to process payment plans (e.g., provide credits or bills) to or between merchants, e.g., on a periodic, per transaction or multiple transaction basis. Thedata processing system 110 can also provide content items associated with additional inventory at checkout for payment on a per-request basis, a per-additional revenue driven basis, a monthly basis, or for free. - In some implementations, the
data processing system 110 provides an option to merchants via therespective merchant servers 120 to 124 to share purchase data with thedata processing system 110 or withother merchant servers 120 to 124. For example, thefirst merchant server 120 could provide thedata processing system 110 with click, or conversion (e.g., purchase) information that thedata processing system 110 can evaluate to identify content items for products of the first merchant (corresponding to the first merchant server 120) or to identify content items of a different merchant. In this example thedata processing system 110 can receive authorization from thefirst merchant server 120 to use this information to identify products of content items of other merchants. -
FIG. 3 shows the general architecture of anillustrative computer system 300 that may be employed to implement any of the computer systems discussed herein (including thesystem 100 and its components such as thedata processing system 110, thecontent placement module 130, or the content selection module 135) in accordance with some implementations. Thecomputer system 300 can be used to provide information via thenetwork 105. Thecomputer system 300 ofFIG. 3 comprises one ormore processors 320 communicatively coupled tomemory 325, one ormore communications interfaces 305, and one or more output devices 310 (e.g., one or more display units) and one ormore input devices 315. Theprocessors 320 can be included indata processing system 110 or the other components of the system 100 (such as thecontent placement module 130 and the content selection module 135). - In the
computer system 300 ofFIG. 3 , thememory 325 may comprise any computer-readable storage media, and may store computer instructions such as processor-executable instructions for implementing the various functionalities described herein for respective systems, as well as any data relating thereto, generated thereby, or received via the communications interface(s) or input device(s) (if present). Referring again to thesystem 100 ofFIG. 1 , thedatabase 140 can include thememory 325 to store indices associated with merchant inventory.

processor 320 may be communicatively coupled to or control the communications interface(s) 305 to transmit or receive various information pursuant to execution of instructions. For example, the communications interface(s) 305 may be coupled to a wired or wireless network, bus, or other communication means and may therefore allow thecomputer system 300 to transmit information to and/or receive information from other devices (e.g., other computer systems). While not shown explicitly in the system ofFIG. 1 , one or more communications interfaces facilitate information flow between the components of thesystem 100. In some implementations, the communications interface(s) may be configured (e.g., via various hardware components or software components) to provide a website as an access portal to at least some aspects of thecomputer system 300. Examples ofcommunications interfaces 305 include user interfaces (e.g., web pages) having content (e.g., advertisements) selected by thecontent placement module 130 for placement on the web pages. - The
output devices 310 may be provided, for example, to allow information to be viewed or otherwise perceived in connection with execution of the instructions. The input device(s) 315 may be provided, for example, to allow a user to make manual adjustments, make selections, enter data or various other information, or interact in any of a variety of manners with the processor during execution of the instructions. Additional information relating to a general computer system architecture that may be employed for various systems discussed herein is provided at the conclusion of this disclosure. - Implementations of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software embodied on a tangible medium, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions, encoded on computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. The program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. A computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. Moreover, while a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially-generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium can also be, or be included in, one or more separate physical components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices).
- The features disclosed herein may be implemented on a smart television module (or connected television module, hybrid television module, etc.), which may include a processing circuit configured to integrate internet connectivity with more traditional television programming sources (e.g., received via cable, satellite, over-the-air, or other signals). The smart television module may be physically incorporated into a television set or may include a separate device such as a set-top box, Blu-ray or other digital media player, game console, hotel television system, and other companion device. A smart television module may be configured to allow viewers to search and find videos, movies, photos and other content on the web, on a local cable TV channel, on a satellite TV channel, or stored on a local hard drive. A set-top box (STB) or set-top unit (STU) may include an information appliance device that may contain a tuner and connect to a television set and an external source of signal, turning the signal into content which is then displayed on the television screen or other display device. A smart television module may be configured to provide a home screen or top level screen including icons for a plurality of different applications, such as a web browser and a plurality of streaming media services, a connected cable or satellite media source, other web “channels”, etc. The smart television module may be configured to provide an electronic programming guide to the user.

- The operations described in this specification can be implemented as operations performed by a data processing apparatus on data stored on one or more computer-readable storage devices or received from other sources.
- The term “data processing apparatus,” “data processing system,” or “computing device” encompasses all kinds of apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, a system on a chip, or multiple ones, or combinations, of the foregoing. The apparatus can include special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). The apparatus can also include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, a cross-platform runtime environment, a virtual machine, or a combination of one or more of them. The apparatus and execution environment can realize various different computing model infrastructures, such as web services, distributed computing and grid computing infrastructures. The
content placement module 130 and thecontent selection module 135 can include or share one or more data processing apparatuses, computing devices, or processors. - A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub-programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
- The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform actions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatuses can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).
- Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), for example. Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- To provide for interaction with a user, implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube), plasma, or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system such as
system 300 orsystem 100 can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In some implementations, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a client device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the client device). Data generated at the client device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the client device at the server. - While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of the systems and methods described herein. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
- Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results.
- In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products. For example, the
content placement module 130 and thecontent selection module 135 can be a single module, a logic device having one or more processing circuits, or part of a search engine. - Having now described some illustrative implementations and embodiments, it is apparent that the foregoing is illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by way of example.
