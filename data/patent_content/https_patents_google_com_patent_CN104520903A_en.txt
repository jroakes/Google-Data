Abstract
A method and system provides increased visual fidelity in a multi-pose three- dimensional rendering of an object by overlaying edge lines. A server sends a multiplicity of two-dimensional renderings of the object to a client device over a network. Each of the 2D renderings depicts the object in a different pose. As the 2D renderings are displayed sequentially, the object appears to move, for example, by pivoting on an axis. The server also sends a multiplicity of overlay renderings to the client device. Each of the overlay renderings corresponds to a respective one of the 2D renderings and depicts edge lines that would appear on the 2D rendering. The edge lines are rendered on a transparent background such that, when a user interface combines one of the 2D renderings with the corresponding overlay rendering, the edge lines are highlighted on the 2D rendering and provide additional visual cues to the viewer.

Fig. 2 A-2L illustrates such as may the example of display 60 shown by display device 28 when performing viewing application 34.Display 60 depicts the spherical 3D object 62 it with two marks 64,66.The control group 68 be in bottom display 60 allows user be such as respectively used to the control 70 and 72 of the previous or next image of selection by activating (such as, utilizing the indicating equipment of the such as mouse as input equipment 26 to carry out " clicks ") or controlled the view of object 62 by mobile slider control 74.In the exemplary display 60 of Fig. 2 A-2L, object 62 is played up by 12 corresponding 2D and is described with 12 attitudes.Each corresponding 2D plays up from single height rendered object 62, but rotates to different angles.In each continuous 2D plays up, object 62 carries out rotating and looks and be have rotated the increment of 30 degree (whole circle rotate 1/12).Play up by sequentially watching 2D, object 62 looks and suitably carries out rotating and making user can see object 62 from different perspectives.In certain embodiments, sliding shoe 74 can comprise for illustrating the current digital indicator 76 played up at which 2D of display.In certain embodiments, user can use input equipment 26 pairs of objects to carry out " click and drag " and with interactively speed target rotation.In certain embodiments, 12 2D play up and are in high compression form and the size of (multiple) associated files is minimized.In various embodiments, 12 2D play up and can carry out rendered object 62 with colored or gray scale.
Certainly, will be appreciated that, although Fig. 2 A-2L depicts the example embodiment that the multi-pose that wherein uses 12 2D to play up to construct 3D object 62 is played up, the multi-pose of 3D object is played up and can be built from playing up to the 2D of three or four so few each so much quantity to 40 or more.
Regardless of the quantity being used for creating 2D that multi-pose 3D plays up and playing up, in the first aspect of disclosed method and system, add the eye fidelity that overlay image is played up to improve multi-pose 3D, though when 2D play up have employed obvious compression of images.This overlay image comprise appear at other 2D each play up in the playing up of edge lines.This overlay image is two tone image, and its monochrome (the second color) with transparent background (the first color) and edge lines is played up.In one embodiment, edge lines play up as black, although such as also other color can be used (such as according to the object of institute's modeling, if object uses very dark color-such as black-carry out modeling, then preferably may use white to play up the edge lines in additional image).
This overlay image is not depict only the edge lines of independent in playing up corresponding to 2D, and alternatively depicts the edge lines played up corresponding to other 2D each.Therefore, refer again to the wherein multi-pose 3D shown in Fig. 2 A-2L and play up the example playing up realization via 12 2D, in one embodiment, overlay image comprises 12 edge lines and plays up, wherein each correspond to 12 2D play up in one.12 edge lines play up in each in overlay image, there is ad-hoc location.The viewing application 34 that client device 12 performs is carried out operating and is covered this 2D with the corresponding part of each the display overlay image in playing up for 12 2D play up to be played up by edge lines.
Fig. 3-5 illustrates and uses the concept of edge lines overlay image how to operate for single 2D image.In figure 3, single 2D texture is played up 80 and is depicted rectangle 3D object 82.It can be from such groups of pictures of all angles rendered object 82 that this texture plays up 80, makes to play up the multi-pose 3D forming object 82 when playing up and sequentially being watched and plays up.Play up in 80 at texture, object 82 has three visible faces 84,86 and 88.The texture in face 84,86 and 88 is described by the profile line of different directions in figure 3.Fig. 4 depicts the corresponding part 90 of edge lines overlay image.The edge lines that corresponding part 90 comprises object 82 play up 92, and it is arranged on transparent background 94 (being represented by profile line 96 in the diagram).The edge on lines 97A-97D opposite, edge 88 carries out highlighted display, wherein edge lines 97B and 97C intersecting of highlighted display surface 88 and 84 and intersecting of face 86 and 88 respectively.Similarly, edge lines 97E-97G, utilizes the edge of the highlighted display surface 86 of edge lines 97C, utilizes intersecting of the highlighted display surface 84 and 86 of edge lines 97E.Edge lines 97H and 97I, utilizes the edge of the highlighted display surface 84 of edge lines 97B and 97E.
When being performed by the CPU 20 of client device 12, viewing application 34 can operate the corresponding part 90 selecting overlay image, and this corresponding part 90 is covered 2D texture plays up on 80.Fig. 5 show when watch application 34 show by 2D is played up be coated with corresponding part 90 that edge lines play up and generate combination picture 102 time by the display 100 watched application 34 and generate.That is, 3D object 82 is played up in 80 at texture and is described, and edge lines play up part 90 be laminated in play up 80 top and edge lines 97A-97I is aimed at the edge playing up the face 84,86 and 88 described in 80.Usually, in certain embodiments, this can by create texture play up 80 and edge lines play up part 90 there is identical Pixel Dimensions (such as, 400x400,500x500,400x300 etc.) and each pixel making texture play up 80 play up in part 90 at edge lines and there is corresponding pixel realize, these edge lines play up part 90 for transparent color (namely, do not change or block texture and play up corresponding pixel in 80) or edge line color (that is, block texture and play up corresponding pixel in 80).
Advantageously, compress although substantially play up 80, the display 100 produced with outward appearance more clearly combination picture 102 depict 3D object 82.In addition, can carry out preserving with GIF or PNG file layout due to overlay image and be only double-colored, so allow maximum Lossless Compression.At the horizontal line place of the length of same color pixel, in PNG and gif file form, LZW compression method is used to be effective especially.Therefore, file size (with corresponding file transmission time) can be made to minimize.In addition, in certain embodiments, the edge lines of overlay image play up can-may selectively-carry out when not having basic texture to play up showing to present only marginate view (being also referred to as " wire frame " view).In addition, in one embodiment, overlay image was transferred to client device 12 (such as, being downloaded by client device 12) before all the other 2D play up, and make user can all the other 2D play up be completely downloaded before manipulation (such as, rotate) this object.In certain embodiments, the transparency of overlay image especially edge line color is that variable (such as, utilizing the slider control of display application 34) has looked many with edge and obviously controlled.
In certain embodiments, scalable vector graphics (SVG) is used to replace rendered pixel to create overlay image with same or analogous (multiple) effect realized with utilize the overlay image preserved with GIF or PNG file layout to obtain.Also will be appreciated that, although be described to multiple parts of single image file above, overlay image can be the individual file being sent to client 12 from server 14.
Fig. 6 illustrates each 2D wherein and plays up the principle of carrying out the first aspect operated in the embodiment played up with each edge lines as the image in individual file.The image of the top row in Fig. 6 depicts a series of six textures and plays up 80, and they can sequentially be shown to create multi-pose 3D by viewing application 34 and play up.In the middle of in Fig. 6, the image of row depicts a series of six edge lines and plays up 92A, and wherein each corresponds to the directly texture be in above it and plays up 80.Edge lines are played up 92A and are here described separately, because they may be stored in (relative with the Single document being divided into multiple part 90) in individual file.The image of the bottom line in Fig. 6 depicts a series of six combination pictures 102, and they are played up 92A with the edge lines in the row of centre and carry out stacked respectively by the texture in top row being played up 80 and produce.
In the second aspect of disclosed method and system, add the eye fidelity that overlay image is played up to improve multi-pose 3D.This overlay image be appear at other 2D each play up in the playing up of shade.Identical with overlay image described above, the overlay image in second aspect is two tone image, has transparent background and monochromatic Shading Rendering.In one embodiment, Shading Rendering is black, although as above about also using other color described by edge lines.
In second aspect, overlay image be not only describe correspond to other 2D play up in the shade of independent, but also describe correspond to other 2D play up in the shade of each.Just as edge lines overlay image, shade overlay image comprises 12 Shading Rendering in the example embodiment of Fig. 2 A-2L, and each wherein in 12 Shading Rendering is played up corresponding to a 2D.Each in 12 Shading Rendering has ad-hoc location in overlay image.The viewing application 34 that client device 12 performs is carried out operating and to be covered in by Shading Rendering with the corresponding part of each the display overlay image in playing up for 12 2D on this 2D plays up.
Fig. 7-9 illustrates and uses the concept of shade overlay image how to play up for single 2D to operate.In the figure 7, single 2D texture is played up 80 (from Fig. 3) and is depicted rectangle 3D object 82.Equally, it can be from such groups of pictures of all angles rendered object 82 that texture plays up 80, makes to play up the multi-pose 3D forming object 82 when playing up and sequentially being watched and plays up.Fig. 8 shows the corresponding part 112 of shade overlay image.This corresponding part 112 comprises the Shading Rendering 114 of object 82, and it is arranged on transparent background 116 (indicated by profile line 118 in fig. 8).Shade 115 is described by stippled area in corresponding part 112.
When being performed by the CPU 20 of client device 12, viewing application 34 can operate the corresponding part 112 selecting overlay image, and this corresponding part 112 is covered 2D texture plays up on 80.Fig. 9 shows when watching when application 34 shows the combination picture 120 generated by 2D being played up the corresponding part 112 that is coated with Shading Rendering by the display 120 watched application 34 and generate.That is, 3D object is played up in 80 at texture and is described, and Shading Rendering part 114 be laminated in play up 80 top and make shade 115 and play up 80 and aim at.Usually, in certain embodiments, this can by create texture play up 80 and Shading Rendering part 114 there is identical Pixel Dimensions (such as, 400x400,500x500,400x300 etc.) and each pixel making texture play up 80 there is corresponding pixel realize in Shading Rendering part 114, this Shading Rendering part be transparent color (namely, do not change or block texture and play up corresponding pixel in 80) or shadow color (that is, dimmed or block texture play up corresponding pixel in 80).
Advantageously, compress although substantially play up 80, the display 120 produced with outward appearance more clearly combination picture 122 depict 3D object 82.In addition, carry out preserving with GIF or PNG file layout due to overlay image and be only double-colored, so allow maximum Lossless Compression.Therefore, file size (with corresponding file transmission time) can be made to minimize.In certain embodiments, the transparency of overlay image especially shadow color is that variable (such as, utilizing the slider control of display application 34) obviously controls to have looked many to shade.
In certain embodiments, scalable vector graphics (SVG) is used to replace rendered pixel to create overlay image with same or analogous (multiple) effect realized with utilize the overlay image preserved with GIF or PNG file layout to obtain.
Although overlay image described above is described to wherein, each comprises the single image in the region that all 2D of playing up corresponding to multi-pose 3D play up wherein, but each corresponding 2D that may play up for multi-pose 3D plays up and uses independent overlay image (although as will be appreciated, its efficiency is lower).
In the third aspect of disclosed method and system, download multi-pose 3D play up the required time by multiple 2D being played up be combined as single image file to improve.With reference now to Figure 10, depict and wherein play up from 36 2D the exemplary embodiment that 130 establishment multi-pose 3D play up.Certainly, play up although the embodiment of Figure 10 plays up 130 establishment multi-pose 3D from 36 2D, as the situation that the multi-pose 3D described in Fig. 2 A-2L plays up, the 2D of other quantity can be used to play up.In any case, in the embodiment in figure 10,36 2D play up 130 in the single image 132 be stored in Single document horizontally.In Fig. 10, dotted line A and G indicates edge, the leftmost side and the edge, the rightmost side of single image 132 respectively, the continuum boundary of dotted line B-F then indicating image 132.That is, dotted line B is in line, and dotted line C is in line, and makes 36 2D play up 130 will to form the image 132 of single horizontal orientation.
Therefore, turn to Figure 11 now, Single document will store single image 132.In the exemplary single image 132 that Figure 11 describes, single image 132 is divided into 36 parts 134, wherein each part correspond to 2D play up in one.Part 134 is arranged as across single horizontal line; That is, part 134 is arranged as row, and each part 134 has the width of 1/36 of the overall width equaling single image 132.Such as, if each part 136 has the width of 500 pixels and the height of 375 pixels, then the overall width of single image 132 is 18000 pixels (500x36) and the overall height of single image 132 is 375 pixels.
Therefore, replace ask and download 36 independent 2D play up in each, watch application 34 only ask and download single image 132.As a result, the expense of relevant document size and bandwidth obviously reduces.In addition, can operate each download queue of only downloading 1-4 file because many browsers have, so eliminate the problem downloading many individual images, be conducive to downloading single (although larger) image.Therefore, in the above particular condition with reference to the example described by Figure 10 and 11, the method can be reduced to 173kB across single request by downloading from the 828kB across 36 HTTP request.This corresponds to the size reduction of about 80%.
In certain embodiments, except rotating except object, multi-pose 3D plays up and beholder can be allowed to tilt object.With reference now to Figure 12, single image 136 can be included in the part 138 of disposing across this image 136 level, such as, play up each in 130 corresponding to 36 2D depicted in figure 10.As described above, sequentially watch 36 2D to play up 130 and beholder can be allowed to look to rotate the object during multi-pose 3D plays up.Single image 136 can also play up for rotating 36 2D of object in each comprise the part 140 of this image, they allow beholder to tilt to the object during multi-pose 3D plays up jointly.In the embodiment that Figure 12 describes, part 140 arranges in the picture vertically downward.Such as, single image 136 comprise for the such part 140 (sloping portion) of each nine in 36 rotating parts (or, be called as an alternative for each 36 rotating parts in nine sloping portions), allow the object of beholder from 324 different angles viewing multi-pose 3D play up or model thus.In the example that Figure 12 describes, single image 136 will have the size of population that 18000 pixels (500x36) take advantage of 3375 pixels (375x9).Certainly, although turned position and obliquity are depicted as horizontal and vertical arrangement in the picture in fig. 12 respectively, turned position and obliquity can be alternatively vertical and flatly arrange respectively.
In certain embodiments, single image 136 is stored as the file (such as, JPEG or PNG file) of progressive form.When single image 136 is transferred to client device 12, user can viewing and/or tilt and/or rotate the inferior quality view that multi-pose 3D plays up before being transmitted of single image 136.This is better than using individuality to play up the method for (such as, the image described in Fig. 2 A-2L), because in these methods, some are played up and have played up download by prior to other.
In the fourth aspect of disclosed method and system, use thumbnail set to multi-pose 3D play up carry out preview until (multiple) high quality graphic (such as, above described single image 136 or 2D play up set) transmit, and adopt a pair selection of several strategy will play up with multi-pose 3D the model and object that represent and user can start to manipulate (such as, by rotating or tilting) time between this multi-pose 3D time of playing up is optimized (such as, reducing).In certain embodiments, and will form compared with 2D that multi-pose 3D plays up plays up, thumbnail can be played up deeply with lower colour bits.That is, although may expect that " true color " view (such as, 24 colors or higher) catches the subtlety of texture and light and shade and to make multi-pose 3D play up convincing, comparatively low level can be used deeply to play up thumbnail.In an embodiment, it is 4 (16 look) images or 5 (32 look) images that thumbnail can be played up, although higher and lower position also can be used dark.Although quality may decrease, this quality is acceptable for preview, and deeply creates less image compared with low level, thereby reduces user and can play up the start-up time before manipulating to multi-pose 3D.
In certain embodiments, except to use except lower color depth or alternatively, use another kind of strategy.Replace using the thumbnail being in its original size, thumbnail can be amplified by browser and/or viewing application.Such as, if multi-pose 3D plays up as 400x400 pixel, but then thumbnail may be played up with certain smaller szie and is enlarged into 400x400 pixel.Exemplarily unrestricted, thumbnail can 200x200 pixel, 100x100 pixel, 50x50 pixel etc. be played up.This strategy is advantageous particularly when thumbnail needs to carry out amplifying (such as, convergent-divergent) with the power of 2, because many browsers have been configured to amplify image with the power of 2.For this reason, the thumbnail played up with 100x100 pixel (or 200x200 pixel) can be favourable when the multi-pose 3D for 400x400 pixel plays up by preview, because this thumbnail can easily be amplified by factor 4 (or 2), although and the thumbnail of the thumbnail of 250x250 pixel or 125x125 pixel-their may feasible-the multi-pose 3D be more suitable for for 500x500 pixel is played up.
In addition, in certain embodiments, thumbnail can with a dimension with differently carry out convergent-divergent in another dimension.Such as, each thumbnail can use less pixel to play up along horizontal axis.When object moves across visual field, human eye and brain are suitable for compensating " motion blur ", and determine the shape of fuzzy object.Utilize this principle, less pixel can be utilized to play up object or the model of rotation along pivot center (that is, horizontal axis), and obviously can't have influence on the perceived quality of primary image.Such as, if it is that 400 pixel wide x400 pixel is high that multi-pose 3D plays up, then thumbnail can be played up is that 50 pixel wide x 100 pixels are high.50 pixels are from left to right by be stretched as 100, picture pixel from top to bottom so much by double, and these give the illusion of motion blur, the eyes of beholder will compensate this.In addition, the same with other embodiment, these embodiments make use of the ability that the multiple horizontal pixel of LZW compression counterweight carries out compressing, and this makes file size reduce.
In addition or as an alternative, in certain embodiments, be similar to and play up described and described in figures 10 and 11 deployment about forming the 2D that multi-pose 3D plays up above, thumbnail can be combined in single image from left to right.Play up as 2D, thumbnail is deployed in single image file and particularly carries out from left to right disposing making the quantity of HTTP request minimize (namely, the quantity of documents that must download and corresponding overhead bandwidth are minimized) and make use of the efficiency of the LZW compression method used in PNG and GIF image, itself so further reduce file size.
Certainly, various aspects described above can be used alone or in combination.Exemplarily unrestricted, in one embodiment, multi-pose 3D plays up the modeling object showing and can rotate across 36 attitudes.That is, multi-pose 3D plays up the object looking and show and rotate with about 10 degree of increments around central vertical axis.Each attitude during multi-pose 3D plays up is with the image rendered object of 400 pixel x400 pixels.Be used for creating 36 2D that multi-pose 3D plays up to play up and play up in single image file, it is of a size of 14400 pixel x 400 pixels.In other words, 36 2D in single image file play up and arrange from left to right.Edge lines overlay file comprises 36 edge lines and plays up, each correspond to 36 2D play up in one and play up with monochrome on transparent background.36 edge lines are played up and are 400x400 pixel, and carry out playing up with true color and Common arrangements is taken advantage of in the image of 400 pixels being stored in 14400 pixels in single image file from left to right.Shade overlay file comprises 36 Shading Rendering similarly, each correspond to 36 2D play up in one and play up with monochrome on transparent background.36 Shading Rendering are 400x400 pixel equally, and Common arrangements is taken advantage of in the image of 400 pixels being stored in 14400 pixels in single image file from left to right.Thumbnail file comprises 36 thumbnails equally, each correspond to 36 2D play up in one and to play up lower color depth than 2D and resolution is played up.36 thumbnails are that 50 pixels are wide and 100 pixels are high, and from left to right Common arrangements 1800 pixels in single image file are wide to be taken advantage of in the image that 100 pixels are high being stored in.As other advantage, thumbnail file can also be used to provide the multi-pose 3D of less version to play up to be such as used as preview on Search Results side.
In the exemplary embodiment, four image files (thumbnail, edge lines are played up, Shading Rendering and 2D play up) are sent to client 12 from server 14.First edge lines overlay file can transmit, and is then thumbnail, is then shade overlay file, and is finally that 2D plays up.First viewing application 34 can show edge lines and play up, be filled with the amplification of thumbnail wherein (namely, convergent-divergent) version, add shade, and when comprise file that 2D plays up (namely, maximum file in four files) when having completed transmission, thumbnail is replaced with 2D and plays up.
Certainly, exemplary embodiment described above is only single embodiment, and feature as described herein may carry out other combinations many.
Turn to now viewing application 34, client device 12 must be able to make display device 28 show multi-pose 3D to play up.As described above, watch application 34 to be performed as the small routine run in browser 30 by CPU 20.In certain embodiments, watching application 34 makes user interface be shown in a part for the webpage of display in web browser 30.With reference to Figure 13, the leading element of the many browsers of browser window 150 that such as display device 28 can show when CPU 20 performs browser application 30, comprises title block 152, navigation bar 154, status bar 156 and properties window 158.In properties window 158, the various contents comprising model attributes (not shown) can be shown, and the region of search 157 of the model in certain embodiments, comprised for allowing the user search of client device 12 will show in multi-pose 3D plays up and/or object and the search button 159 be associated.Content area 258 comprises the user interface 160 generated by performing viewing application 34.User interface 160 is divided into plays up window 162 and control area 164.Play up window 162 according to user-selected model or object and further to show multi-pose 3D according to the state of the various controls (being described below) in control area 164 and play up 166.Such as, multi-pose 3D plays up 166 and can comprise played up edge lines 168, the surperficial light and shade 170 played up and the shade 172 played up.
Control area 164 is played up the particular implementation of 166 according to the embodiment of viewing application 34 and multi-pose 3D and can be comprised various control.Usually, control area 164 can comprise " broadcasting " control 174, its can also multi-pose 3D play up 166 be in " broadcasting " pattern time be used as " time-out " control.When being in " broadcasting " pattern, multi-pose 3D plays up 166 and can rotate around one or more axis.Such as, defaultly, activate " broadcasting " control 174 and multi-pose 3D can be made to play up 166 show as and rotate around axis 176, this axis 176 or can not be presented at and play up in window 162.Control area 164 can also comprise direction control 178 and 180, and they make multi-pose 3D play up to show as to rotate around axis 176 with reverse or forward respectively.Slider bar 182 can have instruction and/or control the control 184 of the selected attitude that multi-pose 3D plays up.That is, the movement of control 184 can make multi-pose 3D model 166 rotate.
