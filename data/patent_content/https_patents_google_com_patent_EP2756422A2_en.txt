- the method 300 may be performed by elements of the browser 206, the navigation prediction module 208, and the prerender module 210 acting together. While aspects of the method 300 are described with respect to the computing device 200, the method 300 may also be performed by the server 104, or any device with hardware and/or software designed to accept instructions .
- the computing device 200 receives one or more indicators of navigational intent.
- Navigational intent may be any action that would tend to indicate that the user will generate a particular network request, such as a request for a particular web page.
- the indicators may provide metrics by which to determine what the particular request will be, such as a confidence value.
- the user may navigate to a certain web page, from which they generally navigate to another certain web page based upon their browsing history, or the user may move his mouse cursor towards a particular hyperlink embedded within a web page.
- the indicator is received from a remote server, such as a search engine that embeds an indicator within search results, indicating that most users that submit a particular search query select a particular search result .
- the computing device 200 attempts to predict the most likely navigation event. In short, the computing device 200 makes a best guess of to where the user is likely to navigate next, based upon the indicator. Methods of performing this prediction are described below (see Figures 4-11) .
- the computing device 200 prerenders the content from the predicted next navigation event as determined at stage 304.
- the prerendering process may include storing a prerendered web page within a browser, such as the prerendered web page 218.
- the computing device 200 may prerender a single web page predicted as the most likely navigation event, or the computing device 200 may prerender multiple pages.
- the computing device 200 determines the number of pages to prerender based upon one or more system capabilities of the computing device 200, such as available system resources, available network bandwidth, processor speed, installed memory, and the like. In some aspects, the number of pages to prerender may be configurable in one or more user settings.
- Figure 4 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 400 for predicting a navigation event based on a client navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 400 provides for storing a navigation history for a user, and predicting a next navigation event based upon a navigation history of a particular user.
- the method 400 may be performed by a computing device such as the computing device 200.
- the method 400 may be performed by a navigation prediction module executing on a processor, such as the navigation prediction module 208.
- the computing device 200 tracks a user navigation history.
- the computing device 200 may store records of web pages visited by the user, such as the browsing history commonly maintained in web browsers.
- the browsing history may comprise the URLs of the web pages visited by the user, the order in which the URLs were visited, and the manner in which the user selected the URL (e.g., whether the URL was a clicked hyperlink, typed into an address bar, a redirect operation from another web page, etc.) .
- the computing device 200 determines a most likely navigation event or events based upon the user navigation history.
- the most likely navigation events may be determined by identifying the globally most visited pages for the user, or the navigation events may be associated with one or more current criteria. For example, the computing device 200 may examine the user's navigation history to determine that, when the user is viewing a particular news web page, they almost always select a link to the top news story on that page, or that when the user first opens the browser in the morning, they are likely to navigate to their bank account page to check their daily balance.
- the computing device 200 may employ various rules, heuristics, and filters to determine the most likely navigation event from the user history.
- the computing device 200 may associate each navigation event with a particular confidence value, indicating the likelihood that the user will select each navigation event. These confidence values may then be used to sort the navigation events to determine the most likely navigation event. A method to determine a confidence value for a given navigation event is described further below (see Figure 5) .
- the computing device 200 reports the most likely navigation event as the predicted navigation event. For example, these predicted most likely navigation event may then be employed by the method described above (see Figure 3) to facilitate prerendering of the web pages associated with the most likely navigation event.
- Figure 5 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 500 for computing a confidence value for a URL using a user navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 500 is operable to track navigation events input by the user and to maintain a frequency value for each stored event.
- the method 500 may be employed to build a client navigation history as used by the method 400, and stored on the computing device 200 as the client navigation history 212.
- the computing device 200 tracks the selection of a particular URL. For example, the user may type a URL for a news site into the browser, or click a link on a page.
- the computing device 200 may monitor the navigation events using functionality built into the browser 206, through a browser extension such as a plug-in or toolbar, or via a third party application executing in tandem with the browser.
- the computing device 200 increments a frequency value associated with the URL selected at stage 502.
- the computing device 200 may track a frequency value associated with each URL selected by a user.
- the frequency value is a data metric used to rank a number of visits to a particular web site or the number of times a particular navigation event is selected.
- the computing device 200 may increment the frequency value associated with the URL, for example by 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, .5, or any other value.
- the frequency value associated with the URL represents how often the user has selected the particular URL, and thus is an indicator of how likely the user is to select the URL in the future.
- the computing device 200 time decays the stored frequency values for the URLs after a given "sweep interval" . Decaying the URL frequency values in this manner allows for current browsing habits to be more heavily weighted than previous browsing habits.
- the computing device 200 may execute the sweep every 30 seconds, every minute, or every 5 minutes during which the user has selected at least one URL.
- the sweep interval may be conducted in response to the selection of at least one URL during a particular sweep interval to ensure that the navigation history values are not decayed below a threshold value during periods where the user is inactive.
- the sweep may decay the stored frequency value associated with the URL by a particular value, such as .99, .5, or 1.0, or by a percentage value, such as 5%, 10%, or 50%.
- the URL may be removed from the list of possible navigation destinations to avoid the list growing too large.
- the frequency values for the URLs may be persisted to a local storage on the computing device 200, or sent to a remote storage such as provided by the server 104.
- the stored frequency values may be used to determine the relative frequency with which the user visits particular web sites.
- the frequency value thus provides a basis from which a confidence value associated with a navigation event leading to each web site may be derived.
- the frequency value itself may be provided as the confidence value.
- the confidence value is determined by comparing a frequency value for a particular web page with the entire user navigation history. For example, the navigation event with the higher frequency value may be associated with a particular percentage confidence value, the second highest frequency value a lower percentage, and the like.
- the confidence value is determined by frequency value by the total number of logged navigation events. For example, the frequency value of a particular URL may be divided by the sum of all frequency values to determine a confidence value.
- a user may be in the process of buying a home, and thus regularly checking financial and banking websites for mortgage rates. During this time, these financial and banking sites would have high values and thus be more likely to be prerendered, thus improving the user experience while searching for a mortgage rate. After completing the home purchase process, the user is likely to lose interest in day to day rate fluctuations, and thus it is no longer optimal to prerender these websites, since the user is unlikely to visit them. As such, providing for a time decay value allows these sites to fall off of the list over time .
- FIG. 6 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 600 for predicting a navigation event based on an aggregate navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 600 is operable to track navigation events voluntarily submitted by users to determine likely navigation patterns .
- the navigation patterns are then analyzed, such as by a server 104, and supplied to the user to facilitate navigation event prediction during the browsing process.
- a server such as the server 104, may send updates to a computing device, such as the computing device 200, as the user browses to different pages, to provide information on which link displayed on a given page is most likely to be selected based on the aggregate navigation history .
- the server 104 receives a set of navigation information comprising a browsing history.
- the browsing history is preferably provided by using an "opt- in/out” method, where the user specifically enables (or disables) reporting functionality to provide elements of their browsing history to the server 104.
- personally identifying data can be anonymized and aggregated before it is stored or used, such that no personal information is stored or accessible.
- a browsing history may be tracked and provided to the server 104 via a browser plug-in or toolbar installed on the user's computing device which tracks the user's browsing history, or by the web browser itself.
- the browsing history may be combined with other received browsing histories to create a set of aggregate data used in a similar manner as the client navigation history described with respect to Figure 4, to predict a likely navigation event.
- the received navigation history may be anonymized to remove any personally identifying information.
- the received navigation history is received with individual URLs and/or transitional URL pairs provided in a hashed data format to remove any personally identifying information prior to transmission to the server 104.
- the server 104 determines a confidence value for each URL on a particular web page, based on the navigation information received at stage 602.
- the server may employ a method similar to that disclosed above with respect to Figure 5 for generating confidence values for URLs on a page, except the navigation events are determined based upon aggregated data instead of specific user data.
- the server 104 may compute confidence values based upon the frequency values derived from the navigation information. In some aspects, confidence values are determined by the percentage of the time that users selected a particular navigation event when they were presented with the choice to select the particular navigation event.
- the transitional URL pairs provide for the determination of a confidence value by dividing a frequency value of a source/destination URL pair by a total number of appearances of the source URL.
- the server may determine navigation events based upon transitions from a first page to a second page, rather than from a pure visit frequency metric.
- the server 104 may maintain an index of web pages and associated URLs and confidence values for each link on the web page, such as in a database. For example, a news site may have five URLs pointing to different news stories.
- the server 104 may receive aggregate data indicating that one of the five news stories is selected 60% of the time, with the other four being selected 10% of the time each. As such, the server 104 would index the page in a database with a 60% likelihood for the first story link, and 10% likelihoods for each of the other four story links .
- the server 104 maintains history data in a confidential manner, such as by converting each URL to a hash value at stage 606.
- the server 104 may provide predicted URL data to a client device without disclosing any personal user data. For example, a user may visit a banking web page that has a particular user name and password login. Depending upon the user, the banking web page may provide URLs to each account the user possesses. Each user accessing the page may have a different set of links provided, depending upon the accounts the user has with the bank.
- the server 104 may provide confidence values that are not associable to links on the page unless the user also possesses access to the same links (e.g., the client can apply the hash function to links they already possess on the currently viewed page to determine if the confidence values apply) .
- the hash value is computed by the computing device 200 prior to sending navigation history data to the server 104. In this manner, the server 104 may receive the navigation history data in the hashed format, without the need to compute a hash value.
- the server 104 transmits the hash values and confidence values associated with the hash values to a client device, such as the computing device 200.
- the transmittal may be in response to a request from the computing device 200 for a particular URL.
- the server 104 may transmit the hash values and confidence values in response to a request for such values from a service executing on the client device 200. For example, when the computing device 200 requests the news web page described above, the server 104 provides the hash values and confidence values for the five story links present on that page.
- the computing device 200 may also request data for particular link hash values by first generating a hash value on the client side, then requesting a confidence value for the particular hash value from the server 104.
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram depicting an example method 700 for computing a confidence value for navigation events associated with a URL using an aggregate navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 700 serves to compare navigation events from a given URL received from a plurality of users, in order to determine how likely each individual navigation event is .
- the confidence values may be determined in relation to a particular "source" web page, with different confidence values for each URL depending upon the page the user is currently viewing. For example, the confidence values may be used above as described with respect to stage 604 of the method 600 (see Figure 6 ) .
- the server 104 examines received browsing histories and computes a number of instances for each navigation event as associated with a particular URL.
- the instance value may be a percentage or a raw number .
- the server 104 may determine if the number of visits to the URL exceeds a minimum threshold of statistical significance. For example, five visits to a particular URL may not provide statistically significant data sufficient to reasonably predict a likely navigation event away from the URL. For example, if the number of instances of the event is less than 1000, the server 104 may proceed to stage 710, and not calculate a probability for the event because the sample size is insufficient.
- the server 104 may determine if a minimum number of users have submitted data regarding the URL to provide statistically significant data. For example, the method 700 may require that at least 50 users have provided data in order to compute and store a confidence value for the navigation event. Otherwise the method 700 may proceed to stage 710 and disregard the event until a sufficient number of users have provided data. As above, the threshold value may fluctuate depending upon the size of the dataset.
- the server 104 determines a window size of recent instances.
- the window size refers to the number of latest visits to the URL that will be examined to determine the confidence value, or a length of time to search back through the instances.
- the window size may be determined based on the amount of traffic the URL receives, how often the content of the URL changes. For example, a news website that has constantly changing content might require a small instance window, because links from the regularly changing URL would grow stale. A website with a small amount of traffic would typically require a longer window size in order to gather enough results for statistical significance.
- the window size might be set at 50 instances, 100 instances, 1000 instances, all instances within the last hour, within the last day, within the last week, or the like.
- the server 104 computes the number of times each particular navigation event, such as the next URL visited for the current URL, occurs within the instances defined by the window size determined at stage 710. For example, out of 1000 visits to a news website, a particular article might be selected 600 times, resulting in a confidence value of 60% for navigating to that article from the URL.
- While the present example primarily relates to determination of a navigation event based upon a number of accesses as a percentage of total navigation events, additional heuristics may also be used to derive the likely event based upon information supplied by the user, such as the previous navigation event (e.g., the website that led to the currently analyzed URL), the time of day (e.g., users are more likely to check news sites when in the morning when they arrive at work), the user's location (e.g., users in a particular geographic region are likely to check sports scores for local teams), or other demographic information.
- the previous navigation event e.g., the website that led to the currently analyzed URL
- the time of day e.g., users are more likely to check news sites when in the morning when they arrive at work
- the user's location e.g., users in a particular geographic region are likely to check sports scores for local teams
- the server 104 optionally compares the confidence values for the navigations events from the URL with a threshold value. If the confidence values do not meet the threshold value, the server 104 may identify a subset of available navigation events, as possible predicted likely navigation events. In this manner the server 104 avoids predicting navigation events when the event does not have a statistically significant likelihood of occurring, thus potentially saving bandwidth on prerender operations on pages that are unlikely to be visited.
- the threshold may be set at a variety of different values, such as 5%, 25%, 50%, or 75%. In some aspects, the threshold may be dynamically altered based upon the number of navigation links present at the URL, the type of URL, the traffic of the URL, the speed at which content changes at the URL, and the like. If the confidence values do not meet the minimum threshold, the server 104 may filter out the possible events that do not meet the minimum threshold .
- the method 700 ends after computing and storing the confidence values for the navigation events associated with the URL.
- Figure 8A is a flow diagram depicting an example method 800 for predicting a navigation event based on an aggregate navigation history using hash values to anonymously manage link data in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the method 800 provides logic by which a computing device 200 may predict a navigation event based upon data received from a server 104, such as the data generated by the method 700 described with respect to Figure 7.
- the computing device 200 receives a set of data from a remote server 104, the set of data comprising information associated with an aggregate browsing history of a web page.
- This aggregate data may be received in response to a request made by the computing device 200 in response to navigating to a particular web page.
- the aggregate data may represent a collection of data received by a remote server from a plurality of users.
- a web browser plug-in may allow the user to "opt-in/out" of functionality that may send their anonymized navigation history to a remote server.
- the remote server may then collect navigation histories from a plurality of users, stored as an aggregate navigation history, such as described above (see Figure 7) .
- the navigation prediction module 208 may generate a request to the server 104 every time the user navigates to a web page, for the aggregate browsing data associated with that web page. The navigation prediction module 208 may then predict a likely next navigation event using the received data, so as to supply the prerender module with a next page to prerender to improve the browsing experience .
- the computing device 200 associates the received hash values and confidence values with the links present on the current URL.
- the computing device computes a hash value for each link on the current page using the same hash function as used by the server 104 to anonymize the link data.
- the hash value is computed on the computing device prior to sending navigation history data to the server. In such cases, the hash value would match the original computed value determined by the computing device prior to the navigation event being transmitted to the server, rather than a value computed on the server.
- the computing device 200 compares the computed hash values with the received hash values from the server 104. In this manner, the computing device 200 may match the confidence values and hash values received from the server 104 with the links available for the user to select on the currently viewed web page. The confidence values indicate a likelihood that a particular navigation event associated with the hash value will be selected. The computing device 200 may thus map the currently viewable links with the received confidence values.
- the computing device 200 identifies the link or links with the highest confidence value or values as the predicted next navigation event.
- the method 800 ends after predicting the next navigation event.
- Figure 8B is an illustration of an example interface 810 of a web browser employing an example method for predicting a user navigation event based on a navigation history in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.
- the illustration depicts a web browser interface 810 displaying a web site and a set of navigation history data 812.
- the web page 810 comprises one or more links 814, 816, 818, 820. These links 814, 816, 818, 820 may be URLs that, when selected by a user, direct the web browser to display a set of content associated with the selected link.
- the navigation history data 812 comprises data associated with the links 814, 816, 818, and two other links, Link E and Link F that are not present for the current user viewing the page.
- the navigation history data 812 may represent an analysis of the individual user's navigation history (See Figures 4-5, 9-11), or an aggregate navigation history (See Figures 6-11) .
- the navigation history 812 comprises information about the links 814, 816, 818, and a confidence value associated with each link.
- the navigation history 812 may be used by other aspects of a computing device 200, such as the navigation prediction module 208, to predict the next navigation event. For example, in the present illustration, according to the navigation history 812, there is a 30% chance the user will select Link A 814, a 60% chance the user will select Link B 816, and a 5% chance the user will select Link C 818. Link D 820 does not have any associated data stored in the navigation history 812. The lack of data for Link D 820 may be explained in a variety of manners, such as that the chance of selection of Link D 820 is below a threshold value, or that no data has been submitted for Link D 820.
- the navigation history 812 also displays a non-zero chance of selecting two links that are not present, Link E and Link F. These links may have been removed from the web page in an update, or they may not be visible to all users, such as the user currently accessing the page.
- the navigation prediction module 208 identifies Link B 814 as a predicted next navigation event because the confidence value of Link B 814 is greater than the values for Link A 812 and Link C 818.
- Figure 9 illustrates an example of directed graph for storing navigation events.
- This graph shows one possible implementation of the client navigation history 212 as described above (see Figure 2) .
- the graph depicted in Figure 9 provides a reference to each navigation event (e.g., a website URL) as a vertex in the graph, with the edges weighted by the number of visits to a destination navigation event from a source address.
- a navigation event e.g., a website URL
- edge weights are updated, and new edges are generated.
- the directed graph may be associated with a particular user, a particular group or subset of users, all users in aggregate, or any other division as appropriate for predicting future navigation events .
- the directed graph may be stored locally or remotely, as described above with respect to client navigation histories and aggregate navigation histories (see Figures 2, 4-8A) .
- navigation histories maintained remotely may be maintained in an opt-in manner, requiring users to explicitly allow their navigation history to be stored for use in prediction of navigation events. Data maintained in this manner may be anonymized and depersonalized in order to protect user privacy .
- higher order graphs may be constructed from a map where the key is the last "n" visited navigation events and the value is an array of pairs of destination addresses and counts.
- a first order model might depict a single address pair transition (e.g., address A -> address B) to predict the first destination
- a second order model might by keyed using a pair of source addresses, and predict a third address as a destination (e.g., when the user starts at address A, and then navigates to address B, what is the likely next event?) .
- Higher order models are also possible, with increasingly lengthy navigation histories being examined to determine the likely navigation event.
- the directed graph depicted in Figure 9 is associated with a two part navigation history (e.g., "n" is equal to two), where the site previously viewed is "URL F," and the current site is the source vertex in the graph (e.g., URL A, B, C, D, or E) .
- navigation prediction operations may be weighted by the length of the history examined. Prediction operations may also require a minimum number of occurrences, or they may be weighted by the number of occurrences in order to prevent a long navigation history with a single instance from overriding a shorter history with an overwhelming data count.
- Prediction operations may also be performed using a subset of the recent navigation history.
- a set of previously viewed pages A, B, and C may be indicative of a certain navigation pattern (e.g., after the user visits A, B, and C in any particular order, the user then tends to visit site D) .
- a user visiting sites A, E, F, C, G, B (in that order) may use the information associated with the "loose" set of previously viewed pages A, B, and C because each of A, B, and C are present within the most recent navigation history, allowing for additional sites to be accessed in between, or modifications in the navigation order.
- An example of a method for predicting a likely navigation event using a directed graph is described below (see Figure 11) .
- FIG 10 is an illustration of an example of a method 1000 for building a directed graph in accordance with aspects of the disclosure. As navigation events occur, they are added to the directed graph for use in navigation prediction operations. Connections between vertices of the graph (e.g., website addresses) are weighted by the number of times the browser navigates from the source vertex (e.g., the source website address) to the destination vertex (e.g., the destination website address).
- vertices of the graph e.g., website addresses
- a navigation event is received. For example, a link may be selected from a website, e-mail, or instant message client, a URL may be typed into an address bar, or another application may initiate a navigation operation (e.g., a selection of a search result provided by a separate search application) .
- a determination is made as to whether the received navigation event corresponds to an entry within a graph.
- the navigation event used as the key to identify a graph may be a plurality of vertices representing a recent navigation history, rather than a single navigation event.
- the counter value defining the weight of an edge of the graph between the current or source URL and the destination URL is incremented.
- an edge from the source "n" navigation events to the destination navigation event may be incremented. In this manner, navigation events between vertices of the graph are stored in the weights of the edges of the directed graph.
- Figure 11 is an illustration of an example of a method 1100 for predicting a navigation event using a directed graph in accordance with aspects of the disclosure. Once created, the directed graph may be used to predict future navigation events based on a past navigation history.
- the past "n" navigation events in a navigation history are determined. For example, the most recent web pages visited by the user may be identified, in the particular order in which the user visited them.
- a navigation event history may be identified for a particular web browser tab or instance, or across all active browser tabs or instances .
- the navigation event history determined at stage 1102 is mapped to a navigation history data graph.
- the navigation event history may be mapped to multiple data graphs, depending upon the length of the history and the "n" order depth of the graphs.
- a navigation history of URL A -> URL B -> URL C -> URL D may map to up to four separate directed graphs, a graph for URL D, a graph for URL C -> URL D, a graph for URL B -> URL C -> URL D, and a graph for URL A -> URL B -> URL C -> URL D.
- a confidence value is determined for the potential destination addresses within the directed graphs determined at stage 1104.
- the potential destination addresses associated with each directed graph may also be compared against the set of addresses present on a current web page. For example, confidence values may not be identified for links that are not active and selectable on the web page the user is viewing .
- the confidence value may be determined using the weights of the edges between the source vertex of the directed graph (e.g., the currently viewed page) and each destination vertex linked to the source vertex.
- the confidence value may be the probability of each navigation event (e.g., the count weight of the possible navigation event divided by the total count of potential next navigation events), weighted such that higher-n entries are given more weight.
- Deeper graphs tend to provide more specific data, but graphs with more data points are better because they are more representative. As such, it may be appropriate to use a formula to determine a weight for each probability given the tradeoffs between different probability calculations. For example, if a data set has 5 graphs of depths 1 through 5, a probability value from each graph might be weighted using the graph depth and the number of samples in the graph.
- One possible formula for determining the weight of each probability value may be:
- weight graph _ depth N * samples _ in _ graph ( Eq . 1 ) [0096] Graph_depth is the number of navigation events used as the key to the graph, samples_in_graph is the number of navigation events stored in the graph, and N is a number greater than 1 used to configure the bias towards graph depth instead of sample size. This formula may determine the weight or significance of each graph, and the probabilities for each URL from each graph may be determined according to that weight .
- one or more likely navigation events are identified using the confidence values determined at stage 1106. For example, all events with a confidence value greater than a threshold value may be identified as likely navigation events (e.g., all navigation events with at least a 50% confidence value, at least a 75% confidence value, or at least a 90% confidence value), a certain number of events with top confidence values may be identified as likely navigation events, or a top navigation event from each examined directed graph may be identified as a likely navigation event.
- one or more likely navigation events are prerendered.
- the present example describes the use of likely navigation events for prerendering, other actions may also be taken to assist the user with accessing the content associated with the likely navigation event.
- the likely navigation events may be presented to the user in a separate interface window for selection, or various prefetching processes may be enabled based upon the probability of each navigation event.
- increasingly aggressive processes are performed in response to the probability of selection of the navigation event. For example, a given navigation event may be prerendered at greater than 90% probability, but only domain name services (DNS) information precached at 60% probability, and no action taken at all at below 10% probability.
- DNS domain name services
- the systems and methods described above advantageously provide for an improved browsing experience.
- the browser can perform prerender operations to minimize the amount of time users wait for web pages to load.
- Multiple methods to perform the prerender operations provide a flexible and robust system for determining the next navigation event .
