Definitions
- This disclosure relates to media advertising.
- An advertiser such as a business entity, can purchase airtime during a television broadcast to air television advertisements.
- Example television advertisements include commercials that are aired during a program break, transparent overlays that are aired during a program, and text banners that are aired during a program.
- the advertiser When an advertiser desires to target a specific television program for advertising, the advertiser will typically purchase a spot that occurs during the airing of the television program on a specific network. However, if the television program airs on other networks, the advertiser must purchase spots from the other network if the advertiser also desires to advertise on the program across two or more networks. Furthermore, if the program is aired on many networks, such as a program that is currently in syndication, then the advertiser will need to engage many networks to determine from which networks spots should be purchased for advertising on the program.
- Engaging multiple networks can be a time-consuming process for the advertiser. Furthermore, ratings information may not be available for many of these networks. Thus the advertiser may be simply left to guess as to which airings of the program and which networks will yield the highest return on investment for an advertising budget. Additionally, demographic information for these networks and programs may not be readily available for the advertiser. Therefore, the advertiser may lose advertising opportunities on other programs that may have a similar demographic.
- Described herein are systems and methods for television advertising.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include receiving a television program query from an advertiser; identifying television programs based on the television program query; providing the identified television programs to the advertiser in response to the television program query; receiving a selection of one of the identified television programs from the advertiser; associating the selected television program with an advertising campaign of the advertiser, the advertising campaign including one or more television advertisements; receiving a request for an advertisement for a television advertisement availability associated with the selected television program, the television advertisement availability scheduled to occur during a scheduled airing of the television program; and selecting, in response to the request, one of the advertisements of the advertising campaign associated with the selected television program for airing during a television advertisement availability associated with the selected television program.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Relevant and effective advertisements for millions of television provider subscribers can be targeted to specific television programs locally and/or nationwide.
- the relevant advertisements can be selected by the advertiser, or, optionally, can be automatically selected by an advertising system configured to identify advertisements that are relevant to the specific television programs.
- an advertiser can be provided with a list of additional programs that have similar demographics to television programs that are selected by the advertiser, thus increasing advertising opportunities.
- the system can be implemented organically or can be implemented with third-party infrastructure partners.

- FIG. 13 is a flow diagram of an example process for filtering television programs for advertising.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example television advertisement system 100 .
- the television advertising system 100 can, for example, deliver relevant content (e.g., advertisements, and hereinafter referred to generally as advertisements) advertisements to viewers to facilitate operator monetization of programming and quantification of advertisement delivery to target markets.
- the television advertising system 100 can, for example, be implemented on one or computer servers, and can provide and receive data over a network.
- Example networks include local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), telephonic networks, and wireless networks (e.g., 802.11x compliant networks, satellite networks, cellular networks, etc.).
- the television advertising system 100 can, for example, communicate over several different types of networks, e.g., the Internet, a satellite network, and a telephonic network.
- the television advertising system 100 can receive television advertisements and advertisement campaign data from an advertiser 140 , e.g. an entity that provides television advertisements, such as a commercial entity that sells products or services, an advertising agency, or a person.
- the television advertising system 100 can facilitate the provisioning of television advertisements to a television provider 160 , e.g., an entity that facilitates the delivery of a television broadcast to viewers, such as cable provider, a digital satellite provider, a streaming media provider, or some other media provider.
- the provider 160 can, for example, receive a provider agent 162 from the television advertisement system 100 .
- the provider agent 162 can, for example, be located at an advertising broadcast insertion location of the provider 162 , e.g., at a head end of the provider.
- the provider agent 162 can, for example, receive advertisement availability schedules from the provider 160 and provide the advertisement availability schedules to the television advertising system 100 .
- the provider agent 162 can read schedule requests, either in real time or ahead of time, and identify which schedule times the television advertising system 100 has permission to fill with advertisements provided by the television advertising system 100 .
- the provider agent 162 can determine if one or more advertisements already scheduled or should/can be preempted or receive information that a scheduled advertisement should be preempted in accordance with one or more criteria (e.g., to improve revenue generation for the provider, or if an advertiser's budget has been depleted after a related advertisement was scheduled, etc.).
- the provider agent 162 can request the television advertising system 100 to identify a relevant advertisement for an identified airtime advertisement spot, e.g., an open advertisement slot or a preempted advertisement slot.
- the advertisement can be deemed relevant based on advertisement meta data and an advertisement context, e.g., an advertisement for extreme sporting equipment for an advertisement having an available advertising budget may be selected for airing during a televised sporting event for which the meta data identifies as a primary demographic 18-30 year old males.
- the television advertising system 100 can, for example, select candidate advertisements to air during an advertisement availability based on account advertiser bids, budgets, and any quality metrics that have been collected, e.g., conversions, viewer actions, impressions, etc.
- advertisements can be selected to air during the advertisement availability according to a computer-implemented auction.
- One exampling auction is a Vickrey-style in which each advertiser pays the bid of the next highest advertisement.
- Other auction processes can also be used, e.g., setting an advertiser bid equal to the estimated number of viewer impressions multiplied by the price an advertiser has offered to pay for each impression, etc.
- the bidding types can be cost per airing, a cost per impression, a cost per full viewing of the advertisement, a cost per partial viewing of the advertisement, etc.
- Other types of costs per actions can also be use, such as phone calls resulting from phone call solicitations; a cost per network airing (e.g., $5.00 per 1000 impressions on a first network, $6.00 per 1000 impressions on a second network), cost per action scaled by the time of day, etc.
- An auction process can, for example, support ads with different or even multiple (hybrid) bidding types.
- the advertisements selected from the television advertising system 100 auction, the advertisement air time, and/or the advertisement can be provided to the provider 160 .
- all available advertisements, or a subset thereof, can be provided to the provider 160 prior to airing, and the provider agent 162 need only receive an advertisement identifier indicating which advertisement is to air during particular advertisement air time.
- the provider agent 162 can thereafter provide a status to the television advertisement system 100 regarding when the advertisement aired.
- the provider agent 162 can also, for example, provide anonymized impression data related to viewing devices 164 a - 164 n .
- logs related to viewing device 164 activity e.g., set top box logs, can be anonymized to remove personal information related to viewing activities and provided to the television advertising system 100 .
- such information can be provided by the provider 160 , or by a third party.
- the television advertising system 100 can charge an advertiser a fee for airing the advertisement.
- the fee can, for example, be substantially in proportion to the number of impressions determined for a particular airing of an advertisement.
- the fee can, for example, be based on the bidding type.
- the bid may be based on a cost per airing, and thus an advertiser would be charged a fee for the airing of the advertisement.
- Other fee determinations can also be used.
- impressions can, for example, be measured statistically.
- An impression can be a household impression, e.g., the airing of an advertisement in household and independent of the number of televisions in a household. If the advertisement is aired on a viewing device in the household, one household impression can be recorded.
- Other impression types can also be used. For example, impressions can be generated by a program rating percentage, e.g., a percentage of viewership in measurable households; or by a program share percentage, e.g., a percentage of viewership in active measured homes; or by some other statistical measurement.
- impressions can be measured by an analysis of activity logs of the viewing devices 164 .
- a household may have three viewing devices 164 , and at a given time two of the devices may be tuned to a first channel and the third device may be tuned to a second channel. If a first commercial airs on the first channel and a second commercial airs on the second channel, impressions can be generated for each viewing device.
- An impression can be dependant on a channel tune status when an advertisement airs on a channel.
- an impression can occur when a viewing device 164 is tuned to a broadcast stream in which an advertisement is inserted, and the viewing device 164 remains tuned to the broadcast stream for N consecutive seconds during the actual display time of the insertion.
- an impression can be defined as a viewing device remaining tuned to a broadcast stream for five seconds after the advertisement begins to air.
- an impression can be defined as a viewing device tuned to a broadcast stream when an advertisement is airing and remaining tuned to the broadcast stream for five seconds after tuning to the broadcast stream. Other tune times can also be used.
- impressions can also be used.
- an impression can be based on an advertisement exposure, e.g., a brief exposure of an advertisement, or a full viewing of the advertisement, of a threshold viewing in between, e.g., five seconds, or five seconds of the first fifteen seconds; or a percentage of the advertisement viewed, etc.
- the television advertisement system 100 can also include one or more data stores to store television advertisements and associated data, e.g., meta data related to the television advertisements, performance data related to the television advertisements, accounting data related to the advertisers and television advertisements, etc.
- the television advertising system 100 includes an advertisement data store 102 , an advertisement parameter store 104 , a log data store 106 , a performance data store 108 , and an out of band data store 110 . Additional advertisement related data can also be stored, e.g., an accounting data store 112 can store accounting data.
- the television advertisement data store 102 can, for example, include advertisements that can be broadcast or aired during an advertisement spot.
- Example television advertisements include video advertisements, banner advertisements, overlay advertisements, such as logos, URLs, dynamic pricing information for an advertisement, etc., and other advertisements that can be used to convey information visually and/or aurally during a television broadcast.
- the television advertisement parameter data store 104 can, for example, include cost per action parameters, frequency values, competitive restrictions, advertising budget data, geographic data, targeting data, etc.
- the television advertisement parameters 104 can, for example, be specified by the advertiser 140 , and/or can be automatically updated based on the performance of advertisements during an advertisement campaign.
- the log data store 106 can include data logs from viewing devices 164 , e.g., set top boxes, satellite receivers, etc.
- the log data can include reporting data that identifies channel tunes, e.g., a channel identifier to which the viewing device was tuned, and channel tune times, e.g., the times that the viewing device was tuned to a channel.
- Other data can also be included, e.g., key presses of remote devices associated with the viewing devices 164 , commands received by the viewing devices 164 , etc.
- the log data can include a list of recorded programs, and for each recorded program a record that indicates whether the recorded program has been played back, and the actions taken during playback, such as fast forwarding or skipping commercials can be included.
- the performance data store 108 can, for example, include quality data, e.g., a total number of impressions for each advertisement, or an impression rate for each advertisement, and/or other quality parameter and/or impression parameters.
- Example impression rates include a percentage of total potential viewers, e.g., the number of identified impressions divided by the number of subscribers; a percentage of actual impressions of a total number of impressions, e.g., a percentage of reliable impressions divided by a total number of impressions.
- An example reliable impression is an impression that satisfies a rule set or condition that determines that the impression was likely viewed on a viewing device by one or more persons.
- performance data can also be stored in the performance data store 108 , e.g., performance of a particular advertisement during particular programming, the probability that viewers will tune to another channel during an advertisement; the probability that viewers will fast-forward through the advertisement; etc.
- Such probabilities can be normalized to average behavior on a per-advertisement basis, or on a per-time slot basis, or on some other measurable basis.
- Performance data can also include data related to how much of an advertisement a viewer watched when the advertisement aired. For example, statistics related to aggregate tune-in and tune-out times; number of viewers, etc. can be measured and evaluated to determine quality data related to advertisements based on viewing percentages.
- the out of band data store 100 can, for example, include data related to the relevance or popularity of particular advertisements, advertisement subject matter, and television programs. For example, web pages can be mined to determine whether particular television programs are expected to have increased viewership, e.g., a sudden increase in fan pages for a program can be correlated to an increase in an expected ratings value, and the resulting data can be stored in the out of band data store 110 . Other data can include data related to search queries, page views on an advertise site, etc.
- the out of band data store 110 can, for example, store date resulting from mining a video web site to identify television advertisements that are particularly popular, e.g., a video web site may record viewing statistics that indicate a particularly humorous advertisement is relatively popular among a certain demographic. Such data can be used to further refine the advertising selection process.
- web sites related to television programs can be mined to determine relevance of products or services related to the television program. For example, a particular program may reference a product in an episode, and the mining of fan sites related to the program may reveal that the product mention has generated a significant interest in the product and related products. Accordingly, advertisements related to the product and related products may be deemed more relevant for time slots during the program.
- the accounting data store 112 can, for example, store accounting data related to advertisements and advertisers 140 .
- the accounting data store 112 can store such data as campaign budgets, monthly spend parameters, and account balances for advertisers.
- Other data can also be stored, such as data that can be utilized to adjust viewing forecasts, adjust pricing models, adjust relevancy measures, etc.
- performance data related to certain products or services advertised e.g., anonymized historical campaign data, trend analysis of program viewership, e.g., viewing statistics of program series episodes in first run, repeat, and syndication, etc. can be stored for analysis.
- data related to advertisements that were aired during time slots not served by the advertisement system 100 can be stored to analyze other advertising market models, e.g., fixed priced advertising markets, reserved advertising markets, etc.
- the advertisement data store 102 , advertisement parameter store 104 , log data store 106 , performance data store 108 , the out of band data store 110 and the accounting data store 112 can be implemented separately or in combination.
- the advertisement data store 102 , advertisement parameter store 104 and performance data store 108 can be implemented in a single advertisement database. Other combinations and/or subcombinations can also be used.
- the television advertisement system 100 can include an advertisement front end engine 120 , an advertisement distribution engine 122 , a scheduler engine 124 , a candidate engine 126 , a reporting engine 128 , and an accounting engine 130 .
- the advertisement front end engine 120 , advertisement distribution engine 122 , scheduler engine 124 , candidate engine 126 , reporting engine 128 , and accounting engine 130 can, for example, be distributed among a plurality of computer devices, e.g. server computers communicating over a network, or can be implemented on a single computer, e.g., as multiple threads on a server computer. Other implementation architectures can also be used.
- the advertisement front end engine 120 , advertisement distribution engine 122 , scheduler engine 124 , candidate engine 126 , reporting engine 128 , and accounting engine 130 can, for example, be implemented in software, such as executable object code, interpreted script instructions, or in combinations of executable and interpreted instructions. Other software and/or hardware implementations can also be used.

- the provider agent 162 or the distribution engine 122 can initiate the download, and upon successful completion the provider agent 162 can notify the television advertising system 100 of a successful download.
- the television advertising system 100 can, for example, label the download with a particular ID that can be later used during scheduling to identify the scheduled advertisement.
- the publisher 160 can receive an advertisement identifier associated with an advertisement availability, e.g., a time slot, and can retrieve the advertisement locally at the television provider 160 premises and insert the selected advertisement into the broadcast stream.
- the television advertisement scheduler engine 124 can, for example, be configured to receive a television advertisement request defining a television advertisement availability from the television provider 160 , and issue a request for candidate television advertisement data, e.g., data related to advertisements that are candidates for being selected to fill the advertisement availability.
- the television advertisement request can include geographic data, provider identification, network data, program data, and other data.
- a request can specify advertisements that can be shown in the geographic area of the USA/California/Bay Area/Mountain View, with an identifier of XX of a television provider, for a television provider YY, on a television network ZZ, to be scheduled within the time window of Monday 2:00 PM-3:00 PM, and at a preferred time of 2:16 PM.
- the candidate engine 126 can, for example, be configured to identify candidate television advertisement data in response to the request for candidate television advertisement data. The identification can be based on data associated with the television advertisements, such as the data stored in the advertisement parameter data store 104 .
- the candidate engine 126 can implement various targeting and/or filtering rules. For example, a budget restriction can be imposed if an advertiser budget is nearly depleted, and the expected fee for airing the advertisement based on expected impressions would exceed the remaining advertising budget.
- Other example rules include the advertisement being successfully downloaded to the television provider 160 ; the advertisement targeting the location or a superset of the location where the advertisement will be showing; the advertiser 140 or advertisement must not be considered fraudulent or delinquent; the publisher 160 has approved the advertisement for showing; the advertisement is targeting this particular television network and/or time; the advertisement is targeting a television program which, through internal or third party data sources, corresponds to the given request; and the advertisement is targeting a demographic profile which, through internal or third party data sources, corresponds to the given request. Fewer or more filtering and targeting conditions can also be applied.
- the television advertisement scheduler engine 124 can select one or more television advertisements to air during the television advertisement availability. The selection can be based on the television advertisement request and the candidate television advertisement data.
- the television advertisement request can be utilized to determine a context, e.g., the context of the programming associated with the advertisement, such as a sporting event, an entertainment genre, a news program, etc.; or the context of the television network, e.g., a network type; or the context of a television channel; or the context of the time of day; or a combination of any of such examples.
- the context can be utilized to determine a relevancy score, and the relevancy score can be utilized to scale an auction result so that bids related to advertisements that are more relevant to the identified context are scaled higher than bids related to less relevant advertisements.
- the scheduler engine 124 and/or the candidate engine 126 can enforce advertisement restrictions.
- the scheduler engine 124 and/or the candidate engine 126 can filter the advertisements to eliminate unwanted advertisements, e.g., frequency capping can be performed to limit the scheduling of certain advertisements based on an amount of time since the advertisement was last aired; competitive restrictions can be applied so that one advertisement cannot be placed near another advertisement of a competitor, etc.
- the reporting engine 128 can, for example, receive television advertisement report data from the provider 160 and determine whether the selected television advertisement aired based on the television advertisement report data. For example, an advertisement may not air due to a programming irregularity, e.g., a sporting event going beyond a scheduled broadcast, an interruption to scheduled programming due to breaking news, etc.
- the reporting engine 128 can process reporting logs, e.g., set top box logs from viewing devices 164 to determine advertisement impressions.

- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an example television advertisement distribution system 300 .
- the advertisement distribution system 300 can, for example, be implemented in the advertisement system 100 of FIG. 1 .
- the advertisement distribution system 300 facilitates the storing of advertisements on a local data store, e.g., local store 166 , associated with the television advertiser 160 .
- the storage of the advertisement at a local store 166 can, for example, facilitate real-time or near real-time auctioning and scheduling of advertisements, e.g., auctioning and scheduling advertisements for available time slots or spots only hours or even minutes before the occurrence of the time slot.
- the provider agent 162 can communicate with the advertisement distribution engine 122 to determine whether advertisements are available for storage on the local store 166 . In some implementations, the provider agent 162 can poll the advertisement distribution engine 122 periodically, e.g., daily, weekly, etc. In another implementation, the advertisement distribution engine 122 can send a notification to the provider agent 162 when an advertisement is available for download, e.g., in response to the provider 160 approving one or more advertisements.
- the advertisement distribution engine 122 can direct the provider agent 162 and a video streamer, e.g., the video steamer 212 , to establish a communication session for downloading the advertisements from the advertisement store 102 to the local store 166 . Additional data can also be downloaded, e.g., an advertisement identifier, or other advertisement parameters, e.g., stored in the advertisement parameter store 104 .
- the provider agent 162 can send an acknowledgement signal to the advertisement distribution engine 122 .
- the acknowledgment signal can, for example, be utilized to associate an advertisement with a television provider location, and to indicate that the television advertisement is stored in a local store 166 at the locus of the provider 160 .
- the advertisement distribution engine 122 can evaluate advertisement parameters stored in the advertisement parameter store 104 to determine which providers 160 the advertisements should be distributed. For example, if the advertisement parameters specify that an advertisement is related to a California marketing campaign, the advertisement will only be distributed to providers 160 that service the California market.
- the advertisement can be transcoded by the advertisement system 100 into a presentation format specified by the provider 160 .
- the provider 160 can receive the advertisement in a standard format, e.g., and MPEG format, and transcode the advertisement into a suitable presentation format.

- the candidate engine 126 can implement various targeting and/or filtering rules as described with respect to FIG. 1 above.
- the scheduling engine 124 can select one or more television advertisements to air during the television advertisement availability defined in the availability schedule 402 .
- the selection can be based on the availability schedule 402 , e.g., the time slots and associated context, and the candidate television advertisement data.
- the context can be utilized to determine a relevancy score, and the relevancy score can be utilized to scale an auction result so that bids related to advertisements that are more relevant to the identified context are scaled higher than bids related to less relevant advertisements.
- the scheduling engine 124 can utilize a Vickrey-style auction based on a cost per action, e.g., a cost per 1000 impressions, or a cost per network ($5.00 on network M, $6.00 on network Y), etc., multiplied by a quality score, e.g., a historical impression rate associated with the advertisement, such as a number of viewers that are determined to have viewed the advertisement divided by the total number of viewers that received the advertisement.
- a quality score e.g., a historical impression rate associated with the advertisement, such as a number of viewers that are determined to have viewed the advertisement divided by the total number of viewers that received the advertisement.
- Other factors that can be used to determine the quality score can be derived from the performance data stored in performance data store 108 , e.g., the performance of a particular advertisement during particular programming, the probability that viewers will tune to another channel during an advertisement; the probability that viewers will fast-forward through the advertisement; etc.
- the scheduling engine 124 may determine an auction rank of the advertisements by multiplying the maximum cost per action for the advertisements by the quality score of the advertisements.
- QS quality score
- the rank of advertisements A, B, and C can be determined as follows:
- the advertisers can thus be ranked as follows:
- the advertisement B would be selected and displayed during the advertisement spot.
- Other auction processes can also be used.
- each spot can be auctioned separately.
- an entire pod can be auctioned, and the highest ranked advertisements can be selected for showing during the pod. For example, if the auction illustrated above for advertisements A, B and C was conducted for a pod of two advertisement spots, commercials B and C would be selected.
- an impression rate can be set to an initial default value, e.g., a rate equal to an aggregate impression rate for advertisements in a related demographic or targeting area, and can thereafter be modified based on historical performance.
- the scheduler engine 124 and/or the candidate engine 126 can enforce advertisement restrictions.
- the scheduler engine 124 and/or the candidate engine 126 can filter the advertisements to eliminate unwanted advertisements, e.g., competitive restrictions can be applied so that one advertisement cannot be placed near another advertisement of a competitor.
- a television advertisement availability window for an advertisement spot can be generated.
- the advertisement availability window can be time based, e.g., five minutes, or can be advertisement based, e.g., three advertisement spots prior to the advertisement spots and three advertisement spot subsequent to the advertisement spot. Advertisements that have associated competitive restrictions that are exclusive of the competitive restrictions of the television advertisements that are selected to air during the television advertisement availability window can thus be precluded from selection for that availability window.
- an advertisement for company B may only be eligible to auction if an advertisement for company A has not or will not air during the associated advertisement availability window e.g., within a predetermined number of advertisement slots or predetermined amount of time.
- Frequency capping can be performed to limit the scheduling of certain advertisements based on an amount of time since the advertisement was last aired. For example, frequency values associated with the television advertisements can be recorded, e.g., the rate of showings of the advertisements per hour. If a current frequency value of an advertisement exceeds a repetition threshold, the advertisement may be precluded from being shown during an advertisement availability.
- geographic data can be used to filter local advertisements.
- the availability schedule may define an advertisement availability in San Francisco, Calif. Accordingly, targeted local advertisements that are not targeted to San Francisco, e.g., a local car dealership in Los Angeles, Calif., may be precluded from being shown during an advertisement availability for the locality of San Francisco.
- advertisement schedule 404 can be accessed by an inserter 172 and a modulator 174 that are utilized to insert advertisements stored in the local store 166 into a broadcast stream 176 .
- a verification report 406 that includes data indicating whether the advertisement aired can be provided to the provider agent 162 .
- the verification report 406 includes data that indicates whether the advertisement aired, the air time of the advertisement, and the channel on which the advertisement aired.
- the provider agent 162 can, in turn, transmit the verification report 406 to the television advertisement scheduling and reporting system 400 for processing by the reporting engine 128 and storing in the accounting data 112 .
- the accounting engine 130 may then charge any fees due to the corresponding advertiser account.

- the television program query “The Paladin” results in the identification of three television programs: “The Paladin”, “The Firm”, and “Crime and Punishment,” as the three television programs belong to the same genre, i.e., crime dramas.
- the search results can be based on other factors, such as similar audience demographics, similar program ratings, and/or similar program durations.
- television programs are identified based on one or more broad matching functions.
- One example broad matching function is the identification of related television programs based on out of band data, such as hyperlinks identified in fan sites. For example, the television program query “The Paladin” may also result in the programs “The Firm” and “Crime and Punishment” being identified if fan sites indicate a related fan base for these television programs.
- search queries can be matched to terms included in the term clusters for program categories to identify programs. For example, to search for television programs on which to advertise diapers, the advertiser can enter the term “diapers.”
- the television advertisement system 100 receives the query, and identifies term clusters that include the term “diapers” and other related terms, such as “training pants.” In turn, television programs belonging to these term clusters are identified. Thus, the advertiser need not know the titles of particular television programs to find relevant television programs for advertising.
- Programs that are currently shown in the program list 724 can be removed by selecting the remove command 728 , or by selecting the remove command 744 if the program is also shown in the search results.
