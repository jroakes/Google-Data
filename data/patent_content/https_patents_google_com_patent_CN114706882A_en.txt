Description
Description of the cases
The application belongs to divisional application of Chinese patent application 201711019617.8 with application date of 2017, 10 and 26.
Technical Field
This description relates to search engines.
Background
The search query may be used to identify resources (e.g., web pages, images, text documents, email documents, multimedia content, etc.) relevant to the user's needs and to present information related to the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user. The computer system may receive a search query, process the search query, identify results relevant to the search query, and return a set of search results in response to a query submitted by a user.
Disclosure of Invention
In some embodiments, a card trigger term identification unit is provided that can identify additional trigger terms of the structured information card. The card trigger term recognition unit allows tuning the grammar of one or more structured information cards over time by evaluating candidate terms potentially included in the grammar of the structured information cards. For example, it is assumed that the syntax of the "Movie" structured information card includes the terms "Movie time", "Movie ticket confirmation", and "ticket confirmation number". The card trigger term recognition unit may analyze terms and one or more candidate queries associated with the grammar of the "Movie" structured information card and recognize additional trigger terms, such as the trigger term "Movie ticket", of the "Movie" structured information card. Thus, subsequent queries received that include terms such as "Movie time", "Movie ticket", or both, will trigger the display of the "Movie" structured information card in response to such queries.
According to one embodiment, the subject matter of this specification can be embodied in methods that facilitate identifying additional trigger terms for a structured information card. The method can include an act of accessing data associated with a template for presenting structured information in response to a search query, wherein the accessed data references (i) one or more tag terms that, when included in the search query, trigger presentation of the structured information in accordance with the template, and (ii) a value for each of the one or more tag terms, thereby retrieving candidate tag terms that have not been associated with the template for presenting the structured information. For each of the one or more tag terms, identifying one or more entities associated with the tag term, identifying one or more entities associated with the candidate tag term. For each of the one or more entities associated with the candidate tag term, associating with the candidate tag term: (i) one or more of the one or more tag terms associated with the entity, and (ii) for each of the one or more tag terms associated with the entity, a value associated with that tag term; and upon subsequently receiving a search query including the candidate tag term, using one or more values associated with the candidate tag term to determine whether to trigger presentation of the structured information in accordance with the template.
Other versions include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs for performing the actions of the methods encoded on computer storage devices.
These and other versions may optionally include one or more of the following features. For example, in some implementations, the one or more tag terms correspond to one or more parameters of a search query.
In some implementations, the value indicates a number of times the search query has been used to trigger presentation of the structured information.
In some implementations, obtaining candidate tag terms that have not been associated with the template for presenting the structured information can include identifying one or more query terms from a query log.
In some implementations, using the one or more values associated with the candidate tag term to determine whether to trigger presentation of the structured information according to the template can include: aggregating the one or more values associated with the candidate tag terms; determining whether the aggregated value satisfies a predetermined threshold; and in response to determining that the aggregated value satisfies the predetermined threshold, determining that the search query including the candidate tag term will trigger presentation of the structured information.
In some implementations, using the one or more values associated with the candidate tag term to determine whether to trigger presentation of the structured information according to the template can include: aggregating the one or more values associated with the candidate tag terms; determining whether the aggregated value satisfies a predetermined threshold; and in response to determining that the aggregated value exceeds the predetermined threshold, determining that the search query including the candidate tag term will not trigger presentation of the structured information.
In some implementations, the method may further include adjusting the one or more values associated with the candidate tag based on a similarity of the candidate tag to the one or more tag terms.
Each of these and other versions may optionally include one or more of the following features.

Detailed Description
Fig. 1 is a context diagram of an example of a system 100 for identifying additional trigger terms for a structured information card 170. System 100 includes user equipment 110, server 120, and network 130.
In the example of fig. 1, at phase a, assume that the user of user device 110 is standing at an airport ticketing counter in front of the user's flight # 437 to denver, colorado. To check the user's baggage and obtain a boarding pass, the user needs to provide a flight confirmation number for the user's upcoming flight. In response to a request from an airline employee for the user's flight confirmation number, the user of the user device 110 may seek to obtain a confirmation email from the airline that includes the user's flight confirmation number. To obtain the confirmation email, the user enters a search query 112A including the term "Flight Ticket" into a search box 113A of the user interface 111A.
After receiving the search query 112A, the user device 110 may transmit the search query 112A to the server 120 via a network 130, the network 130 including one or more of a LAN, WAN, cellular network, internet, etc. The server 120 can process the search query 112A, identify one or more search results responsive to the search query 112A term "Flight Ticket," and then return 134 the search results to the user device 110. The search results may be received by the user device 110 and provided for display using the interface 111A of the user device 110. In this example, the search results may include references to email documents, such as references 114A, 115A, 116A, 117A, 118A, 119A. The reference may include a link that, when selected, provides an email document associated with the link for display on user device 110. Each respective reference may include text such as the name of the email sender, the subject line of the email, the time the email was received, and the date the email was received.
The search results identified based on the search query term "Flight Ticket" can include emails from a variety of different senders. For example, the search results may include a reference 114A to an email from a theater "ABC Theatre" related to the user buying movie tickets to see "Pilot's First Flight. The search results may also include a reference 115A to an email from the restaurant reservation service "Closed Table" for reserving "Wine Flight Bar". The search results may also include a reference 117A to an email that includes an order confirmation from "DC Outfitters" for the purchase of "Flight Jacker". The search results may also include a plurality of references 116A, 118A, 119A to emails associated with ticket purchase confirmations from Airlines such as "NE Airlines", "SE Airlines", and the like. For example, one particular reference 116A references a confirmation email received by the user after purchasing a ticket for "Flight 437 (Flight 437)" from "NE Airlines".
However, given the set of search results provided in response to the search query 112A, obtaining the flight confirmation number of the user may be quite time consuming. This is because the user must read the sender and subject line of each reference to each respective email in response to the user's search. For example, the correct email including the flight confirmation number cannot be identified even by the sender and subject users who read references 114A, 115A, and 116A. The user of user device 110 must then select reference 116A to request the email document associated with reference 116A. Finally, after the email document corresponding to reference 116A is selected, an email document with the flight confirmation number of the user's upcoming flight # 437 is returned. Although the user can obtain the user's confirmation number, the process is inefficient. Furthermore, the process may be less successful for a number of reasons, such as stress on the user from a long list of non-compliance passengers at the ticket counter behind the user, slow cellular data signals due to poor reception in airport terminals, etc.
The system 100 provides a solution for improving a user's retrieval of information from the user's email inbox. For example, at stage a, the system 100 provides a plurality of structured information cards 142A, 144A, 146A that are stored in a structured information card storage unit 140A. Each structured information card includes a template 152A and a grammar 154A. The template 152A of the structured information card includes one or more predetermined fields that may be populated with information from email documents in response to a particular search query. For example, the structured information storage unit 140A may include a structured information card 142A of "Flight" information. The structured information card 142A of the "Flight" information may include a "To" field, a "From" field, a "parts" field, a "Conf. #" field, and a "Flight #" field.
The server 120 may use the card trigger term identification unit 160 to identify one or more additional terms that may be used to trigger the "Flight" structured information card 142A. The additional terms may be based on, for example, one or more queries received from a search box associated with a user interface displayed by the user device, such as search box 112A of user interface 111A. In some embodiments, the card trigger term recognition unit 160 may obtain a query term from a log of received query terms, determine whether the query term is related to one or more other terms in the syntax of the structured information card, and in some cases, add the query term to the syntax of the structured information card. For example, the card trigger term recognition unit 160 may determine that the term "Flight Ticket" should be added to the grammar 154A of the "Flight" structured information card. The addition of the term "Flight Ticket" to the syntax of the "Flight" structured information card results in an updated structured information storage unit 140B at stage B.
At stage B, a user of the same user device 110 may access the user interface 111B at a later point in time. The user interface 111B may be the same user interface as the user interface 111A. The user may enter search query 112B, which includes the term "Flight Ticket," into search box 113B. In a manner similar to that described with respect to phase a, the user device 110 may transmit 132 the search query 112B to the server 120 via a network 130, the network 130 including one or more of a LAN, WAN, cellular network, internet, or the like. The server 120 can process the search query 112B, identify one or more search results that are responsive to the search query 112B "Flight Ticket", and then return 134 the search results to the user device 110. The search results may be received by the user device 110 and provided for display using the interface 112B of the user device 110. In this example, the search results may include references to email documents, such as references 114B, 115B, 116B, 117B, 118B, 119B. In this example, the search results returned to user device 110 and displayed on user interface 111B are the same references to the same email document as references 114A, 115A, 116A, 117A, 118A, 119A provided for display via user interface 111A.
However, at stage B, user interface 111B also includes structured information card 170. The structured information card 170 can include, for example, a display that includes one or more fields that have been populated with data extracted from resources that are responsive to the search query 112B. Structured information card 170 can be retrieved, populated, and provided for display via user interface 111B because the syntax of structured information card 142B stored in structured information card storage unit 140B now includes the term "Flight Ticket". The term "Flight Ticket" is added to the grammar of "Flight" structured information card 142B based on the analysis by card trigger term recognition unit 160 of existing terms included within the grammar of one or more structured information cards 142A, one or more recognized relationships between existing terms included within the grammar of structured information cards 142A, and one or more recognized relationships between the aforementioned grammar terms and one or more queries previously submitted via search box 113A.
The particular structured information card 170 that is retrieved and displayed may be based on the query terms submitted through the search box 113B. For example, server 120 can select a particular structured information card 170 for display via user interface 111B based on a determination that a search query term, such as "Flight Ticket," matches one or more grammar terms associated with the particular structured information card 170. The server 120 may populate the obtained structured information card with content including the highest ranked search result of the information requested by the fields of the structured information card template 152B. In some implementations, the top ranked search result can be the most recent email document that includes the information requested by the fields of the structured information card template 152B.
The structured information card 170 provides the advantage of displaying relevant information about the user's upcoming flight without requiring the user to read the data associated with each reference 114B, 115B, 116B, 117B, 118B, 119B returned by the server 120 as a result of the search. In addition, the structured information card 170 displays the user's flight destination (e.g., denver, colorado), the user's flight origin (e.g., washington, d.c.), the user's flight departure time (e.g., 11:45 am, eastern standard time), the user's flight confirmation number (e.g., KP4EG), and the user's flight number (e.g., 437). Thus, the user does not need to open an email that includes information about the user's upcoming flight because the necessary information associated with the user's upcoming flight is included within the structured information card 170. Thus, a user of a user device 110 standing at a ticket counter may quickly search the user's email, obtain the user's flight confirmation number from the structured information card, and provide the flight confirmation number to an airline representative in an efficient manner.
An example of a system 100 that uses the card trigger term identification unit 160 to identify additional terms that may be added to the syntax of the structured information card is for the "Flight" structured information card 142B. However, the present disclosure should not be so limited. Alternatively, card trigger term identification unit 160 may be used to identify additional syntax terms for any type of structured information card, such as "Movie Ticket" structured information card 144B, "Dinner Reservation" structured information card 146B, and the like. Other examples of structured information cards may include, for example, hotel reservation structured information cards, car rental structured information cards, equipment rental structured information cards, and the like. Further, any type of structured information card may be used, where a set of one or more grammar terms may be used to uniquely identify the structured information card.
Fig. 2A is a context diagram of an example of aspects of a card trigger term identification unit that references card trigger term identification unit 210A. The term "unit" is used broadly by the specification to refer to a software-based system or subsystem that may perform one or more particular functions. Typically, the units will be implemented as one or more software modules or components installed on one or more computers in one or more locations. However, in other cases, multiple units may be installed on the same computer or computers.
The card trigger term recognition unit 210A is used to analyze existing terms associated with the syntax of one or more structured information cards. Terms associated with the grammars of one or more structural information cards include one or more terms that, when received in a search query, trigger display of a particular structural information card.
In some implementations, analyzing existing terms associated with the grammar of one or more information cards can include generating a graph structure 212A. The graph structure 212A may include one or more query nodes 220A, 222A each associated with a particular grammar term that triggers selection, filling, and display of a particular structured information card. Each query node 220A, 222A can be associated with a respective tag term. For example, query node 220A is associated with the tag term "flight reservation" and query node 222A is associated with the tag term "ticket". The label terms used to construct the graph may be obtained from a structured information card storage unit, a query log, and the like.
Each of the querying nodes 220A, 222A may be associated with a particular value. For example, query node 220A is associated with value 232A "800" and query node 222A is associated with value 234A "500". The respective values 232A, 234A can include a particular weight associated with the tag term of each respective query node. In some embodiments, the value may include a count of the number of times a particular tag term is used to trigger selection, population, and display of a particular structured information card. For example, the value 232A "800" may indicate that the tag term "Flight reservation" is used to trigger the selection, filling, and display of the "Flight" structured information card 124A 800 times. Although the value may indicate the number of times a particular tag term is used to trigger selection, filling, and display of a particular structured information card, the present disclosure is not necessarily so limited. For example, in some implementations, the values 232A, 234A may be scaled based on the importance of the tag terms.
The card trigger term identification unit 210A associates a value 232A, 234A corresponding to each query node 220A, 222A with each entity node 250A, 252A, 254A associated with each respective query node 220A, 222A. Query nodes 220A, 222A are associated with entity nodes 250A, 252A, 254A if entity nodes 250A, 252A, 254A include data items derived from tag terms associated with the particular query node 220A, 222A. For example, query node 220A is associated with entity node 250A that includes the term "Flight" because the term "Flight" is derived from the tag term "Flight reservation" associated with query node 220A. Similarly, query node 220A is also associated with entity node 252A, which includes the term "Reservation," because the term "Reservation" is derived from the tag term "flight Reservation" associated with query node 220A. Similarly, query node 222A is associated with entity node 254A that includes the term "Ticket" because the term "Ticket" is derived from the tag term "Ticket" associated with query node 222A. The query node-entity node associations may be represented in the graph structure 212A by creating graph edges 260A, 262A, 264A that point from a particular query node to the associated entity node. For example, the association between query node 220A and entity node 250A may be represented in graph structure 212A by creating a graph edge 260A from query node 220A to entity node 250A. Other graphical edges, such as graphical edges 262A, 264A, may be created in the same manner if desired.
Associating the values 232A, 234A with one or more entity nodes 250A, 252A, 254A can include propagating the values 232A, 234A to one or more entity nodes 250A, 252A, 254 based on a predetermined query node-entity node association established by the generated query graph 212A. For example, the edge 260A may be used to propagate the value 232 "800" from the query node 220A to the entity node 250A. After propagating the value 232 "800" from the query node 220A to the entity node 250A based on the relationship established through the graph edge 260A, the value "800" becomes associated with the entity node 250A as illustrated by element 270A. The values 232A, 234A may be propagated through the graph structure 212A in the same manner based on the established graph structure edges 262A, 264A. The elements 270A, 272A, 274A are grayed out (gray out) in FIG. 2A because the elements 270A, 272A, 274A are not associated with the respective entity nodes 270A, 272A, 274A until after the values 232A, 234A are propagated through the graph structure 212A based on the established graph edge 260A. In some embodiments, the values 232A "800" and 243A "500" are not necessarily actively propagated or assigned to the respective entity nodes 250A, 252A, 254A. For example, in some implementations, the generation of the graph edges 260A, 262A, 264A may be sufficient to associate the values 232A "800" and 242A "500" with their respective entity nodes.
In a similar manner, the tag terms associated with each respective query node 220A, 222A may also be associated with the entity node 250A, 252A, 254A associated with each respective query node. For example, the tag term "flight reservation" may become associated with related entity node 250A based on a graph edge between query node 220A and entity node 250A indicating that query node 220A and entity node 250A are related. The tag term "Ticket" associated with the query node 222A may also be propagated forward through the graph structure 212A in a manner similar to the tag term "flight reservation" described above.
The card trigger term identification unit 210A may also access query logs associated with one or more applications, such as an email application. Access to the query log may be performed to identify one or more candidate query terms that may be evaluated for use in expanding trigger terms associated with a grammar of a particular structured information card. As an example, card trigger term identification unit 210A may retrieve candidate query term "Flight Ticket" 240A in order to evaluate the candidate query term "Flight Ticket" that is potentially included in the grammar associated with structured information cards such as "Flight" structured information card 142A. The query term "Flight Ticket" may have been stored in the query log after a user of a user device, such as user device 110, submitted the query "Flight Ticket" to search for one or more emails using an interface, such as interface 111A, of an electronic mailbox before including the term "Flight Ticket" in the syntax of the "Flight" structured information card.
Fig. 2B is a context diagram of an example of additional aspects of a card trigger term identification unit with reference to card trigger term identification unit 210B.
The card trigger term recognition unit 210B may continue to analyze the graph structure generated by the card trigger term recognition unit 210A in fig. 2A. The card trigger term recognition unit 210B is the same card trigger term recognition unit 210A shown in fig. 2A. Card trigger term identification unit 210B is described separately to illustrate additional operations performed at subsequent stages of the analysis by the card trigger term identification unit of fig. 2A of terms associated with the syntax of one or more structured information cards, starting where the description of fig. 2A ends.
The card trigger term identification unit 210B may analyze the graph structure 212A to detect possible relationships between each respective entity node 250A, 252A, 254A and each respective candidate query node 240A. For example, card trigger term identification unit 210B may determine whether each respective entity node 250A, 252A, 254A is associated with a particular candidate query node 240A. In one embodiment, an entity node may be associated with a particular candidate query node 240A if the term associated with the entity node is included in the tag terms of the candidate query node. For example, entity node 250A is associated with candidate query node 240A because the candidate tag term "Flight Ticket" includes the word "Flight" associated with entity node 250A. Similarly, for example, entity node 254A is associated with candidate query node 240A because the candidate tag term "Flight Ticket" includes the term "Ticket" associated with entity node 254A. Likewise, entity node 252A is not associated with candidate query node 240A because the candidate tag term "Flight Ticket" does not include the term "Reservation" associated with entity node 252A. However, other types of associations may exist between the entity node and the candidate query node. For example, where an entity node comprises an email document, a network address, a URL, etc., the entity node may be associated with a candidate query node if the candidate tag term associated with the candidate query node is to return an email document, a network address, etc., in response to a query that includes the candidate tag term.
Card trigger term identification unit 210B may modify graphical structure 212A to create graphical structure 212B. The card trigger term identification unit 210B may modify the graph structure 212A by generating graph edges representing each relationship between an entity node and a candidate query node. The entity node-candidate query node relationship may be represented, for example, by a graph edge pointing from a particular entity node to a particular candidate query node. For example, the card trigger term identification unit 210B may create a graph edge 280B pointing from the entity node 250A to the candidate query node 240A. Graph edge 280B may thus represent the aforementioned relationship between entity node 250A and candidate query node 240A. Similarly, for example, card trigger term identification unit 210B may create a graph edge 282B pointing from entity node 254A to candidate query node 240A. If necessary, the card trigger term identification unit 210B may generate other graphical edges representing other relationships between the entity node and the candidate query terms.
The card trigger term identification unit 210B may use the generated graph edges based on the relationships between the entity nodes and the candidate query nodes to associate the entity nodes 250A, 252A, 254A values 270A, 272A, 274A with one or more candidate query nodes 240. Associating the entity node value with the candidate query node may include, for example, propagating the entity node value to the candidate query node based on the established graph edge. By way of example, the entity node value 270A "800" becomes associated with the candidate query node 240A, as represented by element 290B. Similarly, for example, the entity node value 274A "500" becomes associated with the candidate query node 240A, as represented by element 292B. Elements 290B and 292B are grayed out because elements 290B and 292B do not exist before the values "800" and "500" are associated with the candidate query node 240A based on the generated graph edges 280B, 282B. In some embodiments, the values 270A "800" and 274 "500" are not necessarily actively propagated or assigned to the candidate querying node 240A. For example, in some implementations, the generation of the graph edges 280B, 282B may be sufficient to associate the values 270A and 274A with the candidate query node 240A.
In a similar manner, tag terms associated with each respective entity node 250A, 252A, 254A as described with reference to fig. 2A may also be associated with one or more candidate query nodes 240A associated with each respective entity node. For example, the tag term "flight reservation" associated with entity node 250A based on graph edge 260A may become associated with candidate query node 240A based on a graph edge 280B generated between entity node 250A and candidate query node 240A indicating that entity node 250A and candidate query node 240A are related. Other tag terms, such as the tag term "Ticket," may also become associated with the candidate query node 240A based on other generated edges of the graph structure 212B.
After the values 290B "800" and 292B "500" are associated with the candidate query node 240A, the card trigger term identifying unit 210B may determine whether the tag term "Flight Ticket" associated with the candidate query node 240A should be added to the syntax of a structured information card such as the "Flight" structured information card based on the values 290B "800" and 292B "500". Determining whether the tag term "Flight Ticket" should be associated with the syntax of the structured information card may include summing values 290B "800" and 292B "500" and evaluating the summing values against a predetermined threshold. If it is determined that an aggregate value such as "1300" (e.g., 800+500 — 1300) satisfies a predetermined threshold, the tag term "Flight Ticket" may be added to the syntax of a structured information card such as the "Flight" structured information card. However, if the aggregate value such as "1300" does not satisfy the predetermined threshold, the tag term "Flight Ticket" is not added to the syntax of the structured information card.
In some implementations, the generated graph structure 212B can be used to trigger the generation of the structured information card without updating the syntax of the structured information card. For example, prior to updating grammar 154A of the "Flight" structured information card, server 120 can receive a query that includes a query term, such as "Flight Ticket," that was not originally associated with grammar 154A of the structured information card. The process described with respect to fig. 2A and 2B may then be performed to associate the values 290B "800" and 292B "500" with the candidate query node associated with the candidate tag term "Flight Ticket". Next, the total values 290B "800" and 292B "500" may be summed to obtain a total value of "1300". Finally, as described above, it may be determined whether the aggregate value of "1300" satisfies a predetermined threshold. If the aggregate value satisfies the predetermined threshold, the received query including the term "Flight Ticket" may be rewritten such that a query including the term "Flight Ticket" not found in the grammar 154A of the "Flight" structured information card 142A triggers the selection, filling, and display of the "Flight" structured information card 142A without updating the grammar 154A of the "Flight" structured information card. Rewriting the query may include, for example, adding one or more of the tag terms to the query that became associated with the candidate tag term "Flight Ticket" via the construction of the graph structure 212B. For example, rewriting the query may include adding the tag term "Flight reservation" to the query. Then, executing an overwrite query that now includes the term found in grammar 154A for the "Flight" structured information card (e.g., "Flight reservation") will result in the "Flight" structured information card being selected, populated, and provided for display. If the aggregate value calculated based on values 290B "800" and 292B "500" does not satisfy the predetermined threshold, the received query with the term "Flight Ticket" will not be rewritten and will not trigger the selection, population, and display of the "Flight" structured information card.
Although the examples provided above describe scenarios in which the syntax is to be updated or a received query may be rewritten, the disclosure is not necessarily so limited. For example, it is also contemplated that there may be scenarios within the scope of the present disclosure in which the grammar may be updated to include additional trigger words and the received query is rewritten during processing of the received query.
The foregoing summation of values 290B "800" and 292B "500" has been described in the context of a simple addition operation. Other types of aggregation methods may be employed. For example, the values 290B "800" and 292B "500" may be multiplied. Alternatively, some form of weighted sum of values 290B "800" and 292B "500" may be calculated, and the result used as a sum value.
Fig. 3 is a flow diagram of an example of a process 300 for identifying additional trigger terms for a structured information card. In general, the process 300 may include accessing data associated with a template for presenting structured information 310, identifying a first set of one or more entities 320, associating one or more tags and one or more values with one or more entities in the identified first set of entities 330, obtaining candidate tag terms 340, identifying a subset of the one or more entities from a first set of entities 350, associating the one or more tags and one or more values with the one or more candidate tag terms 360, receiving a search query 370, and using the values associated with each candidate tag term to determine whether to trigger display of structured information 380. Hereinafter, the process 300 performed by a system, such as the system 100, will be described. The system may include one or more computers.
In more detail, process 300 begins at stage 310, where the system accesses data associated with a template for presenting structured information. Access phase 310 may include, for example, data maintained by a system access to a graph structure including one or more query nodes and one or more entity nodes. The accessed data may include data such as one or more tag terms respectively associated with at least one query node. The one or more tag terms may reference data that, when included in a search query, triggers presentation of a structured information card that includes structured information. The structured information may be based on, for example, a template associated with the structured information card.
Each of the one or more tag terms may be associated with a value. The value may include, for example, an access count representing the number of times one or more tag terms have been used to trigger the display of the structured information card. In some implementations, a value may be scaled using a scaling factor that may increase a weight associated with the value or decrease the weight associated with the value based on the importance of one or more tag terms associated with the value.
At stage 330, the system can associate one or more tags associated with one or more respective query nodes with one or more entities. Associating one or more labels with one or more entities may include assigning a label term of a query node to each entity with which the query node is associated. For example, assume that the query node is associated with the label "Flight Reservation". In such an example, the tag "Flight Reservation" may be assigned to the entity "Flight" and the tag "Flight Reservation" may also be assigned to the entity "Reservation". Alternatively or additionally, the system may also associate one or more values associated with the querying node with one or more entities with which the querying node is related. Associating one or more values associated with the query node with one or more entities may include propagating the values from the query node to each entity to which the query node is related. Propagating one or more tag terms, one or more values, or both from the query node to the entity may be referred to as forward propagation of tag terms, forward propagation of values, or both. Propagation of tag terms, values, etc. does not require physical copying of information, such as tag terms or values, from a first data structure to another data structure. Rather, propagation of information such as tag terms or values may be implied as a result of generating a graph edge between two or more nodes of a graph structure.
At stage 340, the system may obtain candidate tag terms. The candidate tag terms may include one or more terms of a query received by the application. The candidate tag terms may be terms that the system evaluates for potential inclusion in the grammar of the structured information card. Alternatively or additionally, the candidate tag terms may be terms that the system evaluates to determine if the query should be rewritten to trigger the structured information card.
The system can analyze relationships that exist between one or more entities and the obtained candidate tag terms. The system performs the analysis to identify a subset of one or more entities from the first set of entities associated with the candidate tag term at stage 350. If a term associated with the entity is included in the candidate tag terms, the entity may be related to the obtained candidate tag terms. However, other types of associations may exist between entity nodes and candidate tag terms. For example, where the entity includes an email document, a network address, a URL, etc., the entity may be associated with a candidate tag term if selecting the tag term would return the email document, network address, URL, etc. when executing a query that includes the candidate tag term.
At stage 360, the system may associate one or more tags and one or more values with each candidate tag term. For example, any tag terms associated with a particular entity at stage 330 can be associated with entity-related candidate tag terms. Thus, in some embodiments, tag terms propagated from a query node to a particular entity may be further propagated from the entity to candidate tag terms that are related to the particular entity. One or more values associated with an entity may be similarly associated with one or more candidate tag terms related to the entity. Thus, in some embodiments, the value propagated from the query node to a particular entity may be further propagated to candidate tag terms. Propagating one or more labels and one or more values from an entity to a candidate label term may be referred to as backward propagation of labels, backward propagation of values, or both. Propagation of tag terms, values, etc. does not require physical copying of information, such as tag terms or values, from a first data structure to another data structure. Rather, propagation of information such as tag terms or values may be implied as a result of generating a graph edge between two or more nodes of a graph structure.
In some implementations, the system can analyze each of the one or more values associated with the candidate tag term to determine whether the candidate tag term should be added to the grammar associated with the structured information card. Determining whether the tag terms should be associated with the structured information card may include aggregating values associated with the candidate tag terms and evaluating the aggregated values against a predetermined threshold. If the total value is determined to meet the predetermined threshold, the tag term can be added to the grammar of the structured information card. However, if the sum does not satisfy the predetermined threshold, the tag term is not added to the grammar of the structured information card.
In other embodiments, at stage 370, the system may receive a search query that includes candidate tag terms. At stage 380, the system may process the received search query and use the value associated with each identified candidate tag term to determine whether to trigger display of the structured information card. Using the value associated with each candidate tag term may include, for example, aggregating one or more values associated with the candidate tag terms and evaluating the aggregated values against a predetermined threshold. If it is determined that the aggregate value associated with the candidate tag terms satisfies a predetermined threshold, the system may determine that a search query that includes the candidate tag terms will trigger presentation of the relevant structured information card. Alternatively, if the total value is determined not to satisfy the predetermined threshold, the system may determine that a search query including the candidate tag term will not trigger presentation of the relevant structured information card.
In more detail, the process of stage 380 may be performed after receiving the search query and include rewriting the received search query without updating the syntax of the structured information card in order to trigger generation of the structured information card. For example, a query may be received that includes candidate query terms that are not included in the syntax of the structured information card. The process described with reference to fig. 2A and 2B can then be performed to associate one or more values with the candidate query terms. Next, a total value of the one or more values may be calculated. Finally, it may be determined whether the aggregate value satisfies a predetermined threshold. If the sum value satisfies a predetermined threshold, the received query including candidate query terms not found in the grammar of the structured information card may be rewritten to include terms found in the grammar of the structured information card related to the query. When the processes described in fig. 2A and 2B are implemented, terms added to a query may be based on one or more tag terms propagated from one or more query nodes to candidate tag terms. The rewritten query may be executed and then trigger the selection, population, and display of the relevant structured information cards associated with the grammar that includes the terms added to the query during the rewrite. If the sum does not meet the predetermined threshold, then a received query with terms not included in the grammar of the structured information card will not be rewritten and will not trigger the selection, population, and display of the structured information card.
Fig. 4 is a context diagram of an example of a card trigger term identification unit.
The card trigger term recognition unit may generate the graphic structure 405. The graph structure 405 may include a plurality of query nodes, such as query nodes 410, 411, 412, 413, 414. Query nodes 410, 411, 412, 413, 414 are each associated with a respective tag term. For example, query node 410 is associated with the tag term "Flight Reservation", query node 411 is associated with the tag term "Flight Ticket", query node 412 is associated with the tag term "Las Vegas Flight Reservation", query node 413 is associated with the tag term "Journey", and query node 414 is associated with the tag term "jack". Query nodes 410, 411, 412, 413, 414 may be related to one or more entity nodes, such as entity nodes 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447. The one or more entity nodes may correspond to one or more terms from multiple sets of terms shared among tag terms of one or more term nodes 410, 411, 412, 413, 414. For example, other entity nodes may correspond to entities other than one or more shared terms. For example, entity 440 may correspond to a website generated in response to executing a query such as "Flight Reservation".
The graph structure 405 may also include one or more candidate query nodes 420, 422. The candidate query nodes 420, 422 may be based on query terms obtained from a query log. For example, the candidate query node 420 may be based on a candidate tag term "Journey Ticket" obtained from the query log. Similarly, the candidate query node 422 may be based on the candidate tag term "Flight Jack" obtained from the query log.
The graph edges from the query node to the entity node and the graph edges from the entity node to the candidate query nodes may be generated using the processes described with reference to fig. 2A, 2B, and 3. Similarly, value 430 "675", value 432 "1125", value 434 "150", value 436 "680" and value 438 "150" may be propagated forward based on the graph edges and then associated with one or more entity nodes as described with reference to entity values 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 465, 457, 458, 459, 460 using the processes described with reference to fig. 2A, 2B and 3. Similarly, entity values 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 465, 458, 459, 460 may be propagated back from an entity node to one or more candidate query nodes using generated graph edges such as 470, 472, 474, 476. The generated graph edges may also be used to propagate the tag terms associated with each respective query node from the respective query node through the graph structure to the candidate tag terms.
The forward and backward propagation of tag terms and values results in the generated graph structure 405. The candidate query node 420 may be associated with one or more values 480 "1125" and 481 "680". In addition, candidate query node 420 is also associated with tag terms from query node 411 and query node 413 via one or more graph edges extending from query nodes 411, 413 to candidate query node 420 through one or more respective entity nodes. Thus, the candidate query node 420 is also associated with the tag terms "Flight Ticket" and "journal". Other candidate query nodes, such as candidate query node 422, may also be associated with one or more values and one or more tag terms in the same manner as candidate query node 420.
The data in the graph structure 405 may be analyzed to determine whether one or more of the candidate query nodes 420, 422 are associated with tag terms that should trigger selection, population, and display of the structured information card when included in the query. Referring to FIG. 4, for example, data in the graph structure may be analyzed to determine whether one or more of the candidate query nodes 420, 422 are associated with candidate tag terms that, when received in a search query, would result in the selection, population, and display of a "Flight" structured information card.
The card trigger term identification unit may aggregate the values 480 "1125" and 481 "680" associated with the candidate query term 420 to arrive at a total value of "1,805". Similarly, the card trigger term identification unit may aggregate the values 482 "675", 483 "725", 484 "150", and 485 "150" associated with the candidate query term 422 to implement the aggregate value "1700".
With further reference to the example of FIG. 4, a predetermined threshold may be established that can be used to determine whether the tag terms associated with the candidate query nodes 420, 422 should be used to trigger the display of a "Flight" structured information card. For example, if the sum value satisfies a predetermined threshold, the tag term associated with the query node will be used to trigger the display of the "Flight" structured information card. Alternatively, for example, if the aggregate value does not meet a predetermined threshold, the tag term associated with the query node will not be used to trigger the display of the "Flight" structured information card.
As an example, assume a predetermined threshold set to "1750". The candidate query node 420 associated with the candidate tag term "Flight Ticket" is associated with an aggregate value "1805" that exceeds a predetermined threshold "1750". However, on the other hand, queries with the candidate tag term "Flight Jacker" are associated with a running total "1700" that is below a predetermined threshold "1750". Thus, a received query including the tag term "Flight Ticket" will trigger the selection, population, and display of the "Flight" structured information card because the aggregate value associated with "Flight Ticket" satisfies a predetermined threshold. However, since the aggregate value associated with "Flight Jack" does not satisfy the predetermined threshold, a received query containing the term "Flight Jack" will not trigger the selection, population, and display of the "Flight" structured information card.
For the case where the system discussed herein collects personal information about a user or potentially utilizes personal information, the user may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or functional components collect personal information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, emails, profession, user preferences, or the user's current location), or whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before being stored or used, thereby removing personally identifiable information. For example, the identity of the user may be anonymized such that personally identifiable information of the user cannot be determined, or the geographic location of the user may be generalized where location information is available (such as to a city, zip code, or state level) such that a particular location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may control how information about him or her is collected and used by the content server.
The graph structures described in this specification can be represented by any of a variety of suitable physical data structures. For example, the graph may be represented by triples, each triplet representing, in turn, two entities and a relationship from a first entity to a second entity; for example, [ α, β, is father ], or [ α, is father, β ], are alternatives to denote the same fact. Each entity and each relationship may, and typically will, be included in multiple triples. As an example of the subject matter described in this disclosure, triples may be used to describe relationships between query nodes, entity nodes, and values associated with edges between query nodes and entity nodes.
Alternatively, each entity may be stored as a primary node, as a record or object, and linked to all relationships the entity has and all other entities to which the entity is related, e.g., by a linked list data structure. More specifically, the graph may be stored as a adjacency list, wherein the adjacency information includes relationship information.

Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a tangible, non-volatile program carrier for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. Alternatively or additionally, the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal, that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by the data processing apparatus. The computer storage medium can be a machine-readable storage device, a machine-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory device, or a combination of one or more of them.
The term "data processing apparatus" encompasses various apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple processors or computers.

A computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a data communication network.
The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output.

A computer suitable for executing a computer program includes, for example, a central processing unit that can be based on a general purpose microprocessor, or a special purpose microprocessor, or both, or any other kind of central processing unit. Generally, a central processing unit will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a central processor unit for executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, the computer need not have such a device. Additionally, the computer can be embedded in another device, such as a mobile phone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive), to name a few.
