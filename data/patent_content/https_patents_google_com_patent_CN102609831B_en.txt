The more detailed description generated.It addition, in step 220, conversational system can also generate for accommodate by
The form (such as, shown in the group box 349 of Fig. 3 B form) of one group of dialogue that user accesses recently.
What this characteristic was similar to Web browser returns button.In step 222, dialogue assistant 110 these
Form is filed in browser 108 for showing.
In addition to by the order shown in Fig. 2, it is also possible to multiple possible order perform step 214～
220.In some embodiments it is possible to some step omitted in these form generation steps.
Generate conversations list
Now, with reference to Fig. 3 A, such as, response user or the client computer inbox to the mail account of user
The request of form, dialog management system 102 generates conversations list (step 302).As following by more detail
Explained, by performing the search of the mail account to user, generated the list of dialogue.For life
Become the list of the dialogue for inbox view, (sometimes referred to as mark for " inbox " attribute
Sign) relevant dialogue, the mail account of search user.Then, in step 304, dialog management system
102 prepare the information about these dialogues, to be shown, will be been described by more detail as following.
It addition, in step 305, dialog management system also generates the list of at user option action and user can
The list of the label selected.Below in conjunction with the discussion of Figure 4 and 5, these user's selectable list are described
Use.Then, in step 306, acquired results information is sent in dialogue assistant, to be translated.
In step 304, dialog management system 102 performs series of steps repeatedly (from step 306 to step
Rapid 324), to generate the group field each dialogue in conversations list.In certain embodiments, may be used
To be translated these fields by row by dialogue assistant 110, enable a user to easily scan conversations list.
For the message that each dialogue is relevant with one group, dialog management system 102 is first raw in step 307
Become sender's list.Sender's list includes multiple sender's identifier, and each identifier is corresponding to
Create the sender of at least one message.Can according to its Christian name, surname, full name, e-mail address,
Photo or unique icon, or combinations thereof, identify sender.In certain embodiments, as
Really at least two sender has identical Christian name, then enough parts of the surname of each sender are comprised
In corresponding sender's identifier, to distinguish sender mutually.Such as, if two senders all have
There is surnames different with first letter for Christian name Paul, then can use the spelling of Paul and the first letter of surname
Meet (such as, PaulB and PaulK) and distinguish the two sender.The ordinary skill people of the art
Member will appreciate that mark has the alternate manner of two senders of identical Christian name.In other embodiments,
The identifier of sender can be based on the letter relevant to the specific sender resided in users contact list
Breath.In other other embodiments, user can be created that transmission now for specific sender
The pet name in person's list.If sender has created the multiple messages in dialogue, then in sender's list
In its identifier the most only occur once.In one embodiment, can be according to the phase of sender's identifier
Answer message to arrive the time of advent of system 102, the sender's identifier in list is ranked up.Separately
In one embodiment, according to the corresponding name of sender's identifier, alphabet sequence is to the transmission in table
Person's identifier is ranked up.It follows that in step 308, dialog management system 102 according to idsplay order,
Sender's list is formatted, to highlight the one or more sender's identifiers in list.
Herein, use term " highlighted ", it is intended that shown by the most distinguishing mode,
Such as by runic, underline, change background color, change font color, change the mode such as font and add
With display.It addition, in this context, term " highlights " and means with the life of distinguishing mode
Become to be used for showing the formatted message of some thing (such as, the specified part of text).Such as,
In certain embodiments, if user not yet checks his message or is not yet labeled as his message reading
Take, then the name of sender is formatted, to be shown with wide line character.
In certain embodiments, during dialogue assistant receives sender's list and/or recipient's list of dialogue
The photo of listed one or more people, and there is the access right to them.When user checks dialogue
List or single dialogue and cursor positioning in the name or identifier of sender's list time, display should
The photo of sender.In certain embodiments, when checking dialogue, for listed message recipient, carry
Supply identical function.For the e-mail system used by large corporation, this characteristic may
It is useful especially.
In certain embodiments, if user itself has created at least one message in dialogue, then exist
Step 310, dialog management system 102 with for user, as his identifier in sender's list
Unique string or icon or other output prompting, replace the name of this user in sender's list
Or other identifier.A kind of selection of unique string is the self reference identifier in a certain language-specific.
Such as, the pronoun in English " me (I) " can be used for representing this user in sender's list.Because
Many people share identical Christian name, so identifying sender with by the name of sender in sender's list
Compare, this characteristic the most useful (certainly, in an alternate embodiment of the invention can be with do so).By uniquely
Identifier represent user, additionally aid user easily identify those wherein user by least contributing
The dialogue that a piece of news is actively engaged in.
If the many people message to dialogue contribution the most, then sender's list may become long, with
Cause not adapt to space limited in browser window.If identified by the e-mail address of sender
One or more senders in sender's list, then situation is especially true.In this case, then exist
Step 312, the sender in sender's list is carried out excellent according to various information by dialog management system 102
First change processes, with mark subset of the sender of display in browser window.In one embodiment,
This subset at least includes the sender of stop press in dialogue, and in the case of feasible, it is also possible to bag
Include the sender not yet being checked by user or being not yet marked as the message read by user.Separately
In one embodiment, this subset includes last institute in the sender of the first received message in dialogue, dialogue
Receive the sender of message, and according to 0 or multiple more transmissions selected by priorization or scoring method
Person.In certain embodiments, higher priority is given the transmission of the message of the most later arrival
Person.Such priorization often increases the probability of the sender that display is not read message.
Other type of prioritisation scheme can also be used.In certain embodiments, only identify when sender's list
During the subset of the sender of the message in dialogue, sender's list includes omitting labelling " ... " or other table
Show sender's list less than symbol.In certain embodiments, there is its message more than one still
In the case of not checked by user or not yet be marked as being read by user, this subset identification is
The sender that can be allowed with free space is as many.
In step 314, dialog management system 102 creates message number designator, this message for dialogue
The number of message in the instruction dialogue of number designator, do not include permanent deletion or be identified as in addition
The message deleted.Message number designator can be the numeral in a pair bracket, and such as, " (3) " represent
Dialogue exists 3 message.In certain embodiments, when dialogue only includes a piece of news, not for being somebody's turn to do
Dialogue generates message number.Message number designator can also be icon.Icon can be coloud coding,
With the information that offer is extra, such as, to represent that how many message in dialogue are read (the most not yet
Checked or be marked as being read).It follows that in step 316, dialog management system 102 is
Processed dialogue generates session tile.Generally, session tile is the theme of Article 1 message in dialogue,
If or it exceedes predefined length, then for the version blocked of this exercise question.Implement at another
In example, determine session tile by the content heuristically checking Article 1 message, or as selecting,
Also Article 1 message can not only be checked.In one embodiment, if dialogue at least includes that one has
" it is not read " message of attribute, then in browser window, both highlights message number identifier,
Also session tile is highlighted, to cause the attention of user.In another embodiment, only highlight
Session tile, to indicate one or more message not being read.
According to the standard email set up, message can be sent in the recipient of at least 3 types,
One main class recipient, lists its address in " To: " field；Two secondary class recipients,
Their address is listed in " Cc: " field or in " Bcc: " field.Therefore, dialogue management system
System 102 creates the recipient's status indicator for this user in step 318, and recipient's state indicates
Symbol is another designator of user's property of participation in dialogue.In one embodiment, first is used to have any different
Designator, such as " > > ", labelling wherein user is the dialogue of the main recipient of any message, uses the
Two distinguishing designator, such as " > ", labelling wherein user be at least one message secondary recipient and
And be not the dialogue of the main recipient of any message, and the most clearly user is classified as any message
The dialogue (such as, because message is sent in marshalling or mailing list) of recipient does not receive special mark
Note.In other embodiments, can be by other the most distinguishing mode, such as by highlighting
Represent one or more partial rows of these dialogues, represent the main reception that wherein user is at least one message

Check dialogue
Fig. 6 A is a flow chart, and the display describing dialogue assistant how response dialog management system refers to
Order generates conversation view.In certain embodiments, help in the dialogue that dialog information is sent in client computer
Before hands, dialog management system perform some action shown in Fig. 6 A, such as, for to show
The action that the dialog information shown formats.
In step 602, first dialogue assistant receives a series of message belonging to concrete dialogue, and one group
Relevant idsplay order.In step 604, dialogue assistant identifies the title of dialogue, and relevant to dialogue
Any system definition category and user-defined label.According to these categories and label, dialogue is respectively
Generate list and the list of at user option label of at user option action.The two list is similar to
In two drop-down lists 344 and 345 shown in Fig. 3 B.In one embodiment, at user option
The list of action only includes the action being applicable to specifically talk with (that is, the dialogue that will show).Therefore,
Again the dialogue already at " paper basket " category can not be associated with " paper basket " category.For
Same reason, the list of at user option label only include not yet with specifically talk with the label being associated.
From the beginning of step 608, dialogue assistant is that each bar message in dialogue generates sub-table respectively, this son
Form at least includes detail message header and message body.As used herein, message body refers to user
The message created, including theme reference, does not include making an addition to any of message by message processing routine
System information.Each detail message header include the name of sender and/or address and all masters with
Secondary recipient, the theme of message, the action of one group of message-level and date/time value.Message-level
One of action includes the option checking message by the unprocessed form of message, it include routing iinformation and other
The information that message system provides, such as " my version: ", " content type " etc..In step 610, right
Assistant is always according to detail message header creation brief message header for words.Brief message header include sender and
The identifier of recipient.In certain embodiments, recipient is got rid of from brief message header.If
User is in recipient's list, then in step 610, dialogue assistant uses unique character string or icon
Make the identifier of user, the identifier of the user being similarly in sender's list.For example, it is possible to English
Pronoun " me (I) " in language is for representing the user in brief message header.If message is mark
The Article 1 message of the concrete recipient in this dialogue (that is, the master of message header or secondary recipient's field
In), then dialogue assistant will highlight the mark of recipient in brief message header in step 614
Symbol.On the other hand, in certain embodiments, previously it is included in the list of recipient when no longer including
During recipient, dialogue assistant will be by the most distinguishing mode, such as by " ghost image " font, and display
The identifier of this recipient.In other embodiments, brief message header includes sender's identifier, disappears
The date/time of breath part and message represents.
It follows that in step 616, session proxy determines how to show sub-table.If with sub-table phase
The message closed not yet is checked by user or not yet is marked as being read by user, then in step
618 by the pattern display sub-table of extension, i.e. had both shown brief message header, and had displayed that complete disappearing
Breath body.If message has been checked or has been marked as being read, then in step 620, with compression
Pattern shows sub-table acquiescently, only includes that a part for brief message header and message body (such as, disappears
The first few lines of breath).It follows that it can be extended by user by clicking on the sub-table compressed.
Similar, sub-table does not describe detail message header, but includes the option selected for user, if i.e. used
Detail message header is wished to check in family, then select this option in step 622.Finally, in step 624,
Dialogue assistant creates one group and answers option in the bottom of sub-table, such as, " answer ", " answering everyone "
And " forwarding ".In certain embodiments, described above moving is performed for each message in dialogue
The subset made.In certain embodiments, one or more additional formatting action is performed.
Fig. 6 B is that the illustrative screen of the second dialogue in Fig. 3 B according to one embodiment of the present of invention is cut
Figure.The top of this screenshot capture is identical with the top of Fig. 3 B and left part with left part.But the list of dialogue
360 by list 640 replacement of message.At the top of the list of message, it it is the title " title 2 " of dialogue
The 630 all user-defined label 632 relevant to dialogue and " extending all message " buttons 634.
Owing to user has checked this 4 message, and they are labeled as being read, so by compression
Pattern display list in 3 message, and by extension pattern show finally (with up-to-date)
Message.In certain embodiments, (i.e., not yet looked into by user when there is not the message not being read
See or not yet be labeled as them being read by user) time, it is also possible to show by the pattern of extension
It is marked as the message in starred dialogue.This provides all message aggregation in dialogue together
Visual effect.Before the sub-table display brief message header 641 of each compression and such as message body
The extracts 643 of several words.In certain embodiments, with the transmission in colored marking brief message header
Person so that the text representation of each sender can be submitted by different colors to.This contributes to shown
Dialogue in sender is distinguished by.In certain embodiments, system generate color, until system
Till having used up the color relevant to sender.In certain embodiments, color is relevant to each dialogue
Connection, so that same sender can have relative different color, it depends on shown right
Words.Note, brief message header 641 is highlighted all of recipient, because this is dialogue
Article 1 message.By contrast, only in the sub-table of the second compression, a mark is only highlighted
Symbol " S1 ", because this is the Article 1 message of participant during wherein S1 is dialogue.The sub-table of extension
Including complete message body 645, " the more multiselect that detail message header will be caused to be shown upon selection
" link 647 and answer option 649 list.Owing to S4 have sent last message, so
Answering one of option is " answering S4 ", and it reminds user: will answer S4.
In certain embodiments, when the number of the message in dialogue exceedes threshold value, (such as, 8 or 10 disappear
Breath), and will show that a plurality of continuous print message in this dialogue is (such as, from dialogue by the sub-table of compression
The dialogue selected by inbox list in be labeled as the message that is read) time, by not including the of text
The sub-table of two compressions shows these message, thus without sender's list, and without taking passages.Replace,
The sub-table of the second compression represents each message in these message with little lines.Visual effect is, these
Sub-table is manifested just as the edge of the card in stacking sheet.In certain embodiments, never
By first and last message in the sub-table display dialogue of the second compression, and more generally, the most not
Representing some message by the sub-table of the second compression, such as those have the message of " adding asterisk " label.
The use of the sub-table of the second compression contributes to checking the dialogue with a large amount of message.The method can be used
In the message represented in the dialogue that the search inquiry specified with user matches, wherein dialogue has more than threshold
The message of value number.In this case, by second compression sub-table represented by message for not with search
The continuous meassage group matched inquired about by rope.
Fig. 6 C is analogous to the illustrative screen sectional drawing of meaning property screenshot capture shown in Fig. 6 B, different
Be (1) after user clicks the first sub-table 650, show this sub-table by mode of extension, (2)
Last sub-table includes detail message header 660, and (3) click " answering S4 " link user
Afterwards, message response form 670 is attached to last sub-table.In one embodiment, when user just
When checking the content of dialogue, can show constantly for a certain message (such as, stop press)
Carry out the text box answered, i.e. display in association with this text box with this message.In other words, display
Message response form 670, and relative answer text box can be user is accessed, and do not want
User is asked to click on " answering S4 " link.In other embodiments, can for dialogue in all message,
Or for all message as shown by mode of extension, show message response form enduringly.
Structurally, the sub-table 650 of the first extension is identical with the last sub-table shown in Fig. 6 B.Its
Including returning that brief message header, " more multi-option " link, message body and one group are in bottom sub-table
Answer option.In addition to sender of the message and the e-mail address of recipient or other identifier, in detail
Message header 660 also includes the list of the action that user can take.Such as, " this message is put into useless
Wastepaper basket " action 661 allow user message from dialogue remove.Form by default, message response table
Lattice 670 are only included in the address of S4 in " extremely: " field, because what it was being answered by user
The sender of message is S4.But, if the user desired that be sent to more recipient answering message,
Then message response form also provides a user with additional option (such as, " adding Cc ", " adding Bcc ").
Message response form 670 also allows for user and edits the theme of origination message and document is attached to answer disappear
Breath.
Fig. 6 D is to talk with shown in Fig. 6 B after user clicks " extension entire message " button 634
Schematically screenshot capture.As a result, all 4 message 608 are shown by mode of extension.Note, button
Text in 634 changes into " compression entire message ".After user has again tapped on button 634, right
The display of words returns to the form shown in Fig. 6 B.
Fig. 6 E is the schematic screenshot capture of the dialogue illustrating some previously described characteristic.Specifically
Say, Fig. 6 E illustrate at 682 when the number of message in dialogue used when having exceeded threshold value second
The example of compression sub-table.Although user can not see any header information of these message, but user
Still it can be seen that have how many message in the sub-table of this second compression.In certain embodiments, retouching
State in the compression sub-table of the brief message header as illustrated by brief message header 684 and 686,
Describe the message on the two ends of the message in the second compression sub-table.In certain embodiments, Yi Jiru
Shown in Fig. 6 E, brief message header includes sender, message part and the date/time of message
Value, and other recipient of message is not described.The characteristic of " adding asterisk " can be seen at message 688
Example.Asterisk in message 688 is different from other message and is that its asterisk is filled out, and it represents this
One message has starred state, and other message does not have such state.Of course, it is possible to use
Any visual indicator providing distinguishing state, and this concept is not limited to " asterisk ", with
And whether " filled in " asterisk.As described above, in one embodiment, when showing dialogue,
And when there is not the message (as is shown in figure 6e) not being read, show to have by mode of extension and add star
The message of number state.In another embodiment, if there is that be not yet read or not yet checked
Message, then by by compression sub-table but be not by second compression sub-table show starred message
688, such as those message at 682.Other embodiments contemplates different arrangements, the most always by expanding
Exhibition pattern sees starred message, any be not yet read irrespective of whether exist or not yet checked
Message.
Use Query Location, list and display dialogue
As the above mentioned, the dialogue that the inquiry that user may search for specifying with user matches.Dialogue
Management system 102 and dialogue assistant 110 Collaboration, to generate the Search Results corresponding to inquiry, and

Dialog server
Figure 10～19 contributes to describing the embodiment of previously described dialog server 102.Figure 10 says
Understand an embodiment of dialog server 102.Dialog server 102 includes dialog engine 1002, repaiies
Change device engine 1004, message index 1006, query engine 1008, message database 1010, or
Multiple secondary service server 1012, spelling checker 1014 and SMTP 1016.
Dialog engine 1002, via itself and the connection of communication network 106, processes from dialogue assistant's 110
Request and the answer to dialogue assistant 110.Communication network 106 can include Internet, one or more
LAN (LAN), one or more wide area network (WAN), other type of network or such
The combination of network.Also dialog engine being connected to various backup service mechanism, such as, assistant service takes
Business device 1012 and spelling checker 1014.Query engine 1008 is connected to dialog engine 1002, message
Index 1006 and message database 1010.Modifier engine 1004 is connected to dialog engine 1002
And between message index 1006 and message database 1010.SMTP gateway 1016 is connected to dialogue
Between engine 1002 and communication network 106.Although Figure 10 dialog server 102 be described as multiple from
The project dissipated, but the various characteristics that this figure is more intended that submitting in dialog server 102 are carried out
Functionally describe rather than to the signal in the structure of embodiment described herein.It practice, just
Such as those skilled in the art it will be realized that can be the project of independent description group in addition
Close, it is also possible to some project is separated.For example, it is possible to realize in figure only on single server
Vertical some project described, it is also possible to realize single project on one or more servers.Dialogue clothes
The actual number of server and partition characteristic the most between which in business device 102, by with realizing not
With and different, and may be partly dependent on peak use during and mea life between system necessary
The Email handling capacity processed.
As briefly mentioned above, dialog engine 1002 can respond from dialogue assistant 110 with disappear
The various requests that manner of breathing closes, and return answer based on dialogue via it with connecting of communication network 106.
Although SMTP gateway 1016 can also be connected to communication network 106 but it also may make SMTP gateway
1016 reception being more directly related to message and transmissions.Such as, in certain embodiments, SMTP gateway
1016 use simple message transfer protocol (SMTP) (SMIP) transmit and receive message.SMTP gateway 1016 can
To receive new message from communication network 106, and this message is sent in dialog engine 1002, to enter
Row additional treatments.It addition, SMTP gateway 1016 also receives message from dialog server 1002, then
(via communication network 106) is transmitted in message specified recipient address these message.
Dialog engine 1002 can also process and the message that may be encoded carries out asking of spell check
Ask.Dialog engine 1002 sends each several part of the text that will check to spelling checker 1014, to enter
Row spell check.Spelling checker 1014 returns corresponding information, possible incorrect including being identified as
The mark of the text of spelling.In certain embodiments, spelling checker 1014 provides relevant to identified
The information advised for the text of possible incorrect spelling.In certain embodiments, this information
It is sent in dialogue assistant 110, to carry out process in succession.
One or more secondary service server 1012 provide additional service to dialog engine 1002.
In certain embodiments, secondary service server 1012 includes spam detection modules.Hereinafter, reference
Figure 11 discusses the operation of spam detection modules.In certain embodiments, secondary service server 1012
Including attachment management module, this attachment management module effectively the depositing of file to attaching to email message
Storage is managed with retrieval.
Figure 11 describes the embodiment for processing received message.Receive message, given dialogue,
It is indexed, gives one or more attributes to it and it is stored.Such as, initially
Message can be received by SMTP gateway 1016, wherein, can be carried out some and process and operation, the most permissible
It is transmitted in dialog engine 1002 (stage 1102).Dialog engine 1002 can be that the generation of this message disappears
Breath identifier.Message identifier can be used for distinguishing mutually message.In an embodiment, this identifier is by one
The numeral of N number of bit that individual or some is constituted.Such as, in an embodiment, message identifier is permissible
Being the numeral of 64 bits, this numeral is by Y bit (such as 32 ratios are held or 48 bits)
Hash (hash) composition of the message content of markers and 64-Y bit.Hash is mathematical function, its
Value is videoed to less territory from big territory.Those of ordinary skill in the art it will be appreciated that
There is many different methods creating message identifier, these message identifiers provide for disappearing
The enough information that breath distinguishes mutually.
Then, dialog engine 1002 can resolve to its some constituents (stage 1104) message.
These compositions potentially include the address of sender, one or more recipient address, the theme of message,
" Reference: " field, described in RFC 2822 (April calendar year 2001) as described earlier
" In-Reply-To: " field of also describing in field, RFC 2822, the content of message or any can
Out of Memory in the message can be comprised.After have received message, before or after resolving message,
Message is transmitted in spam and checks module (stage 1105), with judge message whether with spam
Matching criteria.In certain embodiments, each spam checks that module is asynchronous with other process of message
Ground, run concurrently.In certain embodiments, the design of spam criterion is intended to whether judge message
The uncalled message of reading may be may not want that for user.
The message resolved is made an addition to message database (stage 1106).In one embodiment,
This message makes an addition to message database, and does not carry out amendment in succession, unless may delete.
Some or all the components of the message extracted during message resolves is used to aid in being received
The judgement (stage 1108) of the dialogue (if there is such dialogue) belonging to message.For example, it is possible to
The theme of message and other message with same subject are compared, because the message in Dui Hua very may be used
Can will have identical or almost identical theme.If not yet finding the dialogue matched, then this
Message is associated with new dialogue.
After having been carried out dialogue association, index for message, for search (stage 1110).
In one embodiment, index for the whole text of message and the part of header information.Implement at some
In example, not to " noise word " (such as " the (this) ", " a (a certain) " and " or in message body
(or) " etc. word) indexes, but indexes other texts all in the relevant portion of message.
Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that, it should for those of the message that can be searched for
Part indexes.It is previously mentioned as following, in certain embodiments, at the relatively after-stage of Message Processing,
The information relating to the attribute relevant to message is made an addition in index.
It follows that give message (stage 1112) the initial sets of attribute.Such as, the genus of these types
Property can be included as received message and adds " not being read " label and (this often means that message is not yet looked into
See, or be not yet marked as being read), to represent that this message is new.The message sent except user
Outward, another attribute being initially given to message is " inbox " attribute.It is initially given to the another of each message
One group of attribute is the user-defined genus relevant to other message (if present) in same dialogue
Property.By search referring to the dialog database described by Figure 18, determine and other message in dialogue
Relevant user-defined attribute.Initially can also give message other attribute.The genus relevant to message
Property can be used for search message data base, to obtain, there is the message of like attribute.For example, it is possible to perform to search
Rope is to search for all message being marked as " not being read ".Alternatively, it is also possible to the attribute of dialogue is added
It is added on message, because in one embodiment, message inherits the attribute of its dialogue.
In certain embodiments, relevant to message attribute can include relevant with single message in dialogue and
The attribute need not being associated with all message.For example, it is possible to " being labeled as deleting ", attribute is (the most also
Be referred to as " paper basket " attribute) with dialogue in single message be associated, and not with same dialogue
In other message be associated.Be labeled as delete message also stored by system, and also with dialogue
It is associated, but generally they is not shown when the dialogue that display is corresponding.Use one or more spy
Fixed view, enables a user to check have the message that attribute " is labeled as deleting ".Such regard
Figure has provided a user with the chance of " not deleting " message.On the other hand, in certain embodiments, handle is worked as
When user-defined label is associated with dialogue, this label is associated with all message in dialogue.?
In some other embodiments, when user-defined label is associated with dialogue, this label and dialogue
In all message meeting predefined criterion (such as, in addition to those are labeled as the message deleted
Message) be associated.
It follows that the user-defined filter that user is had built up is applied to message (stage 1114).
Each user-defined filter includes one group of filtercondition and set.Which filtercondition defines
Message matches with filter, and action includes specifying and will make an addition to message or moving from the label of message removal
Make.Filtercondition can include and the text in sender, recipient, message subject, the literary composition in message
The criterion that this grade is relevant.In certain embodiments, action can include " from inbox remove " (that is, as
Fruit exist, then from message remove inbox label), to message add-on system label (being sometimes referred to as category),
And add user-defined label to message.Such as, filter can be specified and all be had specific project
Or the message of projects combo all should be indicated with " paper basket " label.Another filter can be specified,
If project " Tahoe lake " occurs the most Anywhere, then " holiday " label is made an addition to this
Message.
Noting, in certain embodiments, the stage 1112 and 1114 relates to the label to give being processed
Message.When performing or being ready to carry out stage 1112 and 1114, retrieve and check module from spam
Result (stage 1105).If spam check module message is classified as spam, then
" spam " label gives this message, and removes the label of any conflict (such as, from this message
" inbox " or " paper basket ").
Establish give message tag set after, amendment dialog engine 1002 in index and certain
A little tables (stage 1116), give the tag set of this message with reflection.By adding expression, label is given
The information of which message revises index.As a result, the indexed search on each label of these labels will
Produce the messaging list including current message being processed.It addition, in amendment dialog engine at least one
Individual table or data base, to represent the tag set giving current message being processed.Hereinafter, by reference
Figure 18 describes this point.
Finally, accreditation (stage 1118) can be sent to the sender of message.In certain embodiments, may be used
To send accreditation, and in further embodiments, accreditation can not be sent.
Although Figure 11 describes these stages in particular order, but is not intended as being unduly limited these
The order in stage.In other embodiments, these stages can be carried out different sequences.Such as, exist
Before message is indexed, message can be made an addition to this message database, thus can after the stage 1114
With the stage 1110.Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that and re-starts these stages
The various modes of sequence.
Each message is associated with dialogue
With reference to Figure 12, below for the more detailed of (stage 1106) that how message and dialogue can be matched
Describe.After message resolves (stage 1104 of Figure 11), each several part of constituent can be used
In the planning search inquiry (step 1202) to candidate's dialogue.For example, it is possible to according to temporal information, send out
Information that out of Memory in the person's of sending information, subject information, header or system provide or they
Dialogue is associated by any combination.One embodiment use with " Reference: " and/or
The theme plan search inquiry of the message of " In-Reply-To: " field.Other embodiments includes search inquiry
The sender of middle message or recipient.Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that for
Generation can be relevant from current message the different search inquiry of the many of message.
Use search inquiry for the message previously stored, and receive alternate message (stage 1204).
The information of message or relevant information is checked, to judge which message (if present) can be
Match with current message well (stage 1206).Dialogue belonging to this message is possible for currently disappearing
Dialogue belonging to breath.Multiple different scheme can be used to determine the dialogue belonging to current message.One
The scheme of kind can use the theme of current message.The message with same subject probably belongs to same dialogue.
Therefore, it can the inquiry that planning uses the theme of current message.Such as, if the message flowed into has master
" today, where we should have lunch topic？", then the dialogue (if present) belonging to current message
It is possible to include one or more message with same subject.When theme is compared, entering
Before row compares, theme is carried out normalization and is probably desirable.In certain embodiments, right
Theme carries out normalization and includes removing prefix, such as, remove " Re: " and " Fwd: ", and it is generally by some
System makes an addition to theme them.
However, it is possible to it is desirable to inspection is not only theme.If two message has same master
Topic, but one therein just have received before another a piece of news, then and they are most likely not with a pair
A part for words.Such as, if being separated by one month and receive two and there is theme " today, which we should go
In have lunch？" message, then they can not be a part for same dialogue.Therefore, in the present invention
An embodiment in, if current message and the normalization theme of message from candidate's dialogue match,
Then the inspection to the date/time value of this message is probably desirable.
When message is matched with dialogue, it may be considered that other factors, such as recipient, message content
Each several part, the domain addresses of sender or other factors.Those of ordinary skill in the art will
Can be appreciated that, there are the many different modes for determining the dialogue belonging to new information.The most currently disappear
Cease and mate information matches satisfactorily, then can be the dialogue relevant to this coupling message with current
Message is associated (stage 1206).On the other hand, without find mate satisfactorily message (because of
And, without dialogue), then new dialog identifier is associated with this message (stage 1206).
In some embodiments it is possible to create dialog identifier according to the initial message received in dialogue.
For example, it is possible to system provide initial message message identifier (by transmit or reception system provide)
As dialog identifier.Then, message in succession and currently used as this message mark for dialog identifier
Know symbol to be associated.Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that and can be used for providing dialogue identifier
The various characteristics of the initial message of symbol.In certain embodiments, these characteristics it would be desirable to provide such well
Support: this value is uniquely in this initial message so that multiple dialogues will not be given same dialog identifier.
As mentioned previously, current message is relevant to dialogue (that previously existed or newly created)
After connection (stage 1106), add initial attribute (stage 1108).Can be more preferably geographical with reference to Figure 13
Solution is used for adding an embodiment of these initial attributes (stage 1108).Initially, message can be checked
Sender.If the sender of current message is not to be carrying out the user of this Message Processing for it,
Then current message is likely to be sent to this user by others.Therefore, if concluded currently in the stage 1302
The sender of message is not this user, then can be initial attribute (the also referred to as inbox mark of " inbox "
Sign) it is associated with current message (stage 1304).The attribute of " inbox " can be used for having identified those
It is sent to the message of this user.Such as, in certain embodiments, having disappearing of " inbox " attribute
The search of breath is for the generation of the inbox view of user.
In the literature, use term " attribute " and " label " convertibly.It addition, specific object
" be associated " with message, and use specific object or label " labelling " message be considered to be identical or
The operation of equivalence.
Owing to current message is likely to new, so user not previously checks that this message is also very may be used
Can." not being read " attribute of so instruction is therefore, it can be associated with current message (the stage
1306).Those of ordinary skill in the art is it will be appreciated that can be by reaching equifinality
Various ways realize message attributes.Such as, predefined value can represent " inbox ".Can root
The message according to the search of these attributes with desired attribute be enough to.Can also be other attribute and message phase
Association.Although the energy force rate of search specific object is had any different even more important, but still can examine in a variety of forms
Consider attribute.Attribute can include the attribute that system defines, such as, inbox, paper basket, spam,
All documents and not being read.In certain embodiments, some system property is probably the (example of mutual exclusion
As, inbox, paper basket and spam).Attribute can also include user-defined attribute, herein,
Sometimes they are called category.
If the sender that user is message being processed (as concluded in the stage 1302), or
After any system property used is made an addition to message, such as, with the addition of " not being read "
After (stage 1306), then the additional attribute belonging to dialogue is made an addition to message (stage 1307).
Can for flow into message inspection and use some filtercondition (stage 1308).In embodiment
In, user can set up the mistake when meeting predetermined condition, attribute being applied to received message
Filter.In another embodiment, system can be applied to one or more predefined filters
The message received.
If current message matches with filter criteria, the most next according to filter, attribute can be used
In this message (stage 1310).In one embodiment, system provides to allow users to set up and filters
The instrument of device, in order to some message is not positioned in " inbox ".In other words, filter will be led
" inbox " attribute is caused to remove from message.In another embodiment, can current message with
Specific user-defined attribute is associated, such as, one or more dialogues can be associated with instruction
The label in the field interested to that user be associated.For example, it is possible to flow into message with have
The dialogue of label " food " is associated, and then, " food " label will be associated with current message.
Generally speaking, message inherits the label of dialogue associated there for message.Due to can be multiple mistakes
Filter is applied to received message, it is possible to newly received message and their relevant dialogues with
More than one user-defined label is associated.
In another embodiment, user can be associated sleepy condition with dialogue.In some embodiment
In, when user's special order system do so, just sleepy condition is associated with dialogue.Real at some
Execute in example, when filter and the information matches in dialogue, sleepy condition is associated with dialogue.When
When receiving new information in the dialogue sleepy condition being put on it, sleepy condition is specified and will be held
Some action of row.Such as, sleepy condition can make system avoid inbox label with talk with in new
Message is associated.More particularly, user sleepy condition can be associated with dialogue (directly, or
Person's operation by filter) so that the new information in Dui Hua avoids being placed on the inbox of user
In, unless met some trigger condition.One such trigger condition can be to be directly directed to user (make
For unique main recipient) the message of inflow.Another such trigger condition can be by user or
The passage of a period of time selected by system.Still other trigger condition can be comprise specified word or
The message received of phrase.In this case, when receiving the message meeting sleepy condition, from
Dialogue is removed this drowsiness condition, and uses the message of " inbox " label this inflow of labelling.At certain
In a little embodiments, also take extra action, such as, " inbox " label is made an addition in dialogue
Other message.In another embodiment, " inbox " label is used to indicate have " not being read "
All message in the dialogue of label.Therefore, the search of " inbox " is by this dialogue of return.Real at some
Execute in example, by generating sleepy filter, a sleepy condition be associated with dialogue so that with talk with phase
The new information of association avoids by with " inbox " label in addition labelling, until there is predefined event
Or condition, after this, this drowsiness filter is deleted or modified.
The another kind of filter that can be applied to received message is " spam " filter, and it can
Identify undesirable message, and use " spam " label to they in addition labelling (that is, " rubbish
Rubbish mail " attribute is associated with such message).
Figure 14 illustrates an embodiment of the attribute for revising dialogue.When dialogue or with dialogue phase
When the message of the inflow of association and filter criteria match, the attribute of dialogue can be revised.When user points out
When dialogue should have specific user-defined attribute, it is also possible to the attribute of amendment dialogue.Such as, user
Can specify and concrete dialogue is associated with " food " category.In this case, make this right
Words (with its respective message) carry out labelling with " food " attribute to be associated with " food " attribute.
User can also specify the dialogue being labeled as deleting.
Under some mode, for concept, user-defined attribute is comparable to file.But, this
Each embodiment of invention allows dialogue to be associated with multiple user-defined attributes.In certain embodiments,
When new attribute is associated with dialogue, use all message in the dialogue of new attribute labelling.
With reference to Figure 14, when the given attribute of dialogue to be revised, plan search (stage 1402) is with location
Dialogue (stage 1404).After finding dialogue (stage 1404), the attribute (rank of dialogue can be revised
Section 1406).Concrete mechanism for the stage of completing 1402,1404 and 1406 depends on for belonging to
Property with the mechanism that is associated of dialogue.In certain embodiments, based on dialogue, attribute is relevant to dialogue
Connection.Such as, dialog engine can maintain the list of the attribute relevant to each concrete dialogue.As selection,
Or it addition, dialog engine can maintain index, this index is mapping to each defined attribute with being somebody's turn to do
All dialogues of attribute labelling.As selection, in certain embodiments, to the relevant attribute of dialogue and
Each bar message in this dialogue is associated.In such embodiments, dialog engine can maintain each
Defined attribute is mapping to the index by all message of this attribute labelling, but also can maintain and be used for
Table or other mechanism of every message reflection to the dialogue relevant to this message.
Contrasting with message, the numerous characteristics of the present invention uses the elementary cell as information using dialogue.Example
As, inbox submits the list of dialogue to user.Some characteristic of the present invention use search with mark with
Dialogue listed in multiple different dialogue views in the email account of family.Hereinafter, will retouch with reference to Figure 15
State search dialog and generate the expression being identified dialogue.Initially, search inquiry (stage 1502) is received.
Search inquiry can specified by user, or by system generated (such as, in response to user's point
Hit " inbox " icon).Search inquiry can be based on many factors.Search project in search inquiry can
With the form by word or single contamination from user.Such as, user may search for comprising word " firmly
Bagel " and the message of " cheaply ", and if there is relative conversations, then by this relative conversations of return.
System can respond certain user's action, generates search inquiry.Such as, if the user desired that obtain addressee
Case view, then system generates the dialogue that search inquiry may search for having attribute " inbox ".
Any combination of searchable item purpose is used equally to search inquiry.As the above mentioned, searchable item
Mesh may include that the text of message；To message, the relevant any attribute of dialogue；Or it is relevant to message
The header information of connection.In one embodiment, search inquiry is put on the data base of message and will return one
Group message (stage 1504).Referring briefly to Figure 10, for example, it is possible to by sending to query engine 1008
Search inquiry realizes this point.Query engine 1008 can put on this message index search inquiry
1006, message index 1006 can return the list of message.This message can be received in the stage 1 504
List.If desired, other embodiments can be returned the list of message by various ways,
Including returning one group of message identifier, document identifier, all or part of message or theirs is any
Combination.
In certain embodiments, for as overall dialogue rather than scanning for for each message.
Then, when inquiry comprises the first and second queried for items, and one of them is found in Article 1 message,
When another is found in the Article 2 message of same dialogue, this dialogue will be considered as looking into described
Inquiry is associated, thus is included in Search Results.For example, it is contemplated that such a dialogue: Qi Zhong
A piece of news asks the idea about lunch place and message continuously, specifies concrete restaurant, no simultaneously
Text including origination message.If user is interested in find out, and the right of certain restaurant and lunch is wherein discussed
Words, if the text then for whole dialogue applies this search, seem to there is not message boundaries in dialogue,
Then search for and more likely produce desired result.
Dialogue is associated with the massage set returned in the stage 1504.Multiple method can be used to identify
Relevant dialogue.When have selected message (stage 1506) from the massage set returned in step 1504
Time, that dialogue (step 1508) belonging to mark message.In one embodiment, handle can be maintained
The data structure that each message matches with dialogue.If maintaining such data structure, then to tool
The inspection of the data structure entries that body message identifier is relevant, can identify the dialogue belonging to message.Make
For results set, the number of the dialogue returned can be limited to predefined number.If carried out
This restriction, then the process of this group message continues, until identifying the dialogue of enough numbers, and
And return result.On the other hand, all dialogues being associated with the message groups returned can be identified, but
It is returned only to subset.
List (the rank of dialogue are created upon all or part of dialogue returned belonging to result of mark
Section 1510), then format dialog information, to return in requestor's (stage 1512).Formatting stages
1512 can format the information that multiple dialogue that is different types of and that identified is associated, their details
Difference with embodiment is different.In certain embodiments, formatted message is can be by for dialogue
Information is filed in the type that the dialogue assistant 110 of user is identified.
In certain embodiments, according to predefined rule or rule sets, according to giving each dialogue
Date/time value, sequence dialogue in the conversations list that the stage 1510 is generated.As explained above
, in certain embodiments, each dialogue in conversations list gives and is equal to and is used for generating dialogue
The date/time of the date/time of the latest news that the search criteria of list matches, and according to this
The date/time value given a bit, the dialogue (such as, by anti-chronological order) in sequence conversations list.
Those of ordinary skill in the art is it will be appreciated that also exist and carry out the dialogue in conversations list
Sequence and other the methods various submitted to.
In certain embodiments, the dialogue data through formatting of list of dialogue is represented (in the stage 1512
Produce) include the statistics of number to the message being contained in conversations list in each dialogue.Implement at some
In example, dialogue assistant 110 show the message statistics of each dialogue, to indicate to the user that how much message bag
It is contained in dialogue.
In one embodiment, header (example is briefly talked with for each dialogue establishment in the list of dialogue
As, during the stage 1512), dialogue header can identify the list of the sender of message in dialogue.This
One list can include whole senders or the subset of sender in dialogue.In certain embodiments, to sending out
The list of the person of sending formats, in order to visually distinguishes those and have sent and be currently marked as by user
The sender of (in the dialogue) message " not being read ".In another embodiment, dialogue assistant
110 submit these senders to by the form being different from other sender.It is, for example possible to use runic or prominent
The Text Flag going out display " is not read " sender of message.
In another embodiment, can be by replacing name or the address of user with self reference identifier
Process the list of the sender of (briefly in dialogue header) message.As a result, sending out when display dialogue
The list of the person of sending rather than display are similar to name or other mark letter of the user of the sender of this user non-
During breath, display self reference identifier (such as " me (I) ").Can also use other type of from
I distinguishes the user checked with reference to identifier with other users.
In another embodiment, the briefly dialogue header of each message in the list of dialogue can include
How instruction user receives the information of message.In other words, these information can identify how specially to
Family sends message.For example, it is possible to directly send message to user, can be for message copying user, can
To copy user, or that user can be made to be distribution list message being sent in it for message is blind
Part.Can point out that user receives the one or more modes in these different modes of message to user.
Such as, if directly transmitting message to user, then the expression (such as " > ") of image can be used to point out
When dialogue is filed in user.
In certain embodiments, in the brief information header of each message in the list of dialogue includes dialogue
The extracts held, this extracts includes the information for being shown in bold the text matched with the project of search, and
And also include the text around matched text formatted with normal font.When for inbox or other be
When system category generates the list of dialogue, take passages and include from according to the dialogue selected by predefined criterion
Text.In certain embodiments, take passages the starting of latest news included from dialogue text,
And in another embodiment, take passages and include text that automatically select, that indicate conversation content.
In another embodiment, select to check concrete from the dialogue matched with search inquiry as user
Dialogue time, which message and this inquiry that dialog engine can generate in instruction dialogue match and which
The dialog information that a little message do not match that with this inquiry.Dialog information can also include and this search inquiry phase
A part for the text of the message of coupling.This dialog information can be formatted, to add to user
With display.Dialog information can include the formatting for showing by mode of extension coupling message and for
By the non-matching message of the formatting that compact model shows.Can be by mode of extension various types of information
Be filed in user, including the combination in any of following all or part information: header information, content information,
The text that matches with search inquiry and the text around this search inquiry.In certain embodiments,
When by compact model (such as, in response to user to " compressing all message " button or the selection of option)
When showing one or more message matched with search inquiry, by compact model for such message institute
The information of display includes the extracts of message content, and this extracts includes for being shown in bold and queried for items phase
The information of the text of coupling, but also include the text around the matched text formatted with normal font.
In yet another embodiment, dialog information can indicate when to dialogue with the addition of certain user or
The most eliminate certain user from dialogue.Such as, if the message user being included in dialogue reaches
To point sometime, the most no longer include, then the information for one or more sequential messages may indicate that
User is no longer for a part for dialogue.Such as, dialogue assistant can be different from for showing by using certain
Show that those fonts the most participating in the name of the user of dialogue show that the name of this user is to realize this
Point.For this purpose it is proposed, dialogue assistant can use " ghost image " font.
Dialog information can also provide the information of the addition about new participant to dialogue.Such as, bag is related to
The information of the Article 1 message including new participant can include the name for showing new participant discriminatively
Formatted message.By dialogue assistant, this information can be shown in user, so that newly added sends out
The name of the person of sending or other identification information can be obtained by runic or some other the most distinguishing submission form
To manifest.
