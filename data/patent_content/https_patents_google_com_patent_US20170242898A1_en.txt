Definitions
- This specification relates to people search results.
- Internet search engines aim to identify resources (e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia context) that are relevant to a user's needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user.
- Internet search engines return search results in response to a user submitted query. For example, a user query can seek resources associated with a particular individual by including a name in a query.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a search query, where the search query includes one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying one or more entities associated with the individual identifier; providing the one or more entities as query suggestions; receiving a selection of an entity; obtaining search results for the selected entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the selected entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the selected entity.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied on a computer storage medium encoded with instructions that when executed by one or more computers cause the one or more computers to perform operations of receiving a search query, where the search query comprises one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying one or more entities associated with the individual identifier; providing the one or more entities as query suggestions; receiving a selection of an entity; obtaining search results for the selected entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the selected entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the selected entity.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied on a system including: one or more computers and one or more storage devices storing instructions that are operable, when executed by the one or more computers, to cause the one or more computers to perform operations of: receiving a search query, where the search query comprises one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying one or more entities associated with the individual identifier; providing the one or more entities as query suggestions; receiving a selection of an entity; obtaining search results for the selected entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the selected entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the selected entity.
- the method further includes refining the search results using the one or more terms in the search query.
- the one or more terms include an occupation identifier.
- the one or more terms include an organization identifier.
- the method further includes receiving a second search query, where the second search query includes one or more second terms; refining the identified search results using the one or more second terms; and presenting the refined search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the selected entity.
- Obtaining search results for the selected entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the selected entity includes identifying one or more social profiles associated with the individual identifier. Social profiles are identified based in part on a geographic location of a user. Social profiles are identified based in part on a history of search queries received for a user. Social profiles are identified based in part on inclusion in a social circle associated with a user. Presenting the identified search results includes presenting one or more mechanisms for contacting the selected entity. Presenting the obtained search results comprises providing a mechanism for requesting that the selected entity join a social group associated with a user. Receiving a search query includes receiving at least a portion of the search query.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a search query, where the search query comprises one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying an entity associated with the individual identifier; obtaining search results for the identified entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the identified entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the identified entity.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied on a computer storage medium encoded with instructions that when executed by one or more computers cause the one or more computers to perform operations of: receiving a search query, where the search query comprises one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying an entity associated with the individual identifier; obtaining search results for the identified entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the identified entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the identified entity.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied on a system including: one or more computers and one or more storage devices storing instructions that are operable, when executed by the one or more computers, to cause the one or more computers to perform operations of: receiving a search query, where the search query comprises one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying an entity associated with the individual identifier; obtaining search results for the identified entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the identified entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the identified entity.
- the entity is identified based in part on a geographical location of a user submitting the search query.
- the entity is identified based in part on a history of search queries submitted by a user submitting the search query.
- the entity is identified based in part on inclusion in a social circle associated with a user submitting the search query.
- Search results corresponding to particular individuals can be obtained and provided for presentation.
- User interface elements present results to help the user recognize a “correct” individual (e.g., when multiple individuals share a name), for example, using photos, metadata, and relevant results identified for particular individuals.
- users can identify individuals associated with non-name queries, for example, occupation, organization, events, or location.
- Users can retrieve comprehensive search results for a particular individual.
- the retrieved results can include publicly available search results and content that the particular individual has chosen to share with the users through, for example, a social profile page.
- a user can obtain search results for a particular individual based on a determined affinity between the user and the particular individual and based on a determined popularity of the particular individual.
- FIG. 1 shows an example search system.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process for obtaining entity-specific search results.
- FIG. 3 is an example search result page for presenting search results.
- FIG. 4 is an example search result page for presenting entity-specific search results for an individual.
- FIG. 5 is an example search result page for presenting entity-specific search results for an individual.
- Users can search for individuals by submitting a search query to a search system, where the search query includes a feature.
- the feature can be the name of an individual, a description of an occupation, the name of an organization, or some other description associated with an individual (e.g., “president of the united states”).
- Particular entities can be suggested in response to a feature submitted with a search query.
- the suggested entities can include information (e.g., an individual's name, occupation, affiliated organization, and geographic location), where the information is obtained from a corresponding cluster of resources.
- the entities suggested can vary depending on different factors (e.g., the user submitting the search query, a geographic location of the user submitting the search query, or a social affinity between the user submitting the query and an individual associated with an entity). Users can select a suggested entity to obtain resources from a cluster of resources that corresponds to the selected entity.
- FIG. 1 shows an example system 100 .
- the system 100 provides search results relevant to submitted queries as can be implemented in an internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment.
- the system 100 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented.
- a user 102 can interact with a search system 114 through a client device 104 .
- the client 104 can be a computer coupled to the search system 114 through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet.
- the search system 114 and the client device 104 can be one machine.
- a user can install a desktop search application on the client device 104 .
- the client device 104 will generally include a random access memory (RAM) 106 and a processor 108 .
- RAM random access memory
- a user 102 can submit a query 110 to a search engine 130 within a search system 114 .
- the query 110 is transmitted through a network to the search system 114 .
- the search system 114 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- the search system 114 includes an index database 122 and a search engine 130 .
- the search system 114 responds to the query 110 by generating search results 128 , which are transmitted through the network to the client device 104 in a form that can be presented to the user 102 (e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed in a web browser running on the client device 104 ).
- the search engine 130 identifies resources that match, or are responsive to, the query 110 .
- the search engine 130 will generally include an indexing engine 120 that indexes resources (e.g., web pages, images, or news articles on the Internet) found in a corpus (e.g., a collection or repository of content), an index database 122 that stores the index information, and a ranking engine 152 (or other software) to rank the resources that match the query 110 .
- the indexing and ranking of the resources can be performed using conventional techniques.
- the search system also includes a clustering engine 154 to cluster resources responsive to features (e.g., individuals, occupation, or organization). Cluster features can be included in the index database 122 or in a separate index, not shown. Alternatively, cluster features can be identified at runtime.
- the search engine 130 can transmit the search results 128 through the network to the client device 104 for presentation to the user 102 .
- a query is received prior to submission to the search engine 130 .
- a query can be received as it is being entered by the user 102 and before the search is executed (e.g., by selecting a “search” button).
- One or more suggested queries can be provided to the user 102 .
- the suggested queries can include suggestions of particular entities.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for obtaining entity-specific search results. For convenience, the process 200 will be described with respect to a system including one or more computing devices that performs the process 200 .
- the system receives a search query ( 202 ).
- Search queries can be received from a client device communicating over a network, where the client device interacts with the system using an interface, such as a network interface.
- the search query can include one or more terms received from a user.
- the search query can be “Eiffel.”
- a user enters a search query including one or more terms, where the terms include a feature.
- the feature can be a name for an individual and can be a full or partial name (e.g., “John,” “Doe,” “John D.,” or “Doe, J.”).
- the feature is a description of an occupation (e.g., “software engineer”), where the occupation can be used to identify one or more individuals.
- the feature is the name of an organization (e.g., “sharks football team”), where the name of the organization can be used to identify one or more individuals.
- the feature is a description associated with an individual (e.g., “president of the united states”), where the description can be used to identify one or more individuals.
- the feature is a combination of one or more features (e.g., “john doe software engineer,” “john doe example corporation,” “john doe san francisco,” or “john doe the oldest man in the world”), where the feature can be used to identify one or more individuals.
- suggestions can be provided to the user, e.g., in a drop-down menu so that the user can select from different options.
- the suggestions can be suggested queries including the same or additional autocompleted query terms.
- the suggestions are based on other users' search activities.
- the searches can be algorithmically determined based on a number of objective factors (e.g., popularity of search terms) without human intervention. For example, the user can enter “eiffel,” and the system can suggest “Eiffel Tower,” “Eiffel Tower at night,” Eiffel Tower Paris,” and/or “Eiffel Tower pictures.”
- the system can provide suggestions based on a word-completion algorithm. Alternatively, the system can provide suggestions based on historical data from prior search terms.
- the system provides suggestions for one or more entities that correspond to terms received from the user, as discussed in more detail below.
- the user input of “John Smi” can result in a suggested query of “John Smith”.
- a user input of “John Smith” can result in a suggested query of “John Smith—Software Engineer—Mountain View, CA,” as described in greater detail below.
- instant search results are provided based in part upon entry of one or more characters in the search query.
- the user can enter a search query for “ei,” and search results provided can include search results with phrases “Eiffel Tower,” “Eileen Band,” and “Einstein,” each matching the search term “ei.”
- search results can include search results with phrases “Eiffel Tower,” “Eileen Band,” and “Einstein,” each matching the search term “ei.”
- the user can continue with the search by inputting more characters and the search results can be updated instantly based on the entered characters.
- the search results are instantly updated based in part on the user hovering over one of the suggestions provided in the drop-down menu.
- the system evaluates resources corresponding to a feature that was included in the search query to identify an entity, where the entity represents a specific instance of that feature ( 204 ).
- the identified entity can be the name of an individual (e.g., a “John Doe” entity), a description of an occupation (e.g., a “Software Engineer” entity), the name of an organization (e.g., an “Example Corporation” entity), or some other description associated with an individual (e.g., a “President of the United States” entity).
- the entity is identified using resources linked with individuals, such as social profiles.
- a user's social profile can include a set of identified contacts, a set of links to external resources (e.g., web pages), and subscriptions to content of the system (e.g., a system that provides various content and applications including e-mail, chat, video, photo albums, or blogs).
- Each of these groups can be connected to other users or resources at another degree of separation from the user.
- contacts of the user can each have their own social profile that includes links to resources and contacts.
- the connections to a user within a specified number of degrees of separation can be considered the social circle of the user.
- Users e.g., contacts of a user
- Users can view and interact with each other's social profiles.
- entities are identified using social profiles corresponding to a feature that was included in the search query. For example, an entity can be identified for an individual named “John Doe” if the search query included the feature “john doe,” and if a social profile for that individual is available. Additionally, features can be algorithmically determined based on a number of objective factors (e.g., popularity of search terms) without human intervention. For example, an entity can be identified for an individual named “John Doe” if the search query included the feature “john”.
- an entity is identified based on the number of social circles in which a particular social profile has been added. For example, an entity can be set to correspond to a first “John Doe” if the number of individuals that have added the first “John Doe” to their social circle exceeds the number of individuals that have added a second “John Doe.”
- entity identification is based on the identity of the user submitting the search query. For example, the system can determine the identity of a user submitting the search query if the user has been authenticated (e.g., by signing into an account; Internet protocol address; or by using information stored on the user's system, e.g., cookies).
- the entity is identified based on a social affinity score between the user submitting the search query and one or more individuals.
- social profiles corresponding to individuals named “John Doe” can include profiles for a first, second, and third “John Doe.”
- the system can evaluate a social affinity score for each social profile.
- the social affinity score can represent a level of interaction between the user submitting the search query and each social profile (e.g., the number of times the user has viewed a social profile, the level of communication between the user and an individual's social profile, whether an individual is in the user's social circle).
- the “John Doe” entity can be set to correspond to the social profile for the third “John Doe.”
- the social affinity score can be used to allow the user to find a particular individual (e.g., someone the user personally knows) amongst other individuals that share the same name.
- a cluster of resources corresponding to the “John Doe” entity i.e., resources responsive to the third “John Doe” can be searched to obtain responsive search results.
- An entity can also be identified using resources (e.g., documents, web pages, and images) in a cluster of resources for a feature. In some implementations, an entity is identified based on a count of a number of resources that are responsive to a specific instance of a feature.
- resources e.g., documents, web pages, and images
- a “Jane Doe” entity can be set to correspond to the second “Jane Doe.”
- a cluster of resources corresponding to the “Jane Doe” entity i.e., resources determined to be responsive to the second “Jane Doe” can be searched to obtain responsive search results.
- an entity is identified using the popularity of resources (e.g., documents, web pages, and images) in a cluster of resources for a feature. For example, if resources responsive to individuals named “Jane Doe” include references to a first, second, and third “Jane Doe,” and the resources responsive to the first “Jane Doe” are determined to be more popular (e.g., a higher search engine ranking) than the second or third “Jane Doe,” then a “Jane Doe” entity can be set to correspond to the first “Jane Doe.” In this example, a cluster of resources corresponding to the “Jane Doe” entity (i.e., resources responsive to the first “Jane Doe”) can be searched to obtain responsive search results.
- resources responsive to individuals named “Jane Doe” include references to a first, second, and third “Jane Doe,” and the resources responsive to the first “Jane Doe” are determined to be more popular (e.g., a higher search engine ranking) than
- an entity is identified using information from a user's browsing history. For example, if a user submitting a search query previously searched for a particular individual, then an entity can be set to correspond to that particular individual, where a search using that entity can obtain search results responsive to the particular individual.
- an entity is identified using a geographic location associated with the user submitting a search query.
- resources responsive to individuals named “John Doe” may contain references to a first “John Doe,” who is located in San Francisco and a second “John Doe,” who is located in Los Angeles.
- An entity can be set to correspond to the first “John Doe” in a case where the geographic location for a user submitting a search query is determined to be San Francisco.
- an entity can be set to correspond to the second “John Doe” in a case where the geographic location for a user submitting a search query is determined to be Los Angeles.
- Entities can also be associated with features that reference an occupation, an organization, or a description for an individual.
- an occupation entity is identified using resources associated with individuals that list an occupation for that individual. For example, a social profile for an individual named “John Doe” that lists “Software Engineer” as an occupation can be used to identify a “Software Engineer” entity.
- the occupation entity can be used to search a cluster of resources to identify one or more individuals of that occupation.
- a “Software Engineer” entity can be used to search a related cluster of resources (e.g., web pages of software engineers, documents written by software engineers, web pages for software companies) to identify one or more individuals who are software engineers.
- Specific individuals within this cluster of resources can be identified using one or more of the described techniques (e.g., based on the number of social circles in which a particular social profile has been added, a social affinity score between the user submitting the search query and one or more individuals, the number of resources determined to be responsive for an individual, the popularity of resources for an individual, the browsing history of a user submitting a search query, and the geographic location of a user submitting a search query).
- the search query includes features that reference an individual and an occupation, where an entity is set to correspond to the individual that practices the referenced occupation.
- an organization entity is identified using resources associated with individuals that list an organization with which that individual is associated. For example, a social profile for an individual named “John Doe” that lists “Example Corporation” as an organization can be used to identify an “Example Corporation” entity.
- the organization entity can be used to search a cluster of resources to identify one or more individuals associated with that organization.
- the search query includes features that reference an individual and an organization, where an entity is set to correspond to the individual that is affiliated with the referenced organization.
- an Internet protocol address, or a domain name system address, associated with a user submitting a search query is used to identify an entity. For example, assuming an “example.com” domain name system address corresponds to an organization named “Example Corporation,” if a user submits a search query that originates from an “example.com” domain name system address, then an entity can be set to correspond to the “Example Corporation” organization. In particular, the user's search query can be filtered to obtain resources that are associated with the “Example Corporation” entity.
- search results can be refined further using one or more techniques described above to identify a particular “Jane Doe” (e.g., based on the number of social circles in which a particular social profile has been added, a social affinity score between the user submitting the search query and one or more individuals, the number of resources determined to be responsive for an individual, the popularity of resources for an individual, the browsing history of a user submitting a search query, and the geographic location of a user submitting a search query).
- a particular “Jane Doe” e.g., based on the number of social circles in which a particular social profile has been added, a social affinity score between the user submitting the search query and one or more individuals, the number of resources determined to be responsive for an individual, the popularity of resources for an individual, the browsing history of a user submitting a search query, and the geographic location of a user submitting a search query).
- the system provides one or more entities for selection ( 204 ).
- a user entering a search query can be presented one or more autocomplete suggestions (e.g., in a drop-down menu), where the user can submit a search query upon selection of one of the suggestions.
- the identified entity is presented as a suggestion in a list of suggestions.
- the system can present suggestions “john doe,” “john doe lyrics,” “john doe tv show,” and a “John Doe” entity.
- the presented “John Doe” entity can include a visual identifier associated with the entity and corresponding information (e.g., occupation and affiliated organization).
- the system receives a selection of an entity ( 206 ).
- the user can select a presented entity, where selection of that entity triggers a search within a cluster of resources that corresponds to the entity.
- a selected entity is refined by adding one or more terms to the search query.
- a “Jane Doe” entity can be refined by the user by adding one or more terms (“software engineer”) in a search query box, where the additional terms can be used to refine resources that were obtained as being responsive to the “Jane Doe” entity.
- resources that were obtained as being responsive to the “Jane Doe” entity can be filtered to obtain resources related to the additional terms “software engineer.”
- the system obtains resources responsive to the selected entity ( 208 ).
- the system obtains resources (e.g., documents, web pages, images) from a cluster of resources, where the resources are responsive to the selected entity. For example, if resources responsive to individuals named “Jane Doe” include references to a first, second, and third “Jane Doe” and the selected entity corresponds to the third “Jane Doe,” then the system obtains resources responsive to the third “Jane Doe.”
- Each entity can be linked to a particular cluster of resources (e.g., documents, web pages, and images) that correspond to that entity.
- the cluster of resources can include metadata (e.g., pictures, keywords, or other personally relevant information) determined to be responsive to the identified entity.
- a cluster of resources can be created in an offline process or at runtime by a clustering engine (e.g., clustering engine 154 of FIG. 1 ).
- the clustering engine can create a cluster of resources for a particular entity by identifying resources that are associated with the particular entity. Resources can be identified, for example, by searching an index of resources and the identified resources can be associated with particular entities based on the particular entities occurring in the resource content or metadata associated with those particular entities.
- the system provides the obtained resources to the user ( 210 ).
- a search results page can be provided for presentation (e.g., by a client browser) that includes resources that were obtained from a cluster of resources for a selected entity.
- the obtained resources can include results associated with images, web pages, audio, video resources, social content (e.g., social profile posts authored by the entity), or authored content (e.g., articles authored by the entity).
- the obtained resources can be provided in a ranked order as determined using one or more ranking criteria (e.g., popularity). In some implementations, the ranked order is based in part on a ranking of resources within a cluster of resources for a selected entity, where the ranking is performed using search engine ranking criteria.
- resources are obtained based in part on ranking and category (e.g., web pages, documents, or images), where the resources are obtained in a ranked order within a specified category.
- category e.g., web pages, documents, or images
- the obtained resources can include the top five web pages and the top five images corresponding to the selected entity.
- the obtained resources for the selected entity are provided in a manner that facilitates user recognition of the selected entity and resources corresponding to the selected entity.
- the presentation of obtained resources can include a variety of information for the selected entity (e.g., the name of an individual, occupation, employer, geographic location, organization, images related to the individual, links to resources within a related cluster of resources, social connections to other people, metadata, or other summaries as derived from the underlying cluster of resources.
- the metadata can include, for example, keywords or other relevant, distinguishing textual features.

Description
- This application is a non-provisional of and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/584,790, filed on Jan. 9, 2012, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
- This specification relates to people search results.
- Internet search engines aim to identify resources (e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia context) that are relevant to a user's needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user. Internet search engines return search results in response to a user submitted query. For example, a user query can seek resources associated with a particular individual by including a name in a query.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a search query, where the search query includes one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying one or more entities associated with the individual identifier; providing the one or more entities as query suggestions; receiving a selection of an entity; obtaining search results for the selected entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the selected entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the selected entity.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied on a computer storage medium encoded with instructions that when executed by one or more computers cause the one or more computers to perform operations of receiving a search query, where the search query comprises one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying one or more entities associated with the individual identifier; providing the one or more entities as query suggestions; receiving a selection of an entity; obtaining search results for the selected entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the selected entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the selected entity.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied on a system including: one or more computers and one or more storage devices storing instructions that are operable, when executed by the one or more computers, to cause the one or more computers to perform operations of: receiving a search query, where the search query comprises one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying one or more entities associated with the individual identifier; providing the one or more entities as query suggestions; receiving a selection of an entity; obtaining search results for the selected entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the selected entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the selected entity.
- These and other embodiments can optionally include one or more of the following features. The method further includes refining the search results using the one or more terms in the search query. The one or more terms include an occupation identifier. The one or more terms include an organization identifier. The method further includes receiving a second search query, where the second search query includes one or more second terms; refining the identified search results using the one or more second terms; and presenting the refined search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the selected entity.
- Obtaining search results for the selected entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the selected entity includes identifying one or more social profiles associated with the individual identifier. Social profiles are identified based in part on a geographic location of a user. Social profiles are identified based in part on a history of search queries received for a user. Social profiles are identified based in part on inclusion in a social circle associated with a user. Presenting the identified search results includes presenting one or more mechanisms for contacting the selected entity. Presenting the obtained search results comprises providing a mechanism for requesting that the selected entity join a social group associated with a user. Receiving a search query includes receiving at least a portion of the search query.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a search query, where the search query comprises one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying an entity associated with the individual identifier; obtaining search results for the identified entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the identified entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the identified entity.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied on a computer storage medium encoded with instructions that when executed by one or more computers cause the one or more computers to perform operations of: receiving a search query, where the search query comprises one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying an entity associated with the individual identifier; obtaining search results for the identified entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the identified entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the identified entity.
- In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied on a system including: one or more computers and one or more storage devices storing instructions that are operable, when executed by the one or more computers, to cause the one or more computers to perform operations of: receiving a search query, where the search query comprises one or more terms including an individual identifier; identifying an entity associated with the individual identifier; obtaining search results for the identified entity, where the search results are obtained using clustered resources corresponding to the identified entity; and providing the obtained search results, where the search results are presented in a social profile page corresponding to the identified entity.

The entity is identified based in part on a history of search queries submitted by a user submitting the search query. The entity is identified based in part on inclusion in a social circle associated with a user submitting the search query.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Search results corresponding to particular individuals can be obtained and provided for presentation. User interface elements present results to help the user recognize a “correct” individual (e.g., when multiple individuals share a name), for example, using photos, metadata, and relevant results identified for particular individuals. Additionally, users can identify individuals associated with non-name queries, for example, occupation, organization, events, or location. Users can retrieve comprehensive search results for a particular individual. The retrieved results can include publicly available search results and content that the particular individual has chosen to share with the users through, for example, a social profile page. A user can obtain search results for a particular individual based on a determined affinity between the user and the particular individual and based on a determined popularity of the particular individual.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- Users can search for individuals by submitting a search query to a search system, where the search query includes a feature. The feature can be the name of an individual, a description of an occupation, the name of an organization, or some other description associated with an individual (e.g., “president of the united states”). Particular entities can be suggested in response to a feature submitted with a search query. The suggested entities can include information (e.g., an individual's name, occupation, affiliated organization, and geographic location), where the information is obtained from a corresponding cluster of resources. The entities suggested can vary depending on different factors (e.g., the user submitting the search query, a geographic location of the user submitting the search query, or a social affinity between the user submitting the query and an individual associated with an entity). Users can select a suggested entity to obtain resources from a cluster of resources that corresponds to the selected entity.

FIG. 1 shows anexample system 100. Thesystem 100 provides search results relevant to submitted queries as can be implemented in an internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment. Thesystem 100 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented. - A
user 102 can interact with asearch system 114 through aclient device 104. For example, theclient 104 can be a computer coupled to thesearch system 114 through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet. In some implementations, thesearch system 114 and theclient device 104 can be one machine. For example, a user can install a desktop search application on theclient device 104. Theclient device 104 will generally include a random access memory (RAM) 106 and aprocessor 108. - A
user 102 can submit aquery 110 to asearch engine 130 within asearch system 114. When theuser 102 submits aquery 110, thequery 110 is transmitted through a network to thesearch system 114. Thesearch system 114 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network. Thesearch system 114 includes anindex database 122 and asearch engine 130. Thesearch system 114 responds to thequery 110 by generatingsearch results 128, which are transmitted through the network to theclient device 104 in a form that can be presented to the user 102 (e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed in a web browser running on the client device 104). - When the
query 110 is received by thesearch engine 130, thesearch engine 130 identifies resources that match, or are responsive to, thequery 110. Thesearch engine 130 will generally include anindexing engine 120 that indexes resources (e.g., web pages, images, or news articles on the Internet) found in a corpus (e.g., a collection or repository of content), anindex database 122 that stores the index information, and a ranking engine 152 (or other software) to rank the resources that match thequery 110. The indexing and ranking of the resources can be performed using conventional techniques. The search system also includes a clustering engine 154 to cluster resources responsive to features (e.g., individuals, occupation, or organization). Cluster features can be included in theindex database 122 or in a separate index, not shown. Alternatively, cluster features can be identified at runtime. Thesearch engine 130 can transmit the search results 128 through the network to theclient device 104 for presentation to theuser 102. - In some implementations, a query is received prior to submission to the
search engine 130. For example, a query can be received as it is being entered by theuser 102 and before the search is executed (e.g., by selecting a “search” button). One or more suggested queries can be provided to theuser 102. The suggested queries can include suggestions of particular entities. -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of anexample process 200 for obtaining entity-specific search results. For convenience, theprocess 200 will be described with respect to a system including one or more computing devices that performs theprocess 200. - The system receives a search query (202). Search queries can be received from a client device communicating over a network, where the client device interacts with the system using an interface, such as a network interface. The search query can include one or more terms received from a user. For example, the search query can be “Eiffel.” In some implementations, a user enters a search query including one or more terms, where the terms include a feature. The feature can be a name for an individual and can be a full or partial name (e.g., “John,” “Doe,” “John D.,” or “Doe, J.”). In some implementations, the feature is a description of an occupation (e.g., “software engineer”), where the occupation can be used to identify one or more individuals. In some other implementations, the feature is the name of an organization (e.g., “sharks football team”), where the name of the organization can be used to identify one or more individuals. In yet some other implementations, the feature is a description associated with an individual (e.g., “president of the united states”), where the description can be used to identify one or more individuals. In some alternative implementations, the feature is a combination of one or more features (e.g., “john doe software engineer,” “john doe example corporation,” “john doe san francisco,” or “john doe the oldest man in the world”), where the feature can be used to identify one or more individuals.
- During entry of the search query to the system, suggestions can be provided to the user, e.g., in a drop-down menu so that the user can select from different options. The suggestions can be suggested queries including the same or additional autocompleted query terms. In some implementations, the suggestions are based on other users' search activities. The searches can be algorithmically determined based on a number of objective factors (e.g., popularity of search terms) without human intervention. For example, the user can enter “eiffel,” and the system can suggest “Eiffel Tower,” “Eiffel Tower at night,” Eiffel Tower Paris,” and/or “Eiffel Tower pictures.” The system can provide suggestions based on a word-completion algorithm. Alternatively, the system can provide suggestions based on historical data from prior search terms.
- In some implementations, the system provides suggestions for one or more entities that correspond to terms received from the user, as discussed in more detail below. For example, the user input of “John Smi” can result in a suggested query of “John Smith”. Alternatively, a user input of “John Smith” can result in a suggested query of “John Smith—Software Engineer—Mountain View, CA,” as described in greater detail below.
- In some implementations, instant search results are provided based in part upon entry of one or more characters in the search query. For example, the user can enter a search query for “ei,” and search results provided can include search results with phrases “Eiffel Tower,” “Eileen Band,” and “Einstein,” each matching the search term “ei.” The user can continue with the search by inputting more characters and the search results can be updated instantly based on the entered characters. In some implementations, the search results are instantly updated based in part on the user hovering over one of the suggestions provided in the drop-down menu.
- The system evaluates resources corresponding to a feature that was included in the search query to identify an entity, where the entity represents a specific instance of that feature (204). The identified entity can be the name of an individual (e.g., a “John Doe” entity), a description of an occupation (e.g., a “Software Engineer” entity), the name of an organization (e.g., an “Example Corporation” entity), or some other description associated with an individual (e.g., a “President of the United States” entity).
- In some implementations, the entity is identified using resources linked with individuals, such as social profiles. A user's social profile can include a set of identified contacts, a set of links to external resources (e.g., web pages), and subscriptions to content of the system (e.g., a system that provides various content and applications including e-mail, chat, video, photo albums, or blogs). Each of these groups can be connected to other users or resources at another degree of separation from the user. For example, contacts of the user can each have their own social profile that includes links to resources and contacts. The connections to a user within a specified number of degrees of separation can be considered the social circle of the user. Users (e.g., contacts of a user) can view and interact with each other's social profiles. In such implementations, entities are identified using social profiles corresponding to a feature that was included in the search query. For example, an entity can be identified for an individual named “John Doe” if the search query included the feature “john doe,” and if a social profile for that individual is available. Additionally, features can be algorithmically determined based on a number of objective factors (e.g., popularity of search terms) without human intervention. For example, an entity can be identified for an individual named “John Doe” if the search query included the feature “john”.
- In some implementations, an entity is identified based on the number of social circles in which a particular social profile has been added. For example, an entity can be set to correspond to a first “John Doe” if the number of individuals that have added the first “John Doe” to their social circle exceeds the number of individuals that have added a second “John Doe.” In some other implementations, entity identification is based on the identity of the user submitting the search query. For example, the system can determine the identity of a user submitting the search query if the user has been authenticated (e.g., by signing into an account; Internet protocol address; or by using information stored on the user's system, e.g., cookies).
- In some implementations, the entity is identified based on a social affinity score between the user submitting the search query and one or more individuals. For example, social profiles corresponding to individuals named “John Doe” can include profiles for a first, second, and third “John Doe.” Upon receiving a search query for “John Doe,” the system can evaluate a social affinity score for each social profile. The social affinity score can represent a level of interaction between the user submitting the search query and each social profile (e.g., the number of times the user has viewed a social profile, the level of communication between the user and an individual's social profile, whether an individual is in the user's social circle).
- For example, if the user submitting the search query is determined to interact more frequently with the social profile for the third “John Doe,” then the “John Doe” entity can be set to correspond to the social profile for the third “John Doe.” In other words, the social affinity score can be used to allow the user to find a particular individual (e.g., someone the user personally knows) amongst other individuals that share the same name. In this example, a cluster of resources corresponding to the “John Doe” entity (i.e., resources responsive to the third “John Doe”) can be searched to obtain responsive search results.
- An entity can also be identified using resources (e.g., documents, web pages, and images) in a cluster of resources for a feature. In some implementations, an entity is identified based on a count of a number of resources that are responsive to a specific instance of a feature. For example, if resources responsive to individuals named “Jane Doe” include references to a first, second, and third “Jane Doe,” and the number of resources responsive to the second “Jane Doe” exceed the number of resources for the first or third “Jane Doe,” then a “Jane Doe” entity can be set to correspond to the second “Jane Doe.” In this example, a cluster of resources corresponding to the “Jane Doe” entity (i.e., resources determined to be responsive to the second “Jane Doe”) can be searched to obtain responsive search results.
- In some other implementations, an entity is identified using the popularity of resources (e.g., documents, web pages, and images) in a cluster of resources for a feature. For example, if resources responsive to individuals named “Jane Doe” include references to a first, second, and third “Jane Doe,” and the resources responsive to the first “Jane Doe” are determined to be more popular (e.g., a higher search engine ranking) than the second or third “Jane Doe,” then a “Jane Doe” entity can be set to correspond to the first “Jane Doe.” In this example, a cluster of resources corresponding to the “Jane Doe” entity (i.e., resources responsive to the first “Jane Doe”) can be searched to obtain responsive search results.
- In some other implementations, an entity is identified using information from a user's browsing history. For example, if a user submitting a search query previously searched for a particular individual, then an entity can be set to correspond to that particular individual, where a search using that entity can obtain search results responsive to the particular individual.
- In yet some other implementations, an entity is identified using a geographic location associated with the user submitting a search query. For example, resources responsive to individuals named “John Doe” may contain references to a first “John Doe,” who is located in San Francisco and a second “John Doe,” who is located in Los Angeles. An entity can be set to correspond to the first “John Doe” in a case where the geographic location for a user submitting a search query is determined to be San Francisco. Similarly, an entity can be set to correspond to the second “John Doe” in a case where the geographic location for a user submitting a search query is determined to be Los Angeles.
- Entities can also be associated with features that reference an occupation, an organization, or a description for an individual. In some implementations, an occupation entity is identified using resources associated with individuals that list an occupation for that individual. For example, a social profile for an individual named “John Doe” that lists “Software Engineer” as an occupation can be used to identify a “Software Engineer” entity. In some implementations, the occupation entity can be used to search a cluster of resources to identify one or more individuals of that occupation.
- For example, a “Software Engineer” entity can be used to search a related cluster of resources (e.g., web pages of software engineers, documents written by software engineers, web pages for software companies) to identify one or more individuals who are software engineers. Specific individuals within this cluster of resources can be identified using one or more of the described techniques (e.g., based on the number of social circles in which a particular social profile has been added, a social affinity score between the user submitting the search query and one or more individuals, the number of resources determined to be responsive for an individual, the popularity of resources for an individual, the browsing history of a user submitting a search query, and the geographic location of a user submitting a search query). In some implementations, the search query includes features that reference an individual and an occupation, where an entity is set to correspond to the individual that practices the referenced occupation.
- In some other implementations, an organization entity is identified using resources associated with individuals that list an organization with which that individual is associated. For example, a social profile for an individual named “John Doe” that lists “Example Corporation” as an organization can be used to identify an “Example Corporation” entity. In some implementations, the organization entity can be used to search a cluster of resources to identify one or more individuals associated with that organization. In some implementations, the search query includes features that reference an individual and an organization, where an entity is set to correspond to the individual that is affiliated with the referenced organization.
- In some other implementations, an Internet protocol address, or a domain name system address, associated with a user submitting a search query is used to identify an entity. For example, assuming an “example.com” domain name system address corresponds to an organization named “Example Corporation,” if a user submits a search query that originates from an “example.com” domain name system address, then an entity can be set to correspond to the “Example Corporation” organization. In particular, the user's search query can be filtered to obtain resources that are associated with the “Example Corporation” entity.
- Additionally, if a user submits a search query for individuals named “Jane Doe” then an entity can be set to correspond to “Example Corporation,” where search for individuals named “Jane Doe” can be filtered to one or more individuals named “Jane Doe” that are associated with “Example Corporation.” In such implementations, the search results can be refined further using one or more techniques described above to identify a particular “Jane Doe” (e.g., based on the number of social circles in which a particular social profile has been added, a social affinity score between the user submitting the search query and one or more individuals, the number of resources determined to be responsive for an individual, the popularity of resources for an individual, the browsing history of a user submitting a search query, and the geographic location of a user submitting a search query).
- The system provides one or more entities for selection (204). A user entering a search query can be presented one or more autocomplete suggestions (e.g., in a drop-down menu), where the user can submit a search query upon selection of one of the suggestions. In some implementations, the identified entity is presented as a suggestion in a list of suggestions. For example, in response to a user entering a search query for “john doe,” the system can present suggestions “john doe,” “john doe lyrics,” “john doe tv show,” and a “John Doe” entity. In some implementations, the presented “John Doe” entity can include a visual identifier associated with the entity and corresponding information (e.g., occupation and affiliated organization).
- The system receives a selection of an entity (206). The user can select a presented entity, where selection of that entity triggers a search within a cluster of resources that corresponds to the entity. In some implementations, a selected entity is refined by adding one or more terms to the search query. For example, a “Jane Doe” entity can be refined by the user by adding one or more terms (“software engineer”) in a search query box, where the additional terms can be used to refine resources that were obtained as being responsive to the “Jane Doe” entity. In this example, resources that were obtained as being responsive to the “Jane Doe” entity can be filtered to obtain resources related to the additional terms “software engineer.”
- The system obtains resources responsive to the selected entity (208). In some implementations, the system obtains resources (e.g., documents, web pages, images) from a cluster of resources, where the resources are responsive to the selected entity. For example, if resources responsive to individuals named “Jane Doe” include references to a first, second, and third “Jane Doe” and the selected entity corresponds to the third “Jane Doe,” then the system obtains resources responsive to the third “Jane Doe.”
- Each entity can be linked to a particular cluster of resources (e.g., documents, web pages, and images) that correspond to that entity. In some implementations, the cluster of resources can include metadata (e.g., pictures, keywords, or other personally relevant information) determined to be responsive to the identified entity. A cluster of resources can be created in an offline process or at runtime by a clustering engine (e.g., clustering engine 154 of
FIG. 1 ). The clustering engine can create a cluster of resources for a particular entity by identifying resources that are associated with the particular entity. Resources can be identified, for example, by searching an index of resources and the identified resources can be associated with particular entities based on the particular entities occurring in the resource content or metadata associated with those particular entities. - The system provides the obtained resources to the user (210). For example, a search results page can be provided for presentation (e.g., by a client browser) that includes resources that were obtained from a cluster of resources for a selected entity. The obtained resources can include results associated with images, web pages, audio, video resources, social content (e.g., social profile posts authored by the entity), or authored content (e.g., articles authored by the entity). The obtained resources can be provided in a ranked order as determined using one or more ranking criteria (e.g., popularity). In some implementations, the ranked order is based in part on a ranking of resources within a cluster of resources for a selected entity, where the ranking is performed using search engine ranking criteria. In some other implementations, resources are obtained based in part on ranking and category (e.g., web pages, documents, or images), where the resources are obtained in a ranked order within a specified category. For example, the obtained resources can include the top five web pages and the top five images corresponding to the selected entity.
- In some implementations, the obtained resources for the selected entity are provided in a manner that facilitates user recognition of the selected entity and resources corresponding to the selected entity. For example, the presentation of obtained resources can include a variety of information for the selected entity (e.g., the name of an individual, occupation, employer, geographic location, organization, images related to the individual, links to resources within a related cluster of resources, social connections to other people, metadata, or other summaries as derived from the underlying cluster of resources. The metadata can include, for example, keywords or other relevant, distinguishing textual features.

For example, the drop-
down menu 306 can present an additional entity for a second individual also named “Aaron Brown,” where the second “Aaron Brown” can have a different geographic location (e.g., “San Diego, CA”), a different occupation (e.g., “Project Manager”), or a different organization (e.g., “Example Inc.”). - Instant search results 310 responsive to the terms “aaron brown” are presented. The
instant search results 310 are provided based on entry of the terms “aaron brown,” and include search results responsive to one or more individuals named “Aaron Brown.” The user can continue with the search by inputting more characters and the search results can be updated instantly based on the entered characters. In some implementations, the search results are instantly updated based in part on the user hovering over one of thesuggestions 306 provided in the drop-down menu. For example, the user can select the “Aaron Brown”entity 308 from the drop-down menu and, in response, the search results can be instantly updated to display search results responsive to theentity 308. - A
social profile 312 corresponding to the suggested “Aaron Brown”entity 308 is also presented.
