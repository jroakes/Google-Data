- the disclosed subject matter relates to methods, systems, and media for modifying search results based on search query risk. More particularly, the disclosed subject matter relates to determining whether to demote a search result based on search query risk.
- Keyword searching is an important tool that allows users to discover content on media content platforms. As such, great emphasis is placed on search engine optimization to cause content to appear earlier (or rank higher) in a search results list for certain keyword search queries.
- Content such as a video content, that receives a high rank in a search results list is more visible to users, which can attract more visitors that may select the video content for consumption, accrue more watch time, and ultimately lead to increased revenue.
- bad actors can abuse this visibility by optimizing misleading (e.g., spam), racy, pornographic, infringing, and/or “clickbait” content to target search queries that are deemed as being risky. For example, the search query “action full movie 2018” may yield a search results list including abusive re-uploads of action movies.
- a method for demoting search results comprising: receiving a search query for a video content item; generating a plurality of search results in response to the search query; calculating a set of result values, wherein each result value of the set of result values is associated with a respective search result of the plurality of search results; calculating a query value associated with the search query based on the set of result values; identifying a threshold value based on the query value; determining whether each result value of the set of result values is less than the threshold value; in response to determining that a first result value of the set of result values is less than the threshold value, demoting a first search result of the plurality of search results, wherein the first result value is associated with the first search result; and causing at least a portion of the plurality of search results to be presented based on the demotion.

Description
- This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/055,247, filed Nov. 13, 2020, which is the national stage application under 35 U.S.C. § 371 of International Patent No. PCT/US2019/060070, filed Nov. 6, 2019, which claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 62/769,894, filed Nov. 20, 2018, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- The disclosed subject matter relates to methods, systems, and media for modifying search results based on search query risk. More particularly, the disclosed subject matter relates to determining whether to demote a search result based on search query risk.
- Keyword searching is an important tool that allows users to discover content on media content platforms. As such, great emphasis is placed on search engine optimization to cause content to appear earlier (or rank higher) in a search results list for certain keyword search queries. Content, such as a video content, that receives a high rank in a search results list is more visible to users, which can attract more visitors that may select the video content for consumption, accrue more watch time, and ultimately lead to increased revenue. However, bad actors can abuse this visibility by optimizing misleading (e.g., spam), racy, pornographic, infringing, and/or “clickbait” content to target search queries that are deemed as being risky. For example, the search query “action full movie 2018” may yield a search results list including abusive re-uploads of action movies.
- Accordingly, it is desirable to provide new methods, systems, and media for modifying search results based on search query risk.
- Methods, systems, and media for modifying search results based on search query risk are provided.
- In accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, a method for demoting search results is provided, the method comprising: receiving a search query for a video content item; generating a plurality of search results in response to the search query; calculating a set of result values, wherein each result value of the set of result values is associated with a respective search result of the plurality of search results; calculating a query value associated with the search query based on the set of result values; identifying a threshold value based on the query value; determining whether each result value of the set of result values is less than the threshold value; in response to determining that a first result value of the set of result values is less than the threshold value, demoting a first search result of the plurality of search results, wherein the first result value is associated with the first search result; and causing at least a portion of the plurality of search results to be presented based on the demotion.

Advantageously, said mechanisms address the technical problems associated with how to filter abusive content from search results in response to search queries.
- In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can be used to demote search results. For example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can receive a search query, generate a plurality of search results in response to the search query, demote a first search result of the plurality of search results, and cause at least a portion of the plurality of search results to be presented based on the demotion, as described below in connection with
FIG. 1 . - In some embodiments, the mechanism described herein can demote search results based on search query risk. For example, in some embodiments, the mechanism described herein can calculate a set of result values (where result values are also referred to herein as result goodness values) corresponding to respective search results in response to a search query, calculate an overall query value (where query value is also referred to herein as a query goodness value) of the search query based on the set of result goodness values, and demote at least one search result based on the overall query goodness value, as described below in connection with
FIGS. 1-5 . In a more particular example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can identify a threshold value (also referred to herein as a threshold goodness value) based on the calculated query goodness value and demote a search result having a result goodness value that is less the threshold goodness value, as described below in connection withFIGS. 1, 5 , and 6. That is, a dynamic threshold is provided, the value of which is dependent on the received search query. In another more particular example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can refer to a function that maps a range of query goodness values to corresponding threshold goodness values, as described below in connection withFIGS. 5 and 6 . Accordingly, in some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can demote or otherwise modify search result positions or rankings based on the variable risk of search queries. In this way, abusive media may be filtered from appearing in the results sent to the user in response to the search query. - In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can adjust the function that maps query goodness values to threshold goodness values based on historical search traffic, as described below in connection with
FIG. 7 . For example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can adjust the function based on a classifier that classifies historical search results as abusive or not abusive. In a more particular example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can tune the function based on various weights and/or penalties for misclassification. Accordingly, in some embodiments, search results that are deemed to be abusive search results can be removed and/or hidden (e.g., without demoting search results more than necessary). - In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can improve search engine technology. For example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can determine the context of a search query and use the determined context to perform one or more actions. In a more particular example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can use effective abuse signals to understand the risk of a search query, and the mechanisms described herein can then vary an aggressiveness and/or granularity of demotions based on the risk.
- These and other features for demoting search results based on search query risk are described further in connection with
FIGS. 1-9 . - Turning to
FIG. 1 , an illustrative example 100 of a process for demoting search results based on search query risk in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter is shown. As illustrated, blocks ofprocess 100 can be executed by one or more servers, as shown and described in connection withFIGS. 8 and 9 , and/or any other suitable computing device(s). - At 102,
process 100 can receive a search query. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can receive a search query for one or more video content items from a user device. In some embodiments, a search query can include one or more search terms and/or any other suitable information. For example, the search query for one or more video content items can include the terms “action full movie 2018” or “holiday cartoon.” - At 104,
process 100 can generate search results in response to receiving the search query. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can generate search results including one or more content items associated with the search term(s) included in the search query and/or any other suitable information. In a more particular example,process 100 can perform the search by transmitting the received search query to a search engine, which can then execute the search. In some implementations, the search system can use a search application programming interface (API) to search various content sources for search results responsive to the received search query. Search results responsive to the received search query can then be obtained. - It should be noted that, in some embodiments, each search result can correspond to a different content item. In some embodiments, content items can include video content items (e.g., video clips, movies, video playlists, and/or any other suitable video content items), audio content items (e.g., audio clips, music, audiobooks, audio playlists, and/or any other suitable audio content items), images, articles, blogs, web pages, and/or any other suitable content items.
- At 106,
process 100 can determine information associated with each of the search results. For example, in some embodiments, the information can include one or more features associated with each content item included in the search results. For example, in some embodiments, features can include a quality score associated with a content item, a quality score associated with a user, entity, and/or channel that uploaded the content item, a watch rate score associated with the content item, and/or any other suitable feature information. In some embodiments, each feature can correspond to a feature used by a classifier to classify a content item, a user, a channel, etc. In some embodiments,process 100 can determine any other suitable information associated with each of the search results. - In some embodiments,
process 100 can determine information associated with each of the search results in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can collect the information from one or more local databases. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,process 100 can collect the information from one or more remote sources, such as a remote server. - At 108,
process 100 can calculate a relative goodness of each search result. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can calculate a respective result goodness value, Gr, for each of the search results (e.g., content items). In some embodiments, a result goodness value, Gr, can be a numerical value within a particular goodness range. In particular, in some embodiments, the goodness range can include a first boundary (e.g., 1.0) representing relative “goodness” and a second boundary (e.g., 0.0) representing an opposing end of the range, such as relative “badness.” In other words, in some embodiments, a result goodness value, Gr, can be a value such that 0≤Gr≤1. It should be noted that, in some embodiments, the goodness range can have any suitable boundaries, and “good” indicator and/or “bad” indicator can be represented by any suitable value(s) within those boundaries. - For example, in some embodiments, an official video related to a children's cartoon can be an example of a relatively “good” content item, while an abusive re-upload of a movie (e.g., re-upload videos including content that has been previously uploaded on a content provider site and/or associated with another user or entity, impersonate a channel associated with another user or entity, etc.) can be an example of a relatively “bad” content item. Accordingly, the official video related to the children's cartoon can then have a result goodness value closer to the first boundary representing relative “goodness” (e.g., Gr=1.0) and the abusive re-upload of the movie can have a result goodness value closer to the second boundary representing relative “badness” (e.g., Gr=0.0) in some embodiments. In this way, the result goodness value provides an indication as to whether a result is a relatively good quality result (e.g., an official video) or a relatively bad quality result (e.g., an abusive copy). Put another way, the result goodness value provides an indication as to the quality of the result.
- In some embodiments,
process 100 can calculate result goodness values in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can calculate respective result goodness values for each of the search results (e.g., content items) based on the determined information associated with each of the search results. In a more particular example, in some embodiments, each result goodness value can be calculated based on one or more features associated with a corresponding content item. In some embodiments,process 100 can calculate a result goodness value in the manner shown and discussed in connection withFIG. 2 . - Turning to
FIG. 2 , an illustrative example 200 of a process for calculating a result goodness value in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter is shown. As illustrated, blocks ofprocess 200 can be executed by one or more servers, as shown and described in connection withFIGS. 8 and 9 , and/or any other suitable computing device(s). - At 202,
process 200 can identify one or more features associated with each content item. For example, in some embodiments, the feature(s) can include a quality score associated with the content item, a quality score associated with a user, entity, and/or channel that uploaded the content item, a watch rate score associated with the content item, and/or any other suitable feature information. In a more particular example, a feature can include obtaining a channel score that is associated with a channel or a group of content items, where the content item is associated with the channel. In another more particular example, a feature can include obtaining a watch rate score that can represents the number of views or engagements a content item receives with respect to the number of times that the content item is shown (e.g., a video search result, a thumbnail representation, etc.). In some embodiments, the feature(s) can be identified from the information determined inblock 106. In some embodiments, a predetermined value, such as a default value, can be identified for a feature associated with the content item that cannot be determined inblock 106. - It should be noted that, in some embodiments, any suitable number of features can be identified or collected. In some embodiments, the type of features used in determining goodness values can be configured by a user receiving search results.
- At 204,
process 200 can calculate a relative goodness of each identified feature. For example, in some embodiments,process 200 can calculate a respective feature value (where feature value is also referred to herein as a feature goodness value), g, for each feature. In some embodiments, a feature goodness value, g, can be a numerical value within the goodness range. For example, in some embodiments, a feature goodness value g can be a value such that 0≤g≤1, where 0 can represent a “bad” or low-quality level of a feature and 1 can represent a “good” or high-quality level of a feature. - In some embodiments,
process 200 can calculate a feature goodness value, g, in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments,process 200 can map a feature (e.g., feature information determined for a content item) to a feature goodness value using a predetermined function, such as the function shown and described in connection withFIG. 3 . It should be noted that, in some embodiments,process 200 can map a feature to a feature goodness value using any suitable function. It is further noted that, in some embodiments,process 200 can use the same function or different functions to map each attribute to a respective feature goodness value. In some embodiments, mapping a plurality of features to one or more functions can normalize features to the goodness range. - Turning to
FIG. 3 , an illustrative example 300 of a function for mapping a feature to a feature goodness value in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter is shown. As described above, a watch rate score, w, can be a score that represents the number of views or engagements a content item receives with respect to the number of times that the content item is shown (e.g., a video search result, a thumbnail representation, etc.) and a watch rate goodness value, gw, can provide an indication as to the quality of the watch rate result, where the watch rate goodness value can be an indication as to whether a watch rate result is a relatively good quality watch rate result or a relatively bad quality watch rate result (e.g., an abusive copy). As illustrated, function 300 is a piecewise linear function that maps a watch rate score, w, to a watch rate goodness value, gw, where the watch rate goodness value, gw, is within a goodness range (e.g., 0≤gw≤1). For example, in some embodiments, function 300 can associate a content item having a relatively high watch rate score (e.g., w=0.8) with a relatively high watch rate goodness value (e.g., gw=1.0). As another example, in some embodiments, function 300 can associate a content item having a relatively low watch rate score (e.g., w=0) with a relatively low watch rate goodness value (e.g., gw=0.2). - Turning back to
FIG. 2 , at 206,process 200 can calculate a result goodness value, Gr, for a content item. In some embodiments, a result goodness value for a content item can reflect the overall goodness of a content item based on the goodness of its features. For example, in some embodiments, the result goodness value can be calculated based on the calculated feature goodness values. In a more particular example, in some embodiments, the result goodness value can be calculated as a product of the feature goodness values. - Additionally, in some embodiments, each of the features can be assigned a corresponding weight that is applied to corresponding feature goodness values when calculating the result goodness value. For example, in some embodiments, each weight can be applied as an exponent of a corresponding feature goodness value. In some embodiments, each weight can be a number between 0 and 1. Alternatively, in some embodiments, each weight can be any suitable number.
- In some embodiments,
process 200 can calculate a result goodness value, Gr, for a content item based on the feature goodness values g(feature) and respective weights of each feature k(feature) usingEquation 1 as follows: -
- For example, in some embodiments, assuming a weight of ke=0.4 applied to a quality feature and a weight of kw=0.44 applied to a watch rate feature, and for a content item having a quality goodness value of ge=0.9 and a watch rate goodness value of gw=0.8,
process 200 can calculate a goodness result value Gr using Equation 1.1 as follows: -
G r =g e ke ×g w kw =(0.9)(0.4)×(0.8)(0.44)≈0.8691 (Equation 1.1) - Turning back to
FIG. 1 , at 110,process 100 can calculate relative goodness of the search query. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can calculate a query goodness value, Gq, for the search query. In some embodiments, a query goodness value can be a value representing overall goodness of a search query based on relative goodness of the search results (e.g., content items) corresponding to the search query. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can calculate a query goodness value, Gq, based on the result goodness values, Gr, calculated inblock 108. In some embodiments, a query goodness value, Gq, can be a numerical value within the goodness range. For example, in some embodiments, a query goodness value, Gq, can be a value such that 0≤Gq≤1, where 0 can represent a “bad” or low-quality goodness value and 1 can represent a “good” or high-quality goodness value. The query goodness value may indicate a relative quality of the query. - In some embodiments,
process 100 can calculate a query goodness value in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can calculate the query goodness value, Gq, as an average of the calculated result goodness values, Gr, using Equation 2 as follows: -
Gq=avgr Gr (Equation 2) - Alternatively, in some embodiments,
process 100 can apply a function, f, to each of the calculated goodness values, Gr, prior to calculating an average of the result goodness values. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can calculate a query goodness value, Gq, based on result goodness values, Gr, using Equation 3 as follows: -
G q=avgr f(G r) (Equation 3) - In some embodiments, the function f can correspond to a kernel that is applied to each of the calculated result goodness values. For example, in some embodiments, the function, f, can be the identity function such that f (Gr)=Gr, in which case the query goodness value, Gq, can simply be calculated as the average of the result goodness values, Gr, such as in Equation 2. As another example, in some embodiments, the function, f, can be a function for adjusting a result goodness value, such as the function shown and described in connection with
FIG. 4 . In some embodiments, the function, f, can be any suitable function. - Turning to
FIG. 4 , an illustrative example 400 of a function for adjusting a result goodness value in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter is shown. As illustrated, function 400 is a piecewise linear function defined by Equation 4 as follows: -
- In some embodiments, application of
function 400 can adjust a mid-range result goodness value (e.g., Gr=0.5) to become a high result goodness value (e.g., f(Gr)=1.0). In effect, any search result (e.g., content item) having a result goodness value of 0.5≤Gr≤1 prior to adjustment can be identified as a “good” search result by having the high result goodness value after the adjustment in some embodiments. - Additionally, in some embodiments, calculation of a query goodness value, Gq, according to Equations 3 and 4 can distinguish between a polarized query, where half of the results are deemed to be very good (e.g., Gr=0.9) and half of the results are deemed to be very bad (e.g., Gr=0.1), and a mid-range query dominated by mid-range results (e.g., 0.4≤Gr≤0.6). For example, in some embodiments,
process 100 can calculate a query goodness value of Gq=0.5 for a polarized query and a query goodness value of Gq≈0.9 for a mid-range query using Equations 3 and 4. In contrast, a simple average of result goodness values Gr (e.g., without application offunction 400, such as in Equation 2) can yield a query goodness value of Gq=0.5 for both the polarized query and the query goodness value in some embodiments. - Turning back to
FIG. 1 , at 112,process 100 can selectively demote search results. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can determine whether any content items included in the search results are blacklisted items.Process 100 can then demote any search results associated with content items determined to be blacklisted in some embodiments. In some embodiments, a content item can be blacklisted when a channel and/or user associated with the content item is blacklisted. As another example,process 100 can demote search results based on the calculated result goodness values, the calculated query goodness value, and/or any other suitable information. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can demote search results in the manner shown and described in connection withFIG. 5 . In some embodiments,process 100 can demote search results in any suitable manner. - Turning to
FIG. 5 , an illustrative example 500 of a process for demoting search results in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter is shown. As illustrated, blocks ofprocess 500 can be executed by one or more servers, as shown and described in connection withFIGS. 8 and 9 , and/or any other suitable computing device(s). In some embodiments, blocks ofprocess 500 can be performed for each search result in a generated set of search results. - At 502,
process 500 can determine whether a search result is included in a whitelist. In some embodiments,process 500 can determine whether a search result is included in a whitelist by determining whether a content item associated with the search result is included in a whitelist. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,process 500 can determine that a search result is included in a whitelist if a channel, playlist, and/or domain (e.g., URL) associated with the search result is included in a whitelist. In some embodiments,process 500 can receive information indicating whether a search result is included in a whitelist. For example, in some embodiments,process 500 can receive the information from a local database and/or a remote source (e.g., a remote server). - At 504, in response to determining that a search result is included in a whitelist,
process 500 can allow the search result. In some embodiments, allowing the search result can include allowing the search result to be presented in a list of search results. - However, at 506, in response to determining that a search result is not included in a whitelist,
process 500 can determine whether the search result is included in a blacklist. In some embodiments,process 500 can determine whether a search result is included in a blacklist by determining whether a content item associated with the search result is included in a blacklist. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,process 500 can determine that a search result is included in a blacklist if a channel, playlist, and/or domain (e.g., uniform resource locator (URL)) associated with the search result is included in a blacklist. In some embodiments,process 500 can receive information indicating whether a search result is included in a blacklist. For example, in some embodiments,process 500 can receive the information from a local database and/or a remote source (e.g., a remote server). - At 508, in response to determining that a search result is included in a blacklist,
process 500 can demote the search result. In some embodiments, demoting a search result can include lowering a rank in which the search result is presented in a list of search results. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, demoting a search result can include preventing monetization of a content item associated with the search result. In other words, playback of a content item associated with a demoted search result can be prevented from accruing ad revenue in some embodiments. In some embodiments, demoting a search result can include preventing the search result from being presented in the list of search results. In some embodiments, demoting a search result can include any other suitable action. - However, at 510, in response to determining that a search result is not included in a blacklist,
process 500 can identify a threshold goodness value, GT. In some embodiments, a threshold goodness value can correspond to a minimum allowable result goodness value a search result must have to be presented in a list of search results. In some embodiments, the threshold goodness value , GT, can be any suitable value. For example, in some embodiments, a threshold goodness value, GT, can be a predetermined value, such as 0.5 or any other suitable value. As another example, in some embodiments,process 500 can identify a threshold goodness value, GT, based on the query goodness value, Gq, calculated inblock 110. In a more particular example, in some embodiments,process 500 can identify the threshold goodness value, GT, based on the function shown and described in connection withFIG. 6 . In some embodiments,process 500 can identify a threshold goodness value in any suitable manner. - Turning to
FIG. 6 , an illustrative example 600 of a function for identifying a threshold goodness value in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter is shown. As illustrated, function 600 includes acurve 602 that defines a threshold goodness value, GT, based on a query goodness value, Gq, ademote region 604, an allowregion 606, and an always allowregion 608. - In some embodiments,
curve 602 can be a monotonically non-increasing function. In particular, in some embodiments, the threshold goodness value, GT, can decrease as the query goodness value, Gq, increases. In other words, riskier search queries (e.g., queries having a query goodness value, Gq, closer to 0 or a lower bound) can result in stronger demotions relative to less risky search queries (e.g., queries having a query goodness value, Gq, closer to 1 or an upper bound) in some embodiments. As a result, in some embodiments, more search results can be demoted for search queries that are deemed to be riskier search queries, and more search results can be allowed for search queries that are deemed to be less risky search queries. - In some embodiments,
curve 602 can map a query goodness value, Gq, to a minimum allowable result goodness value, Gr (or a threshold goodness value, GT). In other words, in some embodiments, a search result can be allowed to be presented if it has a result goodness value, Gr, that is greater than or equal to a threshold goodness value, GT, corresponding to the query goodness value, Gq, of the search query that led to the search result. Furthermore, in some embodiments, a search result can be demoted if it has a result goodness value, Gr, that is less than a threshold goodness value, GT, corresponding to the query goodness value, Gq, of the search query that led to the search result. Accordingly, in some embodiments,curve 602 can define an upper boundary ofdemote region 602 and a lower boundary of allowregion 606. - In some embodiments,
value A 610 can correspond to a maximum value ofcurve 602. In other words, in some embodiments, a search result having a result goodness value, Gr, that is greater than or equal to value A 610 can never be demoted according tofunction 600. Accordingly, in some embodiments,value A 610 can define a lower boundary of always allowregion 608. - Turning back to
FIG. 5 , at 510,process 500 can identify a threshold goodness value, GT, by mapping the calculated query goodness value, Gq, to a corresponding result goodness value, Gr, usingfunction 600. - At 512,
process 500 can compare a result goodness value, Gr, of a search result to the threshold goodness value, GT. For example, in some embodiments,process 500 can determine whether the result goodness value, Gr, is less than the threshold goodness value, GT. In some embodiments, the result goodness value used in the comparison can correspond to the result goodness value of the search result calculated inblock 108. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the result goodness value used in the comparison can correspond to a predetermined value, such as Gr=0.5 or any other suitable value. - At 508, in response to determining that a result goodness value, Gr, of a search result is less than the threshold goodness value, GT,
process 500 can demote the search result as described above. - However, at 504, in response to determining that a result goodness value, Gr, of a search result is greater than or equal to the threshold goodness value, GT,
process 500 can allow the search result as described above. - Turning back to
FIG. 1 , at 114,process 100 can cause at least a portion of the generated search results to be presented based on the demotion performed inblock 112. For example, in some embodiments,process 100 can cause at least a portion of the generated search results to be presented such that one or more demoted search results are prevented from being presented. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,process 100 can cause at least a portion of the generated search results to be presented such that one or more demoted search results are presented at a lower rank than originally generated. In some embodiments,process 100 can cause the search results to be presented on the user device that sent the search query. - Turning to
FIG. 7 , an illustrative example 700 of a process for tuning functions in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter is shown. As illustrated, blocks ofprocess 700 can be executed by one or more servers, as shown and described in connection withFIGS. 8 and 9 , and/or any other suitable computing device(s). - At 702,
process 700 can receive a history of search traffic associated with one or more users. For example, in some embodiments, a history of search traffic can include previous search queries, top-K search results corresponding to those queries, and/or any other suitable information. In some embodiments,process 700 can retrieve the history of search traffic from one or more local databases. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,process 700 can receive the history of search traffic from one or more remote sources, such as a remote server. - At 704,
process 700 can label each search result included in the history of search traffic as one of a plurality of labels. For example, in some embodiments, the labels can include a “BAD” label, which corresponds to a result that is deemed to be abusive. As another example, in some embodiments, the labels can include a “GOOD” label, which corresponds to a result that is deemed to be not abusive. As yet another example, in some embodiments, the labels can include an “UNKNOWN” label, which corresponds to a result about which little is known. In some embodiments, the labels can include any other suitable label. - At 706,
process 700 can tune one or more functions based at least on the history of search traffic. For example, in some embodiments,process 700 can tune function 300, function 400, and/or function 600 based on the history of search traffic and/or any other suitable information. In some embodiments,process 700 can tune function 300, function 400, and/or function 600 in any suitable manner, such as utilizing support vector machines (SVM), naïve Bayes classifiers, Bayesian networks, decision trees, machine learning models, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, probabilistic classification models, and/or any other suitable technique. - In some embodiments,
process 700 can use the labeled search results to tunefunction 300, function 400, and/orfunction 600. For example, in some embodiments, the labeled search results can be used as a training dataset of a model and/or a classifier. In a more particular example, in some embodiments, search results labeled as “BAD” can be included in a set of negative examples of the training dataset. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, search results labeled as “GOOD” or “UNKNOWN” can be included in a set of positive examples of the training dataset. In some embodiments, the training dataset can include any other suitable examples and/or information. - Additionally, in some embodiments, each search result included in the training dataset can be associated with a weight based on a label associated with the search result. For example, in some embodiments, a “BAD” search result can be associated with a mid-range weight (e.g., 4.0). As another example, in some embodiments, a “GOOD” search result can be associated with a relatively high weight (e.g., 16.0). In effect, wrongly demoting a “GOOD” search result can lead to a relatively large penalty in some embodiments. As yet another example, in some embodiments, an “UNKNOWN” search result can be associated with a relatively low weight (e.g., 0.1+p(x|q)). In some embodiments, p(x|q) can correspond to a fraction of the search query watch time attributed to the search result. Accordingly, in some embodiments, wrongly demoting an “UNKNOWN” search result can lead to a relatively small penalty (e.g., between 0.1 and 1.1).
- In some embodiments,
process 700 can use a logistic loss function to perform the tuning, such as Equation 5 as follows: -
- In some embodiments, p as referenced in Equation 5 can correspond to a probability of a search result belonging to a positive class. Additionally, in some embodiments, slope as referenced in Equation 5 can correspond to slope=2 or any other suitable value.
