- another aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure includes determining one or more demographic profiles, each demographic profile being based on content provided by a content database over the computer network to a predetermined set of users that have a common demographic property, the content interacted with by the predetermined set of users, each demographic profile being associated with the common demographic property, determining a first demographic property for a new user, selecting from the one or more demographic profiles, a demographic profile based on the first demographic property of the new user, based on the selected demographic profile, creating a query to the content database, submitting the query over the computer network to the content database, and retrieving content from the content database based on the query, and providing the content to the user.
- implementations of one or more of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- each of the one or more demographic profiles is determined based on content interacted with by the predetermined set of users that have the common demographic property within a first predetermined period of time, and the method further comprises: updating the one or more demographic profiles based on content interacted with by the predetermined set of users that have the common demographic property within a second predetermined period of time.
- the predetermined set of users may include a predetermined number of users that have performed one or more from the group of subscribing to a predetermined number of content sources, and reading a number of content items that satisfies a threshold.
- features may include wherein the common demographic property includes information about one or more of location, age and gender, wherein each of the one or more demographic profiles includes one or more categories which are determined from the content items interacted with by the respective predetermined set of users, or wherein the one or more categories are weighted according to a score of each of the content items from which the respective categories are determined, and wherein the score is preferably based on one or more of a frequency of reads by the predetermined set of users, a frequency of reads by all users, a number of reshares of the content items of a social network platform, a number of endorsements of the content items, a number of self-posts of the content items; and a number of trending popular content items.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example system for recommending content.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example system for recommending content as a social network server.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example content recommendation unit.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example method for generating a profile.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B are a flowchart illustrating another example method for generating a profile.
- FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an example method for recommending content using a demographic profile.
- One technical issue with existing applications that recommend content to a user is that providing inappropriate recommendations, cause resource inefficiency when distributing recommendations and/or content from content sources to users using a stream.
- the inefficiency arises either because a user is provided proactively with content that the user would have otherwise not requested, or because a user requests, based on recommendations received by the user, contents that appears to be of interest but which is in fact not of interest to the user.
- the systems and methods disclosed herein address the technical issue to reduce said resource inefficiency, in part by increasing the prediction accuracy of selecting content and/or recommendations provided to a user via a stream.
- a demographic profile includes information that enables selection of content items from a content stream based on said information.
- a demographic profile may specify one or more topics and/or categories of content items.
- a demographic profile corresponds to a demography which reflects certain demographic properties of users belonging to the demography, the demographic properties being for example a location, age, etc. as described elsewhere herein.
- a user has certain demographic properties according to which a demographic profile can be chosen. Such demographic profile reflects interests and topics in the specific demography to which the user belongs.
- Another technical issue is how to provide recommended content to new users that have not subscribed to any sources or topics and have an empty or near empty interest profile.
- the systems and methods disclosed in this specification solve this technical issue by identifying healthy or engaged users that are engaged with the system and have a predetermined level of interaction with the system.
- the system also identifies one or more demographic properties of the healthy or engaged users. With the consent of the healthy or engaged users, the system processes the content items in their stream and their interaction with the content items for healthy or engaged users with a given demographic property, and then uses the processing to build a demographic profile for the given demographic property.
- the demographic profile is used to recommend content to new users that have the same demographic property.
- the systems and methods disclosed in this specification are advantageous because they increase the engagement of new users with the system, provide recommended content that more closely matches the user interest, and leverage the interaction and knowledge of existing users that know what they are doing to help new users gain knowledge of the system.
- Another advantage provided by the systems and methods disclosed in this specification is that, in the context of distributing contents from content sources to users, a smaller, more targeted selection of recommendations and corresponding content items can be provided to each user, so that overall content distribution from news sources to users can be more resource efficient.

- the user identification module 204 is coupled to the content acquisition pipeline 200 receive the content items and each content item's metadata and tags. For a selected user and with the user's consent, the user identification module 204 can retrieve the interaction(s) of that user with the content items in the social network server 101 . In some implementations, the user identification module 204 can determine the type of the user as one or more of a consumer, an engager, a healthy user or a new user.
- the user identification module 204 determines whether the selected user is a “new user” by determining whether the selected user satisfies (interacted with fewer than) a threshold number of content items in a predetermined period. For example, users that have read 5 or fewer posts in the last 30 days may be classified as new users. It should be understood that different definitions for a new user may be created and used by modifying the number of interactions or selecting only particular types of interactions with content, for example, only subscription to topic, only reads, only comments, or only selected types of interactions or sets of types of interactions. The user identification module 204 also identifies one or more properties of the user.
- the user identification module 204 may determine the Internet Protocol address (IP address) from which the user is accessing the social network server 101 and then translate the IP address into a location.
- IP address Internet Protocol address
- the location may be a city, a state, a country, a region, etc. in different implementations.
- the user identification module 204 may identify one or more properties of the user by accessing a profile of the user, presenting a question or query to the user, or explicitly or implicitly determining the value of the property for the user based on the property itself or from a knowledge graph.
- the user identification module 204 is also coupled to the profile selection module 206 to provide a signal indicating whether the user is a new user and one or more demographic properties of the user.
- the profile selection module 206 may be steps, processes, functionalities or a device including routines for selecting a demographic profile to use in generating the stream of content for the user.
- the profile selection module 206 is coupled to the profile generation module 202 to retrieve and access the demographic profiles created by and stored in the profile selection module 206 .
- the profile generation module 202 creates and stores the demographic profiles in the data store 222 , then provides an index to the demographic profiles in the data store 222 in response to queries from the profile selection module 206 .
- the profile selection module 206 is also coupled to the user identification module 204 to receive one or more properties for the user for which the stream is being generated.
- the profile selection module 206 uses the property value(s) provided for the user from the user identification module 204 to retrieve the corresponding or matching demographic profile from the profile generation module 202 .
- the user identification module 204 also sends a signal to the profile selection module 206 indicating whether the user is a new user. If the user is not a new user, the profile selection module 206 does not provide a profile to the collaborative filtering engine 208 , but rather signals the collaborative filtering engine 208 to use an existing profile of the user.
- the profile selection module 206 provides the corresponding or matching demographic profile from the profile generation module 202 to the collaborative filtering engine 208 .
- the profile selection module 206 is coupled to the collaborative filtering engine 208 to provide the selected demographic profile.
- the collaborative filtering engine 208 may be steps, processes, functionalities or a device including routines for generating a model of user interest based on user input, prior user interactions, or the demographic profile.
- the collaborative filtering engine 208 is coupled to the profile selection module 206 to receive a demographic profile that it uses to generate the model.
- the collaborative filtering engine 208 makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user based upon the demographic profile which is a collection of preference information from many users (collaborating).
- the collaborative filtering engine 208 learns a set of topics for a given demographic by observing the topics in the regular posts that appear in the stream for healthy users in that demography and uses that information to fetch a set of posts to show to new users in that demography.
- the collaborative filtering is based upon appearance.
- this collaborative filtering uses the posts to which the users have subscribed.
- the use of the posts to which the users have subscribed is advantageous because healthy users know what they are doing with the stream of content and hence the appearance of a post in the stream is a good indication of what they are interested in.
- the posts being considered may be limited to posts that a healthy users has interacted with recently, e.g. within the past 30 days, and/or that have been posted recently, e.g. within the past 30 days. This has the advantage that the volume of data handled by the collaborative filtering engine for a specific demography can be limited, thus facilitating processing and updating demographic profiles.
- the collaborative filtering engine 208 is coupled to and transmits a model to the scoring engine 212 periodically or upon request.
- the category mapping module 210 may be steps, processes, functionalities or a device including routines for creating categories of content items and determining the mapping of the content items to categories.
- the category mapping module 210 advantageously provides categories that can be used as input to also determine what content items to provide or how to score the content items.
- the category mapping module 210 provides input as to which vertical categories are important. To determine which content items are interesting, the category mapping module 210 defines or creates broad categories and determines what content items belong to which categories.
- Example categories may include sports, music, film, televisions, government, administration, politics, travel, cooking etc.
- web reference entities (“webref” or “webrefs”) are used to generate the categories.
- the category mapping module 210 defines or creates broad categories and determines what webref entities belong to which categories. Some implementations of the disclosure use these webref entities to increase accuracy and minimize ambiguity of information used in online content selection.
- Web reference entities assist in the understanding of text and augment a repository of knowledge. An entity may be a single person, place or thing, and the repository can include millions of entities that each have a unique identifier to distinguish among multiple entities with similar names (e.g., a Jaguar car versus a jaguar animal).
- the category mapping module 210 can access a reference entity and scan arbitrary pieces of text (e.g., text in web pages, text of keywords, text of content, text of advertisements) to identify entities from various sources.
- One such source may be a list of collections that each webref is a part of. Collections are somewhat broad (like Cricket Bowlers, Actors, etc.), and hence can be associated with one of the categories mentioned above. In case one webref entity belongs to two collections (for instance some athletes have appeared in movies); the category mapping module 210 takes the collection with the highest collection score (representing how tightly the webref is associated with the collection). The category mapping module 210 specifies the mapping from collections to categories. Once, category mapping module 210 has identified the category in an initial check; the category mapping module 210 can continue to evaluate a predicate specified in the config file to confirm that the webref indeed is a member of the category. This advantageously avoids some errors that are present in the collections.

- the scoring engine 212 requests the demographic profile responsive to receiving a request for a stream of content for a user.
- the scoring engine 212 receives the demographic profile from the collaborative filtering engine 208 .
- the scoring engine 212 requests and receives candidate content items from the content acquisition pipeline 200 .
- the social graph 179 or other information from the social network may be used to filter, rank or provide lift to the candidate content items, and the scoring engine 212 can request and receive candidate content items from people that the user is connected to in the social graph 179 .

- the scoring engine 212 generates a stream of content for a user based on the scored candidate content items and transmits the stream of content for a user to the user device 115 .
- the user device 115 includes a user interface engine 302 that receives the stream of content for a user from the scoring engine 212 and displays it in a user interface.
- the user interface engine 302 generates a widget for display on third-party websites that allows a user to share content. Additionally, the user interface engine 302 provides the user with a user interface for changing the settings and modifying user interests.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example method 400 for generating a demographic profile in accordance with the present disclosure.
- the method 400 begins by presenting a user interface, for example by launching a social network application 109 or other application that presents and recommends content to the user.
- the user interface may be presented on the computing device 115 .
- method 400 receives 402 input from the user requesting a stream of content.
- the stream of content is automatically generated and provided once the user opens the social network application 109 .
- the method 400 determines 404 whether user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information. If not, the method 400 returns without creating any demographic profiles. However, if the user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information, the method 400 continues to block 406 .
- the method 400 determines the type of the user, for example using the user identification module 204 .
- the types for users may include one or more of a consumer, an engager, a healthy user, or a new user.
- the content recommendation unit 103 classifies users as a consumer, an engager, a healthy user, and/or a new user and applies different optimizations to the different segments. For example, consumers are users who do not engage on content items but rather consume content items silently. In some implementations, their stream is weighted with increased importance for clicks: URL clicks, media plays, expand posts, and photo clicks.
- An engager for example, is a user that tends to engage on content items, and in some implementations, their stream is weighted with increased importance for endorsements, reshares, and comments.
- the content recommendation unit 103 processes the engagement rate of the user. For example, a user with an engagement rate>0.001 engagements per read is considered an engager while those with a rate lower than this threshold are considered consumers.
- the content recommendation unit 103 also determines whether the user is a healthy user or a new user.
- a healthy user is a user that has interacted with more than a predefined number, h, of content items within a predetermined time period; and a new user is a user that interacted with fewer than a threshold number of content items in a predetermined period.
- the method 400 determines whether the type of the user is a healthy or engaged user. If not, the method 400 returns without creating any demographic profiles. However, if the user is a healthy or engaged user, the method 400 selects 408 a demographic property and a value for that property. For example, location may be used as the demographic property and the value may be Canada. Then the method 400 retrieves 410 interaction information and other metadata for content items of healthy/engaged user(s) with the selected demographic property and which have expressed consent in step 404 . For example, this information is retrieved from the content acquisition pipeline 200 or the data store 222 by the profile generation module 202 . In some implementations, the method 400 only retrieves 410 interaction information and other metadata only for content healthy users.
- the content acquisition pipeline 200 retrieves content items from multiple sources in parallel.
- the multiple sources may include five different sources: 1) self-posts that the viewer of the stream has just made that have not been indexed yet; 2) endorsements—these are posts that point out that a user that the viewer is following has performed an activity; 3) recommendation posts that are served to the user based on a user interest model aggregated from multiple sources; 4) currently trending posts; 5) inferred graph posts which are posts from users in viewer's inferred graph; and 6) regular posts from users, communities and collections that the viewer is following.
- the content acquisition pipeline 200 provides the activity ids that are seen by a user which can be used to identify webref entities corresponding to the posts seen by the user. This information when aggregated across a demography is used to identify the popular webref entities.
- the method 400 creates a demographic profile using the retrieved interaction information of block 410 .
- the method 400 identifies a set of topics of the regular posts that appear in the stream for healthy users that have a matching demographic property and matching value to the property and value selected in block 408 . These topics with weights are included in the demographic profile.
- the demographic profile may also include one or more categories and an indication of their importance. The categories may be provided based on the selected demographic property from the category mapping module 210 .
- the method 400 provides, in step 414 , the demographic profile for use in generating a stream of content for the user. It should be understood that process of FIG. 4 may be performed repeatedly for different properties and different values of the properties, and for different users.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B show another example method 500 for generating a demographic profile.
- FIGS. 5A and 5B are provided to illustrate that the demographic profiles may be: 1) based on a plurality of demographic properties with different values, 2) updated periodically; 3) based on webrefs and categories.
- the method 500 begins by receiving 502 input from the user requesting a stream of content and determining 504 whether user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information. If the user has not consented to use of her demographic and interaction information, the method 500 returns without creating any demographic profiles. On the other hand, if the user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information, the method 500 proceeds to block 506 and determines the type of the user.
- the method 500 determines whether the type of the user is a healthy or engaged user. If not, the method 500 returns without creating any demographic profiles. However, if the user is a healthy or engaged user, the method 500 continues in block 508 .

- the location is a first property used in generating the demographic profile. While the location is and has been described as being a country, it should be understood that is could be a state, province, city, or any other geographic region. As an example, the country could be Canada.
- the method 500 continues by selecting 510 one or more additional demographic properties and associated values. For example, the additional demographic properties of gender and age may be selected with respective values of male and 18-25 years old. Then the method 500 retrieves 512 interaction information and other metadata for content items of healthy/engaged user(s) based on the location and the selected demographic properties, and which have expressed consent in step 504 .
- block 512 retrieves interaction information and other metadata for content items of the healthy user typed in block 506 . In some implementations, block 512 retrieves interaction information and other metadata for content items of the healthy user(s) that have matching location and demographic properties as the user typed in block 506 . The interaction information and other metadata for content items is also limited to those interactions that occurred within a first time period. Continuing the above example, in block 512 this would result in retrieval of interaction information and other metadata for content items of healthy users accessed from Canada by males 18-25 years old for a predetermined time period of one week. This provides the base data set from which the demographic profile may be created.
- the method 500 continues by aggregating 514 and scoring web references corresponding to the content items for analysis.

- the aggregated webrefs entities are output into a table for later analysis. Then the method 500 also maps 516 the web references to categories. This can be performed by the category mapping module 210 as described above.
- the aggregated webrefs entities are not directly used because they contain a lot of very generic webref entities that are too generic to be differentiating.
- every video service video embedded post will contain the webrefs of the name of the video service and “Video.” Thus, these webrefs will occur in every demographic and add very little value to understanding of the interests of users in that demographic.
- the method 500 weights 518 the categories for addition to the profile. Based on other information about the demographic properties, the some categories may be of weighted as more important because they are of more interest to the user than others. The categories are weighted based on their importance to the demographic properties.

The categories are weighted based on their importance to the demographic properties.
- the method 500 continues by adding 520 lift to categories having a score satisfying a threshold. For example, the method 500 may review the topics, and then re-score or rank the topics using the knowledge graph and interactions by the demography matching the selected demographic properties. Then lift is computed for categories based the rescoring for the demography. The categories that have scores above a threshold are then included in the demographic profile. The addition of this lift may cause some categories to be included and others to be removed from the demographic profile.
- the method 500 creates a demographic profile using the web reference scores, weighted categories and lift.
- the method 500 determines 524 whether there are additional interactions from a second time period. If not, the method 500 continues at block 532 . If there are additional interactions from a second time period, the method 500 proceeds to block 526 .
- This process illustrates that the demographic profile may be recomputed every hour, day, week, month or year as needed or desired.
- the method 500 retrieves interaction information for a healthy/engaged user based on the selected location and the selected demographic properties for a second period of time. Then method 500 recalculates 528 the categories, weighting and lift similar as was described above with reference to blocks 514 , 516 , 518 and 520 . Then the method 500 updates 530 the demographic profile using recalculated information.
- method 500 determines 532 whether there are other locations for which to compute a demographic profile. It should be understood that process of FIGS. 5A and 5B may be performed repeatedly for different properties and different values of the properties, and for different users. As an example, multiple demographic profiles for location as the property may be created. For example, there may be one demographic profile for each location value where the location values are different countries such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, Germany, France, etc. If so the method 500 returns to block 508 of FIG. 5A and repeats steps 510 - 530 to create a profile for another location. If there are not additional locations, the method 500 provides 534 the demographic profile for use in generating a stream of content for the user
- FIG. 6 shows an example method 600 for recommending content using a demographic profile. Then method 600 receives 602 input from the user requesting a stream of content. Then the method 600 determines 604 whether user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information. If not, the method 600 returns and does not use the demographic profile to create the stream of content and uses other means. However, if the user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information, the method 600 continues to block 606 . In block 606 , the method 600 determines whether user is a new user. As noted above, a new user is a user that has had limited interaction with social network 109 . For example, the method 600 may determining whether the user has interacted with fewer than a threshold number of content items in a predetermined period.
- the method 600 determines 608 one or more demographic properties of the user. As an example, the location of the user may be determined by identifying the IP address from which the user is accessing the social network server 101 and then translating the IP address into a location. Next the method 600 determines 610 a demographic profile corresponding to the demographic property determined in block 608 . Then the method 600 generates 612 a steam of content for the user with the determined demographic profile. Finally, the stream of content is provided 614 to the user. Specifically, the determined demographic profile is used to fetch a set of content items to show new users.

Abstract
A system and method for generating a stream of content for a new user is described. The method includes determining one or more demographic profiles, each demographic profile being based on content provided by a content database over the computer network to a predetermined set of users that have a common demographic property, the content interacted with by the predetermined set of users, each demographic profile being associated with the common demographic property; determining a first demographic property for a new user; selecting from the one or more demographic profiles, a demographic profile based on the first demographic property of the new user; based on the selected demographic profile, creating a query to the content database; submitting the query over the computer network to the content database; and retrieving content from the content database based on the query, and providing the content to the user.
Description
- The present application claims priority, under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e), to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/497,946, filed Dec. 8, 2016, entitled “Demographic Based Collaborative Filtering for New Users,” which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
- In recent years, there has been widespread proliferation of different applications for sharing content and messaging. For example, there are now social networking applications, news service applications, video sharing applications, and various other applications where content is provided or recommended to the user. Furthermore, additional functionality is constantly being added to these applications to increase user interaction with these applications. Many of these applications are also accessible via a user's mobile phone.
- However, one problem for these applications is that for many users, especially new users, the added complexity of such additional functionality makes it difficult for users to interact with the applications and get the content in which they are most interested.
- There have been attempts to solve this problem by allowing the user to subscribe to sources or make recommendations based on the user's interests. For example, interest profiles have been generated by observing the topics on which the user is engaging. However, for new users, they have not subscribed to any sources and their interest profile is empty because they have not interacted with the application. This makes it difficult to provide any meaningful recommendations of content.
- The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.
- This specification relates to systems and methods for generating a demographic profile and using it to recommend content. According to one aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure, a system includes a processor, and a memory storing instructions that, when executed, cause the system to perform operations comprising: determining one or more demographic profiles, each demographic profile being based on content provided by a content database over the computer network to a predetermined set of users that have a common demographic property, the content interacted with by the predetermined set of users, each demographic profile being associated with the common demographic property, determining a first demographic property for a new user, selecting from the one or more demographic profiles, a demographic profile based on the first demographic property of the new user, based on the selected demographic profile, creating a query to the content database, submitting the query over the computer network to the content database, and retrieving content from the content database based on the query, and providing the content to the user.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure includes a method that includes determining one or more demographic profiles, each demographic profile being based on content provided by a content database over the computer network to a predetermined set of users that have a common demographic property, the content interacted with by the predetermined set of users, each demographic profile being associated with the common demographic property, determining a first demographic property for a new user, selecting from the one or more demographic profiles, a demographic profile based on the first demographic property of the new user, based on the selected demographic profile, creating a query to the content database, submitting the query over the computer network to the content database, and retrieving content from the content database based on the query, and providing the content to the user.
- Other implementations of one or more of these aspects include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other implementations may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instance, each of the one or more demographic profiles is determined based on content interacted with by the predetermined set of users that have the common demographic property within a first predetermined period of time, and the method further comprises: updating the one or more demographic profiles based on content interacted with by the predetermined set of users that have the common demographic property within a second predetermined period of time. For example, the predetermined set of users may include a predetermined number of users that have performed one or more from the group of subscribing to a predetermined number of content sources, and reading a number of content items that satisfies a threshold. For instance, features may include wherein the common demographic property includes information about one or more of location, age and gender, wherein each of the one or more demographic profiles includes one or more categories which are determined from the content items interacted with by the respective predetermined set of users, or wherein the one or more categories are weighted according to a score of each of the content items from which the respective categories are determined, and wherein the score is preferably based on one or more of a frequency of reads by the predetermined set of users, a frequency of reads by all users, a number of reshares of the content items of a social network platform, a number of endorsements of the content items, a number of self-posts of the content items; and a number of trending popular content items. In general, another aspect of the subject matter of this disclosure may be embodied in methods wherein the weighting of a category in a demographic profile is increased in importance if the content items have a first score for the predetermined set of users that is relatively high compared to a second score scores for all users.
- The specification is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar elements.

FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an example system for recommending content as a social network server. -
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an example content recommendation unit. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example method for generating a profile. -
FIGS. 5A and 5B are a flowchart illustrating another example method for generating a profile. -
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an example method for recommending content using a demographic profile. - One technical issue with existing applications that recommend content to a user is that providing inappropriate recommendations, cause resource inefficiency when distributing recommendations and/or content from content sources to users using a stream. The inefficiency arises either because a user is provided proactively with content that the user would have otherwise not requested, or because a user requests, based on recommendations received by the user, contents that appears to be of interest but which is in fact not of interest to the user. Hence the systems and methods disclosed herein address the technical issue to reduce said resource inefficiency, in part by increasing the prediction accuracy of selecting content and/or recommendations provided to a user via a stream. The systems and methods disclosed in this specification solve these technical issues by generating one or more demographic profiles, determining a demographic profile, and then using that determined demographic profile to retrieve content items for the user which has the effect of increasing the probability that the query retrieves content items that are used and engaged with by the user so that as few superfluous data as possible is transmitted from a content source to a user when distributing the content items. A demographic profile includes information that enables selection of content items from a content stream based on said information. For example, a demographic profile may specify one or more topics and/or categories of content items. A demographic profile corresponds to a demography which reflects certain demographic properties of users belonging to the demography, the demographic properties being for example a location, age, etc. as described elsewhere herein. A user has certain demographic properties according to which a demographic profile can be chosen. Such demographic profile reflects interests and topics in the specific demography to which the user belongs.
- Another technical issue is how to provide recommended content to new users that have not subscribed to any sources or topics and have an empty or near empty interest profile. The systems and methods disclosed in this specification solve this technical issue by identifying healthy or engaged users that are engaged with the system and have a predetermined level of interaction with the system. The system also identifies one or more demographic properties of the healthy or engaged users. With the consent of the healthy or engaged users, the system processes the content items in their stream and their interaction with the content items for healthy or engaged users with a given demographic property, and then uses the processing to build a demographic profile for the given demographic property. The demographic profile is used to recommend content to new users that have the same demographic property. The systems and methods disclosed in this specification are advantageous because they increase the engagement of new users with the system, provide recommended content that more closely matches the user interest, and leverage the interaction and knowledge of existing users that know what they are doing to help new users gain knowledge of the system. Another advantage provided by the systems and methods disclosed in this specification is that, in the context of distributing contents from content sources to users, a smaller, more targeted selection of recommendations and corresponding content items can be provided to each user, so that overall content distribution from news sources to users can be more resource efficient.

Thecommunication unit 220 can provide other connections to thenetwork 105 and to other entities of thesystem 100 using various standard communication protocols, including, for example, those discussed elsewhere herein. - The
data store 222 is an information source for storing and providing access to data. In some implementations, thedata store 222 may be coupled to thecomponents social network server 101 via thebus 214 to receive and provide access to data. In some implementations, thedata store 222 may store data received from theother entities system 100, and provide data access to these entities. Thedata store 222 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable media for storing the data. In some implementations, thedata store 222 may be incorporated with thememory 218 or may be distinct therefrom.

In other implementations, thecontent acquisition pipeline 200, theprofile generation module 202, theuser identification module 204, theprofile selection module 206, thecollaborative filtering engine 208, thecategory mapping module 210, and thescoring engine 212 are stored in thememory 218 of thesocial network server 101 and are accessible and executable by theprocessor 216 to provide their respective acts and/or functionality. In any of these implementations, thecontent acquisition pipeline 200, theprofile generation module 202, theuser identification module 204, theprofile selection module 206, thecollaborative filtering engine 208, thecategory mapping module 210, and thescoring engine 212 may be adapted for cooperation and communication with theprocessor 216 andother components social network server 101. - The
content acquisition pipeline 200 may be steps, processes, functionalities or a device including routines for receiving content items from different heterogeneous sources and processing the content items to adds metadata and tags. Thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 also provides the content items to thedata store 222 for storage, the scoring server 304 for determining stream content and theprofile generation module 202 for generating one or more demographic profiles. The content items and the user information associated with them as described herein are subject to the user consenting to data collection. Thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 is coupled to the heterogeneous data sources (e.g., thesearch server 135,entertainment server 137,news server 139 and electronic message server 141) to retrieve or receive content items from these sources. In some implementations, thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 annotates the content items with specific tags, for example for features, types of information, sources, uses, and user activities. Once the content items are annotated, theprocessing module 202 transmits the data to thedata store 222. Thedata store 222 indexes the features of each content item and stores them in at least one database. Thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 also transmits the content items to theprofile generation module 202 so that the content items and the metadata and tags can be used in generating one or more demographic profiles. Thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 also transmits the content items to the scoring server 304 for ranking the content items for a user as will be described below. - The
profile generation module 202 may be steps, processes, functionalities or a device including routines for generating one or more demographic profiles. Theprofile generation module 202 is coupled to thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 receive the content items and each content item's metadata and tags. Theprofile generation module 202 uses this information to generate different demographic profiles as described in more detail below with reference toFIGS. 4, 5A, and 5B . In some implementations, theprofile generation module 202 cooperates with the category mapping module 210 (described below) to generate the demographic profiles. In one example, the demographic profile is a table of web reference entities for each country. More specifically, theprofile generation module 202 extracts the most common web reference entities (“webrefs”) read by active users in a particular country. Demographic properties includes age, gender, location, occupation, education, employment, marital status, income, children, etc. Each demographic profile created by theprofile generation module 202 may be associated with one or more specific demographic properties and a value for that property. For example, the demographic property may be location and the value of the location property may be the United States. In another example, the demographic properties may be location and gender with respective values of Canada and female. It should be understood that any number of demographic profiles may be generated by theprofile generation module 202 with different permutations of different demographic properties and different values for those properties. In some implementations,profile generation module 202 generates profiles of healthy users. A healthy user is defined as a user that has interacted with more than a predefined number, h, of content items within a predetermined time period. For example, a healthy user may be users that read more than h (e.g., 100) posts in the last 30 days. The interaction and content items may include: a frequency of reads by the predetermined set of users; a frequency of reads by all users; a number of reshares of content items of a social network platform; a number of endorsements of the content items; a number of self-posts of the content items; a number of trending popular content items, stream for clicks, URL clicks, media plays, expand posts, photo clicks, read, comments/posts, reshares, endorsements, or any other way a user may interact with content items in a stream of content. The interaction information for a predetermined set of healthy users having the same property value for a given demographic property may then be aggregated and weighted to create a demographic profile for that given demographic property. In some implementations, theprofile generation module 202 only generates a demographic profile if there are a number of healthy users that satisfy a threshold. For example, in one implementation, a demographic profile for a given demographic property value is only generated if there are at least 100 healthy users, e.g., the threshold is 100 healthy users. Alternatively, the number of healthy user may be at least 50. Theprofile generation module 202 is also coupled to thecollaborative filtering engine 208, as depicted inFIG. 3 , to provide the one or more demographic profiles for use in generating the stream of content. - The
user identification module 204 may be steps, processes, functionalities or a device including routines for determining a type of the user and identifying one or more properties of the user. Theuser identification module 204 is coupled to thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 receive the content items and each content item's metadata and tags. For a selected user and with the user's consent, theuser identification module 204 can retrieve the interaction(s) of that user with the content items in thesocial network server 101. In some implementations, theuser identification module 204 can determine the type of the user as one or more of a consumer, an engager, a healthy user or a new user. In some implementations, theuser identification module 204 determines whether the selected user is a “new user” by determining whether the selected user satisfies (interacted with fewer than) a threshold number of content items in a predetermined period. For example, users that have read 5 or fewer posts in the last 30 days may be classified as new users. It should be understood that different definitions for a new user may be created and used by modifying the number of interactions or selecting only particular types of interactions with content, for example, only subscription to topic, only reads, only comments, or only selected types of interactions or sets of types of interactions. Theuser identification module 204 also identifies one or more properties of the user. For example, if location is the demographic property, with user consent, theuser identification module 204 may determine the Internet Protocol address (IP address) from which the user is accessing thesocial network server 101 and then translate the IP address into a location. The location may be a city, a state, a country, a region, etc. in different implementations. In some implementations, with user consent, theuser identification module 204 may identify one or more properties of the user by accessing a profile of the user, presenting a question or query to the user, or explicitly or implicitly determining the value of the property for the user based on the property itself or from a knowledge graph. Theuser identification module 204 is also coupled to theprofile selection module 206 to provide a signal indicating whether the user is a new user and one or more demographic properties of the user. - The
profile selection module 206 may be steps, processes, functionalities or a device including routines for selecting a demographic profile to use in generating the stream of content for the user. Theprofile selection module 206 is coupled to theprofile generation module 202 to retrieve and access the demographic profiles created by and stored in theprofile selection module 206. In some implementation, theprofile generation module 202 creates and stores the demographic profiles in thedata store 222, then provides an index to the demographic profiles in thedata store 222 in response to queries from theprofile selection module 206. Theprofile selection module 206 is also coupled to theuser identification module 204 to receive one or more properties for the user for which the stream is being generated. For example, if the property is location, and theuser identification module 204 determined the location for the user is Canada, that information (property value=Canada) is provided by theuser identification module 204 to theprofile selection module 206. Theprofile selection module 206 uses the property value(s) provided for the user from theuser identification module 204 to retrieve the corresponding or matching demographic profile from theprofile generation module 202. In some implementations, theuser identification module 204 also sends a signal to theprofile selection module 206 indicating whether the user is a new user. If the user is not a new user, theprofile selection module 206 does not provide a profile to thecollaborative filtering engine 208, but rather signals thecollaborative filtering engine 208 to use an existing profile of the user. On the other hand, if the user is a new user, then theprofile selection module 206 provides the corresponding or matching demographic profile from theprofile generation module 202 to thecollaborative filtering engine 208. Theprofile selection module 206 is coupled to thecollaborative filtering engine 208 to provide the selected demographic profile. - The
collaborative filtering engine 208 may be steps, processes, functionalities or a device including routines for generating a model of user interest based on user input, prior user interactions, or the demographic profile. Thecollaborative filtering engine 208 is coupled to theprofile selection module 206 to receive a demographic profile that it uses to generate the model. Thecollaborative filtering engine 208 makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user based upon the demographic profile which is a collection of preference information from many users (collaborating). In some implementations, thecollaborative filtering engine 208 learns a set of topics for a given demographic by observing the topics in the regular posts that appear in the stream for healthy users in that demography and uses that information to fetch a set of posts to show to new users in that demography. More specifically, the collaborative filtering is based upon appearance. For example, this collaborative filtering uses the posts to which the users have subscribed. The use of the posts to which the users have subscribed is advantageous because healthy users know what they are doing with the stream of content and hence the appearance of a post in the stream is a good indication of what they are interested in. The posts being considered may be limited to posts that a healthy users has interacted with recently, e.g. within the past 30 days, and/or that have been posted recently, e.g. within the past 30 days. This has the advantage that the volume of data handled by the collaborative filtering engine for a specific demography can be limited, thus facilitating processing and updating demographic profiles. Thecollaborative filtering engine 208 is coupled to and transmits a model to thescoring engine 212 periodically or upon request. - The
category mapping module 210 may be steps, processes, functionalities or a device including routines for creating categories of content items and determining the mapping of the content items to categories. Thecategory mapping module 210 advantageously provides categories that can be used as input to also determine what content items to provide or how to score the content items. Thecategory mapping module 210 provides input as to which vertical categories are important. To determine which content items are interesting, thecategory mapping module 210 defines or creates broad categories and determines what content items belong to which categories. Example categories may include sports, music, film, televisions, government, administration, politics, travel, cooking etc. In some implementations, web reference entities (“webref” or “webrefs”) are used to generate the categories. To determine which webref entities are interesting, thecategory mapping module 210 defines or creates broad categories and determines what webref entities belong to which categories. Some implementations of the disclosure use these webref entities to increase accuracy and minimize ambiguity of information used in online content selection. Web reference entities assist in the understanding of text and augment a repository of knowledge. An entity may be a single person, place or thing, and the repository can include millions of entities that each have a unique identifier to distinguish among multiple entities with similar names (e.g., a Jaguar car versus a jaguar animal). Thecategory mapping module 210 can access a reference entity and scan arbitrary pieces of text (e.g., text in web pages, text of keywords, text of content, text of advertisements) to identify entities from various sources. One such source, for example, may be a list of collections that each webref is a part of. Collections are somewhat broad (like Cricket Bowlers, Actors, etc.), and hence can be associated with one of the categories mentioned above. In case one webref entity belongs to two collections (for instance some athletes have appeared in movies); thecategory mapping module 210 takes the collection with the highest collection score (representing how tightly the webref is associated with the collection). Thecategory mapping module 210 specifies the mapping from collections to categories. Once,category mapping module 210 has identified the category in an initial check; thecategory mapping module 210 can continue to evaluate a predicate specified in the config file to confirm that the webref indeed is a member of the category. This advantageously avoids some errors that are present in the collections. It also prevents may-be-problematic webrefs from getting into the demographic profile. Thecategory mapping module 210 is coupled to thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 to receive metadata about content items and webref entity information. Thecategory mapping module 210 is coupled to theprofile generation module 202 to provide the categories so they can be used in creating demographic profiles. - The
scoring engine 212 may be steps, processes, functionalities or a device including routines for receiving the demographic profile from thecollaborative filtering engine 208 and comparing candidate content items from thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 to the demographic profile to score them. Thescoring engine 212 generates a stream of content for a user based on the scored candidate content items and transmits the stream of content for a user to the user device 115. Thescoring engine 212 is coupled to thecollaborative filtering engine 208 to receive the demographic profiles for new users. As noted above, the demographic profiles is matched to a demographic property of the user. Thescoring engine 212 is coupled to thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 to receive content items. In some implementations, thescoring engine 212 is coupled to thedata store 222 to receive content items. - Referring now to
FIG. 3 , another example implementation of thecontent recommendation unit 103 is shown.FIG. 3 shown the general data flow of through thecontent recommendation unit 103 to produce the stream of content.FIG. 3 illustrates how content items are provided to thecontent recommendation unit 103, in particular thecontent acquisition pipeline 200, from different heterogeneous sources of content items. Example heterogeneous sources may include thesocial network server 101, the third-party server 107, thesearch server 135, theentertainment server 137, thenews server 139, and theelectronic message server 141. The heterogeneous data sources (e.g., thesearch server 135,entertainment server 137,news server 139 and electronic messages server 141) may be crawled by thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 to retrieve content items and their associated metadata. In some implementations, the heterogeneous data sources transmit the content items and their associated metadata to thecontent acquisition pipeline 200. - The
content acquisition pipeline 200 annotates the content items with specific tags, for example features and a global score that was generated by thescoring engine 212 and processes the data about user activities. The activities described herein are subject to the user consenting to data collection. In some implementations, once the content items are annotated, thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 transmits the data to thedata store 222. Thedata store 222 indexes the features of each content item and stores them in at least one database. In some implementations, the content items are organized according to an identification format (SourceType#UniqueItemID, for example, “VIDEOSERVICE#video_id” and “NEWS#doc_id”), an item static feature column that holds an item's static features (for example, title, content, content classification, etc.), an item dynamic feature column that holds an item's dynamic features (for example, global_score, number of clicks, number of following, etc.), a source (src) static feature column where the source is a publisher of an item (for example, Newspaper A in news, video uploading in a video service, etc.), a src dynamic feature column holds the source's dynamic features, a content column holds activities that were used to create activities and a scoring_feature holds a message that is used for user scoring. - The
content acquisition pipeline 200 also transmits the content items to thescoring engine 212 for a global user ranking. The global scores may be transmitted from thescoring engine 212 to thedata store 222, which stores the global scores in association with the content items. The global scores are helpful for organizing the content items in thedata store 222. - Turning now to the
collaborative filtering engine 208, thecollaborative filtering engine 208 receives the demographic profile from theprofile selection module 206. Theprofile generation module 202 generates the demographic profile and provides to thecollaborative filtering engine 208 via theprofile selection module 202 as has been described above. The demographic profile can be provided to thecollaborative filtering engine 208 periodically or upon request. - In some implementations, the
scoring engine 212 requests the demographic profile responsive to receiving a request for a stream of content for a user. Thescoring engine 212 receives the demographic profile from thecollaborative filtering engine 208. Thescoring engine 212 requests and receives candidate content items from thecontent acquisition pipeline 200. In some implementations, thesocial graph 179 or other information from the social network may be used to filter, rank or provide lift to the candidate content items, and thescoring engine 212 can request and receive candidate content items from people that the user is connected to in thesocial graph 179. In some implementations, thescoring engine 212 requests and receives candidate content items from thedata storage 222. Thescoring engine 212 compares the candidate content items to the demographic profile and scores the candidate content items. In the case of candidate content items from thesocial server 101, thescoring engine 212 receives the candidate content items from thesocial server 101, compares the candidate content items to the categories in the demographic profile and rescores the candidate content items according to the demographic profile. Thescoring engine 212 generates a stream of content for a user based on the scored candidate content items and transmits the stream of content for a user to the user device 115. - The user device 115 includes a user interface engine 302 that receives the stream of content for a user from the
scoring engine 212 and displays it in a user interface. In some implementations, the user interface engine 302 generates a widget for display on third-party websites that allows a user to share content. Additionally, the user interface engine 302 provides the user with a user interface for changing the settings and modifying user interests. -
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating anexample method 400 for generating a demographic profile in accordance with the present disclosure. Themethod 400 begins by presenting a user interface, for example by launching asocial network application 109 or other application that presents and recommends content to the user. The user interface may be presented on the computing device 115. Thenmethod 400 receives 402 input from the user requesting a stream of content. In some implementations, the stream of content is automatically generated and provided once the user opens thesocial network application 109. Then themethod 400 determines 404 whether user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information. If not, themethod 400 returns without creating any demographic profiles. However, if the user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information, themethod 400 continues to block 406. - In
block 406, themethod 400 determines the type of the user, for example using theuser identification module 204. For example, the types for users may include one or more of a consumer, an engager, a healthy user, or a new user. Thecontent recommendation unit 103 classifies users as a consumer, an engager, a healthy user, and/or a new user and applies different optimizations to the different segments. For example, consumers are users who do not engage on content items but rather consume content items silently. In some implementations, their stream is weighted with increased importance for clicks: URL clicks, media plays, expand posts, and photo clicks. An engager, for example, is a user that tends to engage on content items, and in some implementations, their stream is weighted with increased importance for endorsements, reshares, and comments. To classify these users, thecontent recommendation unit 103 processes the engagement rate of the user. For example, a user with an engagement rate>0.001 engagements per read is considered an engager while those with a rate lower than this threshold are considered consumers. Inblock 406, thecontent recommendation unit 103 also determines whether the user is a healthy user or a new user. In some implementations, a healthy user is a user that has interacted with more than a predefined number, h, of content items within a predetermined time period; and a new user is a user that interacted with fewer than a threshold number of content items in a predetermined period. - At
block 407, themethod 400 determines whether the type of the user is a healthy or engaged user. If not, themethod 400 returns without creating any demographic profiles. However, if the user is a healthy or engaged user, themethod 400 selects 408 a demographic property and a value for that property. For example, location may be used as the demographic property and the value may be Canada. Then themethod 400 retrieves 410 interaction information and other metadata for content items of healthy/engaged user(s) with the selected demographic property and which have expressed consent instep 404. For example, this information is retrieved from thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 or thedata store 222 by theprofile generation module 202. In some implementations, themethod 400 only retrieves 410 interaction information and other metadata only for content healthy users. In some implementations, thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 retrieves content items from multiple sources in parallel. For example, the multiple sources may include five different sources: 1) self-posts that the viewer of the stream has just made that have not been indexed yet; 2) endorsements—these are posts that point out that a user that the viewer is following has performed an activity; 3) recommendation posts that are served to the user based on a user interest model aggregated from multiple sources; 4) currently trending posts; 5) inferred graph posts which are posts from users in viewer's inferred graph; and 6) regular posts from users, communities and collections that the viewer is following. In one example, thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 provides the activity ids that are seen by a user which can be used to identify webref entities corresponding to the posts seen by the user. This information when aggregated across a demography is used to identify the popular webref entities. - At
block 412, themethod 400 creates a demographic profile using the retrieved interaction information ofblock 410. For example, themethod 400 identifies a set of topics of the regular posts that appear in the stream for healthy users that have a matching demographic property and matching value to the property and value selected inblock 408. These topics with weights are included in the demographic profile. The demographic profile may also include one or more categories and an indication of their importance. The categories may be provided based on the selected demographic property from thecategory mapping module 210. Once created, themethod 400 provides, in step 414, the demographic profile for use in generating a stream of content for the user. It should be understood that process ofFIG. 4 may be performed repeatedly for different properties and different values of the properties, and for different users. -
FIGS. 5A and 5B show anotherexample method 500 for generating a demographic profile.FIGS. 5A and 5B are provided to illustrate that the demographic profiles may be: 1) based on a plurality of demographic properties with different values, 2) updated periodically; 3) based on webrefs and categories. Themethod 500 begins by receiving 502 input from the user requesting a stream of content and determining 504 whether user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information. If the user has not consented to use of her demographic and interaction information, themethod 500 returns without creating any demographic profiles. On the other hand, if the user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information, themethod 500 proceeds to block 506 and determines the type of the user. And atblock 507, themethod 500 determines whether the type of the user is a healthy or engaged user. If not, themethod 500 returns without creating any demographic profiles. However, if the user is a healthy or engaged user, themethod 500 continues inblock 508. Thesesteps steps FIG. 4 . - The
method 500 continues by selecting 508 a location and a value for the location. The location is a first property used in generating the demographic profile. While the location is and has been described as being a country, it should be understood that is could be a state, province, city, or any other geographic region. As an example, the country could be Canada. Themethod 500 continues by selecting 510 one or more additional demographic properties and associated values. For example, the additional demographic properties of gender and age may be selected with respective values of male and 18-25 years old. Then themethod 500 retrieves 512 interaction information and other metadata for content items of healthy/engaged user(s) based on the location and the selected demographic properties, and which have expressed consent instep 504. In some implementations, block 512 retrieves interaction information and other metadata for content items of the healthy user typed inblock 506. In some implementations, block 512 retrieves interaction information and other metadata for content items of the healthy user(s) that have matching location and demographic properties as the user typed inblock 506. The interaction information and other metadata for content items is also limited to those interactions that occurred within a first time period. Continuing the above example, inblock 512 this would result in retrieval of interaction information and other metadata for content items of healthy users accessed from Canada by males 18-25 years old for a predetermined time period of one week. This provides the base data set from which the demographic profile may be created. - The
method 500 continues by aggregating 514 and scoring web references corresponding to the content items for analysis. In some implementations, the score assigned for each webref entity for a demography=Σ log (per-user-count+1). The summation is done across a predetermined set of users of the demography. The individual contribution of a user is natural-log (times-user-has-seen-the-webref+). The aggregated webrefs entities are output into a table for later analysis. Then themethod 500 also maps 516 the web references to categories. This can be performed by thecategory mapping module 210 as described above. The aggregated webrefs entities are not directly used because they contain a lot of very generic webref entities that are too generic to be differentiating. For example, every video service video embedded post will contain the webrefs of the name of the video service and “Video.” Thus, these webrefs will occur in every demographic and add very little value to understanding of the interests of users in that demographic. Next, themethod 500weights 518 the categories for addition to the profile. Based on other information about the demographic properties, the some categories may be of weighted as more important because they are of more interest to the user than others. The categories are weighted based on their importance to the demographic properties. - Referring now also to
FIG. 5B , themethod 500weights 518 the categories for addition to the profile. Based on other information about the demographic properties, the some categories may be of weighted as more important because they are of more interest to the user than others. The categories are weighted based on their importance to the demographic properties. Next, themethod 500 continues by adding 520 lift to categories having a score satisfying a threshold. For example, themethod 500 may review the topics, and then re-score or rank the topics using the knowledge graph and interactions by the demography matching the selected demographic properties. Then lift is computed for categories based the rescoring for the demography. The categories that have scores above a threshold are then included in the demographic profile. The addition of this lift may cause some categories to be included and others to be removed from the demographic profile. Atblock 522, themethod 500 creates a demographic profile using the web reference scores, weighted categories and lift. - Next, the
method 500 determines 524 whether there are additional interactions from a second time period. If not, themethod 500 continues atblock 532. If there are additional interactions from a second time period, themethod 500 proceeds to block 526. This process illustrates that the demographic profile may be recomputed every hour, day, week, month or year as needed or desired. Atblock 526, themethod 500 retrieves interaction information for a healthy/engaged user based on the selected location and the selected demographic properties for a second period of time. Thenmethod 500 recalculates 528 the categories, weighting and lift similar as was described above with reference toblocks method 500updates 530 the demographic profile using recalculated information. Updating has the technical effect that the demographic profile is kept current over time, which means that the profile reflects the most recent content items of the various content sources, and that the profile can be kept at a manageable size. Thenmethod 500 determines 532 whether there are other locations for which to compute a demographic profile. It should be understood that process ofFIGS. 5A and 5B may be performed repeatedly for different properties and different values of the properties, and for different users. As an example, multiple demographic profiles for location as the property may be created. For example, there may be one demographic profile for each location value where the location values are different countries such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, Germany, France, etc. If so themethod 500 returns to block 508 ofFIG. 5A and repeats steps 510-530 to create a profile for another location. If there are not additional locations, themethod 500 provides 534 the demographic profile for use in generating a stream of content for the user -
FIG. 6 shows anexample method 600 for recommending content using a demographic profile. Thenmethod 600 receives 602 input from the user requesting a stream of content. Then themethod 600 determines 604 whether user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information. If not, themethod 600 returns and does not use the demographic profile to create the stream of content and uses other means. However, if the user has consented to use of her demographic and interaction information, themethod 600 continues to block 606. Inblock 606, themethod 600 determines whether user is a new user. As noted above, a new user is a user that has had limited interaction withsocial network 109. For example, themethod 600 may determining whether the user has interacted with fewer than a threshold number of content items in a predetermined period. If the user is not a new user, then themethod 600 returns and the user's existing profile can be used to generate the stream of content. However, if the user is a new user, then themethod 600 determines 608 one or more demographic properties of the user. As an example, the location of the user may be determined by identifying the IP address from which the user is accessing thesocial network server 101 and then translating the IP address into a location. Next themethod 600 determines 610 a demographic profile corresponding to the demographic property determined inblock 608. Then themethod 600 generates 612 a steam of content for the user with the determined demographic profile. Finally, the stream of content is provided 614 to the user. Specifically, the determined demographic profile is used to fetch a set of content items to show new users. In some implementations, thecollaborative filtering engine 208 looks up a corresponding demographic profile, queries thecontent acquisition pipeline 200 for content items then provide thescoring engine 212 to mix into the stream of content. In some implementations, the demographic profile is a list of topics and new indexing-serving of thecontent recommendation unit 103 retrieves posts for the given list of topics. Topics can be specified in various vocabulary including webrefs, high-dimensional embedding factors etc. Thecontent recommendation unit 103 may also include indexing, scoring, ranking, diversity and a whole host of topical retrieval issues. Thecontent recommendation unit 103 is particularly advantageous because the use of demographic profiles eliminates the cold start problem for new users that have no historical interest data or an undeveloped interest model. Thecontent recommendation unit 103 also breaks down the feedback loops that make it difficult to recommend interesting content in conventional systems. - In situations in which certain implementations discussed herein may collect or use personal information about users (e.g., user data, information about a user's social network, user's location, user's biometric information, user's activities and demographic information), users are provided with one or more opportunities to control whether the personal information is collected, whether the personal information is stored, whether the personal information is used, and how the information is collected about the user, stored and used. That is, the systems and methods discussed herein collect, store and/or use user personal information only upon receiving explicit authorization from the relevant users to do so. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed. As one example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined. As another example, a user's geographic location may be generalized to a larger region so that the user's particular location cannot be determined.
- Reference in the specification to “some implementations” or “an implementation” means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the implementation is included in at least some instances of the description.
