Definitions
- the invention generally relates to video processing, and more specifically to video fingerprinting.
- Electronic video libraries may contain thousands or millions of video files, making management of these libraries an extremely challenging task.
- the challenges become particularly significant in the case of online video sharing sites where many users can freely upload video content.
- users upload unauthorized copies of copyrighted video content, and as such, video hosting sites need a mechanism for identifying and removing these unauthorized copies.
- While some files may be identified by file name or other information provided by the user, this identification information may be incorrect or insufficient to correctly identify the video.
- An alternate approach of using humans to manually identifying video content is expensive and time consuming.
- video sharing sites may upload multiple copies of video content to the site. For example, popular items such as music videos may be uploaded many times by multiple users. This wastes storage space and becomes a significant expense to the host.
- a third problem is that due to the large number of files, it is very difficult to organize the video library based on video content. Thus, search results may have multiple copies of the same or very similar videos making the results difficult to navigate for a user.
- Various methods have been used to automatically detect similarities between video files based on their video content.
- various identification techniques such as an MD5 hash on the video file
- a digital “fingerprint” is generated by applying a hash-based fingerprint function to a bit sequence of the video file; this generates a fixed-length monolithic bit pattern—the fingerprint—that uniquely identifies the file based on the input bit sequence.
- fingerprints for files are compared in order to detect exact bit-for-bit matches between files.
- a fingerprint can be computed for only the first frame of video, or for a subset of video frames.
- each of these methods often fail to identify videos uploaded by different users with small variations that change the exact bit sequences of the video files.
- videos may be uploaded from different sources and may vary slightly in how they are compressed and decompressed.
- different videos may have different source resolutions, start and stop times, frame rates, and so on, any of which will change the exact bit sequence of the file, and thereby prevent them from being identified as a copy of an existing file.
- an improved technique is needed for finding similarities between videos and detecting duplicate content based on the perceived visual content of the video.
- a technique is needed for comparing videos that is unaffected by small differences in compression factors, source resolutions, start and stop times, frame rates, and so on.
- the technique should be able to compare and match videos automatically without relying on manual classification by humans.
- a method and system generates and compares fingerprints for videos in a video library using fingerprints that represent the discontinuity structure of the video, according to the locations of discontinuities in the video frame sequence, the audio stream, or both.
- a discontinuity is, for example, a shot boundary indicating a discontinuity in the stream of captured video (e.g., a cut, fade, or dissolve transition), or a silent point indicating a temporal location where the audio volume drops below a predetermined value or percentile.
- the methods for generating video fingerprints provide a compact representation of the structural characteristics of the video that can be used to quickly and efficiently identify video content.
- the methods also allow for comparing videos by using their fingerprints in order to find a particular video with matching content (such as, for example, to find and remove copyright protected videos or to find and remove duplicates).
- the methods enable organizing and/or indexing a video library based on their visual content by using video fingerprints. This can provide improved display of search results by grouping videos with matching content.
- a video fingerprint is generated by determining endpoint frames in the video frame sequence corresponding to discontinuities in the video and encoding the discontinuity information.
- the discontinuities can be shot boundaries, scene changes, periods of audio silence, or other visual or auditory discontinuities. Because the fingerprint is based on the structural discontinuity characteristics of the video rather than an exact bit sequence, video content can be effectively compared even when videos have variations in compression factors, source resolutions, start and stop times, frame rates, and so on.
- a set of fingerprints associated with different segments of a video provide a fingerprint sequence for the video.
- the set of video fingerprints for a received video can be compared against reference fingerprints for videos stored in a reference database. In this manner, matching videos can be efficiently located. This is useful for at least two reasons. First, when a video is uploaded to a file sharing site, it may be immediately checked against all videos in the library. If matches are found, the video can be properly indexed in order to eliminate presentation of duplicates in search results. Alternatively, it may be desirable to discard the uploaded video if any matches are found and only accept new entries to the library that are unique. Second, if a video is known to be copyright protected, its fingerprint can be used to efficiently search for visually identical videos in the library so that copyrighted material can be removed.
- a system for detecting duplicate video content includes an ingest server, a fingerprinting module, an indexing module, a matching module, and a reference database.
- the ingest server receives an input video from a video source and provides the video to the fingerprinting module, which generates a fingerprint sequence for the ingest video.
- Each fingerprint in the fingerprint sequence is indexed by the indexing module according to one or more hash processes which selectively reduce the dimensionality of the fingerprint data.
- a matching module compares fingerprints and/or fingerprint sequences in the reference database to the fingerprint sequence associated with the ingest video and determines if a match is found.
- the matching module may be used both to locate particular video content from a query and to organize video search results based on their content.
- a system for generating a video fingerprint sequence includes a normalization module, an endpoint detection module, an encoding module, and a segmenting module.
- the normalization module converts received videos to a standard format for fingerprinting.
- the endpoint detection module detects the locations of discontinuities in the sequence of video frames and/or the audio stream.
- an encoding module uses this information to generate a representation, such as a bit vector in which each bit (or set of bits) represents a frame and the values of the bits distinguish between frames that are associated with a discontinuity (“endpoint frames”) and frames that are not.
- the encoding module can also encode the data to distinguish between different types of discontinuities.
- the segmenting module segments the encoded data into a number of smaller bit sequences that can overlap each other by some number of bits.
- Each separate bit sequence is a fingerprint representing the structural characteristics of a corresponding segment of video.
- a fingerprint sequence for the video is formed from the ordered set of fingerprints corresponding to the ordered video segments.

- FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating a process for matching video fingerprints.
- FIG. 1 is a high-level block diagram illustrating a system for comparing video content.
- the system comprises an ingest server 104 , a fingerprinting module 106 , an indexing module 108 , a matching module 110 , a reference database 112 , and a video library 116 .
- a fingerprinting module 106 a fingerprinting module 106 , an indexing module 108 , a matching module 110 , a reference database 112 , and a video library 116 .
- different or additional modules may be used.
- the ingest server 104 is adapted to receive one or more videos from a video source 102 .
- the video source 102 can be, for example, a client computer coupled to the ingest server 104 through a network. In this configuration, a user can upload video content to the ingest server 104 from a remote location.
- the video source 102 can be a database or other storage device coupled to the ingest server 104 .
- the video source 102 can be a video storage medium such as a DVD, CD-ROM, Digital Video Recorder (DVR), hard drive, Flash memory, or other memory.
- the ingest server 104 may also be coupled directly to a video capture system such as a video camera.
- the ingest server 104 stores the received videos to the video library 116 .
- the ingest server 104 can also pass received videos directly to the fingerprinting module 106 for fingerprinting immediately upon receipt.
- the ingest server 104 pre-processes the received video to convert it to a standard format for storage in the video library 116 .
- the ingest server 104 can convert the frame rate, frame size, and color depth of a received video to predetermined formats.
- storage format can be Adobe FLASH®, with a frame size of 320 ⁇ 240 at 15 fps, and 8 bit color.
- the fingerprinting module 106 receives a video from the ingest server 104 or from the video library 116 and generates a sequence of fingerprints associated with the video.
- Each fingerprint compactly represents the discontinuity structure of the video by determining locations of discontinuities within the video; the discontinuities can be, for example, shot boundaries within the sequence of video frames and/or silent points in the audio stream.
- This structural discontinuity information is encoded to a bit vector that is divided into multiple overlapping bit sequences. Each bit sequence is a fingerprint corresponding to a particular set of frames that make up a segment of video.
- the fingerprint uniquely identifies a video segment based on its structure such that minor variations due to compression, de-compression, noise, frame rate, start and stop time, source resolutions and so on do not significantly affect the fingerprint corresponding to each video segment.
- the complete ordered set of video fingerprints for the segments of a video provides a fingerprint sequence for the video.
- the indexing module 108 receives the video fingerprint sequences for each video from fingerprinting module 106 and indexes the fingerprint sequences into the reference database 112 .
- the indexing process can use a variety of different hash techniques to generate a signature for a fingerprint that uniquely identifies the fingerprint while fixing the size of the fingerprint data.
- the signature is broken into signature blocks and indexed in hash tables. Indexing beneficially reduces the number of bit comparisons needed to compare two fingerprints. Thus, searches for matching fingerprints can be accelerated relative to direct bit-for-bit comparisons of fingerprints.
- the matching module 110 compares videos or video segments and generates a matching score indicating the likelihood of a match.
- the matching module 110 compares the fingerprint sequence of an ingest video to reference fingerprint sequences stored in the reference database 112 .
- the matching module 110 compares fingerprint sequences in the reference database 112 corresponding to two or more videos stored in video library 116 .
- the matching module 110 may further receive a search query from a user requesting particular content and output a video 118 from the video library 116 that matches the query 114 .
- the video library 116 is a storage device for storing a library of videos.
- the video library 116 may be any device capable of storing data, such as, for example, a file server, a hard drive, a writeable compact disk (CD) or DVD, or a solid-state memory device.
- Videos in the video library 116 are generally received from the ingest server 104 and can be outputted to the fingerprinting module 106 for fingerprinting. Videos are also outputted 118 by the matching module 110 that are relevant to a search query 114 .
- the reference database 112 stores the indexed fingerprints for each video in the video library 116 . Each entry in the reference database 112 corresponds to signature blocks generated in the indexing process. Each entry is mapped to unique identifiers of the video segments corresponding to each signature block.
- the reference database 112 can be searched by the matching module 110 to quickly compare fingerprints and/or fingerprint sequences.
- a first scenario enables the system to query-by-video to find identical or similar videos to a selected video.
- a system operator provides an input query 114 to the matching module 110 .
- the input query 114 is in the form of a video having particular content of interest such as, for example, video content that is copyright protected.
- a fingerprint sequence is generated for the copyright protected video and the reference database 112 is searched for matching fingerprints. Unauthorized copies can then be removed from the video library 116 (or otherwise processed) if the matching module 110 detects a match.
- new uploads can be automatically screened for unauthorized copies of known copyrighted works.
- a newly uploaded video is fingerprinted and the fingerprint sequence is compared against fingerprint sequences for the known copyrighted videos. Then, matching uploads are blocked from storage in the video library 116 .
- the video can be processed in pieces as it is received so that so that the full video need not be received before processing begins.
- the system is used to detect and remove multiple copies of video content from the video library 116 .
- Duplicate or near duplicate videos may be found within the video library 116 , or new videos uploaded by the ingest server 104 may be automatically compared against videos in the video library 116 .
- Duplicate videos found in the video library 116 are removed in order to save storage space.
- the new video is simply discarded.
- the system can be used to provide organized search results of videos.
- a user provides an input query 114 and the matching module 110 returns relevant video results.
- the input query 114 can be in the form a conventional text-based search query or can be in the form of a video file as described previously.
- video results are compared to one another by the matching module 110 and matching videos are grouped together in the search results.
- the fingerprinting module 106 is adapted to receive an input video that has been pre-processed by the ingest server 104 , and generate one or more fingerprints representing structural discontinuity characteristics associated with the video.
- the fingerprinting module 106 comprises a normalization module 210 , an endpoint detection module 220 , an encoding module 230 , and a segmenting module 240 .
- the fingerprinting module 106 can have additional or different modules than those illustrated.
- FIG. 3 An example structure for a video received by the fingerprinting module 106 is provided in FIG. 3 .
- the video comprises a series of frames 300 .
- Each frame 300 comprises an image having a plurality of pixels arranged in a two-dimensional grid (for example, in an X direction and a Y direction).
- the frames 300 are also arranged sequentially in time (the t direction).
- a video comprises both spatial information, defined by the arrangement of pixels in the X and Y directions, and sequential or temporal information defined by how the pixels change throughout the time (t) dimension.
- the normalization module 210 generally standardizes the data to be processed during fingerprinting.
- the normalization module 210 includes a frame rate converter 212 , a frame size converter 214 and color converter 216 to normalize video to a predetermined format for fingerprinting. Converting video to a standardized fingerprint format ensures that videos are consistent and can produce comparable results. Often, frame rate, frame size, and color information are reduced by the normalization module 210 in order to improve the speed and power efficiency of the fingerprinting process. For example, the normalization module 210 can convert the video to luminance (grayscale) values without color, reduce the frame rate to 15 fps, and reduce the frame size to 64 ⁇ 64.
- Each of the standard formats used by the normalization module 210 may be predetermined or may be determined dynamically based on various constraints such as, for example, available power, available bandwidth, or characteristics of the received video.
- the endpoint detection module 220 operates on the normalized video obtained from the normalization module 210 .
- An endpoint is a frame corresponding to the temporal location of a discontinuity.
- the endpoint detection module 220 comprises an audio discontinuity detection module 234 and a video discontinuity detection module 236 .
- the audio discontinuity detection module 234 and the video discontinuity detection module 236 can process the normalized video in either order or can process in parallel.
- the video discontinuity detection module 236 analyzes the sequential characteristics of the video frame sequence to determine temporal locations of discontinuities in the frame sequence.
- a video discontinuity can be, for example, a boundary in between shots of video.
- a “shot” refers to an uninterrupted sequence of video frames from one camera.
- a “shot boundary” then is a frame at the point of transition between two different shots.
- a shot boundary can be, for example, an abrupt change such as when a video scene switches from one camera angle to another (i.e. a cut), a fade in which the shot slowly fades to black and a new shot begins, a dissolve in which a first shot slowly transitions into a second shot, or any other type of transition.
- the video discontinuity detection module 236 performs a motion analysis to estimate the relative motion of pixels between frames. Frames corresponding to the temporal locations in the video where motion is highest are determined to be the shot boundaries.
- Various other techniques for detecting shot boundaries are well known in the art.
- the type of shot boundary can also be detected to distinguish between, for example, a cut, fade, dissolve, or other types of shot boundaries.
- the audio discontinuity detection module 234 analyzes audio characteristics of the audio track associated with the video to determine discontinuities in the audio stream.
- An audio discontinuity can be, for example, a silent point in the audio.
- a silent point as defined in one embodiment, is a temporal location in the audio stream at which the audio volume over some predefined number of frames (or number of seconds) is below a predetermined threshold volume or a below a predetermined percentile of the volume in surrounding frames. Silent points often coincide with shot boundaries, although this is not always the case. For example, a silent point could be defined at a location in the audio stream where the volume is less than 20 db for at least 3 seconds (or equivalent number of frames).
- discontinuity detection used by the endpoint detection module 220
- the described techniques can also be applied to other types of media files that do not necessarily have both a frame sequence and an audio track.
- an embodiment that uses only audio discontinuity detection could be applied to an pure audio file that is not necessarily associated with a video frame sequence.
- another embodiment that uses only video discontinuity detection could be applied to a frame sequence that does not necessarily have an associated audio track.
- the locations of discontinuities in a video and/or audio streams provide structural information that is generally unaffected by the presence of variations in compression factors, source resolutions, start and stop times, frame rates, and so on.
- the temporal locations of discontinuities are outputted by the endpoint detection module 220 and used to construct a video fingerprint sequence representing unique structural characteristics of a video.
- An encoding module 230 encodes the discontinuity information into a data representation of the structural discontinuity characteristics of a video.
- Various data representation schemes can be used.
- the encoding module 230 uses a bit vector, in which the bit sequence represents the corresponding frame sequence, and indicates for each frame whether or not any type of discontinuity exists (e.g., a bit value of 1 indicates a discontinuity at the frame (an endpoint frame), while value of 0 indicates the frame is not an endpoint).
- the representation provides a one-to-one mapping between a bit and a frame of video.
- multiple bits can be used per frame where different values represent different types of endpoint frames.
- the encoding module 230 quantizes the representation in time so that a single bit represents several frames of video.
- a bit value of 1 indicates that a discontinuity is present in the several frames of video and a bit value of 0 indicates no discontinuity is present in the several frames represented by the bit value.
- the encoding module 230 represents the discontinuity structure of the video by encoding a sequence of time offsets to the next endpoint frame. For example, an encoding of 500 200, 300 . . . indicates that there are 500 frames from the starting point to the first endpoint, 200 frames to the next endpoint, 300 frames to the next endpoint and so on.
- the segmenting module 240 segments the encoded data into a number of fingerprints. Each fingerprint is a subset of the encoded data corresponding to the discontinuity information for a segment of the video. Segmenting can be performed in a variety of ways. In a first embodiment, the segmenting module segments the encoded data representation into fingerprints that overlap by a fixed number of frames. If the offset between fingerprints is, for example, a single frame then a fingerprint is obtained corresponding to each possible starting position of the video. In alternative configurations, a different offset between fingerprints can be used.
- the number of frames represented by each fingerprint and the offset between fingerprints is varied rather than constant.
- segments are generated so that each segment begins at a particular type of endpoint frame (e.g., a shot boundary).
- the segmenting module 240 is combined with the encoding module 230 to quantize and segment the discontinuity data using a “moving window” approach.
- a first window of frames is quantized in time and a first fingerprint is obtained corresponding to the first window.
- the window then shifts by, for example, one frame, and the new window of frames (overlapping with the first window) is quantized to obtain a second fingerprint.
- Other variations of processes for obtaining fingerprints are also possible and will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.
- FIG. 4 a flowchart illustrates a process for generating a fingerprint sequence using the fingerprinting module 106 .
- the process in FIG. 4 can be viewed in conjunction with FIG. 5 which graphically illustrates the intermediate results of the fingerprint generation process. For the purpose of illustration, only a limited number of frames are shown in FIG. 5 .
- the fingerprinting module 106 receives an input video and the normalization module 210 normalizes 402 the video to obtain input frames 502 .
- the endpoint detection module 220 determines 404 locations of discontinuities.
- the frame has a first shot 504 comprising frames F 1 -F 4 and a second shot 506 comprising frames F 5 -F 9 . It is noted that only a few frames are shown per shot for the purpose of illustration only, and that an input video may typically contain many more frames per shot.
- the endpoint detection module 220 identifies frames F 1 , F 4 , and F 9 as endpoint frames.
- FIG. 5 illustrates only the detection of shot boundaries, the process can include detecting other video frame discontinuities, audio stream discontinuities, or both.
- an encoded data representation (e.g., a bit vector) is generated 406 indicating the locations of discontinuities in the video frame sequence.
- a bit vector 508 is used in which a “1” indicates a discontinuity and a “0” indicates no discontinuity.
- different types of encodings can be used as previously described.
- the encoded data (e.g., a bit vector 508 ) is segmented 408 into fingerprints.
- the bit vector 508 is segmented into fingerprints 510 having a length of 4 and an offset of one frame between fingerprints.
- additional fingerprints 510 can be similarly obtained from the segmenting step 408 .
- segments and/or fingerprints can be of different sizes (typically longer) than that illustrated.
- a fingerprint sequence 512 is generated 410 for a video from the ordered set of fingerprints 510 .
- the fingerprint sequence 512 can be compared to a reference fingerprint sequence by counting the number of differences between the bits in the respective sequences. This comparison provides a good indication of the similarity between the videos associated with the fingerprint sequences.
- the fingerprints are indexed by the indexing module 108 .
- An example process for indexing uses a min-hash process as illustrated in FIG. 6 .
- the min-hash process generates a “signature” for the video fingerprint by applying a set of P permutations to the bit values of the fingerprint.
- the signature contains fewer bits than the full fingerprint but retains most of the information in the associated fingerprint.
- the video fingerprint is in the form of a bit vector that represents the shot boundary sequence for an individual segment.
- the indexing module applies a number P permutations to the bits of the fingerprint.
- Each permutation defines a bit re-arrangement (e.g., bit swap) of the bits of the fingerprint; the permutation may be a random permutation or algorithmic.
- the permutations are preferably defined beforehand, but once defined the permutations are fixed and always applied in the same order.
- the indexing module 108 receives 602 a fingerprint for a video segment.
- a new bit vector is generated 606 by re-arranging the bits according to a first permutation P 1 .
- a scanning module scans 608 for the location of the first bit value of “1” in the re-arranged bit vector and records 610 this location to a location vector. This process of permutation and location recording repeats 614 for all P permutations.
- each received fingerprint will have the same set of P permutations applied in the same order.
- the output is a location vector having P values, with each value indicating a location of the first bit value of “1” in the underlying fingerprint after applying each permutation. This set of locations provides the signature for the fingerprint.
- each signature is divided into a number of signature blocks and each signature block is placed into a different hash table.
- unique identifiers of any video segment that generates that particular signature block are stored with the corresponding signature block
- Variations on the indexing process can be used depending on the encoding scheme. For example, in an embodiment in which the fingerprints are encoded as a sequence of time offsets to the next endpoint frame, the min-hash step can be bypassed and the sequence of offsets used directly in the locality sensitive hashing step. Alternatively, the offsets can be re-encoded into a bit vector to which min-hash is applied.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an example of indexed fingerprints using the min-hash and locality sensitive hashing techniques described above.
- VID 4 comprising 100 segments and VID 7 comprising 365 segments are shown.
- a first signature 702 a corresponds to a first fingerprint of the second video segment of VID 4 .
- the signature 702 a is represented by a sequence of P locations (e.g., 11, 32, 11, 18 . . . ).
- the signature is broken into signature blocks 706 of four locations each. According to various embodiments, different sized signature blocks are used.
- a second signature 702 b corresponds to the third video segment of VID 7 .
- the first signature block in each signature 702 is mapped to table 1, the second signature block is mapped to table 2, and so on.
- the matching module 110 can be used to efficiently compare and match fingerprints of video files. Using the hash techniques described above, videos can be compared simply by comparing the index values of their signature blocks for each segment, rather than performing a bit-for-bit comparison of the entire fingerprint sequence. An example matching process is illustrated in FIG. 8 .
- a signature sequence (corresponding to the ordered signatures of a fingerprint sequence) for an ingested video is received by the matching module 110 .
- Each signature block of a first signature in the signature sequence is hashed 804 into the corresponding hash tables. For every matching signature block found in the table, a separate count is incremented for each unique video identifier associated with the matching signature block.
- each reference fingerprint maintains a separate count indicating the number of signature blocks of the reference fingerprint that match signature blocks of the first fingerprint of the ingest video.
- the counts are used to determine 806 a matching score between the first fingerprint of the ingest video and each reference fingerprint of each video segment in the reference database 112 .
- the matching scores are compared against a threshold value to determine 808 all reference fingerprints having matching scores above the threshold. Reference fingerprints with matching scores above the threshold are designated as matching fingerprints. This process then repeats for each individual fingerprint of the fingerprint sequence of the ingest video.
- the matching module 110 determines the reference video with the longest consecutive sequence of fingerprints that match the fingerprint sequence of the ingest video. Because each fingerprint corresponds to a time segment of video, this method determines a reference video that matches the ingest video over the longest consecutive time period.
- a fixed length window of time (e.g., 15 seconds) is designated for the ingest video.
- the fixed length window of time corresponds to a block of fingerprints in the fingerprint sequence of the ingest video.
- time offsets are determined between each matching segment of the reference video and the corresponding segments of the ingest video.
- Each matching pair of segments casts a “vote” for a particular time offset. The votes are counted across all matching pairs and the reference window with the highest number of votes is designated as the best match.
- the systems and methods described above enable indexing a video library using video fingerprints and matching video content based on structural characteristics of the video. This is particularly useful, for example, in finding and removing duplicate video content and preventing sharing of copyright protected content. Moreover, the methods can be performed automatically and are therefore more efficient and cost effective than conventional techniques.

Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the invention may additionally be practiced in other embodiments. For example, although the invention has been described above as a fingerprinting and duplicate detection system and method for video files, the techniques can also be applied to other types of media files (e.g., audio files) in which discontinuities can be detected.
