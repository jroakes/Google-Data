Definitions
- This invention relates to methods of delivery of advertisements and measuring responses to those delivered advertisements and in particular relates to the targeting of advertisements delivered over networks such as the Internet.
- on-line advertising For example, on the Internet, often such on-line advertisements will appear on a web page, such as a banner on the top or the bottom of the page.
- a web page such as a banner on the top or the bottom of the page.
- the banner appears at the appropriate location and the user may then try to find out more information regarding the advertisement by selecting the advertisement (clicking through on that banner) through the use of the mouse or other pointing device.
- This will cause a HTTP message to be generated by the browser using the information encapsulated in association with the banner to send a request for an object with a given URL address to a different appropriate web site to access, for example, the advertiser's home page.
- Information about networks and subnetworks is routinely collected.
- information about individual users is also gathered when users select (click on) different advertisements.
- data is tracked on how often a given advertisement has been displayed, how often a given user has seen a given advertisement, and other information regarding the user and the frequency of the display of the advertisement.
- an advertising server process is provided as a node on the network.
- the various advertisements are stored on the network of the server and preferably on the server.
- the affiliated page's encoding includes an embedded reference to an object provided by the advertising server process. That causes the user's browser to contact the advertising server process to provide the advertising image or information that will appear on the accessed web page as displayed by the user's browser.
- the advertising server process determines an appropriate advertisement to select for the particular user.
- the advertising server process will use information such as the number of times the user has seen various advertisements, how often the advertisement has been seen by any user and the start and stop date for the various advertisements to select which advertisement to transmit to the user's web page for display.
- the advertising server process logs that fact and to have more information about the given user.
- a derive profile process is used for compiling information on TCP/IP networks for use by the advertising server process. By compiling the information on networks and user selections, the advertising server process is able to compile information that can be used for targeting advertising.
- FIG. 1 is diagram for explaining a first embodiment of the invention.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram explaining the processes performed in the preferred embodiments.
- FIGS. 3A , 3 B and 3 C are diagrams showing the basic structure of some of the databases kept by the advertising server.
- the basic architecture of the network 10 comprises at least one affiliate web site 12 , an advertisement (ad) server web site 19 and one or more individual advertiser's web sites 18 .
- affiliates are one or more entities that generally for a fee contract with the entity providing the advertisement server permit third party advertisements to be displayed on their web sites.
- an advertisement provided by the advertisement server 19 will be superimposed on the display of the affiliate's web page displayed by the user's browser. Examples of appropriate affiliates include locator services, service providers, and entities that have popular web sites such as museums, movie studios, etc.
- the basic operation of the system is as follows in the preferred embodiment.
- the user's browser When a user browsing on the Internet accesses an affiliate's web site 12 , the user's browser generates an HTTP message 20 to get the information for the desired web page.
- the affiliate's web site in response to the message 20 transmits one or more messages back 22 containing the information to be displayed by the user's browser.
- an advertising server process 19 will provide additional information comprising one or more objects such as banner advertisements to be displayed with the information provided from the affiliate web site.
- the computers supporting the browser, the affiliate web site and the advertising server process will be at entirely different nodes on the Internet.
- the advertisement object which may be an image such as an advertisement banner, an icon, or a video or an audio clip, the browser ends up being connected to the advertiser's server or web site 18 for that advertisement object.
- a user operates a web browser, such as Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer, on a computer or PDA or other Internet capable device 16 to generate through the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) 14 a request 20 to any one of preferably a plurality of affiliate web sites 12 .
- the affiliate web site sends one or more messages back 22 using the same protocol.
- Those messages 22 preferably contain all of the information available at the particular web site 12 for the requested page to be displayed by the user's browser 16 except for one or more advertising objects such as banner advertisements. These objects preferably do not reside on the affiliate's web server. Instead, the affiliate's web server sends back a link including an IP address for a node running an advertiser server process 19 as well as information about the page on which the advertisement will be displayed.
- the link by way of example may be a hypertext markup language (HTML) ⁇ img> tag, referring to, for example, an inline image such as a banner.
- the user's browser 16 transmits a message 23 using the received IP address to access such an object indicated by the HTML tag from the advertisement server 19 .
- Included in each message 23 typically to the advertising server 19 are: (i) the user's IP address, (ii) a cookie if the browser 16 is cookie enabled and stores cookie information, (iii) a substring key indicating the page in which the advertisement to be provided from the server is to be embedded, and (iv) MIME header information indicating the browser type and version, the operating system of the computer on which the browser is operating and the proxy server type.
- the advertising server process 19 determines which advertisement or other object to provide to user's browser and transmits the messages 24 containing the object such as a banner advertisement to the user's browser 16 using the HTTP protocol.
- the object such as a banner advertisement
- the HTTP protocol Preferably contained within the HTTP message is a unique identifier for the advertiser's web page appropriate for the advertisement. That advertisement object is then displayed on the image created by the web user's browser as a composite of the received affiliate's web page plus the object transmitted back by the advertising web server.
- the user's browser again transmits a message to the ad server.
- the ad server notes the address of the computer of the browser (or any other identifier such as a cookie or a digital signature) that generated the message 23 and transmits back the URL of the advertiser's web page so that the user's web browser 16 generates a message 26 to contact the advertiser's web site. 18 .
- the ad server process 19 also notes that a “click through” for an advertisement has occurred and updates the various databases in the manner described below. In the above scenario for the click through process, the ad server process must remember which advertisement was sent to the user's browser in order to know where to redirect the user's browser.
- the affiliate web sites are web pages of affiliates located somewhere on the Internet and the ad server is a particular node on the Internet, other setups are also possible.
- the affiliates may be ISP's or may be actual dedicated web servers and the users may be an entire network instead of an individual browsing on a single computer with a browser.
- FIG. 2 shows the ad server architecture.
- the ad server which may comprise one or more servers uses a database 54 that will be described below and performs reporting processes 59 , management processes 58 , derivation of profile processes 52 and advertisement processes 19 .
- the derive profile process 52 is how the advertisement server gathers information about individual users or TCP/IP networks for individual users. Advertisements, which may be advertisement banners are stored within the ad server process 19 as part of the advertising server process 19 and are periodically updated and refreshed.
- the advertisement server process 19 is used for responding to requests from advertisements provided by the user's as described above.
- the management process 58 is used for updating the various advertisements and overall control of the advertising server process 19 and also permits the advertisers to interface with the database to obtain up to the date reports on the placement of the advertisements.
- the report process 59 is used for generating online reports about the success rate of the advertisement and statistics on the users that are viewing and clicking through on various advertisements and also updating the counters in the database that store how often an advertisement has been displayed.
- the basic database structure is shown in FIG. 3 .
- a user identification, IP address, domain type, time zone, location of the user, standard industrial code for the user's network, the particular advertisements seen and the number of times each such advertisement is seen, the advertisements that were selected or “clicked on” and the pages on which the various users' advertisements were seen is collected.
- targeted Internet advertising is possible.
- FIG. 3B shows a database structure for the advertisements. Included in the information for an advertisement are an identifier for the advertisement, the start date for the advertisement being carried, the last date the advertisement is to be carried, the total number of people who have viewed the advertisements, the target or the minimum number of times the advertisement is to be viewed, acceptable viewers by their web site's SICS (Standard Industry Codes), clicked through and pages that the advertisements are seen on.
- SICS Standard Industry Codes
- This information includes the domain name and type (e.g., military, government, commerce, foreign countries), the IP address, the standard industrial code, the time zone and the address as shown in FIG. 3C . This information can be used in developing information about users. Through the use of these three databases and other appropriate databases that may be kept, the various processes of the advertising server process 19 are performed.
- the advertising server processes 19 first attempts to identify the user in FIG. 2 . This can be accomplished by at least one of two means. First, any incoming request for an image or a multimedia object is examined to determined the IP address of the requesting browser. The advertising server then notes whether a cookie was received in the MIME heading of the request. From these two pieces of information, a user identification is determined. If a cookie was detected, then the cookie contains the user's identification number that can be accessed in the database.
- the request is from a new user so a user identification must be assigned to the user and that user's new identification number will be transmitted back to the users browser along with a write cookie instruction that causes the browser to write a cookie containing that unique identification number on the user's local drive for future accesses to affiliate sites.
- the cookie instruction is transmitted back with the advertisement messages 24 .
- digital signatures or certificates or log ins uniquely identifying the user accessing the affiliate page may be used.
- the advertising server process looks up the user's IP address in a table that stores identification numbers that correspond to IP addresses for the users who have previously contacted the advertising server process. If the IP address is not found in the table, then the user is a new user and is assigned an unused identification number. Also, for each new user, that user's identification number will be marked for further processing under the derive profile process 52 described below. Also, if the domain for the new user has not previously been processed in the domain profile process, it may not be possible to target the advertisement for the new user and rather the new user should be shown a generic advertisement. Also, for new users, a promotional advertisement may be shown to get the new user to provide information about him or herself and his or her employer.
- the ad server 19 obtains from a database all of the information known about the user including the user's geographic location, the domain type (commercial educational, governmental, the Internet service provided), the organization type where the user works (for example a SIC code), the company size, the number of employees in that company, the particular types of advertisements that the user has clicked on by SIC or other appropriate coding and the number of times that the user has been exposed to each advertisement currently in the system as described in FIG. 3A . Also, the relative time of day for the user is calculated based upon either the user's country code or the user's IP access provider or the location of their domain.
- Each advertisement along with a table of the targeting profile criteria for the advertisement and other data regarding the advertisement currently available is stored in a database such as shown in FIG. 3B .
- the actual advertising object which may be a banner image in a GIF or JPEG file format, an icon for an audio or video clip or some other object is kept as part of the advertising server process.
- This information may include targeted consumers by SIC, country, organization type and type of advertisements previously selected by the user.
- the next step is to determine which of the advertisements for which there is a match should be selected.
- the preferred embodiment also includes determining which advertising object should be selected if two or more advertising object have criteria matching the user. selecting from the matched advertisements by determining how often the particular user has been exposed to the given advertisement. For each user, data is kept about the number of times that a user has seen a given advertisement based upon the user ID. For each advertisement where the user matches the criteria, if the number of times that the user has seen the advertisement is less than a predetermined threshold, the advertisement is retained as one of the possible matches. If the number of times that the user has seen a given advertisement exceeds the threshold, the advertisement is discarded as a possible candidate for transmitting back to the user.
- any of number of algorithms may be used to select the particular advertisement to transmit back to the user.
- the formula used is based upon a satisfaction index (SI) according to the following formula:
- the satisfaction index (SI) is 1.0 when the advertisement is on schedule. If the advertisement is running behind schedule (i.e., the current rate of display means that the advertisement will not be viewed the targeted number of times by the end date so that the SI is less than 1.0) while if the SI is greater than 1.0, the advertisement is running ahead of schedule. Therefore, the advertisement that is to be selected for viewing is the one that has a matched profile and has the smallest SI. Upon selecting the advertisement, the selected advertisement object is then transmitted to the user's browser over the Internet by transmitting the GIF stored in RAM in one or more messages.
- the system stores the fact that the advertisement was sent to the user by storing that information in the database based upon the user ID. This information is used for processing the user's response to the advertisement when the user “clicks” on the advertisement.
- the advertising processor updates the advertisements satisfaction index and logs the advertisement delivery for providing reports. Also, if the advertisement that has been sent has a limit on the number of times that the advertisement can be sent, the count of the number of times that the advertisement has been transmitted is incremented. This limit can be the overall limit for the number of times that the advertisement is viewed and/or the limit that any specific user can view the advertisement. If the limit on the number of times the advertisement can be sent is reached, then the particular advertisement is removed from the list of those that can be transmitted. In addition, even if an advertisement has not been transmitted recently, the SI is updated to reflect the passage of time.
- the advertisement server 19 receives an HTTP request 23 for a click through which it will recognize by receiving the same IP address (and optionally, the user ID specified by the cookie, digital signature or certificate or log in identification) in the request from the same affiliate's web page within a predetermined period. Since the advertisement server previously recorded which advertisement was sent to that IP address, it sends the redirect message causing the user's browser to receive the URL for the advertiser's web site based upon data stored in the server. In addition, the server logs that the advertisement was clicked through, which user selected the advertisement based upon the IP address, and the page on which the advertisement was seen based upon the click through. This information can then be logged in later reporting processes 59 .
- the selection of the particular advertisement object to be sent back to the viewer's browser by the advertising server process 19 can be made by different criteria. For example, models can be created to maximize the likelihood of a click through. Such models for maximizing the likelihood of a click through may be based upon empirically gathered information about either types of advertisements or individual advertisements actually on the system correlated to the compiled information on a user or the user's network and the specific page through which the user is accessing the advertising server process 19 .
- the derive profiles process searches the user database for the address of additional users that have addresses for unknown networks, indicating that they are new users. Then the server does a reverse domain name search to locate the domain name of the user. The server also queries Internet Whols databases to find information about the network, which will often include the domain name.
- a reverse form of look up can be used independent of people accessing the network.
- the server will check common DNS names for the name, such as those starting with “www” and “ftp”. These resolve to IP addresses in most cases. From the IP addresses, the network number can be extracted and if the network does not yet have a domain name associated with the network number or address, the new domain associated with the network.
- a reverse domain name look up (A Whois lookup) will then usually provide the name, address and phone number of the organization, thereby providing the geographic location and the time zone of the network. Once the domain name is acquired, the server will determine whether the domain is an educational, military, governmental network and for non-U.S. based networks what country the network is located in through the extension.
- ISP Internet Service Provider
- the reporting process uses standard database techniques for generating any desired reports. For example, reports showing the number of viewings and click throughs of various advertisements may be generated along with reports showing the click through rates relative to the matching criteria. Also, reports on the SI can be readily generated.
- surveying may be used. Further, for those survey respondents who are responding for non-ISP users discussed above, the results of the survey can be attributed to others on the same network. This provides further information for targeting the display of the advertisements.
- a log in technique may be used whereby when users first access an affiliated web site, the user is assigned through a log in procedure a unique identifier and a log in name. When the user subsequently accesses either the same or a different affiliated web site, the user logs in using the unique identifier, thereby ensuring that users can be identified notwithstanding proxy servers or different users using the same computer.
- advertising server the affiliate web site and the advertiser's web site are described as being in different geographic locations, that is not required.
- the advertising server process, reporting process, derive profile process and management process are described as being implemented on one computer platform performing all of the above described functions, it is readily understood by those of skill that any or all of these functions may be implemented on one or more different computers and further that these processes may be performed at different nodes on the network.
