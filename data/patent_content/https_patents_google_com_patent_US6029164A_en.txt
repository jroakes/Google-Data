Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to electronic mail, and more particularly to electronic mail messaging in a distributed computer system.
- the Internet allows users to interchange useful information in a timely and convenient manner. However, keeping track of this huge amount of information has become a problem.
- the Internet now allows users to exchange information in a number of different presentation modalities, such as text, audio, and still and moving images. Adapting e-mail systems to organize such complex information, and providing efficient means to coherently retrieve the information is not trivial.
- IMAP Internet Messaging Access Protocol
- POP Post Office Protocol
- SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- users must install compatible user agent software on any client computers where the mail service is going to be accessed.
- SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- client computers For example, it is not unusual to store the entire mail database for a particular user in his desk-top or lap-top computer.
- the users explicitly organize mail messages into subject folders. Accessing mail generally involves shipping entire messages over the network to the client computer.
- the method receives data records in an index server, where the data records are parsed into words, and stored a full-text index. Labels are added to the data records and the full-text index.
- the data records are accessed by searching the full-text index using queries including the words and the labels of the data records. It is also possible to remove labels from the full-text index.
- the data records are mail messages, and an inbox label is automatically added when a particular message is received.

- an arrangement 100 provides a distributed mail service having features according to the invention.
- one or more client computers 111-113 are connected via a network 120 to a mail service system 200 described in greater detail below.
- the client computers 111-113 can be workstations, personal computers (PCS), lap-tops, palm-tops, network computers (NCs), or any other similar configured computer system.
- the clients 111-113 can be owned, borrowed, or rented. It should be noted that in practice, the clients 111-113 can potentially be any of the millions of personal computer systems that are currently extant and connected to a network. Over time, a user may use different client computers at different locations.
- each client computer executes standard operating system software (O/S) 114, e.g., UNIX (TM), Windows95 (TM), MacOS (TM) or NT (TM).
- O/S 114 is used to execute application software programs.
- One of the application programs which can execute on the client 110 is a Web browser 115.
- the Web browser 115 can be Netscape (TM) Navigator (TM), Microsoft Explorer (TM), Hot Java (TM), and other similar browsers.
- the functionality of the browser 115 can be extended by forms, applets, and plug-ins generally indicated by reference numeral 116.
- the browser extensions are in the form of client mail application programs described in greater detail below.
- the client mail application programs are downloaded over the network 120 from the mail service system 200.
- the extensions can be implemented using HyperText Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, Java applets, Microsoft ActiveX, or combinations thereof to provided maximum portability.
- the client includes one or more processors (P) 117, memories 118 (M), input/output interfaces (I/O) 119 connected to each other by a bus 120.
- the processors 117 can implement Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) or Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architectures in 32, 64, or other bit length data structures.
- the memories 118 can include solid state dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and fixed and removable memories such as hard disk drives, CD-ROMs, diskettes, and tapes.
- the I/O 119 can be connected to input devices such as a keyboard and a mouse, and output devices such as a display and a printer.
- the I/O 119 can also be configured to connect to multi-media devices such as sound-cards, image processors, and the like.
- the I/O also provides the necessary communications links to the network 120.
- the network 120 includes a large number of public access points, and communications are carried out using Internet Protocols (IP).
- IP Internet Protocols
- IP protocols are widely recognized as a standard way of communicating data. Higher level protocols, such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP), communicate at the application layer, while lower level protocols, such as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) operate at the transport and network levels.
- HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol
- FTP File Transfer Protocol
- TCP/IP Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
- the Internet includes a data exchange interface called the World-Wide-Web, or the "Web" for short.
- the Web provides a way for formatting, communicating, inter-connecting, and addressing data according to standards recognized by a large number of software packages. For example, using the Web, multi-media (text, audio, and video) data can be arranged as Web pages.
- the Web pages can be located by the browser 115 using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
- URLs Uniform Resource Locators
- a URL specifies the exact location of a Web-based resource such as a server or data record.
- the location can include domain, server, user, file, and record information, e.g., HTTP://www.digital.com/ ⁇ userid/file.html/ ⁇ record”
- An Internet service can be used to send and receive mail messages. For example, a mail message can be sent mail to the address "jones @mail. digital.com” using the SMTP protocol.
- the Internet and the Web allow users, with only minor practical limitations, to exchange data no matter where they are using any type of computer equipment.
- the mail service system 200 includes one or more server computers. Usually, the system 200 is part of some private network (intranet) connected to the public network 120. Typically, an intranet is a distributed computer system operated by some private entity for a selected user base, for example, a corporate network, a government network, or some commercial network.
- intranet is a distributed computer system operated by some private entity for a selected user base, for example, a corporate network, a government network, or some commercial network.
- firewall 130 In order to provide security protection, communications between components of the Internet and the intranet are frequently filtered and controlled by a firewall 130.
- the purpose of the firewall 130 is to enforce security policies of the private intranet.
- One such policy may be "never allow a client computer to directly connect to an intranet server via the public portion of the Internet.”
- the firewall in parts, protects accesses to critical resources (servers and data) of the intranet.
- the tunnel 131 typically performs a secure challenge-and-response sequence before access is allowed.
- the mail service system 200 can be implemented as one or more server computers connected to each other either locally, or over large geographies.
- a server computer as the name implies, is configured to execute server software programs on behalf of client computers 111-113.
- server can mean the hardware, the software, or both because the software programs may dynamically be assigned to different servers computers depending on load conditions. Servers typically maintain large centralized data repositories for many users.
- the servers are configured to maintain user accounts, to receive, filter, and organize mail messages so that they can readily be located and retrieved, no matter how the information in the messages is encoded.
- the client computers 111-112 desire to perform e-mail services. These activities typically include composing, reading, and organizing e-mail messages. Therefore, the client computers can make connections to the network 120 using a public Internet service provider (ISP) such as AT&T (TM)or Earthlink (TM). Alternatively, a client computer can be connected to the Internet at a "cyber-cafe" such as Cybersmith (TM), or the intranet itself via a local area network. Many other connection mechanisms can also be used. Once a connection has been made, a user can perform any mail service.
- ISP public Internet service provider
- TM AT&T
- TM Earthlink
- structural and functional characteristics of the arrangement 100 include the following.
- Mail services of the system 200 are available through any Web-connected client computer.
- the users of the services can be totally mobile, moving among different clients at will during any of the mail activities.
- Composition of a mail message can be started on one client, completed on another, and sent from a yet another computer.
- the service system will work adequately over a wide range of connectivity bandwidths, even for mail messages including data in the form of multi-media. Message retrieval from a large repository is done using queries of full-text index without requiring a complex classification scheme.
- the arrangement 100 is designed to incorporate redundancy techniques such as multiple access paths, and replicated files using redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID) technologies.
- RAID redundant arrays of independent disks
- the mail service system includes the following components.
- the system 200 is constructed to have as a front-end a Web server 210.
- the server 210 can be the "Apache" Web server available from the WWW Consortium.
- the Web server 210 interacts with a back-end common gateway interface (CGI) programs 220.
- the programs interface with an account manager 300, a STMP mail server 240, and an index server 250.
- the CGI programs 220 are one possible mechanism.
- the programs could also be implemented by adding, the code directly to the Web server 210, or by adding extensions to the Netscape Server Application Programming Interface (NSAPI) from Netscape (TM).
- NSAPI Netscape Server Application Programming Interface
- the top-level functions of the system 200 include send mail 241, receive mail 242, query index 243, add/remove label to/from mail 244, and retrieve mail 245.
- Different servers can be used for the processes which implement the functions 241-245.
- the account manager 300 maintains account information.
- the mail server 240 is used to send and receive mail messages to and from other servers connected to the network.
- the index server 250 maintains mail messages in message files 400, and a full-text index 500 to messages.
- the CGI programs 220 also interact with the messages files 400 via a filter 280 for mail message retrieval.
- the Web server 210 can be any standard Web server that implements the appropriate protocols to communicate via the network using HTTP protocols 201, for example the Apache server.
- the CGI back-end programs 220 route transactions between the Web server 210 and the operational components of the mail service system.
- the CGI back-end 220 can be implemented as C and TCL programs executing on the servers.
- the account manager 300 maintains account information 301-303 for users who are allowed to have access to the mail system 200.
- Information maintained for each account can include: mail-box address 310, e.g., in the form of a Post Office Protocol (POP-3) address, user password 320, label state 330, named queries 340, filter queries 350, query position information 360, user preferences 370, and saved composition states 380.
- POP-3 Post Office Protocol
- the full meaning and use of the account information will be come apparent as other components of the system 200 are described.
- Labels 330 are used to organize and retrieve mail messages. Labels can be likened to annotated notes that can be added and removed to messages over their lifetimes, in other words labels are mutable. Labels help users organize their messages into subject areas. At any one time, the label state captures all labels that are active for a particular user. Labels will be described in greater detail below.
- mail messages are accessed by using queries. This is in contrast to explicitly specifying subject folders as are used in many known mail systems.
- a query is composed one or more search terms, perhaps connected by logical operators, that can be used to retrieve messages. By specifying the name of a query, a user can easily retrieve messages related to a particular topic, phrase, date, sender, etc.
- Named queries 340 are stored as part of the account information.
- Some queries can be designated as "filter” queries 340. This allows a user to screen, for example, "junk mail,” commonly known as spam. Filter queries can also be used to pre-sort messages received from particular mailing lists. Query position information records which message the user last selected with a query. This way the user interface can position the display of messages with respect to the selected message when the query is reissued.
- User preferences 370 specify the appearance and functioning of the user interface to the mail service as implemented by the extended browser 116 of FIG. 1. Saved composition states 380 allow a user to compose and send a message using several different client computers while preparing the message.
- the account manager 300 can generate a new account, or delete an existing account.
- the account is generated for a user by specifying the user name and password. Once a skeletal account has been generated, the user can supply the remaining information such as labels, named queries, filter queries, and so forth.
- the mail server system 200 receives (242) new mail messages by communicating with the mail server 240 using the POP-3 protocol. Messages are sent (241) using the SMTP protocol.
- the mail server 240 is connected to the Internet by lines 249.
- the appropriate routing information in the mail server 240 for a particular user can be generated after the user's account has been generated.
- a "POP Account Name" should be specified as the user's name. In most systems, the name will be case sensitive.
- the "POP Host" should be the Internet domain name of the mail server 240. Here, the case of the letters is ignored.
- An IP address such as "16.4.0.16" can be used, although the domain name is preferred. In some cases, a particular user's preferred Internet e-mail address may be unrelated to the POP Account Name, or the POP Host.
- Messages are stored in message files 400 and a full-text index.
- the organization of the message files is first described. This is followed by a description of the full-text index 500.
- user interaction with the mail messages is primarily by queries performed on the full-text index 500.
- the index server 250 assigns each received message 401-402, a unique identification (MsgID) 410.
- the MsgID 410 is composed of a file identification (FileID) 411, and a message number (MsgNum) 412.
- the FileID "names," or is a pointer to a specific message file 420, and the MsgNum is some arbitrary numbering of messages in a file, e.g., an index into the file 420.
- a message entry 430 includes the MsgNum stored at field 431, labels 432, and the content of the message itself in field 433.
- the number of separate files 240 that are maintained for storing messages can depend on the design of the underlying file system and specific implementation details. For example, the size and number of entries of a particular file may be limited by the file system. Also, having multiple files may facilitate file maintenance functions such as back-up and restore.
- the log 440 includes "add" entries (+label) 450, and "remove” entries (-label) 460. Each entry includes the MsgID 451 or 453 of the effected message entry, and label that is being added (452) or deleted (453). The contents of the log 440 are occasionally merged with the message files 240. Merged entries are removed from the log 440.
- the label log 440 allows for the mutation of labels attached to data records such as mail messages, where the labels and the data which are labeled are stored in the same index.
- FIGS. 5 and 6 show how the index server 250 generates the full-text index 500.
- Newly received mail messages are processed in batches 403-404. Messages 401 and 402 of a batch are parsed into individual words 510.
- a batch 403 in a large mail service system may include hundreds or thousands of messages. The words of the messages are parsed in the order that they are received in a batch. Each word is arbitrarily assigned a sequential location number 520.
- the very first word of the very first message of the very first batch is assigned location "1," the next word location "2," and the last word location "3.”
- the first word of the next message is assigned the next sequential location "4,” and so forth.
- the indexing process generates additional "metawords" 530.
- an end-of-message (eom) metaword is generated for the last word of each message.
- the metawords are assigned the same locations as the words which triggered their generation. In the example shown, the location of the first eom metaword is "3,” and the second is "5.”
- Metawords help facilitate searches of the index. Metawords are appended with predetermined characters so that there is no chance that a metaword will ever be confused with an actual parsed word. For example, metawords include characters such as "space” which are never allowed in words.
- words means both actual words and synthesized metawords.
- the words and their assigned locations are sorted 540, first according to the collating order of the words, and second according their sequential locations. For example, the word “me” appears at locations "3" and "5" as shown in box 550.
- the sorted batch 550 of words and locations is used to generate the index. Each sorted batch 550 is merged into the index 500, initially empty.
- FIG. 6 shows the logical structure of an index 600 according to the preferred embodiment.
- the index includes a plurality of word entries 610.
- Each word entry 610 is associated with a unique "word,” that appeared at least once in some indexed message.
- word is used very loosely here, since the parsing of the words in practice depends on which marks/characters are used as word separators. Words do not need to be real words that can be found in a dictionary. Separators can be spacing and punctuation marks.
- the indexer 250 will parse anything in a message that can be identified as a distinct set of characters delineated by word separators. Dates are also parsed and placed in the index. Dates are indexed so that searches on date ranges are possible. In an active index there may well be millions of different words. Therefore, in actual practice, compression techniques are extensively used to keep the files to a reasonably size, and allow updating of the index 500 as it is being used. The details of the physical on-disk structure of the index 600, and the maintenance thereof are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,745,899, entitled "A Method for Indexing Information of a Database", issued to Michael Borrows on Apr. 28, 1998 incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
- the word entries 610 are stored in the collating order of the words.
- the word is stored in a word field 611 of the entry 610.
- the word field 611 is followed by location fields (locs) 612.
- locs location fields
- the locations are actually stored as a sequence of delta-values to reduce storage.
- the index 600 is fully populated. This means the last byte 614 of the last location field of a word is immediately followed by the first byte 615 of the next word field.
- Labels provide a way for users to annotate mail messages. Attaching a label to a message is similar to affixing a note to a printed document. Labels can be used to replace the folder mechanisms used by many prior art mail systems. However, a single mail message can be annotated with multiple labels. This compares favorably to folder-based systems where a message can only be stored in a single folder.
- the labels are nothing more than predefined text strings.
- the currently active set of labels for a particular user e.g. the label state 330 of FIG. 3, is maintained by the account manager 300 and is displayed in a window of the graphical user interface. Labels can be added and removed by the system or by users.
- labels are stored in a data structure 650 that parallels and extends the functionality of full-text index 500. Labels are subject to the same constraints as index words. Also, queries on the full-text index 500 can contain labels, as well as words, as search terms. A label is added to a mail message by adding a specific index location (or locations) within the message to the set of locations referred to by the specified label. Label removal is the opposite. Operations on labels are much more efficient than other operations that mutate the state of the full-text index.
- the on-disk data structure for the label index 650 that represents the label state 320 is the same as that described for index word entries 600. This means that the label state can be thought of as an extension of the full-text index 500. Accordingly, the label index extension, like the index 500, maps labels (words) 651 to sequences of index locations 652.
- the label portion of the index is managed by a software component that is distinct from the software that manages the full-text index 500. If a term of a query string is found to be a label, then the label index 650 is searched to provide the necessary location mapping. This mapping is further modified by the label log 440 that contains all recent label mutations (additions or removals).
- the label log 440 can include an in-memory version 660. Since operations on this structure are in-memory, updates for recent label mutations 660 can be relatively fast while the updating of the label index 650 can take place in background.
- a message 700 includes a header 701 and a body.
- the header 701 typically includes the "To”, “From”, “Date” and “Subject” fields.
- the header may also include routing information.
- the body 702 is the text of the mail message.
- Each mail message can initially receive two labels, "inbox” 710 and "unread” 720. Messages labeled as “unread” 720 have not yet been exposed for reading. Messages with the "inbox” label 710 are deemed to require the user's attention. As will be described below, it is possible for messages to be labeled as unread but not have the inbox label. These less important messages can be read by the user as needed.
- Outputting, e.g., displaying or printing, a message removes the unread label 720 under the assumption that it has been read.
- a user can explicitly add or remove the unread label.
- a message can be deleted by attaching a "delete" label 730. This has the effect that the message will not been seen again because messages labeled as deleted are normally excluded during searches. Removing the deleted label has the effect of "un-deleting" a message.
- labels for data records that are mail messages
- “mutable” labels can also be used for other types of data records.
- labels which can be added and removed can be used with data records such as Web-pages, or news group notes.
- the key feature here being that labels are indexed in the same index as the record which they label, and that labels can be added and removed.
- the messages can be retrieved by issuing full-text queries.
- a query searches for messages that match on words and labels specified in the query. This is in contrast with known mail systems where users access mail by remembering in which file, folder, or sub-folder messages have been placed so the folder can be searched. As an advantage of the present system, users only need to recall some words and labels to find matching messages.
- a query includes a sequence of primitive query terms, combined by operators such as "and,” “or,” “not,” “near,” and so forth.
- a primitive term can be a sequence of alpha-numeric characters, i.e., a "word,” without punctuation marks. If the terms are enclosed by quotation marks ("), the search is for an exact match on the quoted string.
- a term can be a label.
- a term such as “from:fred” searches for messages with the word “fred” in the "from” field of a message header. Similar queries can be formulated for the "to,” “from,” “cc,” and “subject” fields of the header.
- a term such as "11/2/96-25/Dec/96" searches for all messages in the specified date range.
- the parsing of dates is flexible, e.g, 12/25/96, 25/12/1996, and Dec/25/96 all mean the same date.
- ambiguity (2/1/96) the European order (day/month) is assumed.
- the CGI program 220 modifies each issued query by appending a term which excludes the "deleted" label, e.g., "and not deleted.” This has the effect of hiding all deleted messages from the user of the client. There is an option in the user interface which inhibits this effect to make deleted messages visible.
- Queries can be "named.” Named queries are maintained by the account manager 300. By specifying the name of a query, users can quickly perform a search for e-mail messages including frequently used terms. Users can compose complex queries to match on some pattern in indexed messages, perhaps intermixing conditions about messages having particular text or labels, and to keep the query for subsequent use.
- Named queries can be viewed as a way for replacing prior art subject folders. Instead of statically organizing messages into folders according to predetermined conditions, queries allow the user to retrieve a specific collection of messages depending on a current set of search terms. In other words, the conditions which define the collection are dynamically expressed as a query.
- Queries can also be used to perform the function of prior art "address books.”
- address books In many known e-mail systems, users keep address books of frequently used addresses. From time to time, users can add and remove addresses. There, the address books are statically maintained as separate data structures or address book files. For example, there can be "personal” and “public” related address books. In contrast, here, there is no separately stored address book. Instead, an "address book” is dynamically generated as it is needed. The dynamic address book is generated from the files 400 and the full-text index 500 as follows.
- a user of a client computer 820 can generate address book type information using a form 800 supplied by one of the client mail application programs 116.
- the form 800 includes, for example, entry fields 801-803 for address related information such as name, phone number, (hard-copy) mail address, and (soft-copy) e-mail address, and so forth.
- address information can be selected from a prior received mail message 805 by clicking on appropriate fields in the header or body of the message 805.
- the address book information is handled exactly as a received mail message.
- An "address" label 809 can also be added to the entry using the labeling convention as described herein.
- the address book mail message 810 and label 809 can be stored in one of the message files 400. Additionally the message 810 can be parsed and inserted into the full-text index 500 as are the words and labels of any other mail message. In other words, the address information of form 800 is merged and blended with the full-text index 500.
- the address information can be retrieved by the user of the client computer 820 composing a query 830 using the standard query interface, with perhaps, the label "address" as one of the query terms.
- the exact content to be retrieved is determined at the time that the terms and operator of the query 830 are composed by the user.
- the address information i.e., one or more address book mail messages, which satisfies the query is returned to the client computer 820 as the dynamic address book 840.
- the user can then select one of the addresses as a "to" address for a new, reply, or forward mail message.
- Messages from a particular user can be specified by including in a query a term such as "from:jones.” This will locate only messages from a particular user. You can select messages of a particular "thread” by using the "view discussion" option of the user interface described below. As stated above, messages for a particular date range can be specified in the query.
- a message filter is specified as one or more name "filter" queries 910.
- the named query 910 is stored as part of the account information of FIG. 3.
- the named filter query 910 can be composed on a client computer 920 using the client mail application programs downloaded from the mail service system 200.
- New messages 930 received by the mail service system 200 are stored, parsed, and indexed in the message files 400 and full-test index 500 as described above.
- each new message 930 can be compared with the named queries 910. If the content of a new message 930 does not match any of the named filter queries 910, then the new message 930 is given the inbox label 710 and the unread label 720, i.e., the message is placed in the "In-box" 940 for the user's attention. Otherwise, the new message 920 is only given the unread label 720.
- mail which is sent out typically has a "from” field including the name of the sender, e.g., "From:Jon Doe," in the message header.
- the body of the mail message may include the text, "You are getting this message from your good friend Jon Doe.”
- the user Jon Doe can set up a named filter query "SentByME" as "From near (Jon Doe)". This query will match any message which contains the word "from” near the word phrase "Jon Doe.”
- the effect is that users do not explicitly become aware of messages that match on the filter query 910. For example, a user may want to filter messages which are "cc" copies to one self.
- a user may also desire to filter out junk e-mail messages arriving from commercial e-mail distributors at known domains, or pre-sort messages received via mailing lists.
- Messages are normally displayed by their primary component being transmitted to the client in the HTML format, and being displayed in the Java applet's window.
- the first line of a displayed message contains any "hot-links" which the user can click to display the message in one of the Web browser's windows, either with the HTML formatting, or as the original text uninterpreted by the system.
- headers in Internet messages can be quite lengthy. Therefore, it is possible to restrict the view to just the "from,” “to,” “cc,” “date,” and “subject” fields of the header.
- the system 200 When displaying retrieved messages, the system 200 heuristically locates text strings which have the syntax of e-mail addresses. If the user click on one of these addresses, then the system will display a composition window, described below, so that the user can easily generate a reply message to the selected e-mail address(es).
- the system 200 when displaying retrieved messages, the system 200 heuristically locates text strings that have the syntax of an URL, and makes the string a hot-link. When the user clicks on the hot-link, the URL is passed to the browser, which will retrieve the contents over the network, and process the content in the normal manner.
- the system also attempts to detect components in messages, such as explicitly "attached” or implicitly “embedded” files.
- the files can be in any number of possible formats.
- the content of these files are displayed by the browser 115. The specific display actions used will depend on how the browser is configured to respond to different component file formats.
- the component can directly be displayed. It is also possible to configure the browser with a "helper" applet to "display" attached files having specific format types as "icons.”
- the message may be in the form of an audio message, in which case, the message needs to be "said,” and not displayed.
- the browser may store some of the content in file system of the client computer.
- the client computers 111-113 may access the mail service system via low-bandwidth network connections, an attempt is made to minimize the amount of data that are sent from the mail service system to the client computers. Even over high-speed communications channels, minimizing the amount of network traffic can improve user interactions.
- mail messages can become quite large.
- the entire mail message, included files are typically shipped to the client computer.
- any part of the mail message can immediately be read by the user after the message has been received in the client.
- the mail service system 200 can recognize messages components that are included as such.
- the system 200 can discover an explicitly attached file 1010 to a message 1000, and the system 200 can also heuristically discover textual components 1020-1021 that are implicitly embedded without MIME structuring in the message.
- the system 200 can recognize embedded "uuencoded" enclosures, base 64 enclosures, Postscript (and PDF) documents, HTML pages, and MIME fragments.
- the system 200 is configured to "hold-back" such components 1010, 1020-1021 encoded in different formats using a "MIME" filter 1001.
- the attached and embedded components are replaced by hot-links 1031 in a reduced size message 1030. Only when the user clicks on one of the hot-links 1031 is the component sent to the requesting client computer.
- the functions described can be displayed as pull-down menus, or as button bars depending on a desired appearance.
- the functions are implemented as Java applets.
- the file menu has the following options, Administration, Preferences, and Quit. If the user clicks on the Administration option button, then the system 200 loads the system administrative page into the browser 116. Using the Administrative window, subject to access controls, the user can view and modify accounts, and view the server log files. The preferences option is used to modify user preferences 370. Quit returns to the main log-in window.
- This menu includes the View Discussion, Name Current Query, Forget Named Query, Exclude "deleted” Message, and Your Query Options.
- the View Discussion option issues a query for messages related to the currently selected message.
- “related” means any messages which share approximately the same subject line, and/or being in reply to such a message, or messages linked by a common standard "RFC822" message ID.
- the Name Current Query allows a user to attach a text string to the current query. This causes the system 200 to place the query in the account for the user for subsequent use.
- the Forget Named Query option deletes a named query.
- the Excluded "deleted" message option omits from a query result all messages that have the deleted label. This is the default option. Clicking on this option changes the behavior of the system 200 to include, in response to a query, "deleted" messages.
- the Your Named Queries option displays a particular user's set of named queries 340. Clicking on any of the displayed names issues the query.
- This menu includes the Record Label, and Forget Label options. These options respectively allow for the addition and removal of labels to and from the label state 330.
- the client keeps a history of, for example, the last ten queries to allow for the reissue of queries.
- the options of this menu are Go Back, Redo Current Query, Go Forward, and The History List.
- Go Back reissues the query preceding to the current query.
- Redo reissues the current query. This option is useful to process messages which have recently arrived, or in the case where the user's actions have altered the messages files 400 in some other manner.
- Go Forward reissues the query following the current query.
- the History List displays all of the recently issued queries. Any query listed can be reissued by clicking on the query.
- Options here include: Select All, Select Unread, Select Read, Mark As Unread, Mark As Read, Add Labels, Remove Labels, and Use Built-in Viewer.
- the Select All option selects all messages which match the current query. The next two options respectively select message that do not, and do have the unread label. The following two options add and remove labels label to currently selected messages.
- the user interface normally displays a message by converting the message to an HTML format and presenting it to an HTML viewer which can either be in the browser's main window, or with a built-in viewer.
- the last option of the message menu selects the viewer.
- the help options can be used to display informational pages on how to use the various features of the system.
- the help pages are down-loaded on demand into the client computer from the mail service system 200.
- This menu bar includes buttons for the following functions. The functions are enabled by clicking on the button.
- This button is used to add a selected label to a message.
- Relabel This button combines the functions of the unlabel and add functions.
- Delete With this button, a deleted label is added to a message.
- Unlabel Used to remove a single label mentioned in a query from a message.
- Prev Selects a preceding message.
- Newmail Issues a query for all message having the inbox label.
- Query Presents a dialog to compose and issue a query.
- This button bar is used to perform the following functions.
- Detach Generate a new top-level window to display selected messages.
- Compose Generate a window for composing new mail messages.
- This function sets up a window for composing a new message. A selected message is attached to the new message. The attached messages are forwarded without the need of down-loading the messages to the client computer.
- This function sets up a window for composing a new message with the same recipients as those in a selected message.
- Reply To Sender Set up a window for composing a new message to the sender of a selected message.
- composition window Access to the composition window is gained by clicking on the Compose, Forward, Reply, or Modify button, or by clicking on a "mail-to" hot link in a displayed message.
- Compose begins a new message, forward is used to send a previously received message to someone else, reply is to respond to a message, and modify allows on to change a message which has not yet been sent.
- the mail service allows a user to compose multiple messages at a time.
- the text of a message is typed in using an available composition window, or generating a window if none are available.
- the exact form of the typing area of the composition window depends on the nature of the windowing system used on a particular client computer. Typically, while typing the user can use short-cuts for editing actions such as cut, paste, copy, delete, undo, and so forth.
- Text portions from another message can be inserted by using the Insert Msg, or Quote Msg buttons. If an entire message is to be included, then the Forward button should be used. The message will not actually be posted until the send function is selected. While the message is being composed, it is periodically saved by the mail system. Thus, a composition session started using one client computer in an office, can easily be completed some time later using another computer.
- Send Sends a message. Any attachments are included before sending the message. The user is notified of invalid recipients by a status message, and editing of the message can continue. Otherwise, the window is switched to read-only mode.
- this button replaces the send button to allow one to close the composition window.
- Discard This button is used to discard the message being composed, and switches the window to read-only. A user can then click the close or modify buttons.
- Insert Msg Replace the selected text with displayed text from a selected message.
