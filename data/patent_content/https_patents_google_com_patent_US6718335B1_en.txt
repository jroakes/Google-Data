Definitions
- This invention generally relates to meta data, and more specifically, to a meta data repository that stores summary information about data.
- Meta data is information about data. For example, meta data about a particular database might contain descriptions about what type of information is held in each table and field within the database. The databases meta data would also explain the physical attributes of the database such as the types and lengths of the fields, table spacing, indexing, etc. Basically, the meta data repository should be the one place to find out everything and anything about a database.
- Meta data catalogs are collections or repositories of meta data. These catalogs are playing an increasingly vital role in publishing authenticated information and in storing and disseminating such information through a controlled but uniform interface. While these catalogs are of substantial use, the normal meta data catalog has several constraints. For instance, these catalogs are inactive—that is, nothing can really be done to the data in the catalogs. Also, these catalogs provide only limited information. The meta data catalog may provide complete information about a particular database, but all the information in that database came from another database, and often a user needs to know more about that other database.
- a persistent problem is that the catalogs do not hold all the information a user might want.
- a meta data catalog may hold all the physical information of a database
- a user is normally not able to determine from the catalog, where the information came from—that is, the mappings indicating how one database maps to another.
- An object of this invention is to provide an improved meta data catalogue.
- Another object of the present invention is to provide a meta data catalog with the ability to drive changes in associated systems.
- a data warehouse comprising means for database modeling, and means for extracting data from the database and storing the extracted data.
- a reporting tool is used to make inquiries of the stored data and to format the results of the inquiries, and a single meta data catalog is coupled to the means for modeling, the means for extracting and storing, and the reporting tool.
- a user needs to update information only once.
- the catalog meta data then drives changes in associated systems, such as a warehouse, extraction programs and reporting tools. In order to accomplish this, the meta data catalog holds enough information to control all these various parts of the process.
- the present invention allows a developer to quickly model a new database based on an existing database, identify how the two databases are linked to each other (mapping information), create the database definition, and then use all this captured information in a variety of reporting methods. All the pertinent data are in one location.
- the meta data catalog is of particular use in very large databases (1000+tables), because much of the functionality included allows changes to the data model to be made quickly and globally when needed.
- FIG. 1 illustrates a data warehouse embodying the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating functions of elements of the data warehouse.
- FIGS. 1 and 2 shows a data warehouse 10 , comprising means 12 for database modeling, and means 14 for extracting data from said database and storing the extracted data.
- a reporting tool 16 is used to make inquiries of the stored data and to format the results of the inquiries, and a single meta data catalog 20 is coupled to the means for modeling, the means for extracting and storing, and the reporting tool.
- a user needs to update information only once.
- the meta data catalog 20 drives changes in associated systems, such as warehouse 10 , extraction programs 14 , and reporting tools 16 . In order to accomplish this, the meta data catalog 20 holds enough information to control all these various parts of the process.
- the meta data repository stores summary information about data. For example, meta data about a particular database might contain descriptions about what type of information is held in each table and field within the database. The database's meta data would also explain the physical attributes of the database.
- the invention allows the developer to quickly model a new database based on an existing database, identify how the two databases are linked to each other (mapping information), create the database definition, and then use all this captured information in a variety of reporting methods.
- the invention stores meta data from different databases in a single meta data catalog 20 . All the pertinent data is in one location.
- the meta data catalog 20 is of particular use in very large databases (1000+tables), because much of the functionality included allows changes to the data model to be made quickly and globally when needed.
- the data warehouse 10 may be part of a database computer 22 . More specifically, database computer 22 includes one or more storage media containing the data warehouse 10 .
- Database computer 22 is preferably a massively parallel process computer and executes the UNIX operating system or Windows NT, although other computer and operating system configurations are also envisioned by the present invention.
- Data warehouse 10 is suited to run on any computer that supports an Open Database Connect (ODBC) interface to data warehouse.
- ODBC Open Database Connect
