- Operational transformation rules 333 are also stored in memory 325 of collaborative development service 130 as well as in user device 160 .
- collaborative development service 130 provides an object-oriented software development architecture that allows developers to create software applications based on data models.
- collaborative development service 130 provides access to three basic data types for use in constructing a data model: ordered lists (arrays), maps, and primitives.
- Collaborative development service 130 supports several primitive types, including, without limitation, float, integer, Boolean, string, and date.
- a developer may generate an object using lists, maps, and primitives, and may further create a data model that includes one or more objects.
- the data models created in this manner may be used to create a software application relating to a variety of content types, including, without limitation, word processing applications, spreadsheet applications, drawing tools, photo or image editing applications, video editing applications, design tools, software development tools, audio or music editing applications, games, software applications having a shared user space, etc.
- a data model is a rooted tree, where nodes are either maps or ordered lists, and leaves are primitive values. Any node in the tree can be specified using an ordered list, referred to as a “target path,” of key names and array indices.
- a software application developed using collaborative development service 130 has a single root data model object, referred to as the root map. All application-specific data is nested inside the root map.
- collaborative development service 130 supports two operations for the instantiation and deletion of non-primitive objects, two operations on array data, and one operation on map data.
- the supported operations, or mutations, are described below.
- the typeName may be a user-defined type name or one of the built-in types like “Map” or “Array”.
- DeleteObject(String id) Deletes an object with the given id. All references to an object must be removed before an object can be deleted. Mutations that refer to a deleted object are transformed to nothing. If an object deletion is undone, the reverse mutation includes all mutations necessary to fully reconstruct the deleted object.
- InsertBefore Inserts a primitive value or an object reference into an ordered list before a given index. All higher-indexed values in the list are shifted to the right.
- Delete(TargetPath path) Deletes a value from an array. All higher-indexed values in the list are shifted to the left.
- a developer may begin building an application by writing a data model definition file.
- Collaborative development service 130 provides a compiler service that compiles the data model definition file to generate a collection of Javascript files that represent the user's data model. The developer may code against this API.
- a developer employing user device 160 or other processing device may access collaborative development service 130 via network 105 and define one or more objects based on ordered lists, maps, and primitives.
- a developer may further construct a data model based on the objects built from the lists, maps, and primitives.
- a data model may include a word object having an ordered list of alphanumeric characters defining a word, an image object having an ordered list of pixel values defining an image, a line graph object having an ordered list of values to be plotted, etc.
- a data model may include other types of objects built from the lists, maps, and primitives provided, such as a paragraph object, a spreadsheet column object, a line object, a rectangle object, etc.
- a developer may then create a software application based on the data model.
- the software application may be maintained at third party web site 112 , for example.
- a user of the software application may access the software application via collaborative development service 130 and create a document.
- the user may then create an instance of an object, or object instance, within the document by defining the characteristics of the object. For example, supposing that software application defines a word object that includes an ordered list of alphanumeric characters, a user may create a document and generate an instance of the word object by typing a word, thereby specifying the alphanumeric characters within the list.
- the user may also specify other characteristics of the word object instance such as the font, size, etc.
- a developer associated with third party website 112 accesses collaborative development service 130 and creates a data model that includes a word object.
- the data model (including the word object) is stored in memory 325 as data model 450 and word object 455 , as shown in FIG. 3 .
- the developer then develops a software application based on the data model, and maintains the software application (indicated in FIG. 1 as software application 400 ) at third party website 112 .
- software application 400 is created for use in relation to a word processing application, and enables users to create and edit text documents.
- Software application 400 may include other word processing functions.
- software application 400 may enable a user to create a paragraph (an instance of a paragraph object), a footnote (an instance of a footnote object), etc.
- a user may access software application 400 via collaborative development platform 130 and use software application 400 to create and/or edit a document.
- a user accesses his or her account at collaborative development service 130 and accesses software application 400 , by clicking on a link on a web page, or by selecting an option from a menu, for example.
- the user employs software application 400 to create a text document.
- the user's document is stored in memory 325 as document 410 .
- collaborative development service 130 uses software application 400 to edit document 410 .
- the user types text within document 410 , including one or more words.
- collaborative development service 130 generates an instance of word object 455 by defining an ordered list containing the alphanumeric characters specified by the user, and by specifying any other associated characteristics of the word. Supposing, for example, that the user types the alphanumeric characters “helloworld,” collaborative development service 130 generates within document 410 a word object instance 424 which includes an ordered list 407 containing the alphanumeric characters “helloworld,” as shown in FIG. 4B .
- word object instance 424 also includes instance data 428 which includes various types of data related to word object instance 424 .
- Instance data 428 includes text layout information specifying the layout of the text defined by ordered list 407 , such as numbered spacers corresponding to the relative location of each of the characters in the text.
- Object instance 424 may include other types of information not shown in FIG. 4B .
- layout information relating to an object instance may be stored separately from the object instance itself.
- data may be stored in a database, table, or in another type of data structure.
- a well-known technique used to display information on a user device includes transmitting data adapted to cause the user device to display all or a portion of the information on a Web page.
- collaborative development service 130 may transmit to browser 210 (of user device 160 ) a request, in the form of HyperText Markup Language (HTML), adapted to cause browser 210 to display a representation of word object instance 424 .
- browser 210 displays a representation of object instance 424 .
- FIG. 5 shows a web page 591 on which word object instance 424 is displayed as part of a text document, in accordance with an embodiment.
- HTML HyperText Markup Language
- an object instance may be updated based on one or more instructions received from users. For example, an instruction to add a letter to the end of word object instance 424 may be received from a user employing a user device 160 .
- collaborative development service 130 modifies word object instance 424 , and then transmits a request to user device 160 to redraw word object instance 424 on display 270 to effect the change in the visual representation of the word object instance.
- user device 160 redraws word object instance 424 on display 270 to reflect the change.
- collaborative development service 130 maintains a record of all user activities and revisions related to a particular document in a user activity table, and enables users to view activity and/or revision history pertaining to the particular document.
- FIG. 4B shows an example of an activity table that may be associated with document 410 in accordance with an embodiment.
- Activity table 428 includes a column 434 , which indicates a date and time of an activity perform by a user, such as accessing or leaving a document, or making a revision to the document.
- Activity table 428 includes a column 436 identifying the user who performed the activity.
- Column 438 describes the activity performed by the user, such as entering or leaving a document, or making a change to the document.
- row 451 indicates that User 1 performed a first activity, Activity 1 , at MM/DD/YYYY at 12:01:01.
- Row 452 contains data related to a second activity performed by User 2 at MM/DD/YYYY at 12:03:05.
- activity table 428 is stored in memory 325 , as shown in FIG. 3 .
- collaborative development service 130 utilizes fundamental edits to provide editing features.
- the fundamental edits correspond to the smallest changes that may be made to an object instance, and may be utilized in various combinations to provide all of the possible editing functions provided by collaborative development service 130 .
- the fundamental edits may vary by content type.
- fundamental edits for a word processing editor may include inserting a character, deleting a character, applying a style, inserting an entity (e.g., a numbered list), and updating an entity.
- Fundamental edits for a drawing tool may include moving an object one pixel in a given direction, deleting an object, etc.
- activity table 428 is updated such that a revision history, including a running collection of applied changes, is maintained.
- Combinations of two or more fundamental edits may be referred to as a command.
- commands correspond to modifications that make use of two or more fundamental edits.
- an “Insert Column in Table” command may utilize multiple “insert character” fundamental edits, and may also utilize multiple “apply style” fundamental edits to insert a column into a table within a document.
- collaborative development service 130 When instructions requesting multiple fundamental edits with respect to a particular object instance are received from a user device 160 , collaborative development service 130 applies each requested fundamental edit to the object instance in response to instructions. However, rather than sending to user device 160 a separate request to redraw the visual representation of the object instance after applying each fundamental edit to the object instance, collaborative development service 130 instead determines an efficient redraw approach that reduces the number of redraws required.
- collaborative development service 130 may analyze the instance data associated with the object instance, including layout data, and/or revision history data within activity table 428 indicating multiple fundamental edits performed during execution of a command, and based on such information, merge several fundamental edits or otherwise reduce the number of redraws needed to render the changes as compared to the number of fundamental edits that have actually been applied to the object instance. A request is then transmitted to one or more user devices to redraw the object instance to effect the changes in the visual representation of the object instance.
- the instance data (including updated layout data) and the revision history data within activity table 428 may be analyzed to determine which alphanumeric characters, lines, or sections of the document have been affected.
- a command includes a first fundamental edit that is applied to a particular alphanumeric character, and a second fundamental edit that supersedes the first fundamental edit (e.g., a letter “g” is typed, and then a letter “p” is typed in the same position)
- a redraw approach may be determined that eliminates the first fundamental edit.
- fundamental edits that affect adjacent alphanumeric characters may be merged.
- a request is transmitted to one or more user devices 160 to redraw the visual representation of the updated object instance, thereby efficiently redrawing the object instance on user device 160 using a reduced number of redraws (e.g., by combining two or more of the redraws into a single redraw).
- the number of redraws that are used to redraw the visual representation of the object instance is less than the number of fundamental edits that were performed as part of the command.
- a plurality of instructions specifying respective changes to an object instance are received from a user device 160 and applied to the object instance.
- An efficient redraw approach reflecting the requested changes is then determined.
- An instruction to implement the redraw approach is then transmitted to the user device 160 .
- the user device 160 redraws the object instance based on the instruction.
- one approach to reducing the number of redraws applied to an object instance relates to adjacent character insertions in a collaborative typing context. For example, when a user who wishes to edit text document 410 requests a first character insertion, and then requests a second character insertion adjacent to the first (e.g., a first requested operation is to insert the characters “ab” at a given location, and a second requested operation is to insert characters “cd” adjacent to the inserted characters), a non-optimized redraw approach may include performing two separate redraws of the line—first to redraw the line with the characters “ab” inserted at the appropriate location, and then to redraw the line with the characters “cd” inserted at the appropriate location.
- the insertions are merged such that the insertions are achieved by a single redraw of the text.
- a request to redraw the object instance in this manner is transmitted to user device 160 , and a single redraw is performed.
- a user employing a user device 160 accesses object instance 424 and begins to edit the object instance. For example, the user may generate instructions to edit the object by pressing a key on a keyboard, or by pushing a button on a computer mouse, etc. Instructions reflecting the user's changes are transmitted to collaborative development service 130 by user devices 160 .
- FIG. 6 is an illustration of several changes made by the user to object instance 424 in accordance with an embodiment.
- the top row of boxes 605 , 610 , 615 , and 620 indicate a series of edits to word object instance 424 desired by the user, which are specified by instructions received from the user.
- the bottom row of boxes 625 , 630 , 635 , and 640 illustrate changes actually made to word object instance 424 by collaborative development service 130 in response to the user's instructions.
- Box 605 shows word object instance 424 before an instruction is received.
- Box 625 shows list 407 , and also shows text layout information 411 , which includes a portion of instance data 428 that pertains to the layout of the text.
- Numbered spacer “00” corresponds to the first letter in list 407 , “h”, and numbered spacer “07” corresponds to the eighth letter in list 407 , “r”, etc.
- a first instruction specifying a first desired change to the object instance is received from user device 160 .
- the user inserts the characters “my” after the “hello” text and before the “world” text.
- User device 160 transmits a request to make the desired change.
- the insertion is represented in layout information 411 as the insertion of two additional spacers following the fifth spacer (numbered “04”), which corresponds to the last character in “hello,” and renumbering the remaining spacers accordingly to accommodate the two inserted characters.
- User activity table 428 (shown in FIG. 4B ) is also updated to specifically identify the change, and the date and time the change was requested. Activity table 428 is further updated to identify the user of user device 160 as the source of the instruction.
- the user transmits an additional instruction to modify the text further by inserting the characters “hi” between the “m” and the “y” characters that were previously inserted, as shown in box 615 .
- the second insertion is merged with the first insertion rather than being handled separately.
- the change is represented as an insertion of four characters after the “hello” text and before the “world” text.
- the two insertions are represented as the insertion of four additional spacers following the fifth spacer (number “04”), and renumbering the remaining spacers accordingly.
- An instruction is now received from the user to modify word object instance 424 by applying an “underline” style to the “llomhiywor” text, as shown in box 620 .
- layout information 411 is modified to convey that the “underline” style should be applied to spacers numbered “02” through “11”, and therefore, that the range of spacers numbered “02” through “11” should be updated.
- Activity table 428 is updated to specifically identify these changes, and the date and time the change were requested. Activity table 428 is further updated to identify the user of user device 160 as the source of the instructions.
- layout information 411 indicates that the range of spacers number “02” through “13” should be updated in a single operation to effect the changes made to object instance 424 .
- the optimized redraw approach is used to update the visual representation of the object instance is updated on user device 160 .
- Collaborative development service 130 transmits a request to user device 160 to update the visual representation of object instance 424 by redrawing the range of spacers numbered “02” through “11” to effect the changes specified in the modified instance data 428 .
- the request directs user device 160 to complete the changes by performing a single redraw, instead of three redraws.
- user device 160 performs a single redraw in accordance with the request to effect the specified changes.
- collaborative development service 130 may receive, substantially simultaneously, from a plurality of user devices, multiple instructions specifying respective changes to an object instance.
- collaborative development service 130 uses operational transformation rules 333 to determine, for each respective user device, a transformed instruction, or set of transformed instructions, to cause the user device to display the changed object instance accurately and consistently, and transmits the transformed instruction(s) to the respective user device.
- operational transformation rules 333 include rules governing the modification of an object instance, and the redrawing of the visual representations of the object instance on multiple user devices, when multiple changes are made to the object instance.
- operational transformation rules 333 resolve conflicting changes specified in a plurality of instructions received from a plurality of user devices.
- a plurality of instructions received from a plurality of user devices specify conflicting changes to a document that may create inconsistent visual representations of the document across the respective user devices
- one or more operational transformations are applied to generate one or more transformed operations operable to reflect the specified changes in a consistent manner in the visual representations displayed on the respective devices.
- the rules apply a logic that contextualizes the changes specified by multiple instructions to determine a resolution that will result in a consistent visual representation of a document or object instance across multiple devices, without creating a collision (such as a temporal paradox or a race condition).
- operational transformations are applied to instructions received from user devices in real-time or substantially in real-time, to enable the respective user devices to update the respective visual representations of the document in real-time or substantially in real-time.
- processor 375 examines instructions received from respective user devices 160 and selectively applies operational transformation rules 333 to determine transformed operations.
- processor 375 in accordance with operational transformation rules 333 , examines a first instruction P (received from a first device) specifying a first change to an object instance, and a second instruction Q (received from a second device) specifying a second change to the object instance, and determines a set of transformed operations (P′,Q′) in accordance with the following transformation rule:
- Transformation Rule 1 The application of Transformation Rule 1 is described in the illustrative embodiments discussed below.
- a first user employing user device 160 -A uses collaborative development service 130 to access software application 400 , and accesses document 410 .
- a second user employing user device 160 -B simultaneously accesses document 410 in the same manner.
- the first user types the word “CAT” within document 410 .
- a word object instance 703 (including ordered list 705 and instance data 706 ) is created within document 410 .
- Word object instance 703 is viewed by the first and second users via web pages displayed on user device 160 -A and user device 160 -B, such as web page 707 shown in FIG. 7A .
- Processor 375 receives from user device 160 -A a first instruction, reflecting a change made by the first user, to replace the first character “C” of a word object instance “CAT” with the characters “CH.”
- a second instruction, reflecting a change made by the second user, is received from user device 160 -B to replace the third character of the word, “T”, with the character “R.”
- the second instruction is received by processor 375 before a request has been transmitted to the user device 160 -B to update that device's visual representation of the word based on the first instruction.
- FIG. 7B is a flowchart depicting a method of updating a visual representation of an object instance in accordance with an embodiment.
- a determination is made as to whether a first result of applying of a first change to an object instance followed by applying a second change to the object instance is the same as a second result of applying the second change followed by applying the first change to the object instance.
- processor 375 determines that application of the first change followed by application of the second change results in the character string “CHRT”, while application of the second change followed by application of the first change results in the character string “CHAR,” and that these two results are different. Therefore, requesting that the user devices to apply the first change and the second change may result in inconsistent visual representations on the users' devices (if, for example, user devices 160 -A and 160 -B apply the changes in a different order).
- a first transformed operation and a second transformed operation are determined such that a first transformed result of applying the first transformed operation to the object instance followed by application of the second transformed operation to the object instance is the same as a second result of applying the second transformed operation to the object instance followed by application of the first transformed operation to the object instance.
- Processor 375 accordingly transforms the two changes into a pair of transformed operations: a first transformed operation to replace the first character “C” of the word with the characters “CH,” and a second transformed operation to replace the fourth character “T” of the word object instance with the character “R” (instead of replacing the third character).
- Application of the first transformed operation followed by the second transformed operation produces the same result as application of the second transformed followed by the first transformed operation.
- a visual representation of the object instance is updated based on the first transformed operation and the second transformed operation. Accordingly, collaborative development service 130 transmits to user device 160 -A and to user device 160 -B respective requests to apply the first and second transformed operations to object instance 874 .
- User devices 160 -A and 160 -B receive the requests and apply operational transformation rules 333 to determine which of the requests to apply and which to disregard. If a user device receives from collaborative development service 130 a request to perform a change that it has already performed, the user device disregards the request. Therefore, for example, user device 160 -A disregards the request to replace the first character “C” of the word object instance with the characters “CH.” User device 160 -A therefore applies the second requested operation (to replace the fourth character “T” of the word object instance with the character “R”).
- User device 160 -B also applies operational transformation rules 333 to determine which of the two requests to apply and which to disregard. Because user device 160 -B has replaced the third character of the word object instance “T” with the character “R,” user device 160 -B adds an additional operation to reverse the edit to the third character, and then applies the first and second requested operations to the word.
- a first instruction is received from a first device to insert text of length X at the beginning of a word object instance of length Y
- a second instruction is received from a second device to insert text at the end of the object instance (after the Yth alphanumeric character)
- Processor 375 uses operational transformation rules 333 , transforms the two changes to a pair of transformed operations: a first transformed operation to insert the first text at the beginning of the word object instance, and a second transformed operation to insert the second text after the (X+Y)th alphanumeric character of the word object instance.
- Requests to perform the transformed operations are transmitted to both devices. This example is discussed further in the illustrative embodiment described below.
- a first user wishing to edit text document 410 , employs user device 160 -A to access software application 400 via collaborative development service 130 , and accesses text document 410 . While editing document 410 , the first user types the word “brown.”
- a word object instance 874 is generated, including an ordered list 857 and instance data 878 .
- Word object instance 874 is displayed on display 270 of user device 160 -A.
- browser 210 of user device 160 -A may display word object instance 874 on a web page 871 , as shown in FIG. 8A .
- Word object instance 874 is also displayed on user device 160 -B on a web page 891 similar to web page 871 , as shown in FIG. 8B .
- a transformed operation is determined based on the changes, and a request is transmitted to a user device to update a visual representation of the object instance based on the transformed operation.
- a plurality of transformed instructions may be determined such that application of the transformed instructions, in any order, results in consistent visual representations of the object instance on the plurality of user devices.
- FIG. 9 is a flowchart of a method to update a visual representation of an object instance in accordance with an embodiment.
- a first instruction specifying a first change to an object instance is received from a first device.
- the first user inserts the text “quick” ( 951 ) at the beginning of word object instance 874 .
- Browser 270 of user device 160 -A displays the text “quickbrown,” as shown in FIG. 10A , and transmits to collaborative development service 130 an instruction to insert the text “quick” at the beginning of word object instance 874 .
- Collaborative development service 130 receives the instruction from user device 160 -A.
- a second instruction specifying a second change to the object instance is received from a second device.
- the second user inserts the text “fox” ( 953 ) after the fifth alphanumeric character of word object instance 874 .
- Browser 270 of user device 160 -A displays the text “brownfox,” as shown in FIG. 10B , and transmits to collaborative development service 130 an instruction to insert the text “fox” after the fifth alphanumeric character of word object instance 874 .
- Collaborative development service 130 receives the instruction from user device 160 -A.
- the first and second instructions are received by processor 375 substantially simultaneously (before any request has been transmitted to either user device to update a visual representation of the object instance).
- Processor 375 examines the first change and the second change to determine whether the result of applying the first change followed by the second change is the same as the result of applying the second change followed by the first change. In the illustrative example, the results are different. Accordingly, processor 375 determines that a set of transformed operations is required.
- a transformed operation is determined based on the first change and the second change.
- Processor 375 generates a first transformed operation to insert the text “quick” at the beginning of word object instance 874 , and a second transformed operation to insert the text “fox” after the tenth alphanumeric character of word object instance 874 .
- the result of applying the first transformed operation followed by the second transformed operation is the same as the result of applying the second transformed operation followed by the first transformed operation.
- a visual representation of the object instance is updated based on the transformed operation.
- Collaborative development service 130 transmits a first request to user device 160 -A to perform the first and second transformed operations, and a second request to user device 160 -B to perform the first and second transformed operations.
- User device 160 -A receives the request and, in response, redraws object instance 874 to effect the first and second transformed operations.
- User devices 160 -B also receives the request and, in response, redraws object instance 874 to effect the first and second transformed operations.
- FIG. 11A shows updated word object instance 874 displayed on web page 871 , displayed on user device 160 -A.
- FIG. 11B shows updated word object instance 874 displayed on web page 891 , displayed on user device 160 -B.
- collaborative development service 130 receives instructions from user devices 160 , identifies conflicting changes to a document, determines any necessary transformed operations, and transmits to the user devices requests to apply the transformed operations to the devices' respective visual representations of the document, in real-time, or substantially in real-time, to provide to users a real-time collaborative editing experience.
- collaborative development service 130 thus stores instructions as they are received from user devices 160 .
- Collaborative development service 130 from time to time processes a batch of instructions, identifies conflicting changes to a document, determines any necessary transformed operations, and transmits to the user devices requests to apply the transformed operations to the devices' respective visual representations of the document.

- each time user device 160 transmits to collaborative development service 130 an instruction to make a change to a particular object instance user device 160 also stores transiently in memory a reverse instruction in a stack data structure.
- the most recent reverse instruction is retrieved from the stack and applied to the visual representation of the object instance on the user's particular user device. In this manner, a user may undo his or her own most recent change without affecting changes made by other users.
- a user may selectively undo a change that he or she made within a document (even if the change is not the most recent change made by the user), without affecting any other change.

- Collaborative development service 130 provides a platform for developers to create and edit a software application. After the software application has been developed, the software application may be maintained at a third party web site, such as third party web site 112 , for example. In one embodiment, collaborative development service 130 is implemented using software residing on a server, for example.
- third party website 112 is associated with an address, such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
- a link representing the URL may be placed in advertisements or on selected webpages to facilitate the use of the third party software application by end users. A user wishing to access the third party software application may do so by clicking on the link associated with the URL, for example.
- collaborative development service 130 executes the third party software application and allows the user to access functionality of the software application via an embedded frame displayed on the user's device.

- These data models are operational transformation ready, highly customizable and provide built-in support for developer-defined operations.
- These data models also provide built-in support for other features such as those described above (e.g., undo/redo, etc.).
- FIG. 16B is a flowchart of a method of providing collaborative development service in accordance with an embodiment.
- the method starts.
- a developer creates a data model and constructs a third party application in a manner such as that described above.
- the developer then provides a URL to users who wish to access the third party application.
- the users select the third party application (e.g., by clicking on the URL) and execute the application.
- Collaborative development service 130 causes the third party software application to be executed and provides access to the application via an embedded frame.
- the users may create a document using the application which is embedded as an IFrame on a webpage.
- the users interact with collaborative development service 130 via the embedded IFrame, using interframe communication through a parent frame.
- a determination is made whether substantially simultaneous instructions have been received from two or more users to change data in the document. If not, the method ends, at step 1610 . If yes, transformation operational rules are applied to the instructions, at step 1606 .
- collaborative development service 130 is updated, and requests are sent to the users' browsers to reflect the updates to the data.
- updates to the data are displayed within embedded IFrame in each user's display.
- a determination is made whether or not the users wish to make additional changes in the document. If so, the process returns to step 1605 . If not, the process ends at step 1610 .

- a developer may enter code in region 1709 .
- the developer inputs code 1704 to create a portion of the data model.
- Other code may be input anywhere in 1709 .
- the coding portion 1704 and/or 1709 may be displayed within a portion of an application and the application may provide menu buttons such as compile button 1705 .
- An example of code that may be used is shown in FIG. 17B .
- the code shown is for exemplary purposes; any coding language and/or technique may be used.
- the code may contain comments enclosed in between “//” or blocks of text enclosed in “/* */” characters, as is known.
- the data model code may also contain a package specifier indicating the closure package to which each data type in the file should be assigned when the file is compiled and data type stanzas consisting of an optional list of @prefixed annotations, a data type name, followed by a pair of braces enclosing a list of field specifications.
- Annotations such as @Root which indicates the root data type, shown by code line 1707 , are supported by the collaborative development service 130 .
- exactly one data type must be marked “@Root” and a compilation warning is displayed specifying a data type that is not reachable from @Root.
- field specifications in the code may consist of a data type, a field name, and a semicolon.
- Acceptable data types include any primitive type name, map, array (optionally parameterized) and any data type name specified in the data model definition.
- Field names and namespaces must be unique across all files in a compilation run.
- Package specifications are merely a convenience for the compiled output.
- Parameterized array data type may be followed by angle brackets containing another data type. This indicates that this array must contain values of a particular type. This may influence the compiler output and adds another level of runtime checking to the compiled code.
- the compiler may accept 0 or more data model files.
- the compiler may also accept a compressed collection of 0 or more data model files and in return, produce a compressed list of outputs.
- the compiler produces the standard outputs as shown in FIG. 17C . These outputs are discussed below.
- Output 1710 represents my.datamodel.DatamodelManager, which is a standard singleton class that provides access to the Root data model object, a data model factory registry (to allow developers to use their own subclasses of generated data model objects), support for developer-defined user operations, and undo/redo support.
- the DatamodelManager is a required constructor parameter for all other compiler-generated data model classes. At least one customized method may be included to have the return type specified in the data model definition.
- Output 1711 represents my.net.CommunicationsManager, which is a standard singleton class that provides hooks for setting up network communication with the collaborative development service 130 and loading the initial data models.
- Output 1712 represents my.datamodel.ChangeEvent, which is the event fired when a datamodel object changes.
- Output 1713 represents my.datamodel.DatamodelObject, which is the base class of all generated data types. This class includes basic capabilities such as event registration and low-level integration with the DatamodelManager.
- Output 1715 represents my.datamodel.ArrayObject, which is a subclass of DatamodelObject used to model unparameterized arrays.
- Output 1716 represents my.datamodel.MapObject, which is a subclass of DatamodelObject used to model maps.
- the compiler may also generate custom files based on a developer's data model definition files. These custom files are described as follows.
- File 1717 represents my.datamodel.ParameterizedArray---parameterType which is a subclass of ArrayObject.
- ParameterType which is a subclass of ArrayObject.
- a parameterized array type is created.
- the methods of ParameterizedArray objects are typed to enforce the proper content type, and they include runtime checking to ensure that only objects of the correct type are inserted into the array.
- File 1718 represents a user-specified data type which is a subclass of DatamodelObject that is created for each user-defined type in the file.
- This file contains getter and setter methods for each field in the data model definition.
- the setter methods are tied into the DatamodelManager, so that whenever a field is “set”, the appropriate mutation is generated, applied to the data model, added to the undo stack, and communicated to the server.
- Every DatamodelObject may support two closure event types:
- the ChangeEvent contains the mutations that represent the change that occurred. Because object graphs can be arbitrarily complex, the DESCENDANT_CHANGED event may have complex behavior. In a cyclic object graph, a change to a parent object may cause a DESCENDANT_CHANGED event to fire.

For example, all or a portion of a document that a user creates or edits may be displayed ondisplay 270. A set ofoperational transformation rules 333 is stored inuser device 160. Operational transformation rules 333 are discussed in more detail below. -
FIG. 3 shows functional components ofcollaborative development service 130 in accordance with an embodiment.Collaborative development service 130 includes aprocessor 375 and amemory 325.Collaborative development service 130 may include other components not shown inFIG. 3 . Operational transformation rules 333 are also stored inmemory 325 ofcollaborative development service 130 as well as inuser device 160. - In accordance with the embodiment of
FIG. 1 ,collaborative development service 130 provides an object-oriented software development architecture that allows developers to create software applications based on data models. In particular,collaborative development service 130 provides access to three basic data types for use in constructing a data model: ordered lists (arrays), maps, and primitives.Collaborative development service 130 supports several primitive types, including, without limitation, float, integer, Boolean, string, and date. A developer may generate an object using lists, maps, and primitives, and may further create a data model that includes one or more objects. The data models created in this manner may be used to create a software application relating to a variety of content types, including, without limitation, word processing applications, spreadsheet applications, drawing tools, photo or image editing applications, video editing applications, design tools, software development tools, audio or music editing applications, games, software applications having a shared user space, etc. - In accordance with an embodiment, a data model is a rooted tree, where nodes are either maps or ordered lists, and leaves are primitive values. Any node in the tree can be specified using an ordered list, referred to as a “target path,” of key names and array indices. A software application developed using
collaborative development service 130 has a single root data model object, referred to as the root map. All application-specific data is nested inside the root map. - In accordance with an embodiment,
collaborative development service 130 supports two operations for the instantiation and deletion of non-primitive objects, two operations on array data, and one operation on map data. The supported operations, or mutations, are described below. - CreateObject(String id, String typeName): Creates an empty object of the given type with the given id. The typeName may be a user-defined type name or one of the built-in types like “Map” or “Array”.
- DeleteObject(String id): Deletes an object with the given id. All references to an object must be removed before an object can be deleted. Mutations that refer to a deleted object are transformed to nothing. If an object deletion is undone, the reverse mutation includes all mutations necessary to fully reconstruct the deleted object.
- Update(TargetPath path, Object value|ObjectReference objectId): Replaces a key in a map or an index of an array with the given primitive value or object reference. If the value is null, the key is deleted entirely. Array indices are updated using the Update( ) mutation.
- InsertBefore(TargetPath path, Object value|ObjectReference objectId): Inserts a primitive value or an object reference into an ordered list before a given index. All higher-indexed values in the list are shifted to the right.
- Delete(TargetPath path): Deletes a value from an array. All higher-indexed values in the list are shifted to the left.
- In accordance with an embodiment, a developer may begin building an application by writing a data model definition file.
Collaborative development service 130 provides a compiler service that compiles the data model definition file to generate a collection of Javascript files that represent the user's data model. The developer may code against this API. - Accordingly, a developer employing
user device 160 or other processing device may accesscollaborative development service 130 vianetwork 105 and define one or more objects based on ordered lists, maps, and primitives. A developer may further construct a data model based on the objects built from the lists, maps, and primitives. For example, a data model may include a word object having an ordered list of alphanumeric characters defining a word, an image object having an ordered list of pixel values defining an image, a line graph object having an ordered list of values to be plotted, etc. A data model may include other types of objects built from the lists, maps, and primitives provided, such as a paragraph object, a spreadsheet column object, a line object, a rectangle object, etc. - A developer may then create a software application based on the data model. After a software application is created, the software application may be maintained at third
party web site 112, for example. A user of the software application may access the software application viacollaborative development service 130 and create a document. The user may then create an instance of an object, or object instance, within the document by defining the characteristics of the object. For example, supposing that software application defines a word object that includes an ordered list of alphanumeric characters, a user may create a document and generate an instance of the word object by typing a word, thereby specifying the alphanumeric characters within the list. The user may also specify other characteristics of the word object instance such as the font, size, etc. - Suppose, for example, that a developer associated with
third party website 112 accessescollaborative development service 130 and creates a data model that includes a word object. The data model (including the word object) is stored inmemory 325 asdata model 450 andword object 455, as shown inFIG. 3 . The developer then develops a software application based on the data model, and maintains the software application (indicated inFIG. 1 as software application 400) atthird party website 112. In the illustrative embodiment,software application 400 is created for use in relation to a word processing application, and enables users to create and edit text documents.Software application 400 may include other word processing functions. For example,software application 400 may enable a user to create a paragraph (an instance of a paragraph object), a footnote (an instance of a footnote object), etc. - In accordance with an embodiment, after
software application 400 is placed at thirdparty web site 112, a user may accesssoftware application 400 viacollaborative development platform 130 anduse software application 400 to create and/or edit a document. Suppose, for example, that a user accesses his or her account atcollaborative development service 130 and accessessoftware application 400, by clicking on a link on a web page, or by selecting an option from a menu, for example. Suppose further that the user employssoftware application 400 to create a text document. In the illustrative embodiment ofFIG. 3 , the user's document is stored inmemory 325 asdocument 410. - Suppose now that the user uses
software application 400 to editdocument 410. In particular, the user types text withindocument 410, including one or more words. When the user types a word,collaborative development service 130 generates an instance ofword object 455 by defining an ordered list containing the alphanumeric characters specified by the user, and by specifying any other associated characteristics of the word. Supposing, for example, that the user types the alphanumeric characters “helloworld,”collaborative development service 130 generates within document 410 aword object instance 424 which includes an orderedlist 407 containing the alphanumeric characters “helloworld,” as shown inFIG. 4B . - Referring to
FIG. 4A ,word object instance 424 also includesinstance data 428 which includes various types of data related to word objectinstance 424.Instance data 428 includes text layout information specifying the layout of the text defined by orderedlist 407, such as numbered spacers corresponding to the relative location of each of the characters in the text.Object instance 424 may include other types of information not shown inFIG. 4B . - In other embodiments, layout information relating to an object instance may be stored separately from the object instance itself. For example, such data may be stored in a database, table, or in another type of data structure.
- A well-known technique used to display information on a user device includes transmitting data adapted to cause the user device to display all or a portion of the information on a Web page. For example,
collaborative development service 130 may transmit to browser 210 (of user device 160) a request, in the form of HyperText Markup Language (HTML), adapted to causebrowser 210 to display a representation ofword object instance 424. In response,browser 210 displays a representation ofobject instance 424.FIG. 5 shows aweb page 591 on which word objectinstance 424 is displayed as part of a text document, in accordance with an embodiment. - In an embodiment, an object instance may be updated based on one or more instructions received from users. For example, an instruction to add a letter to the end of
word object instance 424 may be received from a user employing auser device 160. In response,collaborative development service 130 modifiesword object instance 424, and then transmits a request touser device 160 to redrawword object instance 424 ondisplay 270 to effect the change in the visual representation of the word object instance. In response to the request,user device 160 redrawsword object instance 424 ondisplay 270 to reflect the change. - In accordance with an embodiment,
collaborative development service 130 maintains a record of all user activities and revisions related to a particular document in a user activity table, and enables users to view activity and/or revision history pertaining to the particular document.FIG. 4B shows an example of an activity table that may be associated withdocument 410 in accordance with an embodiment. Activity table 428 includes acolumn 434, which indicates a date and time of an activity perform by a user, such as accessing or leaving a document, or making a revision to the document. Activity table 428 includes acolumn 436 identifying the user who performed the activity.Column 438 describes the activity performed by the user, such as entering or leaving a document, or making a change to the document. For example,row 451 indicates thatUser 1 performed a first activity,Activity 1, at MM/DD/YYYY at 12:01:01. Row 452 contains data related to a second activity performed byUser 2 at MM/DD/YYYY at 12:03:05. In this example, activity table 428 is stored inmemory 325, as shown inFIG. 3 . - In accordance with an embodiment,
collaborative development service 130 utilizes fundamental edits to provide editing features. The fundamental edits correspond to the smallest changes that may be made to an object instance, and may be utilized in various combinations to provide all of the possible editing functions provided bycollaborative development service 130. The fundamental edits may vary by content type. For example, fundamental edits for a word processing editor may include inserting a character, deleting a character, applying a style, inserting an entity (e.g., a numbered list), and updating an entity. Fundamental edits for a drawing tool may include moving an object one pixel in a given direction, deleting an object, etc. - As fundamental edits are applied to an object instance, activity table 428 is updated such that a revision history, including a running collection of applied changes, is maintained.
- Combinations of two or more fundamental edits may be referred to as a command. As such, commands correspond to modifications that make use of two or more fundamental edits. For example, an “Insert Column in Table” command may utilize multiple “insert character” fundamental edits, and may also utilize multiple “apply style” fundamental edits to insert a column into a table within a document.
- When instructions requesting multiple fundamental edits with respect to a particular object instance are received from a
user device 160,collaborative development service 130 applies each requested fundamental edit to the object instance in response to instructions. However, rather than sending to user device 160 a separate request to redraw the visual representation of the object instance after applying each fundamental edit to the object instance,collaborative development service 130 instead determines an efficient redraw approach that reduces the number of redraws required. For example,collaborative development service 130 may analyze the instance data associated with the object instance, including layout data, and/or revision history data within activity table 428 indicating multiple fundamental edits performed during execution of a command, and based on such information, merge several fundamental edits or otherwise reduce the number of redraws needed to render the changes as compared to the number of fundamental edits that have actually been applied to the object instance. A request is then transmitted to one or more user devices to redraw the object instance to effect the changes in the visual representation of the object instance. - In one example, following either a full or partial completion of an instruction pertaining to an instance of a text object (a word object, a paragraph object, etc), the instance data (including updated layout data) and the revision history data within activity table 428 may be analyzed to determine which alphanumeric characters, lines, or sections of the document have been affected. In a specific example, when a command includes a first fundamental edit that is applied to a particular alphanumeric character, and a second fundamental edit that supersedes the first fundamental edit (e.g., a letter “g” is typed, and then a letter “p” is typed in the same position), a redraw approach may be determined that eliminates the first fundamental edit. In another example, fundamental edits that affect adjacent alphanumeric characters may be merged.
- A request is transmitted to one or
more user devices 160 to redraw the visual representation of the updated object instance, thereby efficiently redrawing the object instance onuser device 160 using a reduced number of redraws (e.g., by combining two or more of the redraws into a single redraw). In such a manner, the number of redraws that are used to redraw the visual representation of the object instance is less than the number of fundamental edits that were performed as part of the command. Examples of systems, methods and apparatus for determining a redraw approach using a reduced number of required redraws to render an updated object instance are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/006,259, entitled “Merging Electronic Document Redraws,” filed Jan. 13, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference. - In accordance with an embodiment, a plurality of instructions specifying respective changes to an object instance are received from a
user device 160 and applied to the object instance. An efficient redraw approach reflecting the requested changes is then determined. An instruction to implement the redraw approach is then transmitted to theuser device 160. Theuser device 160 redraws the object instance based on the instruction. - While the discussion herein uses examples relating to text documents and word object instances, the methods and systems described herein may be applicable to determine a redraw approach for object instances related to a variety of content types, including, without limitation, spreadsheets, drawings, photographs, images, videos, designs, music, software code, games, a software application having a suitable shared user space, etc.
- For example, one approach to reducing the number of redraws applied to an object instance relates to adjacent character insertions in a collaborative typing context. For example, when a user who wishes to edit
text document 410 requests a first character insertion, and then requests a second character insertion adjacent to the first (e.g., a first requested operation is to insert the characters “ab” at a given location, and a second requested operation is to insert characters “cd” adjacent to the inserted characters), a non-optimized redraw approach may include performing two separate redraws of the line—first to redraw the line with the characters “ab” inserted at the appropriate location, and then to redraw the line with the characters “cd” inserted at the appropriate location. However, in accordance with an embodiment, the insertions are merged such that the insertions are achieved by a single redraw of the text. A request to redraw the object instance in this manner is transmitted touser device 160, and a single redraw is performed. - Returning to the illustrative embodiment, suppose that a user employing a
user device 160 accesses objectinstance 424 and begins to edit the object instance. For example, the user may generate instructions to edit the object by pressing a key on a keyboard, or by pushing a button on a computer mouse, etc. Instructions reflecting the user's changes are transmitted tocollaborative development service 130 byuser devices 160. -
FIG. 6 is an illustration of several changes made by the user to objectinstance 424 in accordance with an embodiment. The top row ofboxes instance 424 desired by the user, which are specified by instructions received from the user. The bottom row ofboxes instance 424 bycollaborative development service 130 in response to the user's instructions. -
Box 605 showsword object instance 424 before an instruction is received.Box 625 showslist 407, and also showstext layout information 411, which includes a portion ofinstance data 428 that pertains to the layout of the text. Numbered spacer “00” corresponds to the first letter inlist 407, “h”, and numbered spacer “07” corresponds to the eighth letter inlist 407, “r”, etc. - A first instruction specifying a first desired change to the object instance is received from
user device 160. Referring tobox 610, the user inserts the characters “my” after the “hello” text and before the “world” text.User device 160 transmits a request to make the desired change. Referring tobox 630, the insertion is represented inlayout information 411 as the insertion of two additional spacers following the fifth spacer (numbered “04”), which corresponds to the last character in “hello,” and renumbering the remaining spacers accordingly to accommodate the two inserted characters. - User activity table 428 (shown in
FIG. 4B ) is also updated to specifically identify the change, and the date and time the change was requested. Activity table 428 is further updated to identify the user ofuser device 160 as the source of the instruction. - In the illustrative embodiment, the user transmits an additional instruction to modify the text further by inserting the characters “hi” between the “m” and the “y” characters that were previously inserted, as shown in
box 615. Referring tobox 635, inlayout information 411 the second insertion is merged with the first insertion rather than being handled separately. As such, inlayout information 411 the change is represented as an insertion of four characters after the “hello” text and before the “world” text. The two insertions are represented as the insertion of four additional spacers following the fifth spacer (number “04”), and renumbering the remaining spacers accordingly. - An instruction is now received from the user to modify
word object instance 424 by applying an “underline” style to the “llomhiywor” text, as shown inbox 620. Referring tobox 640,layout information 411 is modified to convey that the “underline” style should be applied to spacers numbered “02” through “11”, and therefore, that the range of spacers numbered “02” through “11” should be updated. - Activity table 428 is updated to specifically identify these changes, and the date and time the change were requested. Activity table 428 is further updated to identify the user of
user device 160 as the source of the instructions. - A redraw approach is now determined based on the changes made to object
instance 424. In the illustrative embodiment,layout information 411 indicates that the range of spacers number “02” through “13” should be updated in a single operation to effect the changes made to objectinstance 424. - The optimized redraw approach is used to update the visual representation of the object instance is updated on
user device 160.Collaborative development service 130 transmits a request touser device 160 to update the visual representation ofobject instance 424 by redrawing the range of spacers numbered “02” through “11” to effect the changes specified in the modifiedinstance data 428. In the illustrative embodiment, the request directsuser device 160 to complete the changes by performing a single redraw, instead of three redraws. In response,user device 160 performs a single redraw in accordance with the request to effect the specified changes. - In accordance with an embodiment,
collaborative development service 130 may receive, substantially simultaneously, from a plurality of user devices, multiple instructions specifying respective changes to an object instance. In response,collaborative development service 130 usesoperational transformation rules 333 to determine, for each respective user device, a transformed instruction, or set of transformed instructions, to cause the user device to display the changed object instance accurately and consistently, and transmits the transformed instruction(s) to the respective user device. - Referring again to
FIG. 3 ,operational transformation rules 333 include rules governing the modification of an object instance, and the redrawing of the visual representations of the object instance on multiple user devices, when multiple changes are made to the object instance. In one embodiment,operational transformation rules 333 resolve conflicting changes specified in a plurality of instructions received from a plurality of user devices. When a plurality of instructions received from a plurality of user devices specify conflicting changes to a document that may create inconsistent visual representations of the document across the respective user devices, one or more operational transformations are applied to generate one or more transformed operations operable to reflect the specified changes in a consistent manner in the visual representations displayed on the respective devices. In particular, the rules apply a logic that contextualizes the changes specified by multiple instructions to determine a resolution that will result in a consistent visual representation of a document or object instance across multiple devices, without creating a collision (such as a temporal paradox or a race condition). In one embodiment, operational transformations are applied to instructions received from user devices in real-time or substantially in real-time, to enable the respective user devices to update the respective visual representations of the document in real-time or substantially in real-time. - Referring to
FIG. 3 ,processor 375 examines instructions received fromrespective user devices 160 and selectively appliesoperational transformation rules 333 to determine transformed operations. In an embodiment,processor 375, in accordance withoperational transformation rules 333, examines a first instruction P (received from a first device) specifying a first change to an object instance, and a second instruction Q (received from a second device) specifying a second change to the object instance, and determines a set of transformed operations (P′,Q′) in accordance with the following transformation rule: -
T(P,Q)->P′,Q′ such that P*Q′==Q*P′ (Rule 1) - The application of
Transformation Rule 1 is described in the illustrative embodiments discussed below. - Suppose, for purposes of illustration, that a first user employing user device 160-A, uses
collaborative development service 130 to accesssoftware application 400, and accessesdocument 410. A second user employing user device 160-B, simultaneously accessesdocument 410 in the same manner. The first user types the word “CAT” withindocument 410. Referring toFIG. 4A , a word object instance 703 (including orderedlist 705 and instance data 706) is created withindocument 410.Word object instance 703 is viewed by the first and second users via web pages displayed on user device 160-A and user device 160-B, such asweb page 707 shown inFIG. 7A . - The first and second users now wish to collaboratively edit the word “CAT.”
Processor 375 receives from user device 160-A a first instruction, reflecting a change made by the first user, to replace the first character “C” of a word object instance “CAT” with the characters “CH.” A second instruction, reflecting a change made by the second user, is received from user device 160-B to replace the third character of the word, “T”, with the character “R.” The second instruction is received byprocessor 375 before a request has been transmitted to the user device 160-B to update that device's visual representation of the word based on the first instruction. -
FIG. 7B is a flowchart depicting a method of updating a visual representation of an object instance in accordance with an embodiment. Atstep 710, a determination is made as to whether a first result of applying of a first change to an object instance followed by applying a second change to the object instance is the same as a second result of applying the second change followed by applying the first change to the object instance. In the illustrative embodiment,processor 375 determines that application of the first change followed by application of the second change results in the character string “CHRT”, while application of the second change followed by application of the first change results in the character string “CHAR,” and that these two results are different. Therefore, requesting that the user devices to apply the first change and the second change may result in inconsistent visual representations on the users' devices (if, for example, user devices 160-A and 160-B apply the changes in a different order). - If the first result and the second result are the same, there is no need to determine a transformed operation. If however, it is determined that the first result is different from the second result, then, at
step 720, a first transformed operation and a second transformed operation are determined such that a first transformed result of applying the first transformed operation to the object instance followed by application of the second transformed operation to the object instance is the same as a second result of applying the second transformed operation to the object instance followed by application of the first transformed operation to the object instance.Processor 375 accordingly transforms the two changes into a pair of transformed operations: a first transformed operation to replace the first character “C” of the word with the characters “CH,” and a second transformed operation to replace the fourth character “T” of the word object instance with the character “R” (instead of replacing the third character). Application of the first transformed operation followed by the second transformed operation produces the same result as application of the second transformed followed by the first transformed operation. - At
step 730, a visual representation of the object instance is updated based on the first transformed operation and the second transformed operation. Accordingly,collaborative development service 130 transmits to user device 160-A and to user device 160-B respective requests to apply the first and second transformed operations to objectinstance 874. - User devices 160-A and 160-B receive the requests and apply
operational transformation rules 333 to determine which of the requests to apply and which to disregard. If a user device receives from collaborative development service 130 a request to perform a change that it has already performed, the user device disregards the request. Therefore, for example, user device 160-A disregards the request to replace the first character “C” of the word object instance with the characters “CH.” User device 160-A therefore applies the second requested operation (to replace the fourth character “T” of the word object instance with the character “R”). - User device 160-B also applies
operational transformation rules 333 to determine which of the two requests to apply and which to disregard. Because user device 160-B has replaced the third character of the word object instance “T” with the character “R,” user device 160-B adds an additional operation to reverse the edit to the third character, and then applies the first and second requested operations to the word. - In another example, suppose that a first instruction is received from a first device to insert text of length X at the beginning of a word object instance of length Y, and a second instruction is received from a second device to insert text at the end of the object instance (after the Yth alphanumeric character), before any request has been transmitted to update the visual representation of the word object instance based on the first instruction.
Processor 375, usingoperational transformation rules 333, transforms the two changes to a pair of transformed operations: a first transformed operation to insert the first text at the beginning of the word object instance, and a second transformed operation to insert the second text after the (X+Y)th alphanumeric character of the word object instance. Requests to perform the transformed operations are transmitted to both devices. This example is discussed further in the illustrative embodiment described below. - Suppose now that a first user, wishing to edit
text document 410, employs user device 160-A to accesssoftware application 400 viacollaborative development service 130, and accessestext document 410. Whileediting document 410, the first user types the word “brown.” Referring toFIG. 4A , aword object instance 874 is generated, including an orderedlist 857 andinstance data 878.Word object instance 874 is displayed ondisplay 270 of user device 160-A. For example,browser 210 of user device 160-A may displayword object instance 874 on aweb page 871, as shown inFIG. 8A . - Suppose now that a second user, employing user device 160-B, wishing to edit
document 410 in collaboration with the first user, accessessoftware application 400 viacollaborative development service 130, and accessesdocument 410.Word object instance 874 is also displayed on user device 160-B on aweb page 891 similar toweb page 871, as shown inFIG. 8B . - In accordance with an embodiment, when instructions are received from a plurality of user devices specifying a plurality of changes to an object instance, a transformed operation is determined based on the changes, and a request is transmitted to a user device to update a visual representation of the object instance based on the transformed operation. In one embodiment, a plurality of transformed instructions may be determined such that application of the transformed instructions, in any order, results in consistent visual representations of the object instance on the plurality of user devices.
-
FIG. 9 is a flowchart of a method to update a visual representation of an object instance in accordance with an embodiment. Atstep 910, a first instruction specifying a first change to an object instance is received from a first device. Referring toFIG. 10A , the first user inserts the text “quick” (951) at the beginning ofword object instance 874.Browser 270 of user device 160-A displays the text “quickbrown,” as shown inFIG. 10A , and transmits tocollaborative development service 130 an instruction to insert the text “quick” at the beginning ofword object instance 874.Collaborative development service 130 receives the instruction from user device 160-A. - At step 920, a second instruction specifying a second change to the object instance is received from a second device. Referring to
FIG. 10B , the second user inserts the text “fox” (953) after the fifth alphanumeric character ofword object instance 874.Browser 270 of user device 160-A displays the text “brownfox,” as shown inFIG. 10B , and transmits tocollaborative development service 130 an instruction to insert the text “fox” after the fifth alphanumeric character ofword object instance 874.Collaborative development service 130 receives the instruction from user device 160-A. The first and second instructions are received byprocessor 375 substantially simultaneously (before any request has been transmitted to either user device to update a visual representation of the object instance). -
Processor 375 examines the first change and the second change to determine whether the result of applying the first change followed by the second change is the same as the result of applying the second change followed by the first change. In the illustrative example, the results are different. Accordingly,processor 375 determines that a set of transformed operations is required. - At
step 930, a transformed operation is determined based on the first change and the second change.Processor 375 generates a first transformed operation to insert the text “quick” at the beginning ofword object instance 874, and a second transformed operation to insert the text “fox” after the tenth alphanumeric character ofword object instance 874. The result of applying the first transformed operation followed by the second transformed operation is the same as the result of applying the second transformed operation followed by the first transformed operation. - At
step 940, a visual representation of the object instance is updated based on the transformed operation.Collaborative development service 130 transmits a first request to user device 160-A to perform the first and second transformed operations, and a second request to user device 160-B to perform the first and second transformed operations. User device 160-A receives the request and, in response, redrawsobject instance 874 to effect the first and second transformed operations. User devices 160-B also receives the request and, in response, redrawsobject instance 874 to effect the first and second transformed operations.FIG. 11A shows updatedword object instance 874 displayed onweb page 871, displayed on user device 160-A.FIG. 11B shows updatedword object instance 874 displayed onweb page 891, displayed on user device 160-B. - In accordance with an embodiment, the methods described above are performed in real-time or substantially in real-time. Thus,
collaborative development service 130 receives instructions fromuser devices 160, identifies conflicting changes to a document, determines any necessary transformed operations, and transmits to the user devices requests to apply the transformed operations to the devices' respective visual representations of the document, in real-time, or substantially in real-time, to provide to users a real-time collaborative editing experience. - In another embodiment, changes made by users may be processed in batch. Thus,
collaborative development service 130 thus stores instructions as they are received fromuser devices 160.Collaborative development service 130 from time to time processes a batch of instructions, identifies conflicting changes to a document, determines any necessary transformed operations, and transmits to the user devices requests to apply the transformed operations to the devices' respective visual representations of the document. - The methods and systems described herein advantageously allow users of an online document processing service, and particularly users who wish to employ a third party software application to create and develop a document of any content type, to collaboratively develop and edit the document in real-time. Unlike existing methods and systems, the methods and systems described herein transform changes made by multiple users and display the changes on multiple devices in a consistent manner while avoiding collisions. Furthermore, the changes are displayed on multiple devices in real-time, allowing each user to view not only his or her own changes to the document, but also changes made by other users, in real-time.
- In accordance with an embodiment, the redraw optimization methods described above may be combined with the operational transformation methods described above to transform various instructions received from users to generate one or more transformed operations, and then to determine an efficient redraw approach for redrawing an object instance to reflect the one or more transformed operations.
- In accordance with an embodiment, a user who has made a change to a particular object instance may select an undo option to reverse the change. For example, a user may select an undo option from a drop-down menu displayed on
display 270 ofuser device 160. - In one embodiment, each
time user device 160 transmits tocollaborative development service 130 an instruction to make a change to a particular object instance,user device 160 also stores transiently in memory a reverse instruction in a stack data structure. When the user selects the undo option, the most recent reverse instruction is retrieved from the stack and applied to the visual representation of the object instance on the user's particular user device. In this manner, a user may undo his or her own most recent change without affecting changes made by other users. In another embodiment, a user may selectively undo a change that he or she made within a document (even if the change is not the most recent change made by the user), without affecting any other change. - A redo option is also available to re-apply a change that has been reversed by the selection of the undo option.
- In accordance with an embodiment, a user viewing a document may view a list of revisions made to the document. Referring to
FIG. 12 , for example, auser viewing document 410 on aweb page 1285 may press a button on a computer mouse to cause amenu 1260 to appear. In this example,menu 1260 includes arevision history option 1267. When the user selectsrevision history option 1267,collaborative development service 130 accesses activity table 428 and retrieves information relating to revisions made to document 410.Collaborative development service 130 causesuser device 160 to display the document and the document's revision history on a page, such asweb page 1388 shown inFIG. 13 . A portion ofdocument 410 is shown in a left-hand portion ofpage 1388. In a right-hand portion of the page, the document'srevision history 1316 is shown. For example, the information fromrows User 1 andUser 2, respectively, are displayed. - In accordance with an embodiment,
collaborative development service 130 enables users to maintain a comment thread pertaining to a document, while the users are collaboratively editing the document. Referring toFIG. 14 , aweb page 1475 may be displayed on auser device 160. In this example,document 410 is displayed in a left-hand portion of the page. Acomment thread 1450 is displayed in a right-hand portion of the page. In the illustrative embodiment,comment thread 1450 includes afirst comment 1431 generated by a first user and asecond comment 1435 generated by a second user. A user may add a comment to the comment thread by selecting anadd button 1461 and composing a comment. When a new comment is added,comment thread 1450 is updated.Comment thread 1450 is stored inmemory 325, as shown inFIG. 3 . - In various embodiments, the method steps described herein, including the method steps described in

FIG. 15 .Computer 1500 includes aprocessor 1501 operatively coupled to adata storage device 1502 and amemory 1503.Processor 1501 controls the overall operation ofcomputer 1500 by executing computer program instructions that define such operations. The computer program instructions may be stored indata storage device 1502, or other computer readable medium, and loaded intomemory 1503 when execution of the computer program instructions is desired. Thus, the method steps ofFIG. 7B and/orFIG. 9 can be defined by the computer program instructions stored inmemory 1503 and/ordata storage device 1502 and controlled by theprocessor 1501 executing the computer program instructions. For example, the computer program instructions can be implemented as computer executable code programmed by one skilled in the art to perform an algorithm defined by the method steps ofFIG. 7B and/orFIG. 9 . Accordingly, by executing the computer program instructions, theprocessor 1501 executes an algorithm defined by the method steps ofFIG. 7B and/orFIG. 9 .Computer 1500 also includes one ormore network interfaces 1504 for communicating with other devices via a network.Computer 1500 also includes one or more input/output devices 1505 that enable user interaction with computer 1500 (e.g., display, keyboard, mouse, speakers, buttons, etc.). -

FIG. 15 is a high level representation of some of the components of such a computer for illustrative purposes. - In accordance with an embodiment, the systems and methods described above may be used to provide a collaborative development service to software developers and to end users.
Collaborative development service 130 provides a platform for developers to create and edit a software application. After the software application has been developed, the software application may be maintained at a third party web site, such as thirdparty web site 112, for example. In one embodiment,collaborative development service 130 is implemented using software residing on a server, for example. - In one embodiment,
third party website 112 is associated with an address, such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A link representing the URL may be placed in advertisements or on selected webpages to facilitate the use of the third party software application by end users. A user wishing to access the third party software application may do so by clicking on the link associated with the URL, for example. When a user, employing auser device 160, clicks on such a link,collaborative development service 130 executes the third party software application and allows the user to access functionality of the software application via an embedded frame displayed on the user's device. - Multiple users may use the software application to collaboratively create and edit a document.
FIG. 16A is a flowchart of a method for providing collaborative development services in accordance with an embodiment. Atstep 1641,collaborative development service 130 receives, from a plurality of users associated with respective devices, a plurality of inputs associated with a third party software application, via respective embedded frames displayed on the respective devices. Atstep 1644,collaborative development service 130 updates a plurality of visual representations of the document displayed on respective devices to reflect a plurality of inputs substantially in real-time. - In one embodiment, one or more developers may create a software application based on a data model created in a manner such as that described above. The developers may use a pre-built set of data models, mutations, and supporting libraries that may enable them to quickly build highly functional collaborative data models using the collaborative development system platform. These data models are operational transformation ready, highly customizable and provide built-in support for developer-defined operations. These data models also provide built-in support for other features such as those described above (e.g., undo/redo, etc.).
-
FIG. 16B is a flowchart of a method of providing collaborative development service in accordance with an embodiment. Atstep 1601, the method starts. Atstep 1602, a developer creates a data model and constructs a third party application in a manner such as that described above. The developer then provides a URL to users who wish to access the third party application. Atstep 1603, the users select the third party application (e.g., by clicking on the URL) and execute the application.Collaborative development service 130 causes the third party software application to be executed and provides access to the application via an embedded frame. For example, the users may create a document using the application which is embedded as an IFrame on a webpage. Atstep 1604, the users interact withcollaborative development service 130 via the embedded IFrame, using interframe communication through a parent frame. Atstep 1605, a determination is made whether substantially simultaneous instructions have been received from two or more users to change data in the document. If not, the method ends, atstep 1610. If yes, transformation operational rules are applied to the instructions, atstep 1606. Atstep 1607,collaborative development service 130 is updated, and requests are sent to the users' browsers to reflect the updates to the data. Atstep 1608, updates to the data are displayed within embedded IFrame in each user's display. Atstep 1609, a determination is made whether or not the users wish to make additional changes in the document. If so, the process returns to step 1605. If not, the process ends atstep 1610. -
FIG. 17A shows auser interface 1701 that may be used by a developer to construct a software application in accordance with an embodiment. A developer providesinput 1702 in order to build a data model. A developer may enter code inregion 1709. In the illustrative embodiment, thedeveloper inputs code 1704 to create a portion of the data model. Other code may be input anywhere in 1709. Additionally, thecoding portion 1704 and/or 1709 may be displayed within a portion of an application and the application may provide menu buttons such as compilebutton 1705. An example of code that may be used is shown inFIG. 17B . The code shown is for exemplary purposes; any coding language and/or technique may be used. - As indicated by the
code line 1706, the code may contain comments enclosed in between “//” or blocks of text enclosed in “/* */” characters, as is known. The data model code may also contain a package specifier indicating the closure package to which each data type in the file should be assigned when the file is compiled and data type stanzas consisting of an optional list of @prefixed annotations, a data type name, followed by a pair of braces enclosing a list of field specifications. - Annotations such as @Root which indicates the root data type, shown by
code line 1707, are supported by thecollaborative development service 130. In one embodiment, exactly one data type must be marked “@Root” and a compilation warning is displayed specifying a data type that is not reachable from @Root. - In one embodiment, field specifications in the code may consist of a data type, a field name, and a semicolon. Acceptable data types include any primitive type name, map, array (optionally parameterized) and any data type name specified in the data model definition. Field names and namespaces must be unique across all files in a compilation run. Package specifications are merely a convenience for the compiled output. Parameterized array data type may be followed by angle brackets containing another data type. This indicates that this array must contain values of a particular type. This may influence the compiler output and adds another level of runtime checking to the compiled code.
- When the developer wishes to compile the code, he or she may select an option such as “Compile”
button 1705, shown inFIG. 17A . Any compiler may be used to compile the code. In one embodiment, the compiler may accept 0 or more data model files. The compiler may also accept a compressed collection of 0 or more data model files and in return, produce a compressed list of outputs. - In one embodiment, for any collection of inputs, the compiler produces the standard outputs as shown in
FIG. 17C . These outputs are discussed below. -
Output 1710 represents my.datamodel.DatamodelManager, which is a standard singleton class that provides access to the Root data model object, a data model factory registry (to allow developers to use their own subclasses of generated data model objects), support for developer-defined user operations, and undo/redo support. The DatamodelManager is a required constructor parameter for all other compiler-generated data model classes. At least one customized method may be included to have the return type specified in the data model definition. -
Output 1711 represents my.net.CommunicationsManager, which is a standard singleton class that provides hooks for setting up network communication with thecollaborative development service 130 and loading the initial data models. -
Output 1712 represents my.datamodel.ChangeEvent, which is the event fired when a datamodel object changes. -
Output 1713 represents my.datamodel.DatamodelObject, which is the base class of all generated data types. This class includes basic capabilities such as event registration and low-level integration with the DatamodelManager. -
Output 1714 represents my.datamodel.ObjectReference, which is a wrapper object that represents a reference to a non-primitive object. This object=contains the string identification (id) of the referenced object. -
Output 1715 represents my.datamodel.ArrayObject, which is a subclass of DatamodelObject used to model unparameterized arrays. -
Output 1716 represents my.datamodel.MapObject, which is a subclass of DatamodelObject used to model maps. - The compiler may also generate custom files based on a developer's data model definition files. These custom files are described as follows.
-
File 1717 represents my.datamodel.ParameterizedArray---parameterType which is a subclass of ArrayObject. For each parameterized array type in the data model definition file, a parameterized array type is created. The methods of ParameterizedArray objects are typed to enforce the proper content type, and they include runtime checking to ensure that only objects of the correct type are inserted into the array. -
File 1718 represents a user-specified data type which is a subclass of DatamodelObject that is created for each user-defined type in the file. This file contains getter and setter methods for each field in the data model definition. The setter methods are tied into the DatamodelManager, so that whenever a field is “set”, the appropriate mutation is generated, applied to the data model, added to the undo stack, and communicated to the server. Every DatamodelObject may support two closure event types: -
- my.datamodel.ChangeEvent.Type.CHANGED, which fires whenever the object changes, and my.datamodel.ChangeEvent.TypeDESCENDANT_CHANGED, which fires whenever any descendant object changes.
- The ChangeEvent contains the mutations that represent the change that occurred. Because object graphs can be arbitrarily complex, the DESCENDANT_CHANGED event may have complex behavior. In a cyclic object graph, a change to a parent object may cause a DESCENDANT_CHANGED event to fire. This event may only fire once per object per mutation, even if the change affects an object that is a descendant of the target object via multiple paths.
- After the developer compiles a software application, the developer may offer the software application for sale, offer the software application for use, or otherwise make the software application available, to end-users. In one embodiment, a software application may be uploaded onto a third party website, where other users may access it in a manner described below. The software application, a portion of the application, and/or a document created using the application may be embedded within a website or webpage hosted by
collaborative development service 130, in a known manner. For example, a software application may be embedded as an IFrame on the webpage. Other frames and/or applications may be embedded onto the webpage. In one embodiment, the contents of the webpage with the exception of the embedded IFrame are static and/or the same for all applications. The contents may include but are not limited to items such as hyperlinks, menu buttons, graphics, text, etc. Methods of embedding a software application, or a document, as an IFrame on a webpage are known. - When
collaborative development service 130 embeds a third party software application on a webpage, a user may view the application running within the IFrame, and any related documents, on his/her browser. In one embodiment, the application may be a word processing application and the user may create and/or otherwise access a document using the word processing application. In another embodiment, the application may be a music editor and the client may create and/or otherwise access an existing or new notes editor document. The notes editor document may contain many different fields which may be edited by the user. Other types of applications and documents may be used. - In one embodiment, one or more users may access and/or use a third party software application via
collaborative development service 130. For example, a third party software application may be created by one or more developers and made available via a third party website. The developers may, for example, advertise the application on the third party website or webpage. In another embodiment, the third party software application, or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) associated with the software application, may be listed, or otherwise made available for purchase or use, in a software application store available online. A user may access the third party software application by clicking on a URL associated with the application, for example. In one embodiment, when a user(s) employing auser device 160 clicks or otherwise accesses the URL, the user(s) is/are directed to a webpage hosted bycollaborative development service 130. -
FIG. 18 shows a thirdparty software application 1801 embedded on awebpage 1822, which may be displayed on auser device 160. The user(s) may use thethird party application 1801 to create adocument 1802, which may be displayed to the users in the same embedded IFrame or in a second IFrame on the webpage hosted bycollaborative development service 130. In one embodiment,document 1802 may be visible to the users whilethird party application 1801 may be running in the background and thus invisible to the users. Therefore,third party application 1801 illustrated in the figures may or may not be visible to a user. - In one embodiment, when the user clicks on a URL associated with the third party software application, the user downloads the application or otherwise loads the application onto his/her user device. The application may then be represented as an icon, or appear as a new menu item in a list of items on a webpage hosted by the
collaborative development service 130. The webpage may list, for example, all applications purchased and/or downloaded by the user. The application is loaded onto the user's browser as an embedded IFrame in a manner such as that described above, and a document created using the application may be accessed by the user at anytime using any one or combination of a number of devices having access to the Internet. - In an embodiment illustrated in
FIG. 19A ,collaborative development service 130 communicates with a user'sbrowser window 1903, which displays a parent webpage 1907 (the parent frame) and an embeddedIFrame 1902. In one embodiment, the webpage is hosted oncollaborative development service 130, while the source of the IFrame (e.g., the third party application) is hosted on a third party server associated with the third party application. -
Browser window 1903 includes aparent frame 1907 and an embeddedIFrame 1902. In one embodiment,browser window 1903 may include one or more frames that contain the same universal information as browser window 1903 (or parent frame 1907), regardless of what application is embedded withinIFrame 1902. -
Browser window 1903 communicates with embedded frames using interframe communication. In order forbrowser window 1903 to communicate with embeddedIFrame 1902, event notifications are sent in the direction shown by 1905. Event notifications may be sent without an explicit request and include mutations, as described above, received fromcollaborative development service 130 and information about users that have joined and/or left the document. This one-way communication of events allows for a secure system. - Remote procedure calls (RPCs) 1906 are sent to and/or from the
browser window 1903 to embeddedIFrame 1902. The RPCs may be in the form of requests that are sent from a developer code/application document toparent frame 1907. The RPCs may also be responses that are sent back from the parent code to the developer code including document mutations, request for information about users, etc. Methods of interframe communication are known. - In one embodiment, a third party application and/or a document embedded on
IFrame 1902 communicates withparent frame 1907 using cross-frame messaging which passes messages between parent frame andcollaborative development service 130. In one embodiment, for purposes of security, mutations generated by a third party application embedded in the IFrame are prohibited from directly communicating withcollaborative development service 130. In this way, security measures are implemented to ensure that untrusted, unverified or otherwise unsecure data is not transmitted directly tocollaborative development service 130.FIG. 19B is a flowchart of a method of communicating between a third party application embedded in an IFrame andcollaborative development service 130. First, a request is transmitted from the third party application document embedded in IFrame, atstep 1991. The request may be a question or a mutation on the third party application document. For example, the request may contain a mutation or a question regarding the users that are accessing or have accessed the third party application. The request may be a stream of information or any other type of request. The request is sent from the third party application document embedded in the IFrame toparent frame 1907 and/or webpage via interframe communication (shown as 1908 inFIG. 19A ). The request is received byparent frame 1907 and is verified and/or otherwise determined to be secure, atstep 1992. - The request is then forwarded from the trusted
parent frame 1907 tocollaborative development service 130, where the request may be handled appropriately, atstep 1993. In one embodiment, the request (or message containing the request) is communicated via asynchronous Javascript and Extensible Markup Language (XML) (shown as 1909 inFIG. 19A ). Additionally, a response to the request is also communicated via asynchronous JavaScript and XML (shown as 1909 inFIG. 19A ). The response is sent fromcollaborative development service 130 toparent frame 1907, atstep 1994, which places the response in a proper format to forward to the third party application, atstep 1995. - In one embodiment, a one-way communication is made from
parent frame 1907 to the third party application. This communication may relate to any event including a notification sent without an explicit request including mutations received fromcollaborative development service 130, and information about users (whether a user has joined or left a third party application document), etc. The methods and systems as depicted byFIGS. 19A and 19B provide real-time scripting. - Referring again to
FIG. 18 , a plurality of users use the functionality ofthird party application 1801 to create adocument 1802. Within the document, the users may define instances of particular objects, including word object instances. In an embodiment illustrated byFIG. 20 , the users instantiate a word object “helloworld” 1803. - The plurality of users subsequently send
respective instructions 2001 and to edit object instance “helloworld” 1803, inFIG. 20 . In one embodiment, a first user may sendinstruction 2001 to append the letter “e” (2003) at the end of “helloworld.” Substantially simultaneously, a second user may sendinstruction 2002 to append the letter “x” (2004) at the end of “helloworld.” As both theinstructions FIG. 21B . Specifically, the visual representation ofobject instance 2101 displayed in the embedded IFrame within each of the user's browser windows is updated, as shown inFIG. 22 . - Communication is carried out among frames on
user device 160, and betweenuser device 160 andcollaborative development service 130, in order to implement changes received by the user of the user device as well as changes received by users of other devices.FIG. 21A is a flowchart of a method of providing collaborative development services in accordance with an embodiment. Atstep 2102, a document is displayed within a first frame embedded within a second frame on a first device, wherein the second frame is in communication with a server. For example, a document being edited using a third party software application may be displayed within a first frame embedded within a second (parent) frame on user device 160-A, in communication withcollaborative development service 130. Atstep 2103, a first change to the document is received from a first user. A user of user device 160-A may edit an object instance such as a word within the document. Atstep 2104, the first change is transmitted to the server by interframe communication. The first, embedded frame displayed on user device 160-A communicates the change to the parent frame, which transmits an instruction specifying the change tocollaborative development service 130.Collaborative development service 130 generates a plurality of transformed operations, based on the user's specified change and on changes introduced by a second user of a second user device, in the manner discussed above.Collaborative development service 130 communicates the transformed operations touser device 160. Atstep 2105, a plurality of transformed changes to the document, including a transformed version of the first change and a version of a second change made by a user of a second device, are received by interframe communication. The parent frame receives the information specifying the transformed operations, and communicates the operations to the third party application via the embedded frame. The transformed changes are applied to the visual representation of the document. - Another embodiment in which multiple users use
collaborative development service 130 to collaboratively edit a document is illustratively depicted inFIG. 23 .FIG. 23 shows a document that may be created using a third party software application, in this case, a music editing application.Document 2301 is presented to each user as an embedded IFrame within a webpage on the user's device. The application may exist in the background and may not be visible to the users. Therefore, the users are able to viewdocument 2301 which includes astaff 2303,text 2302, etc., output on their devices. - In this embodiment, a plurality of users wish to collaborate to write a song. The users may access a blank or partially filled staff-sheet within
document 2301. While the users are creating and editing the song, an indicator such as 2302 may indicate to the users that they are in an editing mode. Thus, the users may see text, graphics, etc. stating “Edit Composer” or the like. - In one embodiment, two users, Jan and Joey, wish to compose a new song together. Jan and Joey are located 500 miles apart from each other and wish to use
collaborative development service 130 to create their new song. Jan and Joey may place musical notes on the staff by clicking on a location and placing the note on that location. As shown inFIG. 24 , when Jan or Joey wishes to add anote 2401, he/she clicks on the appropriate note that may appear on a pop-up menu, 2402. The pop-up menu may include a variety of musical notes, etc. In one embodiment, the notes may be placed onstaff 2303 by selection ofnote 2401 from the pop-up menu. - In one embodiment illustratively depicted by
FIG. 25 , Jan wishes to place anote 2501 on the staff at the beginning of ameasure 2503 and Joey, substantially simultaneously, wishes to place anote 2502 at the end ofmeasure 2503. In one embodiment, operational transformation rules are applied to the users' changes in a manner such as that described above yielding the results shown inFIG. 25 . - Jan and Joey now insert lyrics into the song. The lyrics correspond to the notes. Specifically, Jan and Joey may select an
icon 2601 labeled “lyrics” to insert the desired lyrics on of the staff as shown inFIG. 26 . In one embodiment, Joey has inserted a word “The,” in a location shown by 2602 before the word “brown” that was previously placed on the bottom of the staff. Jan then wishes to place the lyrics “quick” atlocation 2603 also before the word “brown.” One or more operational transformation rules are applied, in a manner such as that described above, to Jan and Joey's changes, and the phrase “The quick brown” is produced. After the operational transformation rules have been applied, the visual representation shown on Joey's computer and Jan's computer and the corresponding representation on the server of thecollaborative development service 130 are consistent. For example, both Jan and Joey's computer may display the result shown inFIG. 26 . - At this point, Jan and Joey may collaborate further to complete their song, as depicted by
FIG. 27 . Jan and Joey also collaborate to create the title of their song which is “Jan and Joey's Song.” In one embodiment, Jan and Joey wish to create and/or edit the title of the song substantially simultaneously and operational transformational rules are applied in such a manner as described above. Referring toFIG. 27 , Jan and Joey have completed their song collaboratively and their visual displays have been updated in real-time during the collaboration. -
FIG. 28 is a flowchart of a method of providing collaborative editing services. Operational transformation rules are stored in a memory, atstep 2801. The processor, which is in communication with the memory, receives, via interframe communication, two or more sets of instructions, specifying respective changes to the document, atstep 2802. The two or more sets of instructions may be received substantially simultaneously in real-time. At the processor, a selected operational transformation rule is applied to generate a transformed operation that effects the changes specified by the two or more sets of instructions in a visual representation of the document, in a consistent manner, atstep 2803. At the processor, the generated transformed operation is forwarded via interframe communication, atstep 2804. - In one embodiment, Jan wishes to make a change to the musical notes editor document and sends instructions to the document indicating the change she wants to make. The change is communicated by RPCs from the application document to the parent frame to a server(s) of
collaborative development service 130. In this way, even though Jan has changed some part of the song she is writing locally, the change does not go into effect on all user devices (such as Joey's user device) until the change has been accepted bycollaborative development service 130. Such hierarchy ensures the safety of collaborative development service 130 (and/or a server associated with collaborative development service 130) as each user is prohibited from directly communicating withcollaborative development service 130. Additionally, such a hierarchy protects against malicious attacks by an untrusted party. - Additionally, users are provided with the following features. Such features may be available to user, of any third party application that is created and accessed using
collaborative development service 130. - In one embodiment, users are collaborating on a creating a project, such as writing a song, may utilize a chat feature. In one embodiment, users may wish to conduct a transient discussion on the side of the application in a chat window, for example. The chat window may be located anywhere on the users' screens.
- In one embodiment, users may view all changes made to a document by viewing the revision history. The revision history may show a time stamp of when edits were made. For example, if Joey deleted notes and lyrics from the music editor document, Jan may view the revision history indicative of Joey's edits. Thus, Jan and Joey may access any version of the document at anytime. In one embodiment, Jan and Joey are provided with a list of actions performed including the name of the user that performed the action, the date and time the action was performed and what the user did. If Jan wishes to access lyrics that were created for the song in the past, she may do so at any time without affecting the current state of the song. Also, Jan may restore the song to an earlier state and have the option of restoring it to the current state or any other state at any time.
- Users may access other functions, and the revisions are not limited to revisions to text. The revision history function may also show any comments created by the users. In one embodiment, the users may revert to an earlier version of the document by selecting a particular revision history session. Restoring the document to an earlier version of the document does not delete the current version of the application; rather, all versions are viewable and selectable by the users at any time.

Collaborative development service 130 may be used by enterprise-level clients to manage documents and data. In accordance with an embodiment, an enterprise-level client may specify a policy to govern the management of data and documents. In response,collaborative development service 130 manages the client's documents in accordance with the client-specified policy. For example, if an employee of the enterprise generates a document viacollaborative development service 130, the document is managed in accordance with the policy specified by the enterprise. In another example, if an employee of the enterprise creates a software application viacollaborative development service 130, the software application, including any related code or other data, is managed in accordance with the policy specified by the enterprise. - An enterprise may, for example, grant various access rights to various categories of employees with respect to documents and data. Certain employees may be granted read-only access, other employees may be granted reading and editing rights, other employees may be granted administrator rights, etc. Referring to
FIG. 3 ,collaborative development service 130 stores and records the access rights in apolicy file 3090 inmemory 325. - For example, in one embodiment, an enterprise may specify a policy governing the storage of data and documents created using
collaborative development service 130.FIG. 29 shows acommunications system 2900 similar to that shown inFIG. 1 , in whichcollaborative development service 130 maintains, or has access to, multiple data storage facilities located in a variety of countries and jurisdictions throughout the world. Specifically,collaborative development service 130 maintains or has access to data storage 3076-A, data storage 3076-B, etc. Eachdata storage 3076 may be, for example, a data storage device located in a respective country or jurisdiction. For example, data storage 3076-A may be a data storage device located in Paris, France, data storage 3076-B may be a data storage device located in Sao Paolo, Brazil, etc. -
FIG. 30 is a flowchart of a method of managing data in accordance with an embodiment. Supposing that Enterprise XYZ, an enterprise located in France, wishes to comply with a particular French law requiring that all documents of a certain type be stored within the territory of France, the enterprise may accesscollaborative development service 130 and specify a requirement that all documents and other data meeting certain criteria must be stored and maintained within the territory of France. -
FIG. 31 shows a data managementpolicy web page 3125 on which a client may specify a data management policy. In the illustrative example, Enterprise XYZ specifies “FRANCE” in alocation field 3142, indicating that all data and documents must be stored in France. In other embodiments, other policies may be specified in a similar manner. Referring toFIG. 3 ,collaborative development service 130 records the enterprise's specified policy inpolicy file 3090. - The policies established by Enterprise XYZ are now applied to data, documents, and software generated by any employee of the enterprise. At
step 3010, an enterprise associated with a user of an online service is identified. Thus, when an employee of Enterprise XYZ accessescollaborative development service 130,collaborative development service 130 determines that the employee is associated with Enterprise XYZ. For example,collaborative development service 130 may identify the individual as an employee of Enterprise XYZ based on his or her username. Atstep 3020, a data management policy associated with the enterprise is determined.Collaborative development service 130 accordingly retrieves from memory data defining the data management policy of Enterprise XYZ. In this example,collaborative development service 130 retrieves the policy specifying that certain data must be stored in France. - At
step 3030, the user is provided access to a third party software application. In the illustrative embodiment, the employee accessesthird party application 400 viacollaborative development service 130 in the manner described above, and generates one or more documents. The employee may collaborate with other employees of Enterprise XYZ to edit the documents in a collaborative manner, as described above. For example, the employee, and one or more of the employee's co-workers, may access thirdparty software application 400 viacollaborative development service 130 and create a text document. The employee and his or her co-workers may subsequently edit the document in a collaborative manner, in the manner described above. In other embodiments, the employee and his or her co-workers may create and edit other types of documents associated with other content types. - At
step 3040, data generated by the third party application is managed in accordance with the data management policy. Accordingly, when the employee accesses thirdparty software application 400 and creates a document meeting the criteria specified in the policy,collaborative development service 130 stores the document in a storage device located in the location specified by the policy, for example, in France. If the employee edits the document, all versions and copies of the document are stored within the territory of France. If the employee accessesthird party application 400 and generates other data (or software) that meet the policy's specified criteria, the data is stored within the territory of France, in accordance with the policy of Enterprise XYZ. - In another embodiment, users collaborating to edit a document may each view and track certain information concerning the other users. Such information may include, for example, the date and time another user joined and left the collaboration (i.e., accessed a document or software application), presence information relating to another user in the document or application, activities of another user, revisions made by another user, and another user's audit trail.
Collaborative development service 130 may provide such data based on information stored in activity table 428, for example. Additionally, a user may view the location of another user's cursor in the document in real-time. -
Collaborative development service 130 also provides an auditing service whereby specified documents and data may be analyzed based on criteria specified by the client to determine whether the management of the documents and data are in compliance with the client's policies, or whether the documents or data are in compliance with any other rules or regulations.Collaborative development service 130 also provides an encryption service that may be used in connection with an audit of the client's documents and data. For example, in response to a client request that specified documents and data (pertaining to an audit) be encrypted,collaborative development service 130 identifies the requested documents and data, and encrypts the documents and data. - In accordance with an embodiment, a client may direct that
collaborative development service 130 identify data and documents meeting certain criteria and produce such data and documents in electronic form. This service may be used, for example, by an enterprise involved in a litigation, in response to a discovery request received from an adversary. The enterprise may specify one or more criteria to be used as a basis for identifying relevant documents. For example, an enterprise may request that a search be performed to identify all documents that contain the name “John Doe,” all design documents pertaining to a particular product, etc. - The enterprise may accordingly access
collaborative development service 130 and specify one or more criteria. In response,collaborative development service 130 searches the client's documents and other data based on the specified criteria, and provides the documents and data resulting from the search to the client. The results of the search may be provided in any one of a variety of formats, such as a list of documents, a database containing list of links to documents, etc. - In another embodiment,
collaborative development service 130 provides a full text indexing capability to clients. For example, any part of a document maintained atcollaborative development service 130 may be indexed for use in a full-text indexing search, regardless of the content type. In one embodiment, the indexing may be performed automatically with respect to all user-entered text. In order to perform full-text indexing, optical character recognition (OCR) or the like may be implemented with respect to newly created text or other items input by users. This service may allow a client to perform a keyword search. Such capabilities may be provided automatically to clients bycollaborative development service 130. In another embodiment, full-text indexing may be provided with respect to non-text content. - Unlike existing methods and systems, the systems and methods described above advantageously allow an enterprise-level client of an online document processing service, such as
collaborative development service 130, to establish policies that are applicable to all or a selected portion of the client's data and documents. Advantageously, auditing and verification services are also provided. - In accordance with an embodiment, employees of a client may use a discussion feature to attach comments relating to a particular node of an object within a document. A discussion thread may also be attached to a particular node of an object. The comment or discussion thread is attached to the particular node. Comments and discussion threads may be added in this manner within a document regardless of the content type. For example, in a text document, an employee may place his or her cursor at a particular character in a text document and attach a comment to that particular character. In an image, an employee may place a cursor at an object within the image and attach a comment or discussion thread to the object. An employee developing a software application may attach a comment or discussion thread to a selected component of a data model.
- In accordance with an embodiment, a document and related data may be stored in a
user device 160, to enable a user of the user device to edit the document while offline. For example, documents may be stored locally on a user device using HTML5 offline storage. - The foregoing Detailed Description is to be understood as being in every respect illustrative and exemplary, but not restrictive, and the scope of the invention disclosed herein is not to be determined from the Detailed Description, but rather from the claims as interpreted according to the full breadth permitted by the patent laws.
