- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online environment.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example process for rendering a map with an integrated content item that is aligned with a shape in the map.
- FIGS. 3A-3D are example maps that may be generated using the process depicted in FIG. 2 .
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of example computer systems that can be used to render a map with an integrated content item that is aligned with a shape in the map.
- content item encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including any data that can be provided over a network that includes a visual component for display to a user.
- a visual component for display to a user For example, an advertisement, including a link to a landing page is a content item.
- Another example of a content item is an offer for the purchase of a service or deal. Multiple deals or advertisements may even be displayed together as a single content item.
- the visual component of a content item may be referred to as a creative.
- the processes described below are illustratively applied to content items that are advertisements provided in response to a request for a map, but the processes are also applicable to other content items provided over a network.
- ender encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, generating an image from data including one or more models of objects to be depicted in the image.
- online map encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, a map that is accessible through a network and rendered, at least in part, in real time in response to a request.
- computing device encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, an appropriate processor and/or logic that is capable of receiving and storing data, and of communicating over a network.
- An online mapping service provides requested maps with integrated content items (e.g., advertisements) for presentation to a user. It may be useful to pair content items with maps, even where the content items do not reflect places depicted in the map. For example, it may be useful to present an advertisement for a restaurant review and rating service in map that is generated in part in response to a search for restaurants in a geographic area.
- a content item may be integrated into a map in a relatively unobtrusive manner by identifying and selecting relatively unused space in the map and aligning an image for the content item with the geometric features of that space. For example, integrated content item may be created by projecting an advertisement image onto a surface depicted in a map.
- a content item may be overlaid on various types of shapes within a map.
- shapes could include polygons used to represent geographic features (e.g., a body of water), polygons used to represent architectural features (e.g., a wall or roof of a building), or space between other features in map (e.g., the space between roads depicted in the map).
- the process of scaling and aligning an image for a content item to match a shape in a map may be referred to as snapping the content item to the shape. Snapping a content item to a shape may reduce the extent to which significant features of the map are obscured by the content item when its visual component is overlaid.
- snapping may include virtually affixing the content item to the shape so that the visual component of the content item is rendered in the same relative position to the shape regardless of the viewpoint from which the map is rendered.
- Shapes may be selected for snapping of a content item in a variety of ways.
- shapes are identified and evaluated in response to a request by comparing features of the shapes occurring in a requested map view. For examples, geometric, texture, or color features of shapes in the map may be compared to select the best shape or shapes for overlay.
- one or more shapes in a map may be identified before a request is received. For example, the wall of a building depicted in 3 dimensional (3-D) maps may identified as candidate shape and an advertiser may purchase the ongoing right to have their advertisements displayed on the wall whenever the wall appears in a user requested map.
- a content item may be selected for integration into a requested map.
- a request for an online resource that includes a map may create one or more opportunities to present content items to a user.
- Selection of a content item for presentation in response to a resource request is interchangeably referred to as allocation of an impression to the selected content item (e.g., an advertisement).
- the value of an allocation may be estimated based on information about the impression and the content item.
- relevant information about an impression may include the geometric dimensions of the available display space (e.g., geometric features of a shape in the map), information about other content in the requested online resource (e.g., text from labels or pins in a map or a query used to generate a map), the time of the request, data about the user who made the request (e.g., cookies, geographic location, etc.), etc.
- Information about the content item may include keywords associated with the content item.
- a content or advertisement allocation system may seek to allocate impressions to content items in a manner that enhances the estimated value of the allocations.
- a score used for selection of content items may be based in part on an estimate of the value of allocating an impression to a content item.
- an auction may be run in real-time to allocate an impression by selecting a content item with the highest bid.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online environment 100 in which a map server system 110 responds to requests for maps by transmitting data reflecting maps with integrated content items (e.g., advertisements).
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects user devices 106 , content providers (e.g., advertisers 108 ), an advertisement management system 120 , and the map server system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of user devices 106 and advertisers 108 .
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources, including map data 118 , over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application (e.g., a web browser) to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 and the presentation of content to a user.
- a user application e.g., a web browser
- a user device 106 can submit requests 116 for resources including a map to the map server system 110 .
- map data 118 representing the requested map can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- the map data 118 may also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display in which advertisements or other content items can be presented.
- the advertisement management system 120 may receive a request for additional content items (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the map data 118 .
- the request for advertisements may include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are identified in requested map, and these requests are provided to the advertisement management system 120 .
- the geometric dimensions of the advertisement slot can be provided to the advertisement management system 120 .
- terms associated with a requested map or a search query associated with the map can also be provided to the advertisement management system 120 to facilitate identification of advertisements that are relevant to the map.
- the advertisement management system 120 can select advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“candidate advertisements”).
- candidate advertisements can include advertisements having characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to a specified request 116 .
- the advertisement management system 120 can select from the candidate advertisements that are provided for presentation in advertisement slots of a map based on results of an auction. For example, the advertisement management system 120 can receive bids from advertisers 108 and allocate the advertisement slots to the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction.
- the bids are amounts that the advertisers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their advertisement in a map.
- a bid can specify an amount that an advertiser 108 is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the advertisement, referred to as a CPM bid.
- the bid can specify an amount that the advertiser is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the advertisement or a conversion following selection of the advertisement.
- the highest bidders can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors (e.g., quality scores).
- a conversion occurs when a user performs a particular action related to an advertisement provided with a map. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks (on a web page) or taps (on a mobile device) on an advertisement and is referred to a landing page. Another conversion may occur when a user consummates a purchase before leaving that landing page. A conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action.
- User actions may include, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or web page, registering on a website, etc.
- Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- the advertisement management system 120 may store and access data regarding past allocations of content items and user interactions in a data store 119 .
- the data store 119 is a data store that stores data representing previous user interactions with online resources and advertisements. For example, in response to receiving a request for an advertisement, the advertisement management system 120 can store data identifying the map or other resource to which the request corresponds. Additionally, the advertisement management system 120 can store data representing the advertisements that were provided in response to the request and any user actions (e.g., clicks or conversions) that are detected following presentation of the advertisements.
- the data store 119 may also store user session logs or cookies reflecting a user's browsing history.
- the allocation module 130 may determine quality scores (e.g. predicted click through rates) for allocations of an impression to candidate content items based in part on weights for the online resource (e.g., map) in which the impression occurs.
- quality scores may result from a blend of factors determined by matching characteristics (e.g., keywords) associated with a candidate content item to features (e.g., terms) occurring in the online resource or associated with the current user requesting the resource.
- the allocation module 130 may select from among candidate content items based on quality scores. Data reflecting the selected content may be transmitted with a server system interface component of the advertisement management system 120 in response to a request for an impression.
- the map server system 110 may receive an advertisement from the advertisement management system 120 or directly from an advertiser 108 .
- a map rendering module 112 may be used to snap the advertisement to a shape in the requested map.
- the map rendering module 112 renders the map, resulting in map data 118 reflecting the map with the advertisement integrated.
- the map data 118 may then be transmitted to the user device 106 that requested the map.
- data reflecting the advertisement may be sent directly to the user device 106 which may integrate the advertisement in a received map based on integration instructions in the received map data 118 .
- the map server system 110 may be implemented as software that is executed on a processing apparatus, e.g., a computer system described in FIG. 4 .
- One or more server system interface components of the map server system 110 may be used to transmit map data 118 and receive requests 116 or advertisements.
- the advertisement management system 120 may also be implemented as software that is executed on a processing apparatus, e.g., a computer system described in FIG. 4 .
- a map server system and a content management system (e.g., advertisement management system 120 ) may be implemented on the same processing apparatus.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example process 200 for rendering a map with an integrated content item that is aligned with a shape in the map.
- the process 200 selects a shape in the map to which a content item may be snapped. A content item may also be selected. The content item is snapped to the selected shape.
- the map may be rendered, resulting in map data representing the map with the content item overlaid on the selected shape.
- the map data may be transmitted to a user device for presentation to a user in response to a request.

- the request may include a search query.
- a request may include a search for “hotels” in the specified geographic region.
- a map rendered in response to the request with this search query may include pins at locations of hotels in the region.
- the request may include information about a user making the request (e.g., a cookie).
- the request may be received 210 from a user device (e.g., user device 106 ) over a network (e.g., network 102 ).
- a network e.g., network 102
- the request may be received using a network interface (e.g., server system interface components of the map server system 110 ).
- the request may be received via a user interface (e.g., a keyboard, keypad, touchpad, or pointing device interface).
- the request may be further transmitted to a remote map server system to acquire additional map data for use in rendering the requested map.
- a shape in the requested map is selected 220 for overlay with a content item. Scores for shapes in the map may be determined and compared to select 220 the shape with the best characteristics for overlay of a content item. The scores may be based on one or more factors. For example, a shape selection score may be a linear combination of factors derived from characteristics of the shape.
- a shape selection score is based on geometric features of the shape. For example, large shapes may be preferred by basing the score on the area of a shape. In some implementations, shapes with right angles may be preferred. For example, a score may be based on the extent to which angles at vertices of the shape deviate from ⁇ 2.
- a shape selection score may be based on one or more features reflecting the geographic feature type of a shape. For example, a shape selection score may be based on a color feature of a shape or a texture feature of a shape. For example, a polygon with the color feature ‘blue’ may represent a body of water.
- shapes with the color feature ‘blue’ may be assigned high shape selection scores (where a high shape selection score indicates that a shape is more suitable for content item overlay than another shape with a low shape selection score).
- a shape occurring in the map may have a type parameter associated with it (e.g., indicating the shape represents water, park, or establishment grounds).
- a shape selection score may be based in part on a type parameter. For example, the shape selection score may be increased for a shape with a type parameter set to “water”, “park”, or “desert”, while the shape selection score may be decreased for a shape with a type parameter set to “golf course” or “establishment grounds”.
- a metric indicating the position of a shape in the requested map relative to the center of the map or to an edge of the map is determined.
- a shape selection score may be based in part on the position metric (e.g., a radial distance from the center). For example, shapes near the edges of a map may be preferred to reduce user annoyance that may be caused by the overlay of content items in the map. Using the position metric, the selection may be biased for the selection of shapes positioned near an edge of the map. In some implementations, shapes with more prominent or central positions in the map may be preferred to increase the chance of a user recognizing an overlaid content item.
- a shape is selected 220 after a content item has been chosen for integration into the map.
- the geometric dimensions of a display feature of the content item may be considered in selecting the shape to which the content item will be snapped.
- a shape selection score may be based in part on a comparison of the geometric features of the content item (e.g., the dimensions of its creative) to geometric features of the shape in the map.
- Geometric features may be compared by determining a metric for the fit between a creative and a shape in a map. For example, the ratio of the area of the creative to the area of shape when the creative is maximally sized to fit within the shape may be used as a metric of the fit.
- shapes to which content items may be snapped are dynamically identified and selected 220 in response to the request for a map.
- candidate shapes in a map may have been identified before a request for a particular map occurs. For example, shapes that correspond to specific geographic or architectural features (e.g., bodies of water or walls of buildings) that are depicted by a mapping system may be bid on by interested parties (e.g., advertisers 108 ) before user requests are received.
- interested parties e.g., advertisers 108
- a standing bid on a previously identified shape in the map may be used to select 220 a shape for overlay.
- These shapes with standing bids or reserved display rights may be referred to as a virtual billboard location. Records for identified virtual billboards reflecting standing bids or other status information may be maintained in a data storage device (e.g., storage device 406 ) and accessed when a request for a map is received.
- the shape to which a content item may be snapped may be selected 220 by the map rendering module 112 of the map server system 110 .
- the shape may be selected 220 by a map rendering module operating on a user device 106 .
- a content item may be selected 230 for integration into the requested map.
- the content item may describe something other than a place in a geographic region depicted in the map. For example, where a request for a map includes a search query for “hotels,” an advertisement for a hotel search service that is not tied to a particular location in depicted in the map may be selected for integration into the map.
- a content item is selected from among a set of candidate content items based on a comparison of quality scores. For example, the candidate content item with the highest predicted click through rate when paired with the impression associated with the shape in the requested map may be selected.
- selecting a content item for integration in the map includes running an auction for the available display space (e.g., the selected shape).
- a content item with the highest bid may be selected.
- an effective bid may depend in part on a quality score for the pairing of the content item and the requested map. For example, a bid may be specified as an amount that will be paid for a conversion.
- a content item is selected 230 after a shape has been chosen for overlay.
- the geometric features of the shape may be considered in selecting the content item that will be snapped to the shape.
- a content item selection score may be based in part on a comparison of the geometric features of the content item (e.g., the dimensions of its creative) to geometric features of the shape in the map.
- Geometric features may be compared by determining a metric for the fit between a creative and a shape in a map. For example, the ratio of the area of the creative to the area of shape when the creative is maximally sized to fit within the shape may be used as a metric of the fit.
- the content item may be selected 230 by the allocation module 130 of the advertisement management system 120 .
- the content selection is performed by a remote server and a computing device (e.g., map server system 110 or user device 106 ) that implements the shape selection and rendering of the map receives the selected content item over a network 102 through a network interface (e.g., communication interface 466 ).

- a creative for the content item may be scaled to the largest size that will fit completely within the selected shape. In this manner, the display size of the content item may be increased without substantially increasing the chance of obstructing significant features of the map.
- a creative may be scaled to be bigger than the selected shape in one or more dimensions. For example, if the selected shape is smaller than a minimum required display size for a creative, the minimum display size may be utilized for the map.
- a content item may be scaled 240 by the map rendering module 112 of the map server system 110 .
- the content item may be scaled 240 by a map rendering module operating on a user device 106 .

FIG. 4 is a block diagram of example computer systems that can be used to render a map with an integrated content item that is aligned with a shape in the map. - The term “content item” as used herein encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including any data that can be provided over a network that includes a visual component for display to a user. For example, an advertisement, including a link to a landing page is a content item. Another example of a content item is an offer for the purchase of a service or deal. Multiple deals or advertisements may even be displayed together as a single content item. In some cases, the visual component of a content item may be referred to as a creative. The processes described below are illustratively applied to content items that are advertisements provided in response to a request for a map, but the processes are also applicable to other content items provided over a network.
- The term “render” as used herein encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, generating an image from data including one or more models of objects to be depicted in the image.
- The term “online map” as used herein encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, a map that is accessible through a network and rendered, at least in part, in real time in response to a request.
- The term “computing device” as used herein encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, an appropriate processor and/or logic that is capable of receiving and storing data, and of communicating over a network.
- An online mapping service provides requested maps with integrated content items (e.g., advertisements) for presentation to a user. It may be useful to pair content items with maps, even where the content items do not reflect places depicted in the map. For example, it may be useful to present an advertisement for a restaurant review and rating service in map that is generated in part in response to a search for restaurants in a geographic area. A content item may be integrated into a map in a relatively unobtrusive manner by identifying and selecting relatively unused space in the map and aligning an image for the content item with the geometric features of that space. For example, integrated content item may be created by projecting an advertisement image onto a surface depicted in a map.
- A content item may be overlaid on various types of shapes within a map. For example, shapes could include polygons used to represent geographic features (e.g., a body of water), polygons used to represent architectural features (e.g., a wall or roof of a building), or space between other features in map (e.g., the space between roads depicted in the map). The process of scaling and aligning an image for a content item to match a shape in a map may be referred to as snapping the content item to the shape. Snapping a content item to a shape may reduce the extent to which significant features of the map are obscured by the content item when its visual component is overlaid. For example, snapping may include virtually affixing the content item to the shape so that the visual component of the content item is rendered in the same relative position to the shape regardless of the viewpoint from which the map is rendered.
- Shapes may be selected for snapping of a content item in a variety of ways. In some implementations, shapes are identified and evaluated in response to a request by comparing features of the shapes occurring in a requested map view. For examples, geometric, texture, or color features of shapes in the map may be compared to select the best shape or shapes for overlay. In some implementations, one or more shapes in a map may be identified before a request is received. For example, the wall of a building depicted in 3 dimensional (3-D) maps may identified as candidate shape and an advertiser may purchase the ongoing right to have their advertisements displayed on the wall whenever the wall appears in a user requested map.
- A content item may be selected for integration into a requested map. A request for an online resource that includes a map may create one or more opportunities to present content items to a user. Selection of a content item for presentation in response to a resource request is interchangeably referred to as allocation of an impression to the selected content item (e.g., an advertisement).
- The value of an allocation may be estimated based on information about the impression and the content item. For example, relevant information about an impression may include the geometric dimensions of the available display space (e.g., geometric features of a shape in the map), information about other content in the requested online resource (e.g., text from labels or pins in a map or a query used to generate a map), the time of the request, data about the user who made the request (e.g., cookies, geographic location, etc.), etc. Information about the content item may include keywords associated with the content item. A content or advertisement allocation system may seek to allocate impressions to content items in a manner that enhances the estimated value of the allocations. In some implementations, a score used for selection of content items may be based in part on an estimate of the value of allocating an impression to a content item. In some implementations, an auction may be run in real-time to allocate an impression by selecting a content item with the highest bid.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exampleonline environment 100 in which amap server system 110 responds to requests for maps by transmitting data reflecting maps with integrated content items (e.g., advertisements). Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectsuser devices 106, content providers (e.g., advertisers 108), anadvertisement management system 120, and themap server system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofuser devices 106 andadvertisers 108. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources, includingmap data 118, over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application (e.g., a web browser) to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102 and the presentation of content to a user. - A
user device 106 can submitrequests 116 for resources including a map to themap server system 110. In turn,map data 118 representing the requested map can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. Themap data 118 may also include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display in which advertisements or other content items can be presented. - When a map is requested by a
user device 106, theadvertisement management system 120 may receive a request for additional content items (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with themap data 118. The request for advertisements may include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are identified in requested map, and these requests are provided to theadvertisement management system 120. - For example, the geometric dimensions of the advertisement slot can be provided to the
advertisement management system 120. Similarly, terms associated with a requested map or a search query associated with the map can also be provided to theadvertisement management system 120 to facilitate identification of advertisements that are relevant to the map. - Based on data included in the request for advertisements, the
advertisement management system 120 can select advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“candidate advertisements”). For example, candidate advertisements can include advertisements having characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to a specifiedrequest 116. - The
advertisement management system 120 can select from the candidate advertisements that are provided for presentation in advertisement slots of a map based on results of an auction. For example, theadvertisement management system 120 can receive bids fromadvertisers 108 and allocate the advertisement slots to the highest bidders at the conclusion of the auction. The bids are amounts that the advertisers are willing to pay for presentation (or selection) of their advertisement in a map. For example, a bid can specify an amount that anadvertiser 108 is willing to pay for each 1000 impressions (i.e., presentations) of the advertisement, referred to as a CPM bid. Alternatively, the bid can specify an amount that the advertiser is willing to pay for a selection (i.e., a click-through) of the advertisement or a conversion following selection of the advertisement. The highest bidders can be determined based on the bids alone, or based on the bids of each bidder being multiplied by one or more factors (e.g., quality scores). - A conversion occurs when a user performs a particular action related to an advertisement provided with a map. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks (on a web page) or taps (on a mobile device) on an advertisement and is referred to a landing page. Another conversion may occur when a user consummates a purchase before leaving that landing page. A conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action. User actions may include, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a website, viewing at least a certain number of web pages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a website or web page, registering on a website, etc. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- The
advertisement management system 120 may store and access data regarding past allocations of content items and user interactions in adata store 119. Thedata store 119 is a data store that stores data representing previous user interactions with online resources and advertisements. For example, in response to receiving a request for an advertisement, theadvertisement management system 120 can store data identifying the map or other resource to which the request corresponds. Additionally, theadvertisement management system 120 can store data representing the advertisements that were provided in response to the request and any user actions (e.g., clicks or conversions) that are detected following presentation of the advertisements. Thedata store 119 may also store user session logs or cookies reflecting a user's browsing history. - The
allocation module 130 may determine quality scores (e.g. predicted click through rates) for allocations of an impression to candidate content items based in part on weights for the online resource (e.g., map) in which the impression occurs. The quality scores may result from a blend of factors determined by matching characteristics (e.g., keywords) associated with a candidate content item to features (e.g., terms) occurring in the online resource or associated with the current user requesting the resource. - The
allocation module 130 may select from among candidate content items based on quality scores. Data reflecting the selected content may be transmitted with a server system interface component of theadvertisement management system 120 in response to a request for an impression. - In some implementations, the
map server system 110 may receive an advertisement from theadvertisement management system 120 or directly from anadvertiser 108. Amap rendering module 112 may be used to snap the advertisement to a shape in the requested map. Themap rendering module 112 renders the map, resulting inmap data 118 reflecting the map with the advertisement integrated. Themap data 118 may then be transmitted to theuser device 106 that requested the map. - In some implementations, data reflecting the advertisement may be sent directly to the
user device 106 which may integrate the advertisement in a received map based on integration instructions in the receivedmap data 118. - The
map server system 110 may be implemented as software that is executed on a processing apparatus, e.g., a computer system described inFIG. 4 . One or more server system interface components of themap server system 110 may be used to transmitmap data 118 and receiverequests 116 or advertisements. Theadvertisement management system 120 may also be implemented as software that is executed on a processing apparatus, e.g., a computer system described inFIG. 4 . In some implementations, a map server system and a content management system (e.g., advertisement management system 120) may be implemented on the same processing apparatus. -
FIG. 2 is a flow chart of anexample process 200 for rendering a map with an integrated content item that is aligned with a shape in the map. Theprocess 200 selects a shape in the map to which a content item may be snapped. A content item may also be selected. The content item is snapped to the selected shape. The map may be rendered, resulting in map data representing the map with the content item overlaid on the selected shape. In some implementations, the map data may be transmitted to a user device for presentation to a user in response to a request. In some implementations, shape selection and map rendering may be performed on a user device and the rendered map may be directly presented to a user through a display. - The
process 200 can be implemented, for example, by themap rendering module 112 in themap server system 110 ofFIG. 1 . In some implementations, themap server system 110 is a data processing apparatus that includes one or more processors that are configured to perform actions of theprocess 200. For example, the data processing apparatus may be theapparatus 400 described inFIG. 4 . In some implementations, some of the steps inprocess 200 may be pushed out to a client device, e.g., auser device 106. For example, themobile device 450 described inFIG. 4 may be a user device that selects a shape and renders the map with a received content item snapped to the shape. In some implementations, a non-transitory computer readable storage medium can include instructions that when executed by a computing device (e.g., a computer system) cause the device to perform actions of theprocess 200. - A request for an online map is received 210. The request may specify a geographic region that will be depicted in the map and other characteristics (e.g., display size, 2-D or 3-D, tilt angle of the map view, street view or satellite view, etc.) of the desired map. In some implementations, the request may include a search query. For example, a request may include a search for “hotels” in the specified geographic region. A map rendered in response to the request with this search query may include pins at locations of hotels in the region. In some implementations, the request may include information about a user making the request (e.g., a cookie).
- The request may be received 210 from a user device (e.g., user device 106) over a network (e.g., network 102). For example, the request may be received using a network interface (e.g., server system interface components of the map server system 110). In some implementations, where the
process 200 is mostly or entirely performed by a client device (e.g. user device 106), the request may be received via a user interface (e.g., a keyboard, keypad, touchpad, or pointing device interface). The request may be further transmitted to a remote map server system to acquire additional map data for use in rendering the requested map. - A shape in the requested map is selected 220 for overlay with a content item. Scores for shapes in the map may be determined and compared to select 220 the shape with the best characteristics for overlay of a content item. The scores may be based on one or more factors. For example, a shape selection score may be a linear combination of factors derived from characteristics of the shape.
- In some implementations a shape selection score is based on geometric features of the shape. For example, large shapes may be preferred by basing the score on the area of a shape. In some implementations, shapes with right angles may be preferred. For example, a score may be based on the extent to which angles at vertices of the shape deviate from π2.
- It may be useful to overlay content items on certain types of geographic features depicted in a map (e.g., bodies of water, parks, wilderness areas, or empty space between depicted features) because these geographic features may be considered less significant by users. A shape selection score may be based on one or more features reflecting the geographic feature type of a shape. For example, a shape selection score may be based on a color feature of a shape or a texture feature of a shape. For example, a polygon with the color feature ‘blue’ may represent a body of water. Where water is considered a relatively insignificant geographic feature, shapes with the color feature ‘blue’ may be assigned high shape selection scores (where a high shape selection score indicates that a shape is more suitable for content item overlay than another shape with a low shape selection score). In some implementations, a shape occurring in the map may have a type parameter associated with it (e.g., indicating the shape represents water, park, or establishment grounds). A shape selection score may be based in part on a type parameter. For example, the shape selection score may be increased for a shape with a type parameter set to “water”, “park”, or “desert”, while the shape selection score may be decreased for a shape with a type parameter set to “golf course” or “establishment grounds”.
- In some implementations, a metric indicating the position of a shape in the requested map relative to the center of the map or to an edge of the map is determined. A shape selection score may be based in part on the position metric (e.g., a radial distance from the center). For example, shapes near the edges of a map may be preferred to reduce user annoyance that may be caused by the overlay of content items in the map. Using the position metric, the selection may be biased for the selection of shapes positioned near an edge of the map. In some implementations, shapes with more prominent or central positions in the map may be preferred to increase the chance of a user recognizing an overlaid content item.
- In some implementations, a shape is selected 220 after a content item has been chosen for integration into the map. In these cases, the geometric dimensions of a display feature of the content item may be considered in selecting the shape to which the content item will be snapped. A shape selection score may be based in part on a comparison of the geometric features of the content item (e.g., the dimensions of its creative) to geometric features of the shape in the map. Geometric features may be compared by determining a metric for the fit between a creative and a shape in a map. For example, the ratio of the area of the creative to the area of shape when the creative is maximally sized to fit within the shape may be used as a metric of the fit.
- In some implementations, shapes to which content items may be snapped are dynamically identified and selected 220 in response to the request for a map.
- In some implementations, candidate shapes in a map may have been identified before a request for a particular map occurs. For example, shapes that correspond to specific geographic or architectural features (e.g., bodies of water or walls of buildings) that are depicted by a mapping system may be bid on by interested parties (e.g., advertisers 108) before user requests are received. When a map request is received, a standing bid on a previously identified shape in the map may be used to select 220 a shape for overlay. These shapes with standing bids or reserved display rights may be referred to as a virtual billboard location. Records for identified virtual billboards reflecting standing bids or other status information may be maintained in a data storage device (e.g., storage device 406) and accessed when a request for a map is received.
- The shape to which a content item may be snapped may be selected 220 by the
map rendering module 112 of themap server system 110. In some implementations, the shape may be selected 220 by a map rendering module operating on auser device 106. - A content item may be selected 230 for integration into the requested map. The content item may describe something other than a place in a geographic region depicted in the map. For example, where a request for a map includes a search query for “hotels,” an advertisement for a hotel search service that is not tied to a particular location in depicted in the map may be selected for integration into the map.
- In some implementations, a content item is selected from among a set of candidate content items based on a comparison of quality scores. For example, the candidate content item with the highest predicted click through rate when paired with the impression associated with the shape in the requested map may be selected.
- In some implementations, selecting a content item for integration in the map includes running an auction for the available display space (e.g., the selected shape). A content item with the highest bid may be selected. In some implementations, an effective bid may depend in part on a quality score for the pairing of the content item and the requested map. For example, a bid may be specified as an amount that will be paid for a conversion.
- In some implementations, a content item is selected 230 after a shape has been chosen for overlay. In these cases, the geometric features of the shape may be considered in selecting the content item that will be snapped to the shape. A content item selection score may be based in part on a comparison of the geometric features of the content item (e.g., the dimensions of its creative) to geometric features of the shape in the map. Geometric features may be compared by determining a metric for the fit between a creative and a shape in a map. For example, the ratio of the area of the creative to the area of shape when the creative is maximally sized to fit within the shape may be used as a metric of the fit.
- For example, the content item may be selected 230 by the
allocation module 130 of theadvertisement management system 120. In some implementations, the content selection is performed by a remote server and a computing device (e.g.,map server system 110 or user device 106) that implements the shape selection and rendering of the map receives the selected content item over anetwork 102 through a network interface (e.g., communication interface 466). - A content item may be scaled 240 to fit the selected shape. In some implementations, a creative for the content item is scaled to fit completely within the selected shape. For example, a creative for the content item may be scaled to the largest size that will fit completely within the selected shape. In this manner, the display size of the content item may be increased without substantially increasing the chance of obstructing significant features of the map. In some implementations, a creative may be scaled to be bigger than the selected shape in one or more dimensions. For example, if the selected shape is smaller than a minimum required display size for a creative, the minimum display size may be utilized for the map.
- A content item may be scaled 240 by the
map rendering module 112 of themap server system 110. In some implementations, the content item may be scaled 240 by a map rendering module operating on auser device 106. - A content item may be aligned 250 with the selected shape. Shapes occurring in a map may have various orientations. The edges of the shape may run at various angles with respect to the edges of the map. In 3-D maps, there may also be a tilt parameter associated with a shape that helps to achieve the perception of a 3-D perspective on the places depicted in a map. In order to align a content item to the shape, a visual component of the content item (e.g., a creative) may be oriented to match the orientation of the shape. In some implementations, a visual component of a content item may be rotated to align one of its edges as closely as possible to an edge of a shape selected for overlay, subject to constraints designed to preserve legibility of the visual component. An example, an alignment operation in 2-D map may be constrained to ensure that the text is no more than 90 degrees rotated from an edge of the map display. In another example, am alignment in a 3-D map may be constrained to ensure a visual component is never tilted more than approximately 45 degrees away from the camera view angle.
- A content item may be aligned 250 by the
map rendering module 112 of themap server system 110. In some implementations, the content item may be aligned 250 by a map rendering module operating on auser device 106. - The map may be rendered 260 with a visual component (e.g., creative) of the content item projected onto the shape. A projection operation may be performed to overlay a creative onto a surface defined by the shape in the map. In some implementations, the result of the rendering is map data (e.g., a rasterized image or a set of instructions for producing a rasterized image) that includes a scaled and aligned visual component of the content item. In some implementations, the result of rendering is map data that includes instructions for integrating a visual component of a content item into place within the map. For example, where a content item is sent directly from a separate advertisement server to a user device and map data is sent from a map server to the user device, the map data may include instructions identifying the shape onto which a creative of the content item should projected. The map data may also include scale and orientation parameters for the content item.
- A map may be rendered 260 by the
map rendering module 112 of themap server system 110. In some implementations, the map may be rendered 260 by a map rendering module operating on auser device 106. - Map data may be transmitted 270 in response to the request for presentation of the map to a user. For example, the map data may be transmitted 270 to a user device (e.g., user device 106) over a network (e.g., network 102). The map data may be transmitted using a network interface (e.g., server system interface components of the map server system 110). In some implementations, where the
process 200 is mostly or entirely performed by a client device (e.g. user device 106), the map may be directly presented to a user via a display interface (e.g.,display interface 456 coupled to a display 454). -
FIG. 3A shows anexample map 310 that may be generated usingprocess 200.Map 310 is 2-D map depicting an urban region with rivers running along two of its sides. Two content items, both advertising the hotel search service “HOTEL DEALS,” have been integrated intomap 310. The first content item has been snapped to a blue polygon (the color blue is represented by a fine dot pattern in the figure) representing a portion of river on the left side of the map, just off the shore. The second content item has been snapped to a space in the lower right portion of the map defined by four major roads (i.e., roads represented with thicker lines in the figure) that surround it. The space includes less significant roads (i.e., roads represented with thinner lines in the figure). The depictions of these less significant geographic features have overlaid with the creative for the second content item. In some implementations, features in the map are assigned to a hierarchy reflecting the relative significance of the features. The hierarchy may be used to determine which features may be ignored when identifying shapes consisting of space between features of higher priority. For example, a hierarchy for roads depicted in a map may be defined, e.g., highways first (highest significance in the hierarchy), then arterial roads, then local roads, then terminal roads, then footpaths. -
FIG. 3B shows anexample map 320 that may be generated usingprocess 200.Map 320 is a 3-D map of an urban region with zero tilt perspective (i.e., the region is viewed from directly above). Buildings in the region are depicted as 3-D objects with outer surfaces including walls and roofs. Two content items, both advertising the hotel search service “HOTEL DEALS,” have been integrated intomap 320. The first content item has been snapped to a large roof of a building in the upper right corner of the map.

In addition, certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (for example, to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of the user cannot be determined.
- The processes described herein and variations thereof contain functionality to ensure that party privacy is protected. Likewise, the processes may be programmed to confirm that information about a party is publicly known before divulging that information to another party even before incorporating that information into a social graph.
- Elements of different implementations described herein may be combined to form other implementations not specifically set forth above. Elements may be left out of the processes, computer programs, Web pages, etc. described herein without adversely affecting their operation. In addition, the logic flows depicted in the figures do not require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. Various separate elements may be combined into one or more individual elements to perform the functions described herein.
- Other implementations not specifically described herein are also within the scope of the following claims.
