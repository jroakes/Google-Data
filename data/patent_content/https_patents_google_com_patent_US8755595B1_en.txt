Definitions
- OCR optical character recognition
- the characters are often parts of words that are captured in the images.
- OCR is often used to recognize characters found in scanned images of documents, books, newspapers, journals and other print media.
- the OCR systems may analyze the scanned documents and output machine-encoded text corresponding to the characters that were recognized in the scanned images.
- Ground truth data may be collected from and/or about a scanned image to facilitate an OCR engine's operation or training.
- ground truth data may be symbolic data (such as encoded text) and associated layout or location information (such as a bounding box associated with the encoded text).
- An OCR engine may be trained using this ground truth data to enable the OCR engine to recognize characters or other data in this and subsequent images.
- OCR engines have used synthetic training or ground truth data extracted from test images in limited, controlled circumstances.
- the synthetic data or test images may be generated by rendering text in a controlled environment using a variety of fonts and geometric transformations.
- an OCR engine may be trained to recognize the characters of the image but with limited capabilities.
- OCR engines trained with such synthetic data have difficulty identifying characters on images when the images are taken in less-than-ideal conditions and/or in uncontrolled environments.
- OCR engines trained on synthetic data may have difficulty identifying characters, symbols, words and/or other text from pictures that may have low light issues, blur, and/or other distortions as discussed above.
- images of variable quality obtained from a variety of sources may include images that may have originally been taken by a mobile device such as a camera on a mobile phone and/or images that may have been taken in an environment with varying or less-than-ideal circumstances, such as, images taken with a low camera resolution, poor lighting and/or out-of-focus.
- images that may have a variable quality or even a low quality are images of street signs, storefront lettering or other text taken with mobile cameras by users outdoors or indoors.
- Such images captured in uncontrolled or less-than-ideal camera environments are often difficult to process in an OCR engine. Automatic extraction of ground truth data from such images has been too difficult and error prone.
- Automatically extracted character ground truth data may include character bounding boxes from images given a set of word bounding boxes and transcriptions.
- a transcription may be rendered in a plurality of fonts and orientations to obtain a set of candidate word templates with associated character bounding boxes.
- a word template may be selected from the set of candidate word templates.
- the selected word template may correspond to a word patch from an image.
- the character bounding boxes of the selected word template may be evaluated in a plurality of orientations about each respective character from the word patch to obtain a set of candidate character templates.
- a character template may be selected from the set of candidate character templates.
- Each selected character template may correspond to the respective character from the word patch.
- Character ground truth data including the selected character templates oriented to correspond to the word patch may be provided as training data for recognizing in other images the characters of the word patch.
- a system may include one or more processors and a memory coupled to the one or more processors.
- a template generator may render a transcription in a plurality of fonts and orientations to obtain a set of candidate word templates with associated character bounding boxes, and select a word template from the set of candidate word templates.
- the selected word template corresponds to a word patch from an image.
- a character box refiner may evaluate the character bounding boxes of the selected word template in a plurality of orientations about each respective character from the word patch to obtain a set of candidate character templates.
- the character box refiner may select, for each respective character from the word patch, a character template from the set of candidate character templates.
- Each selected character template corresponds to a respective character from the word patch.
- An output formatter may provide character ground truth data including the selected character templates oriented to correspond to the word patch as training data. This training may be used to recognize in other images the characters of the word patch.
- a computer program product including a computer readable medium having computer program logic recorded thereon that, when executed by a processor, enables the processor to extract ground truth from images is disclosed.
- a method for obtaining training data for an OCR (optical character recognition) engine is disclosed.
- Coarse ground truth data may be stored.
- Character-level ground truth data may be automatically extracted from the coarse ground truth data.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary system by which to automatically extract character ground truth data from images.
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example method for obtaining data for training an OCR engine.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart of an example method for the automatic extraction of character-level ground truth data from coarse ground truth data.

- Embodiments relate generally to the automatic extraction of character ground truth data from images.
- Computer-implemented methods, systems, and computer program products are provided to automatically extract character ground truth data for training or input to OCR engines.
- Automatically extracted character ground truth data may include character bounding boxes from images given a set of word bounding boxes and transcriptions.
- the system 100 as shown in FIG. 1 may automatically extract character ground truth data from images taken in uncontrolled environments.
- the character ground truth data may then be used to train optical character recognition (OCR) engines or devices to recognize characters, symbols, words and/or other text or items from images taken in real-world or uncontrolled environments.
- OCR optical character recognition
- the system 100 may provide information to train OCR engines to identify characters, symbols, words and/or other text or other items from noisy images taken in uncontrolled or street environments.
- Uncontrolled environments may include those environments or circumstances that occur in everyday life. For example, images taken from a street or in a park. Capturing images in these environments, amongst many others, may increase the likelihood that the captured images may include some level of distortion.
- the distortion may be from the environment and/or the device capturing the image. Examples of distortion that may occur in images include blur, movement, low-light, bright-light and other distortions.
- an image of a street sign captured with a mobile device may be an example image from an uncontrolled environment.
- controlled environments may include those situations in which many of these potential distortions are avoided and/or added synthetically.
- Example controlled environments may include scans from scanners, images in a studio, or pictures of printed text from books and other printed material or resources.
- While the system 100 may process both synthetic (e.g., from controlled environments) and real-world images (e.g., from uncontrolled environments), it is the processing of real-world images by the system 100 that may allow for more effective training of OCR devices, especially OCR devices called upon to process images obtained from a variety of cameras and environments including those that may increase distortion in a scanned or captured image.
- system 100 may include a character-level ground truth generator (CLG) 110 that refines or processes coarse ground truth data 103 , and provides an output of character ground truth data 124 that may be used to train an OCR engine 130 .
- CLG character-level ground truth generator
- Coarse ground truth data 103 may include information such as photographic and/or layout data about one or more images.
- Coarse ground truth data 103 may include, for example, an image 105 and a transcription 109 .
- Image 105 may be any photograph, frame or rendering of an image with characters, symbols, words and/or other text or other items.
- Image 105 may be any image or photograph, and can be taken from controlled or uncontrolled environments.
- Image 105 may include some distortion, such as blur and/or lighting issues, especially if taken in an uncontrolled environment.
- image 105 may include a picture of a street sign as taken from a cell phone. The distortion may cause, for example, the characters of the street sign to appear blurred or difficult to read due to lighting issues and/or the quality of image capture from a cell phone.
- Transcription 109 may include the text or translation of whatever appears in image 105 and is to be identified or processed by system 100 .
- image 105 may include a photograph of a street sign that reads “Route 123 ”, then for example, transcription 109 may include the text “Route 123 ”.
- Image 105 may also include distortion, which may make the text difficult to discern or read. In this way, transcription 109 may provide what text appears (and/or was meant to be captured) in image 105 , and may be used to help identify the characters of the transcription 109 in image 105 .
- transcription 109 may be determined by a manual operator, or other system, that views image 105 and determines what text of the image is valuable and/or needs to be identified by CLG 110 , and provides transcription 109 as part of the coarse ground truth data 103 and/or otherwise in association with image 105 .
- coarse ground truth data 103 may include or otherwise be associated with a bounding box 113 .
- Bounding box 113 may include layout information about image 105 .
- Bounding box 113 may include an indication of where the text of transcription 109 appears in image 105 .
- image 105 may include non-text, non-character space and/or may include multiple text or words not all of which are to be identified by system 100 .
- Bounding box 113 may then identify where within image 105 the text of transcription 109 is located.
- Bounding box 113 may include, for example, coordinates of a rectangular box that contains the text to be identified.
- bounding box 113 may include a perimeter that loosely bounds the word(s) to be processed in image 105 .
- bounding box 113 may include a rectangle or other shape rendered on or with image 105 , wherein inside the word(s) to be identified or processed by system 100 may be included within the area of bounding box 113 .
- a binary mask in which character pixels are turned on and background pixels are turned off, may be used.
- bounding box 113 may be a non-quadralinear shape, having more or less than four sides, such as a triangle, oval or pentagon.
- bounding box 113 may be a quadrilateral, but not necessarily a rectangle.
- image 105 is an image taken at an angle, includes italicized and/or otherwise non-horizontal or slanted text
- a general quadrilateral (or other shape) may provide a better suited bounding box 113 than a rectangle.
- OCR engine 130 may use a rectification process that may transform the quadrilateral patch of image 105 into a rectangular patch.
- system 100 may use shear mapping, whereby points on a first axis are fixed and points on a second axis are shifted parallel to the first axis by a distance proportional to their perpendicular distances from the first axis, to handle bounded italicized text.
- system 100 may use affine transformations to handle bounded non-frontal or otherwise angular images. This may however, as discussed in greater detail below, result in system 100 needed to process a larger number of configurations for images 105 associated with non-rectangular bounding boxes 113 .
- bounding box 113 may include multiple bounding boxes 113 identifying one or more portions of image 105 including one or more words, characters and/or other text.
- transcription 109 may include one or more transcriptions of the words or text within bounding boxes 113 .
- bounding box 113 may be identified or determined by a manual operator or other system that views image 105 and renders bounding box 113 . For example, the same or different operator may determine transcription 109 and bounding box 113 .
- Coarse ground truth data 103 may be received by an input formatter 112 .
- Input formatter 112 may extract a word patch from image 105 based on bounding box 113 .
- the word patch may include that portion or portion(s) of image 105 identified by the bounding box 113 .
- input formatter 112 may crop the pixels of the image 105 bounded or otherwise identified by bounding box 113 .
- input formatter 112 may crop the word patch, convert it to grayscale, and scale it to a common height.
- Input formatter 112 may draw or otherwise render bounding box 113 based on coarse ground truth data 103 that may, for example, indicate where bounding box 113 is to be rendered.
- a template generator 114 may generate a word template 116 for the word patch as determined by input formatter 112 .
- Template generator 114 may render transcription 109 in a variety of fonts and orientations to obtain a set of candidate word templates. For example, template generator 114 may render transcription 109 in the font “Times New Roman” and compare that against the image in the word patch. Template generator 114 may then adjust the orientation of the rendered transcription by adjusting the font size, physical alignment, spacing, boldness, italics, (pixel) offset, color and/or other font characteristics to try and align or match the rendered transcription to the corresponding word from the word patch.
- Template generator 114 may repeat this process for a variety of fonts at a variety of orientations, scoring and/or otherwise evaluating a number of the fonts and orientations based on how closely the font/orientation of transcription 109 corresponds to the word from the word patch. Template generator 114 may then select one of the candidate word templates (e.g., one with the highest score or correlation to the word from image 105 ) as word template 116 .
- the selected word template 116 may include one of a plurality of fonts at one of a plurality of orientations, as determined to correspond to a word from image 105 .
- template generator 114 may render transcription 109 in a font and at an orientation based on the selected word template 116 to correspond to a portion of image 105 (e.g., the word patch).
- Template generator 114 may use any approach to determine the font and orientation including for example, first determining the font that most closely resembles the text of the word patch and then determining how to orient the font, or determining the font and orientation in tandem.
- template generator 114 may render a binary template (e.g., word template 116 ) containing a rendering of transcription 109 in a selected or current font, whereby the rendering may be scaled to a range of heights and widths, for example, between 40% and 100% of the word patch width and heights between 50% and 100% of the word patch height (parameters tuned empirically). For each one of these scaled binary templates, template generator 114 may compute a normalized cross correlation scores (NCC) with the word patch at all possible (or at least multiple different) positions or orientations.
- NCC normalized cross correlation scores
- template generator 114 produces an array of correlation scores for each scaled template, from which the template with the highest score may be selected, and its position together with the (known) scaled template bounding boxes 113 may produce the bounding boxes of both word and symbols or characters (e.g., character templates 120 ) in the word patch.
- word template 116 may closely correlate to or match the word from input image 105 , there may be some variation or gap between individual symbols or characters of word template 116 and the word from (the word patch of) image 105 .
- a character box refiner 118 may repeat a variation of the NCC match discussed above with regards to template generator 114 for the characters of the word.
- Word template 116 may include one or more character bounding boxes that correspond to characters from the word patch.
- the binary template e.g., word template 116
- character box refiner 118 may determine character bounding boxes for one or more characters of the word (of image 105 ).
- Character box refiner 118 may evaluate the character bounding boxes in a plurality of orientations about each respective character from the word patch to obtain a set of candidate character templates. Character box refiner 118 may then select, for each respective character from the word patch, a character template 120 (i.e., char template 120 ).
- the selected char template(s) 120 may include the character bounding boxes from word template 116 , further oriented to more closely correspond to the individual (or clusters of) characters from the word of image 105 .
- the orientation of the character bounding boxes may be limited to a maximum variance from the character bounding boxes as determined from word template 116 .
- character box refiner 118 may produce a set of candidate character templates, which may be scored based upon their correspondence to a respective character from the word. Then, for example, character box refiner 118 may, for each character of the word from image 105 , select a char template 120 with a highest score or correspondence to image 105 .
- char template 120 may be a portion of word template 116 , though need not be limited to a single character.
- word template 116 includes the phrase “Hello World!”
- char templates 120 may include a template for each character or symbol such as “H” “e” “l” . . . “!”, or char templates 120 may include another subset of the phrase such as “Hello” and “World!”, or “he”, “llo”, “wor”, “ld”, and “!”.
- word template 116 included a symbol then char template 120 may include one or more portions of that symbol.
- character box refiner 118 may generate one or more character templates 120 for the characters of the word from the word patch. Character box refiner 118 may determine one or more character bounding boxes from word template 116 . The character bounding boxes, similar to word bounding box 113 , may include bounding boxes that more precisely identify the characters of the word or text from the word patch. For example, if word bounding box 113 identified the text “First Street” in image 105 or word patch. Then, from word template 116 , character box refiner 118 may determine a character bounding box for each letter or character of “First Street”, For example, the first character bounding box may correspond to the “F” and the last character bounding box may correspond to the final “t” from “Street”.
- Character box refiner 118 may, for example, start with the first character bounding box and generate a char (character) template 120 for each character of the word template 116 .
- the character bounding boxes may be determined based on word template 116 . For example, because the characters and spacing and size of the word or text of word template 116 may already be known, the character bounding boxes around each character may be determined by character box refiner 118 . Character box refiner 118 may then adjust or orient each character bounding box to more closely align to the individual character (or group of characters or symbols) to which the character bounding box corresponds.
- Character box refiner 118 may perform a similar function as described above with regards to template generator 114 as it may determine the orientation of the font for word template 116 , however, rather than orienting the entire word or group of characters, character box refiner 118 may orient one character at a time as per the character bounding box. Though in other example embodiments, character box refiner 118 may orient multiple characters or any smaller portions of word template 116 at once.
- character box refiner 118 may orient or adjust the characters (character boxes) of word template 116 to more closely match their alignment and other characteristics to the characters from the word patch. This process may allow CLG 110 to correct for the various ways words and/or characters may be oriented or may appear in images, especially those captured in uncontrolled environments. For example, road signs or street signs such as restaurant or store banners may include various scripts or fonts that may or may not be perfectly aligned, in contrast to books where words are more likely be properly aligned, and being able to adjust each character (or group of characters) by character box refiner 118 may allow CLG 110 to determine more accurately how the text of image 105 has been captured (and/or otherwise identify that text in image 105 ).
- character box refiner 118 may generate char template 120 that includes the realigned or oriented character bounding box. In some example embodiments, not all of the characters may need alignment or adjustment by character box refiner 118 .
- character box refiner 118 may fine-tune or adjust the orientation (as determined by template generator 114 for word template 116 ) within a certain bound. Character box refiner 118 may, in such instances, adjust the appearance or orientation of the characters of the character bounding boxes, rather than completely re-orientating them again from scratch.
- there may be bounds on the orientation that may limit how many pixels the characters of char templates 120 may be offset (e.g., 2 pixels) and/or a maximum degree of rotation allowed (e.g., 20 degrees).
- a word patch that has a height of 32 pixels may be associated with a maximum bounded orientation of ⁇ 2 pixels in the horizontal and/or vertical directions.
- Character box refiner 118 may store the reoriented character bounding boxes as one or more char templates 120 . In other example embodiments however, character box refiner 118 may adjust the character boxes without any specified bounds to better align the character box (of char template 120 ) with the corresponding word patch character.
- An output formatter 122 may generate character ground truth data 124 based on char templates 120 .
- Output formatter 122 may, for example, reassemble, realign, resize, and/or otherwise reorient char templates 120 to more closely correspond to word template 116 and/or the word patch.
- output formatter 122 may scale char templates 120 based on the original image 105 (or word patch) or word template 116 to generate character ground truth data 124 .
- Character ground truth data 124 may include, for example, the reoriented char templates 120 each provided for training OCR engine 130 . While character ground truth data 124 may include any combination(s) of one or more of char templates 120 that may or may not have been regrouped for training OCR engine 130 .
- output formatter 122 may score or otherwise rate the character ground truth data 124 and/or otherwise compare it to a threshold 126 .
- Threshold 126 may include an indication of a level of required correlation between character ground truth data 124 and image 105 (and/or word patch).
- Output formatter 122 may, for example, compute a score for character ground truth data 124 , the score indicating how closely the character ground truth data corresponds to the text (or other symbols) of image 105 (or word patch) and then compare that score to threshold 126 .
- output formatter 122 may provide character ground truth data 124 to a database 128 and/or a training module 132 . If the score however is below threshold 126 , output formatter 122 may discard the character ground truth data.
- Threshold 126 may be useful to indicate a level of correspondence between character ground truth data 124 and image 105 , such that only appropriate and/or accurate character ground truth data 124 (e.g., that meets certain quality expectations) may be used to train OCR engine 130 .
- Threshold 126 may be applied on a character-by-character basis and/or a word-by-word basis depending on the embodiment of system 100 .
- output formatter 122 may perform a consistency check amongst the words appearing on the same line. For example, output formatter 122 may check that extracted word patches from the same line may fall within a min/max height ratio, whereby if the one or more of the words do not meet this requirement, all of the words on that line will be rejected (or in other embodiments, readjusted). Other example embodiments however may invoke less conservative filters that allow greater variation amongst multiples words of an image 105 that appear on the same line or horizontal and/or vertical plane.
- Database 128 may be used to store any state information for system 100 .
- Database 128 may for example store received coarse ground truth data 103 , including image 105 , transcription 109 and/or bounding box 113 data.
- Database 128 may also store word template 116 , word patch, character bounding box, font, orientation, char template 120 , threshold 126 and/or character ground truth data 124 as processed by system 100 .
- Training module 132 may include an OCR engine 130 and a training database 134 .
- Training module 132 may use character ground truth data 124 to train OCR engine 130 to recognize character text and/or symbols or words from images 105 .
- Training database 134 may include, for example, character ground truth data 124 and any other image or training data necessary or useful to train OCR engine 130 .
- OCR engine 130 may include any optical character recognition engine or device used to identify characters, symbols, text words or other portions of one or more images. OCR engine 130 may translate the text of image 105 into typewritten, printed or otherwise machine-encoded text. Training module 132 may train and/or calibrate OCR engine 130 to recognize fonts, words and/or other characters based on character ground truth data 124 as determined from images 105 (taken in uncontrolled environments). OCR engine 130 may then produce formatted output that closely approximates or otherwise identifies the text of the original image 105 .
- system 100 may be used to train OCR engine 130 to read or recognize text, words, characters or other objects from real-world images 105 that may have been taken in uncontrolled environments. Training OCR engine 130 using these images (and corresponding character ground truth data 124 ) from uncontrolled environments allows training module 132 to better train OCR engine 130 to recognize objects from real-world (e.g., non-training) images because OCR engine 130 may be trained on images with real world noise, rather than images with synthetically induced noise.
- real-world e.g., non-training
- System 100 may implement a hybrid approach.
- System 100 may receive the word-level or coarse ground truth data 103 , which may include a loose or word bounding box 113 identifying word(s) to be identified and a transcription 109 corresponding to one or more of bounding boxes 113 .
- word bounding box 113 and/or transcription 109 may be manually determined by an operator, which unlike manual character extraction, may be relatively cheap to obtain manually from operators.
- System 100 may then process coarse ground truth data 103 to produce fine or character-level ground truth data 124 which in turn may be used to train one or more OCR engines 130 .
- System 100 may be used by any party developing an OCR engine 130 (especially for camera-based OCR), as a mean to collect ground truth data from real images for training.
- System 100 may use a two-step approach of first generating word template 116 and then refining word template 116 into a series of char templates 120 .
- template generator 114 may render transcription 109 of the word using a variety of fonts at various possible positions/rotations/scales to match the word existing inside the provided bounding box 113 (or word patch), and keeps or selects the binary or candidate word template with the highest correlation or score with image 105 , as word template 116 .
- the resulting word template 116 may provide a match that gives a pretty accurate and tight bounding box for the whole word (from image 105 ) but whose character bounding boxes may be not be precisely aligned with the corresponding actual characters of image 105 . This may be due, in part, because of distortions in image 105 that may not be fully accounted for in word template 116 or of a mismatch between a rendered font and an actual font.
- a second step, which may be applied by system 100 is to refine the character boxes or character bounding boxes.
- Character box refiner 118 may perform translations or apply orientations to each character box from word template 116 to produce one or more char templates 120 .
- the translations or orientations may be applied around the position predicted by the word match or word template 116 .
- the adjustment to the character bounding boxes may be performed to increase a correlation between the character bounding boxes and the corresponding characters from the real image 105 , whereby the character bounding boxes that most closely correlate to image 105 may be selected as char templates 120 .
- this refinement may be limited or constrained to small displacements in order to avoid letters from drifting away and/or moving so far as to no longer match neighboring characters (char templates 120 ) with similar shape.
- output formatter 122 may apply a filter based on the normalized-cross-correlation (NCC) score and/or the relative position of characters to reject bad matches based on threshold 126 .
- NCC normalized-cross-correlation
- This may produce more accurate character ground truth data or training data 124 that may be used for training OCR engine 130 .
- the operation of system 100 is described further below with respect to method 200 but is not necessarily intended to limit the method 200 to the structure of system 100 .
- FIG. 2 is a flow chart of an example computer-implemented method 200 for obtaining data for training an OCR engine.
- coarse ground truth data may be stored.
- database 128 may store coarse ground truth data 103 .
- Coarse ground truth data 103 may include an image 105 taken in an uncontrolled environment, whereby image 105 may include some text, words or other characters or symbols.
- Coarse ground truth data 103 may also include a transcription 109 of the text appearing in image 105 and a bounding box 113 loosely indicating where within the image the text appears or where the image is to be cropped.
- character ground truth data may be automatically extracted from the coarse ground truth data.
- input formatter 112 may crop a word patch from image 105 based on bounding box 113 , from which template generator 114 may generate word template 116 that includes a font, from a plurality of fonts, selected and oriented to most closely correspond to the text from the word patch.
- character box refiner 118 may adjust the character boxes of the word patch and produce one or more char templates 120 .
- Char templates 120 may provide tighter bounding boxes around one or more portions of the text of image 105 (in contrast to the looser word bounding box 113 received by input formatter 112 ). So, for example, though coarse ground truth data 103 may include word-level ground truth data including and/or about image 105 , the system may automatically extract the character or character-level ground truth data 124 as described above.
- the character ground truth data may be output to train an OCR engine.
- output formatter 122 may rescale char template(s) 120 to generate character ground truth data 124 .

- character ground truth data may be output for storage as training data.
- output formatter 122 may score character ground truth data 124 based on its correlation to the image 105 and/or word patch.
