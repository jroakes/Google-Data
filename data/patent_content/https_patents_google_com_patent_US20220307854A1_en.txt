- Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to a computing system that can generate geolocation information that includes the geographic location of a user device that detects surfaces (e.g., ground surfaces) using sensors.
- the disclosed technology can be used to generate indications of a geographic location based on matching segment signatures associated with images of a surface to stored segment signatures associated with stored images of stored geographic locations.
- the disclosed technology is advantageous partly because a geographic location of a user device can be determined without the need for external communication, and therefore can be carried out even at locations in which Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) signals or cellular connectivity is unavailable or limited.
- GPS Global Positioning Satellite
- On-device geolocation can also be more efficient due to the reduction in resource consumption and latency that results from not having to communicate with external sources (e.g., GPS or other location data).
- external sources e.g., GPS or other location data.
- the indications generated by the disclosed technology can be used in various ways including geolocation of various devices including personal computing devices and/or vehicles.
- the geographic location of the user device can be determined on-device by using a camera of the user device and a database of stored segment signatures. On-device determination of the geographic location of the user device means that the user device is not required to resort to the use of external signals including global positioning system signals and/or cellular tower signals.
- the geolocation information generated by the disclosed technology can be used to determine the location of a vehicle as it travels through an environment (e.g., a city center with skyscrapers that block cellular signals) in which the availability or accuracy of other forms of geolocation is limited.
- the disclosed technology can be implemented in a computing system and/or computing device (e.g., a user device) that is configured to access data (e.g., send and/or receive data), perform operations on the data (e.g., detect features of images, generate segment signatures, and match the segment signatures to stored segment signatures), and generate output including indications associated with the geographic location of the computing device within the geographic area.
- data e.g., send and/or receive data
- perform operations on the data e.g., detect features of images, generate segment signatures, and match the segment signatures to stored segment signatures
- output including indications associated with the geographic location of the computing device within the geographic area.
- the computing system and/or computing device can be used by a vehicle that is operated within a geographic area and is configured to send and/or receive data and/or information from the computing system and/or computing device.
- the computing system can include a server that receives data associated with the geographic location of a user device.
- the computing device can receive location request data based on a user's request for the current geographic location of the user device. For example, a user can issue a voice command requesting the current geographic location of the user device.
- the computing device can access images of segments of the surface of the environment in which the computing device is located. The computing device can then use the images to generate segment signatures that are associated with unique features of the images. The computing device can then determine whether the segment signatures match stored segment signatures associated with previously visited geographic locations.
- the computing device can, for example, use a hash function and hash table to determine if a segment signature matches one of the stored segment signatures associated with the hash table. If the segment signature matches a stored segment signature, the geographic location of the user device can be determined and the computing device can generate output including an indication (e.g., text displayed on a display of the user device) of the geographic location of the user device.
- the disclosed technology can improve the effectiveness and safety of geolocation by providing a user with the location of a user device that can be determined on-device.
- the use of segment signatures can provide a user with a location that can be within a meter or several centimeters of their actual location, which is in contrast with other ways of determining geographic location that can be much less precise.
- the disclosed technology can assist a user in more effectively performing the technical task of geolocation in a potentially complex environment that may include structures that obstruct signals that may otherwise be used to determine the geographic location of a computing device.
- the disclosed technology can also indicate previously visited locations based on the stored geographic locations.
- the computing device can determine its geographic location rapidly on the device itself, thereby avoiding superfluous communications which can drain the device's battery. Furthermore, through reduction of unnecessary communications with a remote source, network resources (e.g., network bandwidth) can be conserved. In this way, the present disclosure provides a way to perform the technical task of geolocation in a manner that reduces power consumption and preserves network resources.
- network resources e.g., network bandwidth
- the computing system can access, receive, obtain, retrieve, and/or generate location request data associated with a request for a geographic location of a user device in an environment.
- the term “environment” used herein can refer to a geographic area in which the user device is located (e.g., the general geographic area proximate the user device).
- the geographic location that is determined using the disclosed techniques can refer to the specific location of the device within that environment.
- the environment can include a geographic area within a predetermined distance and/or radius of the user device and/or the geographic area within the range of one or more sensors associated with the user device.
- the location request data can be received based at least in part on a user interaction with the computing system in which the user requests the current location of a user device (e.g., a vehicle or smartphone) that the user is using.
- a user can interact with the user interface of a computing device and use one or more tactile interactions (e.g., pressing visual user interface elements) and/or auditory interactions (e.g., make a spoken request for the current location of the user device) to generate the location request data that can be used to obtain the geographic location of the user device.
- tactile interactions e.g., pressing visual user interface elements
- auditory interactions e.g., make a spoken request for the current location of the user device
- the location request data can be generated by the computing system on a periodic basis or when some condition has been satisfied.
- the computing system can generate the location request data periodically after some predetermined amount of time (e.g., every five (5) seconds, every minute, or every hour).
- the computing system can generate the location request data when a condition such as the current location of the user device not being determined for more than a predetermined amount of time has been met.
- the location request data can be generated when the geographic location of the user device has not been determined for more than thirty (30) seconds.
- a user does not have to interact with the computing system in order for the location request data to be generated.
- the location request data can be automatically generated on a periodic basis. As such, user distractions can be mitigated, thereby enabling an improvement in the safety of geolocation as described herein.

FIG. 10 depicts a flow diagram of surface detection and geolocation according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. - Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the embodiments, not limitation of the present disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that aspects of the present disclosure cover such modifications and variations.
- Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to a computing system that can generate geolocation information that includes the geographic location of a user device that detects surfaces (e.g., ground surfaces) using sensors. In particular, the disclosed technology can be used to generate indications of a geographic location based on matching segment signatures associated with images of a surface to stored segment signatures associated with stored images of stored geographic locations. As described in more detail below, the disclosed technology is advantageous partly because a geographic location of a user device can be determined without the need for external communication, and therefore can be carried out even at locations in which Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) signals or cellular connectivity is unavailable or limited. On-device geolocation can also be more efficient due to the reduction in resource consumption and latency that results from not having to communicate with external sources (e.g., GPS or other location data). The indications generated by the disclosed technology can be used in various ways including geolocation of various devices including personal computing devices and/or vehicles.
- Further, the geographic location of the user device can be determined on-device by using a camera of the user device and a database of stored segment signatures. On-device determination of the geographic location of the user device means that the user device is not required to resort to the use of external signals including global positioning system signals and/or cellular tower signals. By way of example, the geolocation information generated by the disclosed technology can be used to determine the location of a vehicle as it travels through an environment (e.g., a city center with skyscrapers that block cellular signals) in which the availability or accuracy of other forms of geolocation is limited.
- The disclosed technology can be implemented in a computing system and/or computing device (e.g., a user device) that is configured to access data (e.g., send and/or receive data), perform operations on the data (e.g., detect features of images, generate segment signatures, and match the segment signatures to stored segment signatures), and generate output including indications associated with the geographic location of the computing device within the geographic area. In some embodiments, the computing system and/or computing device can be used by a vehicle that is operated within a geographic area and is configured to send and/or receive data and/or information from the computing system and/or computing device. Furthermore, the computing system can include a server that receives data associated with the geographic location of a user device.
- By way of further example, the computing device (e.g., a user device) can receive location request data based on a user's request for the current geographic location of the user device. For example, a user can issue a voice command requesting the current geographic location of the user device. In response to receiving the location request data, the computing device can access images of segments of the surface of the environment in which the computing device is located. The computing device can then use the images to generate segment signatures that are associated with unique features of the images. The computing device can then determine whether the segment signatures match stored segment signatures associated with previously visited geographic locations. The computing device can, for example, use a hash function and hash table to determine if a segment signature matches one of the stored segment signatures associated with the hash table. If the segment signature matches a stored segment signature, the geographic location of the user device can be determined and the computing device can generate output including an indication (e.g., text displayed on a display of the user device) of the geographic location of the user device.
- Accordingly, the disclosed technology can improve the effectiveness and safety of geolocation by providing a user with the location of a user device that can be determined on-device. For example, the use of segment signatures can provide a user with a location that can be within a meter or several centimeters of their actual location, which is in contrast with other ways of determining geographic location that can be much less precise. Further, the disclosed technology can assist a user in more effectively performing the technical task of geolocation in a potentially complex environment that may include structures that obstruct signals that may otherwise be used to determine the geographic location of a computing device. In addition to improving the safety of geolocation by allowing the user to determine their geographic location without using external signals, the disclosed technology can also indicate previously visited locations based on the stored geographic locations.
- As such a number of advantages can be realized. First, by reducing and/or eliminating the need to communicate with a remote source, the computing device can determine its geographic location rapidly on the device itself, thereby avoiding superfluous communications which can drain the device's battery. Furthermore, through reduction of unnecessary communications with a remote source, network resources (e.g., network bandwidth) can be conserved. In this way, the present disclosure provides a way to perform the technical task of geolocation in a manner that reduces power consumption and preserves network resources.
- The computing system can access, receive, obtain, retrieve, and/or generate location request data associated with a request for a geographic location of a user device in an environment. The term “environment” used herein can refer to a geographic area in which the user device is located (e.g., the general geographic area proximate the user device). The geographic location that is determined using the disclosed techniques can refer to the specific location of the device within that environment. In some embodiments, the environment can include a geographic area within a predetermined distance and/or radius of the user device and/or the geographic area within the range of one or more sensors associated with the user device.
- The location request data can be received based at least in part on a user interaction with the computing system in which the user requests the current location of a user device (e.g., a vehicle or smartphone) that the user is using. For example, a user can interact with the user interface of a computing device and use one or more tactile interactions (e.g., pressing visual user interface elements) and/or auditory interactions (e.g., make a spoken request for the current location of the user device) to generate the location request data that can be used to obtain the geographic location of the user device.
- Further, the location request data can be generated by the computing system on a periodic basis or when some condition has been satisfied. For example, the computing system can generate the location request data periodically after some predetermined amount of time (e.g., every five (5) seconds, every minute, or every hour). By way of further example, the computing system can generate the location request data when a condition such as the current location of the user device not being determined for more than a predetermined amount of time has been met. For example, the location request data can be generated when the geographic location of the user device has not been determined for more than thirty (30) seconds. In the preceding examples, a user does not have to interact with the computing system in order for the location request data to be generated. The location request data can be automatically generated on a periodic basis. As such, user distractions can be mitigated, thereby enabling an improvement in the safety of geolocation as described herein.
- The computing system can access, receive, retrieve, and/or obtain data and/or information including one or more images of one or more segments of a surface of the environment. The one or more segments of the surface of the environment can be associated with the one or more images. Further, the one or more images can include color, greyscale, and/or black and white images of one or more segments of a surface that, in some embodiments, can be the same resolution (e.g. twelve (12) megapixel images) or different resolutions; and/or have the same color depth (e.g. 24-bit) or different color depth (e.g., 8-bit). The one or more images of the surface of the environment can be captured from various angles. For example, the one or more images of the surface of the environment can be captured at a direct top view angle. In some embodiments, the angle at which the one or more images are captured can be an oblique angle (e.g., the lens of the camera is tilted one (1) to fifteen (15) degrees from being parallel to the ground).
- The one or more segments of a surface can include one or more segments of any size (e.g., the same size or different sizes) of a surface of an environment. The surface can be associated with any number of the one or more segments (e.g., a single segment or a plurality of segments). Further, the surface can include any type of surface. For example, the surface can include a ground surface (e.g., a road, a sidewalk, a field, a lawn, a street, a bridge, and/or a parking lot) that can include any type of artificial material (e.g., concrete, asphalt, brick, metal, gravel, wood, rubber, glass, and/or plastic) and/or natural material (e.g., grass, dirt, and/or clay). Further, the surface can include one or more surfaces of walls (e.g., walls of buildings and/or tunnels), one or more surfaces of curbs, one or more surfaces of road barriers, and/or one or more surfaces of trees. The surfaces can include painted surfaces that can include ground surfaces (e.g., road surfaces or street surfaces) that include lane markings, speed indications, and/or other traffic markings. Further, the road surfaces can include one or more surfaces of urban roads, highways, and/or alleyways.
- In some embodiments, the one or more images can be based at least in part on detection of the environment by one or more sensors that can include one or more visible spectrum cameras, one or more infrared cameras, one or more light detection and ranging (LiDAR) devices, and/or one or more sonar devices. For example, the one or more sensors can include one or more cameras that are directed at the surface of the environment, and which are configured to capture the one or more images of the surface of the environment. By way of further example, the one or more images of the one or more segments of the surface of the environment can be based at least in part on one or more still images captures by the one or more cameras and/or motion video imagery captured by the one or more cameras.
- In some embodiments, the one or more images can be based at least in part on a plurality of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) returns associated with the geographic area. For example, the one or more images of the geographic area can include one or more LiDAR returns that are based at least in part on detection of the one or more segments of the surface of the environment.
- Further, the one or more images can be based at least in part on any combination of the one or more images captured by a plurality of the sensors. For example, the one or more images can be based at least in part on some combination of the one or more images captured by a visual spectrum camera and an infrared camera. Using multiple types of sensors to capture the one or more images may result in more effective image capture and can provide one type of imagery (e.g., infrared) where another type of imagery does not capture an adequate image.
- Accessing, receiving, and/or obtaining the one or more images can be based at least in part on the location request data. For example, the location request data can cause the computing system to access one or more images of the surface of the environment that were captured by one or more sensors (e.g., one or more cameras). By way of further example, the location request data can cause the computing system to use the one or more sensors to capture the one or more images of the surface of the environment. In this way, the one or more images can be captured at the time when the location request data is requested by the user and/or accessed by the device. As such the captured image can provide an accurate representation of the location of the device at the time the request is made. Additionally, capturing the one or more images at the time the location request is requested may result in less usage of storage space, which will not be unnecessarily occupied by previously captured images, thereby making better use of the storage space available on the user device.
- The computing system can generate and/or determine one or more segment signatures. The one or more segment signatures can be generated based at least in part on the one or more images. For example, the computing system can analyze the one or more images to determine one or more features of each of the one or more images. The one or more features of the one or more images can then be used to determine the one or more segment signatures which can uniquely identify each of the one or more segment signatures. For example, the visual appearance of each of the one or more segment signatures can be used to generate a unique numerical value that can be associated with the one or more segment signatures respectively.
- Generating the one or more segment signatures can include determining one or more features of the one or more images based at least in part on performance of one or more feature detection operations on the one or more images. For example, the one or more images can be used as part of an input on which the one or more feature detection operations including detection of one or more visual features.
- Further, generating the one or more segment signatures can include generating the one or more segment signatures based at least in part on the one or more features of the one or more images. For example, each of the one or more features of the one or more images can be associated with a feature value, which in combination with other features can be used to generate a unique identifier for an image that can be used as a segment signature.
- In some embodiments, the one or more features can include one or more features associated with the surface of the environment. The one or more features of the surface of the environment can include one or more road surface textures, one or more road markings, and/or one or more pavement cracks. Further, the one or more features of the surface that are depicted in the one or more images can include one or more colors, one or more shapes, and/or one or more textures.
- The one or more images can include a plurality of points (e.g., pixels) each of which includes information associated with visual information of the image including a hue, saturation, and brightness. In some embodiments, the computing system can determine the one or more features of the one or more images based at least in part on analysis of a plurality of feature vectors that are associated with each of the plurality of points in each of the one or more images respectively.
- In some embodiments, the one or more stored signatures can be associated with one or more time stamps respectively. The computing system can use the one or more time stamps to organize the one or more stored signatures based on the time of day and/or the time of year at which the one or more stored signatures were generated. The computing system can, in some embodiments, match the one or more segment signatures to the one or more stored segment signatures based at least in part on the one or more time stamps. For example, if the time of day is noon, the one or more segment signatures can, if possible, be compared to one or more stored segment signatures that were generated during the day. Further, the computing system can compare the one or more segment signatures that were generated during the summer to one or more stored segment signatures with timestamps that indicate the one or more stored segment signatures were generated during the summer. The use of the one or more time stamps can improve the accuracy of matching segment signatures to stored segment signatures, because the appearance of the associated images may change based at least in part on the time of day and/or year (e.g., a different season). Further, the use of the one or more time stamps can lead to more accurate geolocation determination, since the one or more segment signatures may be more likely to correctly match the one or more stored segment signatures.
- In some embodiments, the one or more feature detection operations can include one or more operations associated with a scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique, one or more operations associated with a gradient location and orientation histogram technique, and/or one or more operations associated with a histogram of oriented gradients technique. For example, the scale-invariant feature transform technique can be applied to the one or more images to determine one or more features of the one or more images that are unique and which can be used to generate the one or more segment signatures. By way of further example, the computing system can use SIFT to perform one or more operations including extraction of the one or more features of the one or more images in a manner that is less susceptible to changes in image scale, illumination, and/or noise.
- The computing system can determine the geographic location of the user device and/or the one or more segments associated with the one or more images. The geographic location of the user device and/or the one or more segments of the one or more images can be based at least in part on one or more segment signatures that match one or more stored segment signatures respectively associated with one or more stored geographic locations. The one or more segment signatures can be based at least in part on the one or more images of the one or more segments of the surface of the environment. For example, the computing system can perform one or more operations including one or more comparisons of the one or more segment signatures to the one or more stored segment signatures. Based at least in part on the one or more comparisons, the computing system can determine the one or more segment signatures that match the one or more stored segment signatures. Each of the one or more stored geographic locations can be associated with one or more respective latitudes, one or more respective longitudes, and/or one or more respective altitudes (the elevation).
- Matching the one or more segment signatures to the one or more stored segment signatures can be based on a level of similarity between the one or more segment signatures and the one or more stored segment signatures exceeding a threshold level of similarity. By way of example, the threshold level of similarity can be associated with a proportional amount (e.g., a percentage of matches between the one or more segment signatures and the one or more stored segment signatures) and/or a predetermined amount (e.g., a number of one or more features of the one or more segment signatures that match one or more features of the one or more stored segment signatures).
- In some embodiments, determining the geographic location of the user device and/or the one or more segments associated with the one or more images; and/or determining the one or more segment signatures that match one or more stored segment signatures can include determining whether the one or more segment signatures satisfy one or more matching criteria. The one or more matching criteria can be associated with an amount of similarity between the one or more segment signatures and the one or more stored segment signatures. For example, an amount of similarity can be a proportion of the information in a segment signature that is the same as the information in a stored segment signature. Further, satisfying the one or more matching criteria can include a predetermined portion of the one or more features associated with the one or more segment signatures matching one or more stored features associated with the one or more stored segment signatures. Further, the one or more matching criteria can include a threshold similarity. Satisfying the one or more matching criteria can include an amount of the one or more features associated with the one or more segments exceeding the threshold similarity. For example, a segment signature can be determined to match a stored segment signature if greater than ninety-nine percent (99%) of the information in the segment signature matches the information in the stored segment signature. By way of further example, the segment signature can be determined to match a stored segment signature if greater than eighty-five percent (85%) of the information in the segment signature matches the information in the stored segment signature.
- In some embodiments, the threshold similarity can be a different value ranging from a low level of matching (e.g., at least ten percent (10%) matching between the one or more segment signatures and the one or more stored segment signatures), to an intermediate level of matching (e.g., at least fifty percent (50%) matching between the one or more segment signatures and the one or more stored segment signatures), to a high level of matching (e.g., at least eighty percent (80%) matching between the one or more segment signatures and the one or more stored segment signatures).
- In some embodiments, the one or more stored segment signatures and/or the associated one or more stored geographic locations can be indexed in a hash table. For example, each of the one or more stored segment signatures can be an index value in the hash table or associated with a corresponding index value in the hash table. The hash table can then be used to determine whether any of the one or more segment signatures match the one or more stored segment signatures in the hash table.
- Further, determining the geographic location of the user device and/or the one or more segments associated with the one or more images; can include determining, by the user device, based at least in part on use of a hash function, the one or more segment signatures that match the one or more stored segment signatures that are indexed in the hash table. For example, each of the one or more stored segment signatures can be respectively associated with a corresponding stored geographic location. When a segment signature is determined to match a stored segment signature, the stored geographic location associated with the stored segment signature can be determined to be the location of the user device.
- Determining the geographic location of the user device can include performing one or more sequence matching operations to determine similarity between one or more sequences of the one or more segment signatures and one or more sequences of the one or more stored segment signatures. For example, the computing device can determine that the one or more segment signatures include two or more segment signatures and can then compare sequences (each sequence including at least two segment signatures) to a sequence of the one or more stored segment signatures that includes at least two stored segment signatures. Similarity between the one or more segment signatures can be based at least in part on a predetermined portion or threshold amount of the sequence of the one or more segment signatures matching a sequence of the one or more stored segment signatures.
- Further, determining the geographic location of the user device can include determining that the one or more segment signatures match the one or more stored segment signatures when a threshold amount of the one or more sequences of the one or more segment signatures matches the one or more sequences of the one or more stored segment signatures. The threshold amount can be a predetermined portion of the one or more sequences of the one or more segment signatures match the one or more sequences of the one or more stored segment signatures. By way of example only, the threshold amount can be a ninety-nine percent (99%) proportion, a ninety-five percent (95%) proportion, or a ninety percent (90%) proportion of the one or more sequences of the one or more segment signatures matching the one or more sequences of the one or more stored segment signatures.
- The computing system can access data and/or information that can include map data. The map data can include information associated with a geographic area. For example, the map data can include one or more maps of a geographic area that can include one or more map indications to show the locations of roads, buildings, bodies of water (e.g., lakes, rivers, and/or canals), natural geographic features (e.g., mountains). Further, the map data can include street addresses, the locations of landmarks (e.g., famous buildings and/or statues). The map data can include a three-dimensional representation of the geographic area. For example, the map data can include topographical features of the geographic area. In some embodiments, the map data can be associated with the most recently determined location of the user device. For example, the map data can include information associated with a fifty (50) kilometer radius around the most recently determined location of the user device. Further, in some embodiments, the map data can include a map of a geographic area including any portion of a nation, a state, a province, a county, and/or a city or town.
- The computing system can generate one or more indications that can include information associated with the geographic location of the user device within the geographic area. The one or more indications can include text, images (e.g., photographs, icons, pictures, and/or a graphical user interface), and/or auditory indications (e.g., a synthetic voice announcing information associated with the geographic location). Further, the one or more indications can include data and/or information that can be communicated to another computing system. For example, the one or more indications can include information associated with the location of the user device that can be communicated to a remote computing system or an autonomous vehicle associated with the user device. By way of further example, the one or more indications can include one or more indications can include a set of coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude, and/or altitude associated with the geographic location of the user device).
- The one more indications can include a visual representation of the user device within the geographic area. For example, the visual representation can include a map of a predetermined portion of the geographic area (e.g., a square shaped twenty (20) square kilometer area) with an indicator of the user device at the center of the map.
- The computing system can determine one or more street addresses and/or one or more landmarks located within a predetermined distance of the geographic location of the user device. For example, the computing system can use map data and the geographic location of the user device to determine the street addresses of streets and one or more landmarks within a one (1) kilometer radius of the user device.
- The computing system can generate one or more indications associated with the one or more street addresses or one or more landmarks. For example, the computing device can generate one or more visual indications that show the location of the one or more street addresses and/or one or more landmarks. The one or more visual indications can include textual descriptions (e.g., the names of streets and roads) and/or imagery that can show the location of the user computing device relative to the one or more street addresses and one or more landmarks. Further, the computing system can generate auditory indications that include announcements of the relative location of the one or more street addresses and/or one or more landmarks. For example, the computing system can announce when a street intersection or famous landmark (e.g., a statue of a famous artist) is nearby.
- The computing system can generate one or more indications that can include a distance and/or orientation of the user device relative to the one or more street addresses or one or more landmarks. For example, the computing system can generate an auditory indication that the user device is north of a particular street or that a particular landmark is fifty meters away to the east of the user device.
- The computing system can determine, based at least in part on the one or more segment signatures, one or more stored segment signatures respectively associated with one or more stored geographic locations that were previously traversed from the geographic location of the user device. For example, the computing system can access data including the one or more stored segment signatures and can determine the one or more stored segment signatures that are associated with stored geographic locations that are within a predetermined distance (e.g., fifty (50) meters) of the geographic location of the user device.
- The computing system can generate a map of the geographic area that can include one or more indications associated with the one or more stored geographic locations that were previously traversed from the geographic location of the user device. For example, the computing system can generate a map that includes the geographic location of the user device marked in a first color (e.g., green) and the one or more stored geographic locations that were previously traversed marked in a second color (e.g., red).
- The computing system can generate a visual representation that can include a contiguous set of the one or more stored geographic locations that were previously traversed from the geographic location of the user device. For example, the computing system can determine the one or more stored geographic locations that are contiguous (e.g., within a predetermined distance of one another). Further, the computing system can generate a visual representation in which a set of the one or more geographic locations that are contiguous is shown on a map of the geographic area within five (5) kilometers of the user device.
- The computing system can determine an amount of ambient light associated with the surface of the environment. For example, the computing system can use one or more sensors (e.g., one or more cameras) that are proximate the surface (e.g., within twenty (20) centimeters of the surface) to detect the amount of ambient light around the surface.
- Further, the computing system can adjust a brightness or intensity of light that is cast on the one or more segments. Adjusting the brightness or intensity of light can be based at least in part on the amount of ambient light. For example, the computing system can adjust the brightness of light cast by a light source (e.g., an LED bulb) that is proximate the surface to reach a predetermined brightness level. When the amount of ambient light is below the predetermined brightness level, the amount of light cast by the light source can be increased. When the amount of ambient light is above the predetermined brightness level, the amount of light cast by the light source can be decreased or shut off entirely.
- The computing system can generate one or more new stored signatures based at least in part on the one or more segment signatures that do not match the one or more stored segment signatures. For example, the computing system can perform one or more operations including one or more comparisons of the one or more segment structures to the one or more stored segment signatures. Based at least in part on the one or more comparisons, the computing system can determine that the one or more segment structures that do not match the one or more stored segment signatures are new and can generate the one or more new stored segment signatures that include the one or more segment signatures that do not match the one or more stored segment signatures.
- The computing system can determine, based at least in part on secondary geographic location data, one or more new geographic locations associated with the one or more new stored signatures. For example, the computing system can access secondary geographic location data that is based at least in part on data and/or information from a navigation device that can be used to determine the location of the user device (e.g., a GPS device). The secondary geographic location data can include information associated with the location of the user device including a latitude, longitude, and/or altitude of the user device.
- The computing system can associate the one or more new geographic locations with the one or more new stored segment signatures. For example, the computing system can perform one or more operations to link the one or more new geographic locations to the corresponding one or more new stored segment signatures such that retrieving the one or more new stored segment signatures also retrieves the corresponding one or more new geographic locations.
- The computing system can add the one or more new stored segment signatures to the one or more stored signatures. For example, the computing system can perform one or more operations to add the one or more new stored segment signatures to the one or more stored segment signatures that previously existed. In this way, the one or more stored segment signatures can be updated based on the one or more new geographic locations visited by the user device. In some embodiments, the computing system can add the one or more new stored segment signatures to a remote computing system on a periodic basis (e.g., weekly or daily) or whenever the remote computing system is accessible.
- In some embodiments, the secondary geographic location data can be based at least in part on one or more localization operations that can include use of one or more global positioning system signals, one or more location beacons, or odometry. For example, the one or more localization operations can include accessing and/or receiving a GPS signal that includes the current location (e.g., latitude, longitude, and/or altitude) of the user device.
- In some embodiments, the one or more stored signatures can be indexed using one or more spatial trees or one or more binary trees. Indexing the one or more stored signatures in one or more spatial trees can allow for faster search and retrieval of the associated one or more stored signatures that are indexed.
- In some embodiments, the one or more stored segment signatures can be based at least in part on a historical average of one or more features associated with one or more stored segment signatures. The historical average can be associated with one or more stored segment signatures that are respectively associated with one or more stored segments of the same one or more geographic locations. For example, each of the one or more stored segment signatures can be associated with one or more features of one or more images of one or more stored segments (e.g., one or more images of the one or more stored segments of a surface of an environment that were captured at some time in the past) upon which the one or more stored segment signatures are based. The historical average of the one or more stored segment signatures can be generated and/or determined over a predetermined period of time (e.g., three (3) months or one (1) year from a particular start date to an end date) in the past. In some embodiments, the historical average of the one or more stored segment signatures can be generated and/or determined based on a period of time relative to a current time (e.g., the three (3) months prior to or including the current day).
- As such, the historical average of the one or more features associated with the one or more stored segment signatures can account for variations in the appearance of the surface (e.g., the surface at a particular geographic location) over time (e.g., a ground surface and/or wall surface can become worn over time and can accumulate damage and other wear and tear as a result of being used). Accounting for variations in the appearance of the ground surface over time can result in one or more segment signatures that are more accurately matched to one or more corresponding stored segment signatures, despite variations in the appearance of the same surface over time. Using a historical average associated with the one or more features of the one or more stored segment signatures increases the probability of obtaining geolocation information even when an image associated with a segment signature does not exactly match the appearance of an image associated with a stored segment signature (due to variations). As such, the segment signature may still be matched with the correct corresponding stored segment signature.
- In some embodiments, the one or more stored segment signatures can be generated based at least in part on the historical average associated with the one or more features of one or more stored segment signatures. For example, the one or more stored segment signatures can be updated when one or more new (e.g., one or more images that are more recent than the one or more images a stored segment signature is based on) images of a geographic location that is associated with one or more stored segment signatures are generated. The updated one or more stored segment signatures can be based on a set including the most recent segment signature that was generated and/or one or more previously generated stored signatures. By way of further example, the one or more stored segment signatures can be periodically updated (e.g., daily, monthly, quarterly, and/or annually) and the historical average can be associated with a predetermined period of time in the past (e.g., the last twelve (12) months or the last six (6) months).
- In some embodiments, the user device can include a vehicle and/or a personal computing device. Further, the one or more sensors can be located on one or more portions of a vehicle. The one or more portions of the vehicle can include one or more bumpers of a vehicle, an undercarriage of the vehicle, an/or one or more side panels of the vehicle. Further, the one or more sensors can be located on a computing device (e.g., a personal computing device including a smartphone, a tablet computing device, and/or a laptop computing device) that includes one or more sensors on a front facing side (e.g., a selfie camera) of the computing device or a rear facing side of the computing device (e.g., a camera that is opposite the display of the computing device).
- By way of example, the one or more sensors on an undercarriage of a vehicle (e.g., an automobile) can capture one or more images of a surface (e.g., ground surface below the vehicle). Further, one or more sensors on the side panels of a vehicle (e.g., on the driver doors and/or passenger doors of the vehicle) can capture one or more images of surfaces located to the side of the vehicle including walls, buildings, sidewalks, and/or curbs. Furthermore, one or more sensors located on smartphone can capture one or more images of a sidewalk, trail, parking lot, and/or other location that a pedestrian brings the smartphone.

The user device can be associated with one or more satellites that captures one or more images of a surface of an environment using one or more cameras that can focus on one or more segments of the environment at high resolution (e.g., a thirty (30) centimeter or smaller resolution), medium resolution (e.g., a ten (10) meter to thirty (30) meter resolution), and/or low resolution (e.g., fifty (50) meter or greater resolution).
- The computing system can control one or more vehicle systems of a vehicle. Control of the vehicle can be based at least in part on the one or more indications. The one or more vehicle systems can include one or more motor systems, one or more steering systems, one or more notification systems, and/or one or more braking systems.
- For example, the computing system can use information and/or data associated with the one or more indications (e.g., the current location of the vehicle) to operate a vehicle by guiding the vehicle based on its current location in relation to a destination. Further, the computing system can use the geographic location of the vehicle to avoid contact with an object along a route to a destination. In some embodiments, the vehicle can include an autonomous vehicle (e.g., an autonomous automobile, an autonomous boat, or an autonomous aircraft) that can operate without intervention from a human operator and can which be configured to travel to a destination safely.
- In some embodiments, the vehicle can include a land-based vehicles, a water based vehicle, an amphibious vehicle, and/or an aircraft. The land-based vehicle can include a wheeled vehicle, a tracked vehicle, and/or a walking vehicle (e.g., a bipedal vehicle or quadrupedal vehicle) that can traverse the land. The water based vehicle can include a boat or a submersible. The amphibious vehicle can include a hovercraft. Further, the aircraft can include a fixed wing aircraft, a tilt wing aircraft, and/or a rotor-based aircraft (e.g., single rotor aircraft or multi-rotor aircraft) that can fly.
- In some embodiments, the computing system can perform one or more noise reduction operations to filter surface detritus from the one or more images of the one or more segments. For example, the computing system can perform one or more noise reduction operations to filter leaves, pebbles, and/or other surface detritus from the one or more images. The surface detritus can include detritus that is of a more temporary nature and malleable nature (e.g., fallen leaves) in comparison to more long lasting surface features (e.g., the surface pattern of concrete).
- The disclosed technology can include a computing system (e.g., a geolocation computing system) that is configured to perform various operations associated with geolocation based on matching segment signatures to stored segment signatures. Further, the computing system can be configured to generate, process, receive, and/or send information associated with geolocation information. In some embodiments, the geolocation computing system can be associated with various computing systems and/or devices that use, send, receive, and/or generate indications associated with geographic areas. Furthermore, the geolocation computing system can process, generate, modify, and/or access (e.g., send, and/or receive) data and/or information including sensor data and/or image data that are associated with a geographic area.
- The computing system and/or computing device (e.g., a user device and/or a geolocation computing device) can include specialized hardware and/or software that enable the performance of one or more operations specific to the disclosed technology. The computing system and/or computing device can include one or more application specific integrated circuits that are configured to perform operations associated with receiving location request data associated with a request for a geographic location of a user device in an environment, accessing, based at least in part on the location request data, one or more images of one or more segments of a surface of the environment, generating one or more segment signatures based at least in part on the one or more images, determining the geographic location of the user device based at least in part on the one or more segment signatures that match one or more stored segment signatures respectively associated with one or more stored geographic locations, accessing map data including information associated with a geographic area, and generating one or more indications including information associated with the geographic location of the user device within the geographic area.
- In some embodiments, any of the one or more operations performed by the disclosed technology (e.g., determining and/or generating the one or more segment signatures, determining a geographic location of a user device, and/or generating one or more indications associated with the geographic location of the user device) can be performed on-device (e.g., performed on the device itself with limited or no input or communication with external devices and/or systems) and/or in communication with one or more remote devices and/or one or more remote systems that can be configured to perform some portion of the one or more operations described herein.
- By way of example, the geolocation computing system can be configured to control one or more vehicle systems of a vehicle based at least in part on the one or more indications including a latitude, longitude, and altitude of the vehicle. The one or more vehicle systems that are controlled can include vehicle guidance systems that are used to control the movement (e.g., direction and velocity) of the vehicle through an environment (e.g., a geographic area).
- The systems, methods, devices, apparatuses, and tangible non-transitory computer-readable media of the disclosed technology can provide a variety of technical effects and benefits including an improvement in geolocation performance. In particular, the disclosed technology may provide benefits and advantages including an improvement in travel safety, greater geolocation accuracy, improved energy usage and reduced wear and tear by vehicles that use the geolocation information that is generated.
- The disclosed technology can improve travel safety by providing more accurate geolocation information without the need for external signals including GPS or other signals from remote locations. As such, the disclosed technology can allow an individual or a vehicle the individual is travelling in (e.g., a manually operated vehicle or autonomous vehicle) to avoid potential hazards that can occur as a result of geolocation inaccuracies or an absence of geolocation information (e.g., when GPS signals are blocked by tall buildings). For example, by providing improved geolocation information that accurately represents the location of an object within a geographic area, the disclosed technology can reduce the probability that a vehicle will make unintended contact with an obstruction that is present in the environment in which the vehicle is travelling. Further, the improved geolocation information provided by the disclosed technology can be effectively used by autonomous vehicles. For example, the geolocation information provided by the disclosed technology can allow an autonomous vehicle to determine its location without resorting to external sources.
- Further, the geolocation information generated by the disclosed technology can be used in conjunction with a secondary source of geolocation information to further improve the accuracy of the location of a device. For example, the disclosed technology can be used to provide a point of reference from which the position of a vehicle can be further refined using a secondary source of geolocation such as LiDAR.
- Furthermore, the disclosed technology can improve the efficiency of resource consumption (e.g., fuel and/or electrical energy used by vehicles) by using more accurate geolocation information that allows for the generation of travel routes that are shorter. In general, vehicles that travel shorter routes will consume less energy in comparison to travelling along a longer route from the same starting location to the same destination. Further shorter travel routes can also result in less wear and tear on vehicles since the vehicles will have lower usage (e.g., fewer turns, less braking, and lower distance travelled) per trip. Less wear and tear can result in lower costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of vehicles that travel the routes. Additionally, the disclosed technology can improve the efficiency of resource consumption of the computing device itself. On-device geolocation determination can reduce or obviate the need for communication with external devices (e.g., cellular base stations or GPS satellites), thereby reducing network resource consumption as well as power consumption by the computing device.
- The disclosed technology can also be used to reduce the environmental impact (e.g., adverse environmental impact) on a geographic region by minimizing the distances travelled by vehicles that use the geolocation information to traverse an associated route. For example, the distance of a route can be positively correlated with the amount of vehicle exhaust, noise, and air pollution generated by a vehicle. Further, reducing travel time and/or the distance of a route can also reduce the amount of noise pollution (e.g., noise produced by the motors or engines of a vehicle following a route) and visual pollution (e.g., roads clogged with vehicle traffic) that a vehicle produces while traveling through a geographic area.
- As such, the disclosed technology may provide the specific benefits of improved safety, reduced resource consumption, and reduced environmental impact. Further, any of the specific benefits provided to users can be used to improve the effectiveness of a wide variety of devices and services including the operation of vehicles (e.g., manually driven vehicles and/or autonomous vehicles) that use the geolocation information, routing services, delivery services, and/or mapping services. Accordingly, the improvements offered by the disclosed technology can result in tangible benefits to a variety of devices and/or systems including mechanical, electronic, computing systems, and/or computing devices associated with vehicle operation, geolocation, mapping, and/or navigation.
