Embodiment
Search Results is provided in response to specifying the search inquiry of the resource (such as, at least there is the resource of the threshold value relevance score for search inquiry) being identified as response search inquiry.The link that each Search Results one of to generally comprise in the resource of leading to and being identified as in response to search inquiry (such as, active hypertext links), and the request of the resource be linked to for Search Results will be initiated with the user interactions of Search Results.Such as, the hypertext link of the request initiating the homepage to described vendor web site in response to the user interactions with this Search Results can be comprised for the Search Results of electronic retailer.
In some cases, the request for specific resources can cause subscriber equipment to be redirected to another resource (that is, different from requested resource resources).Such as, some publishers create the mobile resources formatd for checking on the mobile devices such as such as mobile phone, and in response to the request for specific resources from mobile device, mobile device are redirected to this mobile resources.Mobile resources is by the resource determining to format for presenting on mobile device, and is that the data of mobile resources can with quoting and stored, to label to it like this this resource by resource identification.Mobile resources can comprise the resource be redirected to by mobile device in response to the request for another resource when non-mobile device (that is, not being identified as the equipment of mobile device) is not redirected after the request for another resource.
When determining to cause mobile device to be redirected to another resource for the request of specific resources, the Search Results for specific resources can comprise the link (or another is quoted) of another resource that originally will be redirected to towards mobile device.Such as, can the link of leading to another resource be inserted in Search Results, make mobile device ask another resource instead of described specific resources in response to the user interactions with Search Results.
Fig. 1 provides the block diagram of the example context 100 of search service for wherein search system 110.Example context 100 comprises network 102, and such as, LAN (Local Area Network) (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet or their combination, described network 102 connects website 104, subscriber equipment 106 and search system 110.Network 102 accesses by wired and/or wireless communication link.Such as, the mobile computing device such as such as smart phone can utilize cellular network to carry out access network.Environment 100 can comprise millions of websites 104 and subscriber equipment 106.
Website 104 is associated with domain name and one or more resources 105 hosted by one or more server.Example web sites is the collections of web pages formatd with the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) (HTML) that can contain text, image, content of multimedia and compile element (such as, script).Each website 104 is safeguarded by publisher, and described publisher is such as management and/or the entity having this website.
Resource 105 be by network 102 (such as, by website 104) provide and be associated with the data of resource address.Only lift a few example, resource 105 comprises html page, word processing document, and Portable Document format (PDF) document, image, video and feed etc.Resource 105 can comprise content, such as, and word, phrase, image and sound, and embedding information (such as, metamessage and hyperlink) can be comprised and/or embed instruction (such as, script).
Subscriber equipment 106 is for being controlled by user and can being asked by network 102 and receive the electronic equipment of resource 105.Exemplary user equipment 106 comprises the personal computer, the mobile computing device (such as, smart phone and/or tablet computing device) that transmit and receive data by network 102.As herein each place uses, term " mobile computing device " (" mobile device ") means to be configured for and carries out by mobile communications network the subscriber equipment that communicates.Smart phone (that is, supporting to carry out by the Internet the phone that communicates) is an example of mobile device.
Subscriber equipment 106 generally includes user's application, and such as, web browser, in order to help to be transmitted and receive data by network 102.Mobile device can utilize " mobile browser " to be transmitted and receive data by network 102.As each place uses herein, mobile browser can be the browser that can be designated installation browser on the mobile apparatus.Mobile browser can so identify: such as, based on version number or indicate this browser be the browser of mobile version one other identification symbol.Such as, browser developers can create the mobile browser specialized in and use on the mobile apparatus, and can be used for for this mobile browser distributes the version number so identifying mobile browser.As being hereafter described in more detail, the user included by the version number of browser and/or other information of relevant browser can be included in the communication from subscriber equipment-act on behalf of in header.
In order to help the search to resource 105, search system 110 is by crawl the resource 105 be provided on website 104 and index carrys out identifying resource 105.The data of related resources 105 can based on corresponding to data in resource and obtain index.Resource 105 through index and be stored in search index 112 through the copy of buffer memory alternatively.
Subscriber equipment 106 submits search inquiry 109 to search system 110.Responsively, search system 110 access search index 112 is with mark relevant to search inquiry 109 (such as, at least having the minimum appointment relevance score for search inquiry 109) resource 105.Search system 110 identifying resource 105, the Search Results 111 of generating identification resource 105, and Search Results 111 is returned to subscriber equipment 106.
Search Results 111 is generated by search system 110, identification response in the data of the resource 105 of particular search query, and can comprise the link towards resource 105.Exemplary search results 111 can comprise the web page title, word fragment or the image section that extract from webpage, and the URL of webpage.
Search Results 111 (such as, SR1, SR2, SR3) presents in result of page searching 114 shown on a user device.The resource (such as, resource A116) causing subscriber equipment 106 to ask to be quoted by this Search Results with the user interactions of Search Results (such as, SR1115).In some implementations, subscriber equipment 106 submits to the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) (" http ") of the resource for the URL(uniform resource locator) (" URL ") be positioned at specified by the Search Results of generation user interactions to ask.Such as, subscriber equipment 106 can be caused to ask the resource A 116 quoted by Search Results SR1115 with the user interactions of Search Results SR1115.In response to this request, cause the data presented of resource A116 can be received by subscriber equipment 106 and for presenting resource A116 on subscriber equipment 106.
In response to some resource request, return to subscriber equipment the data that redirect instruction (such as, guiding subscriber equipment from the data of another network site request msg) replaces (or being additional to) to cause resource to present.Such as, when receiving the request to resource A116 from subscriber equipment, redirect instruction can be provided to subscriber equipment 106, with presenting of instruction this user equipment requests resource B118.Redirect instruction can comprise subscriber equipment 106 will the URL (or another network site) of therefrom request msg.
Redirect instruction can be supplied to subscriber equipment for a variety of reasons.Such as, when unavailable from the data of the subscriber equipment 106 therefrom network site of request msg, redirect instruction can be provided to subscriber equipment 106.Also can provide to the subscriber equipment of particular type and be redirected to attempt the subscriber equipment of this particular type to guide to the resource be created for checking on this particular device.
Such as, some publishers create multiple versions of particular webpage (or another resource), wherein a version of this webpage is formatted for checking on the mobile apparatus, and another version of this webpage is formatted for checking on non-mobile device (that is, not being identified as the equipment of mobile device).In this example, the formatted webpage version for checking on the mobile apparatus can use than the formatted figure less for the webpage version checked on non-mobile device or the more figure of low resolution, less content of multimedia and/or different aspect ratios.As mentioned above, the formatted resource for checking on the mobile apparatus is called as mobile resources, the formatted resource for checking on non-mobile device is then called as desktop resource (such as, desktop webpage), although these resources can be presented on any computing equipment.
When publisher has created multiple version of webpage (or another resource), the mobile device of request desktop webpage can be automatically redirected to the mobile webpage corresponding with this desktop webpage.Such as, suppose the desktop webpage that resource A116 is linked to for Search Results SR1115, and suppose that subscriber equipment 106 is the mobile device of request resource A116.In this example, mobile device can be automatically redirected with request resource B118, to present mobile resources instead of desktop resource on the mobile apparatus.
Some are redirected completely (or only partly) based on the request for resource received from subscriber equipment be identified as mobile device or non-mobile device and initiate, and to describe hereinafter for determining that subscriber equipment is the example technique of mobile device or desk device.But some are redirected can based on the data stored on a user device, such as cookies (cookie).For example, if search supplier also provide other online services, such as online email account, online shopping car or other online services are (such as, social networks, blog trustship, images share service and/or video sharing service), then on-line search supplier can put one or more cookies on the equipment of user, to strengthen Consumer's Experience (such as, carrying out assisted user customized experience by stored user preference or accounts information).
Cookies is the data file of identifying user equipment (such as, using pseudo random number or the data Hash of anonymous identification subscriber equipment) uniquely.The cookies put on a user device generally only can be visited by the entity putting this cookies on a user device.For example, if search service (such as, example.com) supplier puts cookies on special user equipment, then supplier's (such as, example.com server) of this search service will be generally the sole entity can accessing this cookies.
Cookies can be used for identifying previously to access user's (that is, supposing that user has agreed to storage network tracker on their device) of specific website.Such as, cookies can be stored in when they sign in its email account (such as, by input username and password) on their subscriber equipment by the user of network mail service.Access email account after one period of fixed time in, user may can directly turn back to they email account and without the need to again manually inputting user name and/or password.
Such as, suppose after leave (such as, turning to online newpapers and periodicals or search interface) from network E-mail service, the login page of network E-mail service described in user equipment requests.In this example, when storage cookies on a user device (and determining to have not exceeded fixed time limit) being detected, subscriber equipment can be redirected to the webpage of the email account presenting user and not require that user re-enters its user name or password.Use network E-mail service for illustrative purposes, but such as the online service of other employing cookies such as online retailer also can be initiated to be redirected in response to cookies being detected.
Resource also can carry out redirected subscriber equipment based on the brand of subscriber equipment (such as, manufacturer).Such as, mobile phone application developer can create and user equipment requests can be allowed to buy and/or download the webpage of the application created by this developer.For purpose of explanation, suppose that application developer creates the different application version for two or more the different phone brands (such as, brand A and brand B) using different operating system (or different editions of same operation system) separately.In this example, the application for each respective application version can be obtained from different network sites (such as, application market webpage).Therefore, by brand party A-subscriber device redirection to another webpage (such as, for the application market of brand A phone) can therefrom buying and/or download the application version created for brand party A-subscriber equipment.Similarly, webpage can be arranged to brand party B-subscriber device redirection to the webpage (such as, for the application market of brand B phone) therefrom can buying the application version created for brand party B-subscriber equipment.
Instruction to each redirected generation of subscriber equipment for the result of request of resource being stored in heterogeneous networks position.Such as, when user device responsive is redirected to specific resources in asking another resource, subscriber equipment will make two resource request before reception causes the data presented to described specific resources.Along with the increased number be redirected that subscriber equipment is made, the delay between the presenting of initial resource request and resource increases.Therefore, can by reduce subscriber equipment before the presenting of resource needed for the number be redirected of making reduce resource request and resource present between delay.
Environment 100 comprises redirected minimizing device 120, and this device 120 reduces the number be redirected performed by subscriber equipment.Be redirected that to reduce device 120 be data processing equipment, it uses and is redirected data and determines that whether resource of being quoted by Search Results is redirected resource (that is, by the specific resources of the relocating user equipment to different resource of asking specific resources).Be redirected minimizing device 120 and be represented as the autonomous device communicated with search system 110 by network 102, but in some implementations, be redirected minimizing device 120 and can be embodied as a part for search system 120 or a part for another system.
When based on redirected data, redirected minimizing device 120 determines that redirected resource is quoted (such as by particular search result at least in part, link to) time, be redirected minimizing device 120 to insert in described particular search result redirected resource quoting relocating user equipment different resource extremely (such as, hypertext link).Therefore, the request to described different resource will be initiated with the user interactions of particular search result, instead of the request to described redirected resource.Correspondingly, subscriber equipment can be asked different resource and first not ask to be redirected resource.
Redirected data such as can store 122 from redirected data and obtain.Being redirected data, to store 122 be that such data store: its storage appointment one group be redirected resource and for the redirected resource of redirected resource each in this group by the redirected data of relocating user equipment different resource extremely.For example, if the subscriber equipment of request resource A116 is redirected to resource B118, be then redirected data store 112 will comprise specify from resource A116 to resource B118 be redirected redirected data.
In some implementations, redirected data can still only have its proper subclass to be redirected in response to this request by all devices in the subscriber equipment of the specific redirected resource of specified request.For example, if the equipment being only identified as mobile device is just redirected to resource B118 in response to the request to resource A116, then the redirected data for resource A can specify redirected condition to be receive from mobile device the request of resource A116.
Whether redirected data can specify redirected condition to be other factors further, such as on the subscriber equipment of therefrom request resource, cookies detected.For example, if only just there is being redirected from resource A116 to resource B118 when determining that particular network tracker is stored on a user device, the redirected data condition be redirected to resource B118 of can specifying then for resource A there is particular network tracker (such as, previously by publisher's storing cookies on a user device of resource A).Redirected data also can be specified and specific redirected any other redirected condition that must meet is occurred.
In some implementations, whether redirected data also can specify and use the language setting data from subscriber equipment to be redirected subscriber equipment conditionally by resource.Language setting data can receive from subscriber equipment with searching request and/or to the request of resource.Language setting data refers to the data showing the language presenting information on a user device.Such as, language arranges " en " and the information presented on a user device can be indicated to present with English, and language setting " de " can present with German by indication information.Some publishers such as can create the different editions of specific webpage to provide the version specific to area of this page, or the version specific to language of this page.Therefore, when publisher receives the request to specific homepage (such as, example.com), publisher can by relocating user equipment to the webpage (such as, example.com/german) specific to language.
Fig. 2 A is the block diagram of the example data flow 200 for identifying redirected resource.Data stream starts from being redirected minimizing device 120 and initiates the resource request A202 of request from the resource of publisher's server 204.Resource request A can be such as the http request for the resource being positioned at network site example.com/page1.If be positioned at the resource of example.com/page1 for being redirected resource, then publisher's server 204 will carry out resource response request A202 by redirect instruction 206, and this redirect instruction 206 comprises the network site 207 that redirected minimizing device 120 therefrom will ask another resource.Such as, in response to the request received the resource being positioned at example.com/page1, publisher's server 204 can provide redirect instruction 206 with instruction redirection device 120 from example.com/page2 request msg, instead of provides the data causing resource to present.
When redirected minimizing device 120 receives redirect instruction 206, be redirected minimizing device 120 and initiate another resource request.Such as, the resource request B208 that minimizing device 120 can initiate the resource asking to be positioned at example.com/page2 is redirected.If the resource being positioned at example.com/page2 is not redirected resource, then publisher's server 204 is by providing the resource data 210 presented of the resource causing being positioned at example.com/page2 in response to request.But, if the resource being positioned at example.com/page2 is another redirected resource, then publisher's server 204 will provide the redirect instruction redirected minimizing device 120 being redirected to another network site again, and request process can iteration continue, until present resource and/or time-out (the maximum redirected number such as, after initial resource request or maximum elapsed time) occur.
In response to reception resource data 210, be redirected minimizing device 120 and can confirm that resource data 210 does not comprise redirect instruction, and therefore determine that the resource provided in response to resource request B 208 is standard resource (that is, not being redirected the resource of subscriber equipment in response to resource request) instead of redirected resource.Then, be redirected minimizing device 120 and can store redirected data 212 in redirected index 122.In this example, stored redirected data 212 can indicate for example.com/page1 (such as, " Page
1") request will as the symbol " Page in Fig. 2 A
1: Page
2" represented by, by relocating user equipment to example.com/page2 (such as, " Page
2").Redirected data also can be specified and relocating user equipment (such as, is correspondingly Page to other standards resource
4and Page
y) other redirected resources (such as, Page
3and Page
x).Note, if at resource (such as, the Page of initial request
x) and for be redirected resource the presenting of resource between there is multiple being redirected, then the data storing of resource (or its proper subclass) can be redirected in redirected index in each centre of instruction.Alternatively or additionally, the resource data 212 of the standard resource of only specifying the redirected resource of initial request and present after last being redirected can be stored.
In some implementations, use multiple redirected minimizing device 120 to ask same resource.In these realize, each redirected minimizing device 120 can simulate dissimilar subscriber equipment, make it possible to the difference detected from different resource and be redirected behavior, and based on each equipment, specific resources can be designated redirected resource or standard resource.
Such as, one be redirected reduce device 120 can simulated intelligence phone, and another is redirected and reduces device and can simulate desk device.In this example, the redirected data 212 using each redirected minimizing device to obtain can be contrasted, to determine whether resource determines the condition be redirected based on asking the type of the subscriber equipment of this resource.For example, if specific resources redirecting mobile equipment and be not redirected desk device, then the redirected minimizing device 120 of the redirected minimizing device 120 of simulation desk device and simulation mobile device can be used to detect this redirected behavior with good conditionsi simultaneously.
Be redirected and reduce device 120 and such as can use user-act on behalf of the subscriber equipment that header (or other device identification data) simulates particular type, described user-act on behalf of header or other device identification data specify other details of the equipment of type and/or relevant this resource request of initiation therefrom initiating the equipment of resource request.Such as, as described in more detail with reference to figure 3, act on behalf of header can specify publisher's server 204 can be determined the subscriber equipment of request resource is the information of mobile device or desk device and/or the manufacturer determining this equipment.Therefore, according to the user used by redirected minimizing device-act on behalf of header (or other equipment identification informations), the redirected minimizing device 120 (or other data processing equipments) of request resource can be considered as mobile device or desktop assembly by the person's of being published server 204, makes to be redirected to reduce device 120 and can obtain redirected data for dissimilar subscriber equipment.Redirected data for the equipment of every type can be stored in redirected index, to create the redirected configuration file for each redirected resource.
In some implementations, be redirected and reduce the mobile device that device 120 is arranged to a simulation particular brand (or model), to collect the redirected data for this particular brand (or model).Similarly, be redirected minimizing device 120 and can be arranged to the information presenting single language (such as, English), keep static to make the language setting data for redirected minimizing device 120 pass in time.Such as, be alternative in the multiple requests using different user-act on behalf of header to initiate specific resources, be redirected and reduce device 120 and can use same user-act on behalf of header for each resource request, to reduce the process resource obtained for needed for the redirected data of many different resources.
When redirected minimizing device 120 only simulates the proper subclass of all user device configuration, likely for specific redirected resource redirected data can indefinite appointment whether by dissimilar relocating user equipment to different resource, or be redirected whether with the language setting data for subscriber equipment for condition.Such as, although be redirected data can specified response in the request to specific resources by brand party A-subscriber device redirection to another resource (such as, suppose to be redirected minimizing device 120 and be arranged to simulation brand party A-subscriber equipment), but be redirected data and can not specify the brand party B-subscriber equipment that whether is redirected (such as, because reduce device 120 may not ask described specific resources when simulating brand B equipment).Similarly, redirected data can specify whether be redirected the subscriber equipment using language-specific to arrange, and do not specify whether be also redirected the subscriber equipment using other language to arrange.
In some implementations, be redirected minimizing device 120 and can be arranged to determine whether should continue to link to this specific resources (such as the Search Results of specific resources, instead of another resource), even if this specific resources has been identified as redirected resource.It is in some implementations, described that determine can at least in part based on the analysis of the redirected data for this resource and the redirected chain for described specific resources.Be redirected chain and specify two or more resources of being asked by subscriber equipment when user equipment requests specific resources.For example, if user equipment requests resource X is also redirected to resource Y then, redirected chain then in this example can comprise the URL of resource X and resource Y URL (such as, http//: example.com/>http: //example.com/BrandA_Store).
In some implementations, be redirected reduce device 120 can determine for specific redirected resource Search Results this redirected resource be confirmed as " based on brand " be redirected resource and only have the redirected data based on brand of part available time will comprise link towards described specific redirected resource.Continue the example presented above, the redirected minimizing device 120 supposing have collected redirected data is arranged to only simulates brand party A-subscriber's equipment and does not simulate brand B equipment, and the user that further hypothesis resource Y is brand party A-subscriber equipment therefrom can download the webpage in the application shop of the application created for brand A equipment.In this example, redirected data for specific resources will be specified the brand A device redirection of request resource X to resource Y, but can not specify and whether be redirected brand B equipment (or being redirected to what resource), and make to be redirected minimizing device 120 and can determine only have the redirected data based on brand of part to use.
In these realize, when only there being the redirected data based on brand of part available, be redirected and reduce device 120 and can check that redirected resource and/or this redirected resource are by the URL of relocating user equipment different resource extremely and/or content, to determine that whether different resource that subscriber equipment is redirected to is the resource specific to brand.For example, if the URL of different resource comprises quoting particular brand (such as, brand A), and (namely the redirected device 120 that reduces simulates brand A equipment, the equipment of same particular brand), then can determine that described different resource is the resource specific to brand.Similarly, if be redirected the content of resource to comprise the link of leading to specific to the website of brand, such as, lead to the link of selling for the website of the application of brand A phone, then can be regarded as being redirected based on brand by being redirected of initiating of this redirected resource.Then, be redirected reduce device 120 can determine for the Search Results of redirected resource will continue to comprise towards this redirected resource link (namely, instead of be modified to comprise the link towards different resource), this is because be redirected be confirmed as based on brand be redirected and redirected data based on brand are unavailable for the subscriber equipment (such as, brand party B-subscriber equipment) of at least one brand.The data (such as, based on the data of brand) representing the result that this is determined can such as be stored in redirected index 122.
Be redirected minimizing device 120 can be configured to make similar determination about the redirected resource based on language.In some implementations, when determining to be redirected for being redirected and only having the redirected data based on language of part to use (namely based on language, being redirected data arranges unavailable at least one language) time, redirected minimizing device 120 can not change the Search Results for the redirected resource based on language.Such as, suppose that being redirected minimizing device 120 uses static instruction setting data, makes the redirected data based on language only can use single language.In this example, redirected data for redirected resource will specify the subscriber equipment that whether will be redirected and have the language setting data identical with redirected minimizing device 120, but can not specify and whether also will be redirected other subscriber equipmenies with other language setting data, or specify these other subscriber equipmenies to be redirected to where.Therefore, in this example, be redirected minimizing device 120 and can determine only have the redirected data based on language of part to use.
In some implementations, when only there being the redirected data based on language of part available, being redirected and reducing URL and/or the content language that device 120 can check redirected resource.Such as, be redirected reduce device can the URLexample.com/page3/en that is redirected to of test page example.com/page2, and determine that this URL comprises the character " en " corresponding to the language setting data of English language.Similarly, being redirected minimizing device can check the text of example.com/page2 and the text of example.com/en to determine whether the language of each resource is different.If determine that the language of two pages is different, or the URL of resource that is redirected to of subscriber equipment comprises quoting the language setting data of this subscriber equipment, be then redirected to reduce device 120 and can be considered as being redirected based on language by being redirected.Then, be redirected minimizing device 120 can determine will continue to comprise towards being redirected the link of resource (namely for the Search Results of redirected resource, instead of be modified to comprise the link towards different resource), be confirmed as being redirected and only having the redirected data based on language of part to be confirmed as available based on language this is because be redirected.The data (such as, based on the data of language) of the result of specifying this to determine can such as be stored in redirected index 122.
In some implementations, redirected minimizing device 120 is arranged to determines that the redirected chain for specific redirected resource comprises temporary transient link, makes this specific redirected resource be regarded as temporarily being redirected resource.In these realize, be redirected reduce device 120 can prevent temporary resource by for be temporarily redirected resource Search Results quote, and determine which resource should be quoted by for the Search Results being temporarily redirected resource.Do you such as, suppose that specific redirected resource comprises following redirected chain: http://example.com>http: //example.com/m>http: //example.com/2011/1/1? id=xxxyyyzzz.In this example, be redirected minimizing device 120 and determine URLhttp: //example.com/2011/1/1? id=xxxyyyzzz to have with other known temporary resource (such as, the resource being relocated after fixed time limit or removing) the similar structure of URL, and therefore determine should not comprise link towards this temporary resource for the Search Results of example.com.Therefore, redirected minimizing device 120 can not change the Search Results for example.com, or inserts the link towards the resource being positioned at example.com/m.
Be redirected minimizing device 120 and also such as can identify temporary resource by passing the redirected chain contrasted for specific redirected resource in time.Such as, do you suppose that example.com is confirmed as having following redirected chain at first: http://example.com>http: //example.com/m>http//example.com/2011/1/1? id=xxxyyyzzz, and when next is asked, example.com is confirmed as having following redirected chain: http://example.com>http: //example.com/m>http//example.com/2011/1/5? id=xxxyyyzzz.In this example, last link in each example of redirected chain (such as, example.com/2011/1/1? id=xxxyyyzzz and example.com/2011/1/5? id=xxxyyyzzz) can be confirmed as temporary resource, making to be redirected minimizing device 120 can not lead to the link of these resources to for insertion in the Search Results of example.com.In some implementations, can require that redirected chain at least has minimum appointment rate of change the resource in chain is classified as temporary resource.The data (such as, temporary resource data) of the result of specifying this to determine can such as be stored in redirected index 122.
Fig. 2 B is the block diagram for reducing redirected example data flow 250.Data stream 250 starts from subscriber equipment 106 to search system 110 submit Query 109.Described inquiry also can be supplied to redirected minimizing device 120 by subscriber equipment 106 or by search system 110.As above with reference to described by figure 1, search system 110 identification response in the resource (" response resource ") of search inquiry 110, and generates the Search Results 111 quoting (such as, being linked to) this response resource.Each Search Results such as can comprise hypertext link, and this hypertext link causes subscriber equipment to initiate the request of the resource to the network site be arranged in specified by this hypertext link under being connected on the user interactions with Search Results.Such as, the Search Results SR1 in Fig. 2 B can comprise the hypertext link comprising URL http://example.com/page1, makes will to cause with the user interactions of Search Results SR1 the resource that subscriber equipment 106 is asked from example/com/page1.
Search system 110 provides the one or more data of specifying in Search Results 111 to redirected minimizing device 120.Be redirected reduce device 120 can by Search Results 111 quote (such as, be linked to) resource and redirected index 122 in listed redirected the Resources list contrast, to determine whether any resource quoted by Search Results is redirected resource.Such as, be redirected minimizing device 120 network site of redirected resource listed in the network site (such as, http://example.com/page1) in the hypertext link of each Search Results and redirected index 122 to be contrasted.If be confirmed as quoting redirected resource one of in Search Results 111, then the hypertext link of this Search Results can be replaced with the hypertext link of relocating user equipment standard resource extremely towards described redirected resource.Therefore, user equipment requests standard resource will be caused with the user interactions of this Search Results and first not ask to be redirected resource.
Such as, suppose that SR1 comprises the hypertext link towards example.com/page1, and the redirected device 120 that reduces of hypothesis determines that the resource being arranged in example.com/page1 is listed in redirected resource at redirected index 122.Further hypothesis according to being redirected index 122, the redirected resource being positioned at example.com/page1 by relocating user equipment to the standard resource being positioned at example.com/page2.In this example, be redirected and reduce device 120 and can insert the hypertext link of leading to example.com/page2 and/or remove or forbid to be included at first in SR1 and lead to the hypertext link of example.com/page1 in SR1, thus create one group of Search Results 222 through changing.Then the Search Results 222 of this group through changing can be supplied to subscriber equipment and present in result of page searching 114 by redirected minimizing device 120.
When user and the SR1115 through changing version are mutual, hypertext link towards example.com/page2 will cause subscriber equipment 106 to submit resource request B208 to publisher's server 204, and publisher's server 204 will with the resource data 210 presented of the resource causing being positioned at example.com/page2 in response to subscriber equipment 106.Therefore, in this example, subscriber equipment 106 will be caused to ask the resource from example.com/page2 with the user interactions of SR1115 and first not ask to be positioned at the redirected resource of example.com/page1, thus reducing the number be redirected that subscriber equipment will make before being positioned at the presenting of resource of example.com/page2.
In some implementations, when Search Results become be linked to standard resource through change search time, the visual appearance for the Search Results of redirected resource does not change.Such as, after change, it is Search Results for the resource being positioned at example.com/page1 that SR1115 still visually can indicate SR1, although will initiate the request to the resource being positioned at example.com/page2 with the user interactions of Search Results.In some implementations, visually changing the Search Results through change, making the network site of standard resource therefrom to be asked to be matched with the network site of visually being quoted by the Search Results through changing in response to the user interactions with the Search Results through changing.
Fig. 3 is the process flow diagram for reducing redirected instantiation procedure 300.Process 300 can such as be realized by the data processing equipment of the redirected minimizing device 120 and so on of such as Fig. 1.Process 300 also can be embodied as the instruction be stored on computer-readable storage medium, makes the operation being caused described data processing equipment implementation 300 by the execution of data processing equipment to this instruction.
Searching request (302) is received from subscriber equipment.In some implementations, searching request comprises search inquiry (such as, text and/or image), and this search inquiry of use is selected by Search Results.Searching request such as can be received from mobile device, such as has " smart phone " of the Internet connectivity, and is received by cellular network or other wireless networks.Searching request can such as be received by another data processing equipment of the redirection device 120 and so on of search system and/or such as Fig. 1.Note, redirection device 120 also can receive the data of specifying and receiving searching request and/or from searching request data and do not receive actual searching request.Such as, these data can be supplied to redirection device 120 by the search system 110 of Fig. 1 or another data processing equipment.
Receive the device identification data (304) for subscriber equipment.Device identification data is the data of the type of specifying the equipment therefrom initiating and/or submit to searching request.Such as, device identification data can comprise user-act on behalf of header, this user-act on behalf of manufacturer's (or brand) of header designated user equipment and/or the model of subscriber equipment.User-act on behalf of header can such as comprise specifies specific searching request to be manufactured by brand X telephone operator and the data submitted to of the subscriber equipment that model is BXP-100.
Device identification data also can comprise the hardware of designated user equipment and/or the edition data of software merit rating.Such as, user-act on behalf of header can comprise specifies the data of current installation firmware version on a user device and/or the information about the browser of therefrom initiating searching request.In addition, user-act on behalf of the type that header can indicate the browser therefrom submitting searching request to.
Whether the subscriber equipment that device identification data can be used for determining therefrom to initiate searching request is mobile device, such as smart phone, or determines whether subscriber equipment is laptop devices or desk device.In some implementations, brand or type information can with mobile device brand and model list cross reference.Such as, suppose to be included in smart phone list from the model BXP-100 of brand X telephone operator.In this example, the searching request with the device identification data of appointment national brand X and model BXP-100 received from subscriber equipment can be regarded as being received from mobile subscriber equipment.
In some implementations, the type of the subscriber equipment of submission searching request can based on the type of the browser in order to submit searching request to.Such as, mobile device can use the browser (such as, instead of/or except desktop version browser) of mobile version.Therefore, the searching request with agency-user's header of the mobile version browser of appointment received from subscriber equipment can be regarded as being received from mobile subscriber equipment such as smart phone or non-mobile device such as desk-top computer.
Receive the data (306) of specifying for one group of response resource of searching request.In some implementations, the data of one group of response resource are specified to be appointment one group of data for the Search Results of resource.The data of appointment last set result such as can receive to control oneself and generate the search system of Search Results in response to searching request.These data for any information of each Search Results appointment specified by Search Results, such as, can comprise the network site of resource and/or the resource quoted by Search Results.
Whether the request made for one or more response resource will cause subscriber equipment to be redirected to the determination (308) of different resource.In some implementations, can based on about from the described resource of one group of resource the redirected data of index and/or storage make and describedly to determine.Such as, as described above, the network site of redirected resource known with a group specified by redirected data for the network site of specific response resource can be contrasted.If the network site of specific response resource (such as, URL) network site one of not match in redirected resource (such as, URL), then specific response resource can be regarded as not being redirected resource (that is, being standard resource).Therefore, can determine not cause subscriber equipment to be redirected to the resource different from the resource of the network site being positioned at this specific response resource to the request of specific response resource.If determine that each response resource in described group is not redirected resource, then the Search Results for this group response resource is supplied to subscriber equipment (312).
If the network site of specific response resource (such as, URL) network site one of to be matched with in described redirected resource (such as, URL) (or being otherwise identified as redirected resource), then this specific response resource can be regarded as redirected resource (that is, will relocating user equipment to different resource).Therefore, the different resource causing subscriber equipment to be redirected to being different from this specific response resource to the request of specific response resource can be determined.
If based on mating and determining that specific resources is redirected resource between specific response resource and the network site of redirected resource, then can as hereafter be described in more detail, will (310) in the Search Results be inserted into for specific resources be quoted to described different resource.But, inserting before the quoting of different resource, can make and determining further.
As described above, be that redirected resource is really surely to have the factor except the URL that matches with specified URL in redirected data for condition except this specific response resource for specific response resource.Such as, the condition be redirected of being undertaken by specific response resource can be: the type (such as, mobile device) of the equipment of request resource; The manufacturer of equipment; Whether subscriber equipment stores particular network tracker (or other data files), such as by the entity storing cookies on a user device providing search system and specific response resource simultaneously; And/or from the language setting data that subscriber equipment receives.Therefore, for the request for specific response resource whether will cause subscriber equipment be redirected to different resource determination can at least in part based on the characteristic of subscriber equipment whether be matched be called as redirected condition for the condition be redirected.
As described above, the redirected condition for specific redirected resource can such as be stored in the redirected data for this specific redirected resource.Such as, redirected data for specific response resource can specify this specific response resource to all subscriber equipmenies, only to mobile device, only to non-moving subscribers equipment, or be redirected (such as to some combinations of mobile subscriber equipment and/or non-moving subscribers equipment, based on language setting data, manufacturer or cookies Zhuan Tai – namely, whether subscriber equipment stores specific cookies).
In some implementations, when (such as, based on device identification data) determines that subscriber equipment is mobile subscriber equipment, the determination whether mobile device being redirected to by specific response resource to different resource can be made.Describedly determine that such as whether can indicate this specific response resource based on the redirected data for specific response resource is redirected to different resource by mobile device and makes.If determine that mobile device can be redirected to different resource (supposing to meet any other redirected condition), then can insert quoting (312) different resource independent of whether specific response resource is redirected non-mobile device in the Search Results for specific response resource.If determine that mobile device can not be redirected to different resource by specific response resource, then the Search Results for specific response resource can be provided and not insert quoting different resource.
When determining that subscriber equipment is non-moving subscribers equipment (that is, not being identified as the subscriber equipment of mobile device), can to make similarly for specific response resource whether by non-moving subscribers device redirection to the determination of different resource.Describedly determine that such as whether can indicate specific response resource based on the redirected data for specific response resource is redirected to different resource by non-mobile device and makes.
If determine that non-mobile device can be redirected to different resource (supposing to meet any other redirected condition), then can independent of specific response resource whether redirecting mobile equipment and insert quoting (312) different resource in the Search Results for specific response resource.If determine that non-mobile device can not be redirected to different resource by specific response resource, then the Search Results for specific response resource can be supplied to non-mobile device and not insert quoting different resource.Therefore, the Search Results for specific response resource being supplied to non-mobile device can not have quoting the different resource that mobile device is redirected to, even if insert quoting different resource in another Search Results for specific response resource being supplied to mobile device.Correspondingly, the type of the equipment that can be provided to based on Search Results changes link included in the different Search Results for same resource.
Similar technology can be used for determining whether to meet the redirected condition for the tracker Network Based of specific response resource.Such as, the determination whether subscriber equipment being stored to the cookies for the specific response resource quoted by Search Results can be made.As described above, when providing the entity of search system with when providing the entity of specific response resource to be identical entity, the cookies for specific response resource can be detected by search system.For example, if be provided in line search system shares website entity with Online Video to put cookies on a user device, then this entity can detect described cookies when receiving searching request from subscriber equipment.
If subscriber equipment stores the cookies for specific response resource, then can check the redirected data for specific response resource, to determine whether this specific response resource is redirected the subscriber equipment (supposing also to meet any other redirected condition) storing described cookies.If determine that specific response resource can not be redirected subscriber equipment based on the cookies stored on a user device, then the Search Results for specific response resource can be provided and not insert quoting different resource.But, if determine that specific response resource by the relocating user equipment of storage network tracker to different resource, then can insert quoting described different resource in the Search Results for specific response resource.
In this example, the Search Results for specific response resource being supplied to the subscriber equipment of storage network tracker will comprise the link towards different resource, and other Search Results for same specific response resource being supplied to the subscriber equipment of non-storage network tracker can not comprise the link towards different resource.Correspondingly, will cause with the user interactions of the Search Results for specific response resource of the subscriber equipment being supplied to storage network tracker user equipment requests be different from by be supplied to the user interactions of the Search Results for same specific response resource of subscriber equipment of non-storage network tracker and the resource of the resource of asking.
In some implementations, the condition of whether carrying out for specific response resource the determination be redirected receives language-specific setting data from subscriber equipment.Such as, provide the subscriber equipment of language setting data " en " that the webpage issued with English can be redirected to, and provide the subscriber equipment of language setting data " fr " that the webpage issued with French can be redirected to.Therefore, the condition be redirected of special user equipment can be the language setting data provided by the adjoint request to resource of this subscriber equipment and/or searching request.
Search Results (312) is provided to subscriber equipment.If at least one in response resource is identified as the redirected resource for the subscriber equipment submitting searching request to, then Search Results can comprise at least one through change Search Results, insert to different resource (namely wherein, be different from redirected resource) quote (such as, hypertext link), make will to initiate with the user interactions of the Search Results through changing first not ask to be redirected resource to the request of different resource.If be identified as redirected resource without any response resource, then each Search Results can be supplied to subscriber equipment and do not insert newly quoting different resource.
