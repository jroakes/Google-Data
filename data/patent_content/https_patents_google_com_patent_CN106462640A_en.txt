Made (producing), color (color) etc.).In some implementations, candidate generator 134 can be for extracted entity sets P
Each element in={ p_1, p_2 ... } and user inquiry q, limit and take input to (p, q) and generate N_p rewriting candidate's
Function C (p, q)->{(p,q,r_l),..,(p,q,r_{N_p})}.The non-restrictive example that this generates is to generate the p of N_p rewriting
Concatenation with q.Using alternative information or grammar for natural language, candidate generator 134 can generate other query rewrite candidate
144.Alternative information may include the inquiry being stored in inquiry thesauruss 192.For example, candidate generator 134 is it is contemplated that include class
Be similar to p (for example, p_1) and q, search engine 110 is provided before and is stored in the looking into of lexical item in inquiry thesauruss 192
Ask.In some implementations, candidate generator 134 can concatenate different inputs to p and q to generate output set Q={ C (p_
L, q) and+C (p_2, q) ... }, wherein, Q represents the set of query rewrite candidate 144.
In some implementations, query rewrite candidate 144 can be extracted based on inquiry lexical item and entity extractor 132
Entity various combination.For example, when watching video, user during people occur in video may wish to know going out in video
The title of existing automobile.In this illustration, user 176 can provide inquiry " Who is the manufacturer of this
car？(whom the manufacturer of this automobile is？)”.Inquiry lexical item in this inquiry be " Who, is, the, manufacturer, of,
this、car”.The entity occurring in video when entity extractor 132 can extract inquiry as " CarC, Red, Italy ", wherein,
CarC is the title that associates with this automobile, Red is the color of automobile and Italy is source country.Candidate generator 134 can be given birth to
" (whom the manufacturer of CarC is to Who is the manufacturer of CarC to become inclusion？)”、“Who is CarC
(whom CarC manufacturer is to manufacturer？) ", " (who is the manufacturer of CarC to CarC manufacturer who is？)”
One or more query rewrite candidates 144.In this way, candidate generator 134 generates query rewrite candidate 144, with automatic
Ground includes the context in the inquiry that user 176 provides, and wherein, this context is to be carried by the entity that entity extractor 132 is extracted
For.
In another example, when watching video, the title of the film that user may wish to know that someone takes part in a performance.At this
In individual example, user 176 can occur providing inquiry " Which films has he acted in during this people in video？(he
Drilled any film？)”.Inquiry lexical item in this inquiry is " Which, films, has, he, acted, in ".Entity extractor
132 can extract the entity occurring in video during inquiry as " John Doe, Deep Space (John Doe, the outer space) ",
Wherein, the title that " John Doe " is the title associating with people and Deep Space is film.Candidate generator 134 generates bag
Include " Films acted John Doe Deep Space (the film Deep Space that John Doe drills) ", " Acted John
Doe Deep Space (the film Deep Space that John Doe drills) ", " Films John Doe (film John Doe) ",
One or more inquiry weights of " Which films has John Doe acted in (what film John Doe drilled) " etc.
Write candidate 144.In this way, the entity that query rewrite candidate 144 can be extracted based on inquiry lexical item and entity extractor 132
Various combination.
It is appreciated that the disclosed embodiments are not limited to inquire about the combination (or concatenation) of lexical item and extracted entity.At some
In implementation, candidate generator 134 is based on other and inspires to generate query rewrite candidate.Other inspirations may include similar to institute
The inquiry (or including similar lexical item) of one or more of the query candidate generating.Can according to inquiry thesauruss 192 determine with
The inquiry that one or more of query candidate being generated is similar to.For example, if " Films acted John Doe Deep
Space " is candidate query, then candidate generator 134 can read inquiry thesauruss 192 and identifies another inquiry, for example, with
" Which films has John Doe acted in " that candidate query is similar to is (for example, including one or more similar words
).Thus, for example, " Films acted John Doe Deep Space " determination " Which can be inquired about based on initial candidate
Films has John Doe acted in " is another candidate query.Therefore, inquiry user 176 being provided
“Which films has he acted in？", query rewrite candidate 144 can be " Films acted John Doe
Deep Space " and " Which films has John Doe acted in ".
In some implementations, scoring and rank engine 138 can be based on associating with the inquiry that user 176 initially provides
One or more extracted entities are scored by the timestamp of time and extracted entity and property.For example, scoring and ranking
Engine 138 can be checked can be with the timestamp information of one or more extracted entity associated.If user 176 provides in video
Inquiry time T place annotation entity p_i, then entity p_i can from scoring with rank engine 138 receive just score and if when
Between T when or do not mention p_i during time to approach T, then entity p_i can receive point penalty.For example, it is contemplated that to user by when ten minutes
Inquiry " When is the next game？(upcoming match when？) " provide in stream video.If for example 10
Minute when or substantially annotate entity " athlete (athlete) " or " sports when 10 minutes (or 9-12 minute)
Teams (team) ", then scoring and rank engine 138 can be entity " athlete " or " sports with respect to other entities
Teams " gives higher scoring.Subsequently, candidate generator 134 can use and close with the higher scoring with respect to other extracted entities
The extracted entity of connection is generating query rewrite candidate 144.
In some implementations, scoring and rank engine 138 can be based on the n- being storable in inquiry thesauruss 192
Co-occurrence one or more the extracted entities of scoring of gram.N-gram can be from the n in text or the given sequence of voice
The continuous sequence of individual lexical item.In other words, for example, n-gram can be considered the combination of lexical item.These lexical items can be such as sound
Element, syllable, letter, word or base pair.N-gram is typically from text or speech corpus (for example, inquiring about thesauruss 192)
Collect.Size is that 1 n-gram is referred to as " unigram "；Size be 2 be " bigram " (or, less at large,
“digram”)；Size is " trigram " for 3.Value (for example, " four-gram ", " five-gram " etc.) sometimes through n is come
Represent larger size.
In some implementations, scoring and rank engine 138 can read inquiry thesauruss 192, to identify for inquiry q
Given n-gram for possible entity type.Each entity p_i being extracted for entity extractor 132, if institute
Extracting entity is based on one of most possible entity of n-gram in inspection inquiry thesauruss 192, then scoring and ranking
Engine 138 can give to extracted entity and just score and otherwise giving point penalty.For example, for inquiry " When is the next
Increase is the scoring of the entity p_i of type " sport teams " and " athlete " by game ", scoring and rank engine 138.So
Afterwards, can by candidate generator 134 using with respect to other extracted entities higher the extracted entity that associates of scoring
Generate query rewrite candidate 144.
In this way, inquire about and annotate time and the n- of entity based on such as inquiry before or inquiry log, offer
The inspiration of the co-occurrence of gram, candidate generator 134 can generate one or more query rewrite candidates 144.By scoring and can arrange
Name engine 138 is scored and ranking to the query rewrite candidate 144 being determined by candidate generator 134.
In some implementations, scoring and rank engine 138 can provide one or more inquiry weights to search engine 110
Write candidate 144.Subsequently, scoring and rank engine 138 can provide query rewrite candidate 144 to obtain based on to search engine 110
Accordingly result set characteristic, one or more query rewrite candidates 144 are scored.In some unrestricted implementations
In, the search inquiry before that scoring is also based on associating with search engine 110 with rank engine 138 (for example, is stored in inquiry to deposit
Inquiry in bank 192) or time of associating with the inquiry that user 176 initially provides, query rewrite candidate 144 is commented
Point.
In some implementations, outcome quality can be to provide query rewrite candidate 144 to obtain to search engine 110
Results set characteristic.The outcome quality of results set can be examined from search engine based on based on query rewrite candidate
The quantity of rope or Search Results.For example, if results set has more results than other results sets, this results set
Quality can be confirmed as higher with respect to another results set.Quality is also based on the multiformity of Search Results.For example,
If results set has the result related to audio frequency, video, text and other results sets can have and only text correlation
Result, then the quality of this results set can be confirmed as higher with respect to another results set.Quality be also based on
The dependency of the Search Results based on query rewrite candidate.For example, if results set has including similar with inquiry lexical item
Or the result of identical lexical item, then the quality of this results set can be confirmed as higher with respect to another results set.
The quality of results set can be determined based on other properties of any one of results set or characteristic.In some realization sides
In formula, in the case of given query rewrite candidate collection " Q ", scoring and rank engine 138 are limited to given input p's and q
In the case of give rewrite scoring function S (p, q, r)->R_+.For example, to search engine 110 offer query rewrite candidate " r "
The quantity of the high-quality Search Results obtaining can be quality score.These examples are only illustrate, and are not intended to limit institute
Disclosed implementation.
In some implementations, scoring and rank engine 138 are based on scored one or more query rewrite candidates
144 score accordingly, by query rewrite candidate 144 ranking.For example, compared to another query rewrite candidate, there is low amount
Result, the query rewrite candidate associating with the result of comparatively high amts can have higher ranking.With reference to above-indicated example, look into
Ask rewriting candidate " Which is CarC manufacturer " and 100 results from search engine 110 can be obtained.However,
Query rewrite candidate " CarC manufacturer which is " can generate 80 results.In this illustration, score and arrange
Name engine 138 can be by query rewrite candidate " Which is CarC manufacturer " with respect to query rewrite candidate " CarC
Manufacturer Which is " ranking is higher.
With reference to another example set forth above, query candidate " Which films has John Doe acted in "
Audio frequency from search engine 110, video and text results can be obtained.However, query candidate " Films acted John Doe
Deep Space " can have to text results.In this illustration, scoring and rank engine 138 can be by query rewrite candidates
" Which films has John Doe acted in " is with respect to query rewrite candidate " Films acted John Doe
Deep Space " ranking is higher, because " Which films has John Doe acted in " has created with respect to looking into
Ask the more multifarious results set rewriteeing candidate " Films acted John Doe Deep Space ".In some realization sides
In formula, the top ranked candidate of query rewrite candidate 144 can be confirmed as：argmax_{x elt of Q)S(x).arg
Max represents the parameter of maximum that is to say, that given function obtains the set of the point of the given parameters of its maximum.In other words
Say, the arg max of f (x) can be the set of the value of x that f (x) obtains its maximum M.
As noted above, scoring and rank engine 138 can be based on scored one or more query rewrite candidates 144
Corresponding scoring, by query rewrite candidate 144 ranking.Query rewrite engine 140 subsequently can query rewrite based on particular rank
Candidate is rewriteeing the inquiry related to content of multimedia.In some implementations, the query rewrite candidate of particular rank is permissible
It is top ranked query rewrite candidate.For example, if the inquiry that user 176 provides is " Which films has he
acted in？", then query rewrite engine 140 can automatically by query rewrite be " Which films has John Doe
acted in”.Then, query rewrite engine can provide the inquiry through rewriteeing to search engine 110.Then, results management device 142
