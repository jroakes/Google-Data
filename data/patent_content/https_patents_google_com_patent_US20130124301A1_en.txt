Description
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of content. For instance, images, audio, video, and web pages for many different topics are accessible through the Internet. The accessible content provides an opportunity to present advertisements to users. Advertisements can be placed within content, such as a web page, image or video, or the content can trigger the display of one or more advertisements, such as presenting an advertisement in an advertisement slot within the content and/or in an advertisement slot of a pop-up window or other overlay.
- Advertisers decide the web sites on which they want their ads to be displayed, whereby ad auctions determine whether or not the advertiser's ad will actually be shown to the user visiting a web site, or whether other ads will beat out the ad at issue and be shown instead to the user. Ad auctions rely on many different criteria to determine which ads are to be displayed to a user, such as budget and/or bid made by an advertiser for an ad, predicted click through rate (pctr) for the ad, relevancy of the web site to relevancy information provided by the advertiser with respect to the ad (e.g., a search phrase or web site genre information to be associated with the ad), etc.
- When a user sees an ad on a web pate, that ad might be offensive to the user, due to images and/or text associated with the ad.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification relates to enabling a user to provide dynamic feedback with respect to an ad that the user is currently viewing on a web page or on a search results page.

- As used throughout this document, user interactions include any presentation of content to a user and any subsequent affirmative actions or non-actions (collectively referred to as “actions” unless otherwise specified) that a user takes in response to presentation of content to the user (e.g., selections of the content following presentation of the content, or non-selections of the content following the presentation of the content). Thus, a user interaction does not necessarily require a selection of the content (or any other affirmative action) by the user. For example, the user reviewing content for a period of time may be considered an interaction. A user interaction may also include a user typing in the URL of a content provider directly into the web browser.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment in which an advertisement management system manages advertising services consistent with an illustrative embodiment. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106,advertisers 108, and anadvertisement management system 110. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106, andadvertisers 108. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. An example website is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. - A
resource 105 is any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 is identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105, such as a uniform resource locator (URL).Resources 105 can include web pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, programming elements, interactive content, and feed sources, to name only a few. Theresources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information in hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions. Embedded instructions can include code that is executed at a user's device, such as in a web browser. Code can be written in languages, such as, JavaScript® or ECMAScript®. - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. The data representing theresource 105 can include data specifying a portion of the resource or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which advertisements can be presented. These specified portions of theresource 105 or user display are referred to as advertisement slots. - To facilitate searching of the vast number of
resources 105 accessible over thenetwork 102, theenvironment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies theresources 105 by crawling and indexing theresources 105 provided on thewebsites 104. Data about theresources 105 can be indexed based on theresource 105 with which the data is associated. The indexed and, optionally, cached copies of theresources 105 are stored in a search index (not shown). -
User devices 106 can submit search queries to the search system 112 over thenetwork 102. In response, the search system 112 accesses the search index to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to the search query. In one illustrative embodiment, a search query includes one or more keywords. The search system 112 identifies theresources 105 that are responsive to the query, provides information about theresources 105 in the form of search results and returns the search results to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. A search result can include data generated by the search system 112 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query, and can include a link to theresource 105. An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from theweb page 104, a rendering of theresource 105, and the URL of theweb page 104. Search results pages can also include one or more advertisement slots in which advertisements can be presented. - A search result page can be sent with a request from the search system 112 for the web browser of the
user device 106 to set an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) cookie. A cookie can represent, for example, aparticular user device 106 and a particular web browser. For example, the search system 112 includes a server that replies to the query by sending the search results page in an HTTP response. This HTTP response includes instructions (e.g., a set cookie instruction) that cause the browser to store a cookie for the site hosted by the server or for the domain of the server. If the browser supports cookies and cookies are enabled, every subsequent page request to the same server or a server within the domain of the server will include the cookie. The cookie can store a variety of data, including a unique or semi-unique identifier. The unique or semi-unique identifier can be anonymized and is not connected with user names. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, the use of cookies allows an external service, such as the search system 112 or other system, to track particular actions and status of a user over multiple sessions. A user may opt out of tracking user actions, for example, by disabling cookies in the browser's settings. - When a
resource 105 or search results are requested by auser device 106 or provided to theuser device 106, theadvertisement management system 110 receives a request for advertisements to be provided with theresource 105 or search results. The request for advertisements can include characteristics of the advertisement slots that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results page, and can be provided to theadvertisement management system 110. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to theresource 105 for which the advertisement slot is defined, a size of the advertisement slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the advertisement slot can be provided to theadvertisement management system 110. Similarly, keywords (i.e., one or more words that are associated with content) associated with a requested resource 105 (“resource keywords”) or a search query for which search results are requested can also be provided to theadvertisement management system 110 to facilitate identification of advertisements that are relevant to theresource 105 or search query. - Based on data included in the request for advertisements, the
advertisement management system 110 can select advertisements that are eligible to be provided in response to the request (“eligible advertisements”). For example, eligible advertisements can include advertisements having characteristics matching the characteristics of advertisement slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries. In some implementations, advertisements having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords, the search query, or portions of the search query are selected as eligible advertisements by theadvertisement management system 110. - The
advertisement management system 110 selects an eligible advertisement for each advertisement slot of aresource 105 or of a search results page. Theresource 105 or search results page is received by theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106. User interaction data representing user interactions with presented advertisements can be stored in ahistorical data store 119. For example, when an advertisement is presented to the user via anad server 114, data can be stored in alog file 116. Thislog file 116, as more fully described below, can be aggregated with other data in thehistorical data store 119. Accordingly, thehistorical data store 119 contains data representing the advertisement impression. For example, the presentation of an advertisement is stored in response to a request for the advertisement that is presented. For example, the ad request can include data identifying a particular cookie, such that data identifying the cookie can be stored in association with data that identifies the advertisement(s) that were presented in response to the request. In some implementations, the data can be stored directly to thehistorical data store 119. - Similarly, when a user selects (i.e., clicks) a presented advertisement, data representing the selection of the advertisement can be stored in the
log file 116, a cookie, or thehistorical data store 119. In some implementations, the data is stored in response to a request for a web page that is linked to by the advertisement. For example, the user selection of the advertisement can initiate a request for presentation of a web page that is provided by (or for) the advertiser. The request can include data identifying the particular cookie for the user device, and this data can be stored in the advertisement data store. - User interaction data can be associated with unique identifiers that represent a corresponding user device with which the user interactions were performed. For example, in some implementations, user interaction data can be associated with one or more cookies. Each cookie can include content which specifies an initialization time that indicates a time at which the cookie was initially set on the
particular user device 106. - The log files 116, or the
historical data store 119, also store references to advertisements and data representing conditions under which each advertisement was selected for presentation to a user. For example, thehistorical data store 119 can store targeting keywords, bids, and other criteria with which eligible advertisements are selected for presentation. Additionally, thehistorical data store 119 can include data that specifies a number of impressions for each advertisement and the number of impressions for each advertisement can be tracked, for example, using the keywords that caused the advertisement impressions and/or the cookies that are associated with the impressions. Data for each impression can also be stored so that each impression and user selection can be associated with (i.e., stored with references to and/or indexed according to) the advertisement that was selected and/or the targeting keyword that caused the advertisement to be selected for presentation. - The
advertisers 108 can submit, to theadvertisement management system 110, campaign parameters (e.g., targeting keywords and corresponding bids) that are used to control distribution of advertisements. Theadvertisers 108 can access theadvertisement management system 110 to monitor performance of the advertisements that are distributed using the campaign parameters. For example, an advertiser can access a campaign performance report that provides a number of impressions (i.e., presentations), selections (i.e., clicks), and conversions that have been identified for the advertisements. The campaign performance report can also provide a total cost, a cost-per-click, and other cost measures for the advertisement over a specified period of time. For example, an advertiser may access a performance report that specifies that advertisements distributed using the phrase match keyword “hockey” have received 1,000 impressions (i.e., have been presented 1,000 times), have been selected (e.g., clicked) 20 times, and have been credited with 5 conversions. Thus, the phrase match keyword hockey can be attributed with 1,000 impressions, 20 clicks, and 5 conversions. - Embodiments of the invention provide the capability for a user to submit dynamic feedback information regarding an ad that the user is currently viewing on a web page or on an online search results screen (based on a text or image-based search requested by the user).
- Implementations disclosed herein may provide a clearer way or streamlined mechanism for reporting inappropriate ads, irrelevant ads and/or offensive ads, so that those ads can be pulled from being considered for future ad auctions.
- Implementations disclosed herein can be used in the advertisements environment to allow users to flag ads that they see that are deemed by the user to merit feedback to an ad monitoring service or an ad providing service, such as Google AdWords or Google Adsense.

FIG. 2 shows avehicle advertisement 100 according to an exemplary embodiment. Thatadvertisement 100 is provided on a web page viewed by a user, for example, a web page of an automobile magazine that the user is currently visiting. The advertisement is displayed to the user based on theadvertisement 100 winning an auction resulting from the user visiting a particular web page that allows ads to be displayed along with its own content, for example, or by the user requesting an online search for sports cars in which the ad is shown at a predetermined portion of a search results screen (e.g., above the search results or to the right of the search results). Theadvertisement 100 comprises anicon 110 which may be provided on the periphery of theadvertisement 100, for which a user can click on thaticon 110 and thereby provide feedback regarding theadvertisement 100. InFIG. 2 , theicon 110 is shown as a small question mark (“?”) on the bottom right portion of theautomobile advertisement 100. Other icons and locations of the icon are possible while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the icon can be provided adjacent to the advertisement, but not actually on it. - When a user clicks on the
icon 110, a pop-upwindow 200 appears adjacent to theadvertisement 100, as shown inFIG. 3 . In the pop-upwindow 200, the user has the ability to highlight, identify or specify the issue that the user has with the ad by clicking on a highlight button 210 (which may include a pencil icon to indicate to the user that he/she can mark-up portions of the ad). The user also has the ability to black out or remove any personal information when sending the feedback by clicking on a black out button 220 (which includes a pencil icon to indicate to the user that he/she can blacken portions of the ad or screen shot before they are sent back to the server). The user further has the ability to select a category of feedback in afeedback type region 230. Also, the user has the ability to describe the problem by including text in afeedback text region 240 and preview the feedback by clicking on aPreview button 250. Still further, the user can cancel the sending of feedback by clicking on a Cancelbutton 260, and the user can send the feedback by clicking on aSend Feedback button 270 at the top left of the pop-upwindow 200. Additionally, the user can learn more about the advertisement feedback feature by clicking on the LearnMore button 280 at the bottom right of the pop-upwindow 200. - Referring now to
FIG. 4 , which shows the highlight feature of providing feedback, a user can move his/her mouse point over the advertisement to allow the user to highlight certain portions of the advertisement that are of concern to the user. A drawing application may be utilized to provide for this feature, such as providing a way for the user to circle or otherwise markup up portions of the advertisement that are the basis of the feedback being provided by the user. That is, when the user clicks on thehighlight button 210 as shown inFIG. 3 , a drawing software application is opened, which allows the user to mark up the advertisement in a particular manner (e.g., from a line based on mouse movement over the advertisement to allow the user to circle the area of the advertisement that merits the feedback) so as to show the user's concern with the advertisement. - In particular,
FIG. 4 shows aline 350 made by a user to encircle a particular portion of theadvertisement 100 after the user clicked on thehighlight button 210, in which theline 350 is included in the feedback sent out when the user hits a Send Feedback button. In some embodiments, a screen shot is taken of the marked-up advertisement when the user has finished marking it up, and that screen shot is included in the ad feedback. In the example shown inFIG. 4 , the user does not like the use of “Its Sexy” in the advertisement text, and so has encircled those words in the advertisement with theline 350 created by the user moving his/her mouse along the path of theline 350. - The black out
button 220 shown inFIG. 3 allows the user to provide anonymous feedback, in which the user's identity is removed from the feedback information provided. For example, cookie information is removed from the feedback information when the user clicks on the black outbutton 220, and any personal information of the user that may be associated with the web page on which the advertisement is displayed is also removable, such as by the user clicking on a portion of the web page and blackening that portion of the web page so that it is not included in the advertisement feedback message. InFIG. 4 , a blacked outportion 360 of theadvertisement 100 is shown based on the users moving his/her mouse over that area when the black out button was selected, whereby that portion contains information that the user does not want to include with the advertisement feedback. - Additionally, geographic information of the user can be blocked when the user clicks on the black out
button 220. If the user does not click on the black outbutton 220, the geographic information of the user can be determined based on the online browser used by the user to access the Internet, for example, whereby this information may be useful in determining if certain ads are offensive only to persons living in a particular country or region of a country, and whereby those ads can be blocked in the future from being shown to a particular geographical location based on this data. - The
feedback type region 230 of the pop-upwindow 200 allows the user to select from a list of predetermined categories of feedback type. By way of example, the list may include: a) offensive advertisement, b) inappropriate advertisement for the web page that it is displayed on, c) issue with how advertisement looks on the web site, d) other feedback issue, etc. - The
feedback text region 240 enables the user to enter in text describing what is the basis for the advertisement feedback, and allows the user to more particularly describe the user's issue with the advertisement. By way of example, thefeedback text region 240 allows a computer (e.g., a server) to receive from the user a predetermined number of characters, e.g., 200 characters, in which that text is included in the user feedback provided to an advertisement review department. - The
Preview button 250 allows the user to preview the feedback prior to it being sent out. When thePreview button 250 is clicked, a Preview pop-upwindow 300 opens up, as shown inFIG. 5 . The Preview pop-upwindow 300 shows the feedback that will be provided to an advertisement review department, and allows the user to make any changes to the feedback prior to sending it out. The Preview pop-upwindow 300 includes aSend Feedback button 310, as shown inFIG. 5 , which the user can click in order to send out the advertisement feedback. The Preview pop-up window 330 also includes a Cancelbutton 320, which allows the user to cancel the sending of the advertisement feedback. A Cancelbutton 260 and aSend Feedback button 270 are also provided on the initial feedback pop-up window, as shown inFIG. 3 . - The feedback data is provided to a relevant third party, such as an advertisement review department of an advertisement auction company (that being a company that auctions advertisements for inclusion on web pages). The feedback data can additionally be sent to the advertiser in some embodiments, to allow the advertiser to change the ad so as to remedy the situation. The feedback data can be used to lower an advertisement's rating that is used for future advertisement auctions, for example. For example, advertisement information is entered by an advertiser when the advertiser wants the advertisement to be considered for ad auctions. An advertiser enters a bid for an advertisement, which is the amount that the advertiser agrees to pay each time the ad is clicked by a user when the ad is displayed on a web page. The advertiser also may enter relevancy information, which may correspond to key word phrases associated with key word searches performed by online users, and/or web site genres for websites that the advertiser wants the advertisement displayed. That information collectively is used in an ad auction to provide a score or rating for an ad, to be compared with other ads competing in the same ad auction. In some embodiments, negative feedback on an ad as provided by online users can be used to lower the score or rating for the ad.
- In some embodiments, the ad feedback is filtered based on the category of ad feedback entered by the user, and then sent to an appropriate person or department which is assigned to deal with that particular type of ad feedback.
FIG. 6 shows afilter unit 410 that filters ad feedback based on the type of ad feedback, whereby the ad feedback is stored in adatabase 415 and also provided to either an email of afirst administrator 420, asecond ad administrator 430, or athird administrator 440, based on whether the ad feedback is based on a first ad feedback category, a second ad feedback category, or a third ad feedback category, as determined by the user's selection in thefeedback type region 230 of the ad feedback popup window (seeFIG. 3 ). By providing feedback to the correct persons or departments of an ad monitoring company in a streamlined manner at run time (that is, while a user making the feedback may still be online), quick decisions can be made with respect to pulling offensive or inappropriate ads from being viewed by persons on the Internet. An application can be utilized to forward ad feedback to the relevant persons or departments, based on the category of the ad feedback as chosen by the user who sent the feedback. - The use of the ad feedback can be used for either content ads or search ads. Content ads are provided to online users based on the content of a web site that the user visits, and search ads are provided to online users based on online keyword and/or image searches performed by users.
