- Example methods and systems are described herein. Any example embodiment or feature described herein is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or features.
- the example embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. It will be readily understood that certain aspects of the disclosed systems and methods can be arranged and combined in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are contemplated herein.
- An example apparatus includes a modular, enclosed container with a robotic manipulator inside to move objects such as boxes between a trailer at one end and a loading dock at the other end.
- the apparatus (referred to as a “modular dock”) may include one or more sets of wheels to allow it to be hauled by a truck to a facility, such as a warehouse.
- the modular dock may be positioned in between a loading dock at the facility and a truck trailer that is delivering boxes to and/or from the facility.
- the modular dock may be a relatively small and lightweight trailer (e.g., a 20-foot “half trailer”) that can be backed up to the loading dock of a warehouse and quickly made operational. This form factor allows the modular dock to fit in the space between a typical warehouse dock and typical 53-foot truck trailers.
- a back end of the modular dock may be opened (e.g., by sliding open a door) toward the loading dock.
- the back end of the modular dock may be aligned with the loading dock using one or more load levelers (also referred to as “legs”) positioned near the back end of the modular dock.
- the modular dock may contain a left back leg and a right back leg positioned at the back corners of the modular dock. Each back leg may be independently actuated to move up and down to align the floor of the modular dock with the loading dock on the back end.
- a trailer to load and/or unload may then be connected to the front end of the modular dock, which also may be opened to allow the robotic arm of the modular dock to access the contents of the trailer.
- the modular dock may also be equipped with one or more front legs positioned near the front end. Each front leg may be independently actuated to move up and down to align the floor of the modular dock with the trailer on the front end. Each time a new trailer hooks up to the modular dock, the legs may be adjusted to align with the new trailer.
- Independently actuable legs allow the modular dock to adjust for uneven ground that may be encountered in a parking lot of a warehouse. Additionally, the adjustable legs may allow the modular dock to attach to many different types of buildings and/or trailers. In some examples, the load levelers may also be used to counteract robotic motion within the trailer as the robotic manipulator is moving objects such as incoming boxes (e.g., to prevent the modular dock from tipping).
- a conveyor e.g., a telescoping conveyor
- the boxes may then be moved by the robotic arm contained within the modular dock from the connected trailer onto the conveyor to transport them into the facility.
- the modular dock may also be equipped with a piece of flexible conveyor which connects to the external conveyor from the loading dock.
- the flexible conveyor may be mounted to the floor of the modular dock to align with the loading dock and the attached trailer in order to take strain off the system as the robotic manipulator moves boxes onto to the flexible conveyor for delivery along the conveyor into the facility.
- the robotic arm By placing the robotic arm inside a modular, enclosed truck trailer, the benefits of robotic manipulation (e.g., for moving boxes as well as other functions such as sorting boxes, palletizing boxes, and/or determining metrics of incoming boxes) may be obtained without using extra floor space or otherwise upsetting operation of the facility. Additionally, safety concerns related to robotic operation may be greatly simplified by containing the robotic arm within the enclosed confines of the modular dock.
- the modular dock may also be equipped with one or more optical sensors fixed within the modular dock and/or attached to the robotic manipulator.
- a control system of the modular dock may use sensor data from these sensors to perform measurement, weighing, bar code scanning, and/or identification operations prior to moving boxes to or from existing facilities.
- the modular dock may also have its own network system in order to transmit this information about incoming or outgoing boxes to a facility. Other types of sensors may be used to determine box metrics within the modular dock as well.
- the modular dock presents an opportunity to standardize the environment of a robotic device and optimize the environment for robotic operation.
- the modular dock may also be equipped with a base operating system, a network communication system (e.g., a 4G uplink and a WiFi connection), and its own power system (e.g., a transformer and possibly its own generator).
- the modular dock may therefore be self-contained within a single unit with many different types of operations performed entirely within a transportable trailer (e.g., a “black box” for truck loading/unloading).
- a transportable trailer e.g., a “black box” for truck loading/unloading.
- the combination of the robotic device and the modular dock may only need to be put through a safety audit one time. Afterwards, as long as certain guidelines are followed in operation of the system, individual deployments (e.g., the modular dock pulling up to a dock) may not require additional safety audits.
- boxes or objects may be automatically organized and placed onto pallets.
- automating the process of loading/unloading trucks and/or the process of creating pallets from objects for easier storage and transport may provide a number of industrial and business advantages.
- automating the process of loading/unloading trucks and/or the process of creating pallets may include the incorporation of one or more robotic devices to move objects or perform other functions.
- a robotic device can be made mobile by coupling with a wheeled base, a holonomic base (e.g., a base that can move in any direction), or rails on the ceiling, walls or floors.
- the base can be an elevated base.
- a system including one or more sensors, one or more computers, and one or more robotic arms.
- the sensors may scan an environment containing one or more objects in order to capture visual data and/or three-dimensional (3D) depth information. Data from the scans may then be integrated into a representation of larger areas in order to provide digital environment reconstruction.
- the reconstructed environment may then be used for identifying objects to pick up, determining pick positions for objects, and/or planning collision-free trajectories for the one or more robotic arms and/or a mobile base.
- boxes will refer to any object or item that can be placed onto a pallet or loaded onto or unloaded from a truck or container.
- boxes can refer to cans, drums, tires or any other “simple” shaped geometric items.
- loading and unloading can each be used to imply the other.
- palletizing refers to loading boxes onto a pallet and stacking or arranging the boxes in a way such that the boxes on the pallet can be stored or transported on the pallet.
- the terms “palletizing” and “depalletizing” can each be used to imply the other.
- a robotic manipulator may be mounted on a holonomic cart (e.g., a cart with wheels that allow the cart to move in any direction).
- FIG. 1A depicts an exemplary holonomic cart containing a robotic manipulator.
- a moveable cart 112 may include a robotic arm 102 mounted on the cart 112 .
- the robotic arm 102 may contain a gripping component 104 for gripping objects within the environment.
- the cart may contain one or more wheels 114 , which may be holonomic wheels that operate with two degrees of freedom.
- a wrap around front conveyor belt 110 may be included on the holonomic cart 112 .
- the wrap around front conveyor belt may allow the robot to not have to rotate its gripper to the left or right when unloading or loading boxes from or to a truck container or pallet.
- the robotic manipulator may be mounted on a different type of movable apparatus or may not be mounted on a movable base at all.
- the robotic manipulator may be mounted at a fixed position within a factory setting.
- one or more robotic manipulators may be mounted on rails of a truck or container. In such examples, the robotic manipulators may be used to load or unload the truck or container.
- FIG. 1B is a functional block diagram illustrating a robotic device 100 , according to an example embodiment.
- the robotic device 100 could include various subsystems such as a mechanical system 120 , a sensing system 130 , a control system 140 , as well as a power supply 150 .
- the robotic device 100 may include more or fewer subsystems and each subsystem could include multiple elements. Further, each of the subsystems and elements of robotic device 100 could be interconnected. Thus, one or more of the described functions of the robotic device 100 may be divided up into additional functional or physical components, or combined into fewer functional or physical components. In some further examples, additional functional and/or physical components may be added to the examples illustrated by FIGS. 1A and 1B .
- the mechanical system 120 may include components described above with respect to FIG. 1A , including a robotic arm 102 , a gripper 104 , a conveyor belt 110 , a (movable or holonomic) cart 112 , and one or more wheels 114 .
- the mechanical system 120 may additionally include a motor 122 , which may be an electric motor powered by electrical power, or may be powered by a number of different energy sources, such as a gas-based fuel or solar power. Additionally, motor 122 may be configured to receive power from power supply 150 .
- the power supply 150 may provide power to various components of robotic device 100 and could represent, for example, a rechargeable lithium-ion or lead-acid battery. In an example embodiment, one or more banks of such batteries could be configured to provide electrical power. Other power supply materials and types are also possible.
- the sensing system 130 may use one or more sensors attached to a robotic arm 102 , such as sensor 106 and sensor 108 , which may be 2D sensors and/or 3D depth sensors that sense information about the environment as the robotic arm 102 moves.
- the sensing system may determine information about the environment that can be used by control system 140 (e.g., a computer running motion planning software) to pick and move boxes efficiently.
- the control system 140 could be located on the device or could be in remote communication with the device.
- scans from one or more 2D or 3D sensors with fixed mounts on a mobile base such as a front navigation sensor 116 and a rear navigation sensor 118 , and one or more sensors mounted on a robotic arm, such as sensor 106 and sensor 108 , may be integrated to build up a digital model of the environment, including the sides, floor, ceiling, and/or front wall of a truck or other container.
- the control system 140 may cause the mobile base to navigate into a position for unloading or loading.
- planar surface information may be extracted from 3D sensors to model walls, floor and/or box faces. After modeling the floor, projection of objects onto the floor plane may enable segmentation of obstacles and/or target objects such as boxes.
- Floor-plane projection can also be used to model the corrugated sides of a container or truck, which may not be accurately modeled as planes.
- sidewall angles, floor plane roll and pitch, and/or distance from side walls can be used to maneuver a mobile base into a container without collisions.
- Use of extended 3D information rather than a single line scan may help make the extraction of navigation information robust.
- the side walls may have a vertical extent that is captured by the 3D sensor. Scanning systems that use a single line of depth information may be slower if they scan vertically and/or less robust because they acquire less information.
- front plane modeling can determine the distance to a next group of objects to pick in truck unloading.
- the robotic arm 102 may be equipped with a gripper 104 , such as a digital suction grid gripper.
- the gripper may include one or more suction valves that can be turned on or off either by remote sensing, or single point distance measurement and/or by detecting whether suction is achieved.
- the digital suction grid gripper may include an articulated extension.
- the potential to actuate suction grippers with rheological fluids or powders may enable extra gripping on objects with high curvatures.
- the gripper could potentially span several boxes or objects and turn on suction for some or all of the covered objects.
- the suction or adhesion devices may be a “digital” grid so that the robotic device can turn on any number of the suction devices as will fit boxes sensed for grabbing.
- the system may notice a seam in the boxes (separation between adjacent boxes) such that suckers can be activated on both sides of the seam to pick up both boxes at once, thereby doubling the throughput.
- the suckers can sense after a certain amount time whether they can successfully grip a surface, after which they may automatically shut off.
- sections of the suckers can fold down to grasp the top of the boxes. For instance, grippers can initially start at full extension and then conform to the surface being gripped.
- the robotic arm can implement a wiggle movement to improve a suction grip.
- the robotic arm can wiggle a box side to side to help segment the box from its surroundings.
- the arm can wiggle upon pick up of the box to avoid jostling other objects.
- the robotic arm may employ a wiggle motion in order to make a firm seal against the object.
- the robotic arm may wiggle the object as the robotic arm is picking up the object so that the box can more gently break friction or overlap contact with other items. This may help avoid a situation where pulling the object up too directly or too quickly causes other items to be tossed into the air.
- cardboard boxes can have concave, convex or otherwise rumpled faces that make it hard for a suction device to adhere to.
- wiggling the suction device as the device makes suction contact may enable a more reliable grip on cardboard boxes and other non-planar objects.
- a few center suction devices can be turned on and the arm can wiggle back and forth as it starts to pull the box out. This may break surface adhesion with other boxes and help to start to pull the box out. Once the box is at least partially pulled out, the box may then be segmented from the other boxes more easily.
- wiggling while picking up an object in clutter may remove other objects from the picked up object, thereby preventing unwanted pick up of surrounding objects.
- segmentation of items may be necessary for successful grasping.
- a smooth surface patch may belong to two separate objects.
- manipulator interaction with the objects may be used to perturb the scene to better segment the objects from each other.
- the natural or forced movement of objects on a conveyor, on a slide, moving in a tote, and/or actively jostled within a tote may be tracked by optical flow, parallax, or time delayed views to calculate stereo depth in order to enhance object segmentation.
- one or more of the sensors used by a sensing system may be a RGBaD (RGB+active Depth) color or monochrome camera registered to a depth sensing device that uses active vision techniques such as projecting a pattern into a scene to enable depth triangulation between the camera or cameras and the known offset pattern projector.
- RGBaD RGB+active Depth
- This type of sensor data may help enable robust segmentation.
- cues such as barcodes, texture coherence, color, 3D surface properties, or printed text on the surface may also be used to identify an object and/or find its pose in order to know where and/or how to place the object (e.g., fitting the object into a fixture receptacle).
- shadow or texture differences may be employed to segment objects as well.
- Control system 140 may include at least one processor 142 (which could include at least one microprocessor) that executes instructions 144 stored in a non-transitory computer readable medium, such as the memory 146 .
- the control system 140 may also represent a plurality of computing devices that may serve to control individual components or subsystems of the robotic device 100 in a distributed fashion.
- memory 146 may contain instructions 144 (e.g., program logic) executable by the processor 142 to execute various functions of robotic device 100 , including those described above in connection with FIGS. 1A-1B .
- Memory 146 may contain additional instructions as well, including instructions to transmit data to, receive data from, interact with, and/or control one or more of the mechanical system 120 , the sensor system 130 , and/or the control system 140 .
- a perception-guided robot may utilize a combination of perception together with planning to guide the robot arm to pick up a box and place it where it needs to go.
- FIG. 2A illustrates part of the robotic device from FIG. 1A with a stack of boxes, according to an example embodiment.
- the robotic device may include a robotic arm 102 with a gripping component 104 , sensors 106 and 108 , and conveyor 110 as described above.
- the robotic device could be mounted on a holonomic cart as described with respect to FIG. 1A , could be mounted on a different type of movable apparatus, could be mounted on rails or tracks, or could be stationary.
- the robotic device may be controlled to pick boxes from a stack of boxes 220 containing a heterogenous mix of shapes and sizes of boxes.
- a virtual environment including a model of the objects in 2D and/or 3D may be determined and used to develop a plan or strategy for picking up the boxes.
- the robot may use one or more sensors to scan an environment containing objects, as shown in FIG. 2B .
- a sensor 106 on the arm may capture sensor data about the stack of boxes 220 in order to determine shapes and/or positions of individual boxes.
- a larger picture of a 3D environment may be built up by integrating information from individual (e.g., 3D) scans. Sensors performing these scans may be placed in fixed positions, on a robotic arm, and/or in other locations. According to various embodiments, scans may be constructed and used in accordance with any or all of a number of different techniques.
- scans can be made by moving a robotic arm upon which one or more 3D sensors are mounted. Feedback from the arm position may provide pose information about where the sensor is positioned and may be used to help with the integration. Alternately, or additionally, scans may be made using one or more 2D sensors, for instance by leveraging motion and tracking keypoints in the environment. In further examples, scans may be from fixed-mount cameras that have fields of view (FOVs) covering a given field. In additional examples, scans may be visually registered to help with fine pose estimation, potentially giving better integration results.
- FOVs fields of view
- a virtual environment may be built up using a 3D volumetric or surface model to integrate information (e.g., from different sensors). This may allow the system to operate within a larger environment, such as in cases where one sensor may be insufficient to cover a large environment. Such techniques may also increase the level of detail captured, which may help the robotic device perform various tasks. In particular, integrating information can yield finer detail than from a single scan alone (e.g., by bringing down noise levels). This may make possible better object detection, surface picking, or other applications.
- wide-angle environment reconstruction may be performed by sensing an environment and extracting that information into a simplified geometric model of simple mathematical 3D geometric forms (e.g., planes, cylinders, cones, hemispheres, etc).
- a simplified geometric model of simple mathematical 3D geometric forms e.g., planes, cylinders, cones, hemispheres, etc.
- such techniques may make motion planning easier and/or may make violation of the models (e.g., collisions) easier to detect.
- such techniques may allow a parametric description to extend the environment. For instance, the ground may be treated as a plane that extends behind objects that occlude it.
- planes or other mathematical surfaces in the environment may be extracted in 3D. These known “ideal” surface detections may be combined into a more accurate model of the environment. For instance, planes may be used to determine the full extents of walls (or mathematical description thereof) and other obstacles to avoid collisions and detect where objects of interest are. Also, mathematical representations of objects may be used to look for anomalies such as when person enters into an environment. Such events may violate the ideal model, which may make their detection easier.
- certain objects such as boxes may have simple planar form.
- a metal can have a geometric form of a cylinder and a tire may have a geometric form of a torus.
- Example systems may leverage this trait of certain objects in order model them and/or determine how to motion plan for the objects.
- known templates of certain shapes can be used to refine detected features of objects within the environment that appear to match a particular shape.
- 2D and 3D information may be represented at least in part via one or more facades.
- a facade may be defined as a near-planar construct containing a set of objects, represented as a depth map (e.g., a 2D map of distances as the third dimension). Examples of facades may include the wall of boxes in a truck, the top of a pallet stack containing boxes or other objects, or the top of a bin of jumbled objects.
- a facade may be constructed from boxes, for instance to plan in what order the boxes should be picked up.
- box 222 may be identified by the robotic device as the next box to pick up.
- Box 222 may be identified within a facade representing a front wall of the stack of boxes 220 constructed based on sensor data collected by one or more sensors, such as sensor 106 and 108 .
- a control system may then determine that box 222 is the next box to pick, possibly based on its shape and size, its position on top of the stack of boxes 220 , and/or based on characteristics of a target container or location for the boxes.
- the robotic arm 102 may then be controlled to pick up the box 222 using gripper 104 and place the box 222 onto the conveyor belt 110 (e.g., to transport box 222 into a storage area).
- a facade may be represented as an orthographic projection of 3D surface information. This representation may allow for parsing the facade to determine interesting areas for a particular application. For example, in truck unloading, the upper left corner of the next box to pick may be determined based on a facade representation.
- an orthographic projection of integrated 3D environment may be determined to give a wide-FOV, easily-parsed representation for performing application-related tasks. One such task may be finding the corner or corners (e.g., top left) of a box to pick. Another such task may involve finding good surfaces (e.g., relatively flat and large) for picking objects out of a bin.
- a 3D model of a stack of boxes may be constructed and used as a model to help plan and track progress for loading/unloading boxes to/from a stack or pallet. Any one actual camera view of the facade may suffer from point of view occlusions and perspective distortion. Accordingly, multiple RGBD views via robot arm movements and/or different views from a cart base or fixed locations may be combine to create a single facade of the boxes to be picked.
- the 3D model may be used for collision avoidance.
- planning a collision-free trajectory may involve determining the 3D location of objects and surfaces in the environment.
- a trajectory optimizer may make use of the 3D information provided by environment reconstruction to optimize paths in the presence of obstacles.
- the optimizer may work in real time and may accept many kinds of constraints. As an example of such a constraint, the optimizer may attempt to keep the end effector level throughout the trajectory.
- an environment may be captured as a mesh or set of 3D points.
- a robot arm may be represented as a convex hull of plane segments for quick collision checking. Constant or frequent updating of the environment may allow the robot arm to quickly respond to changes.
- an optimizer may perform frequent continuous collision checking throughout its path.
- An optimizer may accept arbitrary constraints in the form of costs, such as to keep a certain distance away from objects or to approach a goal position from a given angle. Additionally, an optimizer may avoid robot fault conditions by working in joint space, keeping track of windup and choosing goal positions from among multiple inverse kinematics solutions.
- One strategy for motion planning may involve looking ahead several moves to see if the chosen goal joint position will be acceptable for the next move.
- path constraints such as collision avoidance for robotic arms, cameras, cables, and/or other components
- path constraints may be put in a constraint based planning solver and solved for to yield a best path to move the arm for perception.
- the solver may determine a best path for picking up, moving, and placing an object.
- 3D and/or visual sensors may be calibrated to determine their pose with respect to the workspace.
- the calibration may determine their fixed pose in the workspace.
- calibration may determine the offset pose of the sensor from the arm link to which it is attached.
- calibration techniques may allow for the calibration of an arbitrary number of sensors in the workspace. Calibration may involve determining some or all of a variety of parameters and coefficients. For example, calibration may solve for one or more intrinsic parameters such as focal length and image center. As another example, calibration may determine one or more distortion coefficients such as models of radial and tangential distortion. As yet another example, calibration may solve for one or more extrinsic parameters, where the object is in a scene relative to a pattern or other sensors that identified the same pattern in a scene.
- calibration may be performed at least in part by using a calibration pattern, which may be a known set of features in 2D or 3D. For instance, a known pattern of dots may be used, where the distance between each dot and the other dots is known. Calibration may be performed at least in part by collecting multiple different views of an object. In further examples, capturing multiple views of a calibration pattern in different positions may allow for (1) calibration of the one or more coefficients of the camera and/or (2) knowledge of where the camera is relative to the coordinate system established by where the calibration pattern was fixed. In particular embodiments, a camera in the scene may identify a calibration pattern on the robot arm while a camera on the arm identifies a calibration pattern in the scene simultaneously.
- calibration may involve a camera fixed in a scene.
- a calibration pattern may be placed on a robotic arm.
- the robotic arm may be configured to move through the scene as multiple views of the calibration pattern on the robotic arm are collected. This may help to calibrate the camera and/or be useful for relating the coordinate system of the camera to that of the robot. Further, the relation of each device to the other can be determined by each device as the robotic arm moves.
- calibration may involve a camera located on a robotic arm.
- a calibration pattern may be mounted on a wall or table. Then, the camera may be moved around, collecting multiple views of the calibration pattern from different robot or robotic arm positions. When different 3D or 2D views (e.g., 2, 20, 200) are collected, these views can be used to solve for the calibration relationships.
- the system can determine where it is relative to the coordinate system set based on the location of the calibration pattern in the scene.
- both the calibration pattern and the camera may be movable.
- the calibration pattern may be located on a conveyor belt where the robotic arm may be configured to place boxes. After calibration, the system may determine where the camera was relative to that spot on the conveyor belt.
- nonlinear optimization may be performed in a two-stage process for robust estimation of 3D sensor calibration.
- an initialization may be derived from the relative pose offsets of the target and the sensors.
- a batch bundle adjustment may be used to find the optimal pose of the cameras together with the target points.
- Calibration can be extended to the estimation of robot parameters such as joint lengths and joint angle offsets.
- known, precise, robot motion of the camera over a calibration pattern, or a calibration pattern over a camera may be used to improve calibration results. For instance, information about precisely how the camera moves may be used to obtain more accurate camera calibration. That is, if the camera is moved 50 mm right, the corresponding (perspective projection) amount of movement from the calibration object may be detected. This information may be used to jointly or separately optimize the calibration and tracking parameters.
- a robot can look at its ongoing calibration and move in such a way as to maximize information for better calibration. For example, it can detect that some view areas have not been seen and go to those views.

- the pick location containing the items may not be sensitive to precise object orientation(s) and items may be mixed together.
- the place location for the items may or may not be sensitive to object orientation.
- the pick-and-place regions may be defined as 3D regions acceptable for picking or placing an object, with some tolerance.
- the pick-and-place region may be highly cluttered with similar and/or disparate objects.
- the items may come from or be put into a fixture, such as metal or plastic snaps that hold the sorted item in a particular orientation.
- environment modeling of both the pick-and-place location may be used for intelligent grasp location and motion, as well as event reporting (e.g., when a place region is full or a pick region is empty).
- object bounding volumes may be computed and/or distinguishing features of objects may be found (such as textures, colors, barcodes or OCR).
- objects may be sorted into an assigned destination location by matching against a database of location assignments indexed by object type or object ID. For instance, an object's locations may be derived from reading a barcode, considering the size of the object, and/or by recognizing a particular kind of object.
- a plan for a robotic device may be determined in order to achieve certain configurations of the objects within a target location for the objects.
- the goals for loading/unloading or constructing/deconstructing pallets may be to achieve: 1) a dense packing with minimal air gaps in between boxes, and/or 2) a stable packing that won't easily collapse.
- stability may require that, in general, heavy objects are on the bottom, and light objects are on top.
- pallets may be created in order to avoid non-interlaced column stacks, column leans, or other characteristics of a bad stack.
- the pallet or truck/container may be loaded such that work by human operators in subsequent unloading processes is minimized.
- items may be placed in last in, first out order such that, upon unpacking, the items needed first are on top, the items needed second are one layer down and so on.
- the loading of pallets may be independent of how items flow towards the packing cells.
- the system can handle packages sent in random order or in an order known in advance.
- systems may adapt to changes in the flow of items on the fly.
- one or more boxes may be recorded and buffered by holding the boxes in a temporary storage area where their order can be changed along the way.
- a 2D simulator and/or a 3D simulator may be utilized for truck or container loading/unloading or for pallet loading/unloading.
- the state of a stack of boxes may be captured in the physical world and input into the simulator.
- a variable size queue of boxes from one to all the boxes may be used by a simulator for finding a next box to pick. For example, a queue of 2 boxes or 4 boxes or 10 boxes may be considered by a simulator.
- the simulator may search over the boxes in the queue to find the best box placement by heuristic algorithms and/or by brute force or multi-resolution search.
- the system may increment with increasingly fine placement of boxes around the best sites found in the previously coarser level.
- a physics planner may be used for motion planning in order to move the box efficiently to the determined locations.
- the physical and simulated stacks may be continuously monitored for quality of the stack (e.g., density, stability, and/or order placement). In some examples, the process may be repeated until all the boxes have been placed or the target container can no longer fit in another box.

- the front bases and rear bases may be adjusted simultaneously.
- height adjustments of the front bases and rear bases may be interspersed during a single alignment process to align the floor of the container with both the loading dock at the back and the trailer at the front.
- method 400 may further involve moving one or more objects between the trailer and the loading dock by moving the objects through the rectangular container with a robotic manipulator connected to the floor of the container.
- the robotic manipulator may move the objects directly between the trailer and the loading dock (e.g., by reaching into the trailer, picking up an object, and carrying it through the modular dock to the loading dock).
- the robotic manipulator may move objects through the container between the trailer and the loading dock by placing them onto and/or picking them up from one or more conveyors that are contained within the modular dock, run from the modular dock to the loading dock, and/or run from the modular dock to the trailer.
- a block that represents a processing of information may correspond to circuitry that can be configured to perform the specific logical functions of a herein-described method or technique.
- a block that represents a processing of information may correspond to a module, a segment, or a portion of program code (including related data).
- the program code may include one or more instructions executable by a processor for implementing specific logical functions or actions in the method or technique.
- the program code and/or related data may be stored on any type of computer readable medium such as a storage device including a disk or hard drive or other storage medium.
- the computer readable medium may also include non-transitory computer readable media such as computer-readable media that stores data for short periods of time like register memory, processor cache, and random access memory (RAM).
- the computer readable media may also include non-transitory computer readable media that stores program code and/or data for longer periods of time, such as secondary or persistent long term storage, like read only memory (ROM), optical or magnetic disks, compact-disc read only memory (CD-ROM), for example.
- the computer readable media may also be any other volatile or non-volatile storage systems.
- a computer readable medium may be considered a computer readable storage medium, for example, or a tangible storage device.
- a block that represents one or more information transmissions may correspond to information transmissions between software and/or hardware modules in the same physical device. However, other information transmissions may be between software modules and/or hardware modules in different physical devices.
