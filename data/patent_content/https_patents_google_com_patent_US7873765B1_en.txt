- the browser or tool 808 may include graphical user interface (GUI)-based tools and/or an web browsers, such as MICROSOFT EXPLORER, NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR, and the like.
- GUI graphical user interface
- the memory 802 further stores a client application or program 410 that is independently obtained or downloaded onto the client from a server.
- the client application 410 includes various elements, sub-elements, modules, and sub-modules to perform various tasks.
- a detection module 810 is provided to perform detection and identification of peripheral devices 828 that are part of the client architecture 800 .
- An information processing and gathering module 812 is used to gather information (e.g., data relating to the peripheral devices 828 ), and to process the gathered information.
- an information reception and transmission module 814 is provided to transmit the processed information to the server, and to receive information (e.g., offerings) from the server.
- a display module 816 is used to display the information as one or more documents using the browser and/or tool 808 for the benefit of the user.
- aspects of the present invention may be embodied, at least in part, in software. That is, the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor, such as a microprocessor, executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory, such as ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory, cache, a remote storage device, and the like.
- processor such as a microprocessor
- a memory such as ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory, cache, a remote storage device, and the like.
- hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the present invention.
- the techniques are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software or to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.
- a machine-readable medium can be used to store software and data which when executed by a data processing system causes the system to perform various methods of the present invention.
- This executable software and data may be stored in various places including for example ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory, cache, and the like. Portions of this software and/or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices.
- a machine-readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (i.e., stores and/or transmits) information in a form accessible by a machine (e.g., a computer, network device, personal digital assistant, manufacturing tool, and any device with a set of one or more processors).
- a machine e.g., a computer, network device, personal digital assistant, manufacturing tool, and any device with a set of one or more processors.
- the machine-readable medium may include, but is not limited to, floppy diskette, optical disk, compact disk-ROM (CD-ROM), magneto-optical disk, ROM, RAM, erasable programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), magnetic or optical storage media, flash memory devices and another type of media/machine-readable medium suitable for storing electronic instructions.
