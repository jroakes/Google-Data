- Paper documents have an enduring appeal, as can be seen by the proliferation of paper documents even in the computer age. It has never been easier to print and publish paper documents than it is today. Paper documents prevail even though electronic documents are easier to duplicate, transmit, search and edit. [0005] People read for a variety of reasons: for enjoyment, for education, to research a particular topic, for business-related information-gathering, for reference purposes or to keep in touch with current affairs, to name but a few. Every day around the world, a vast amount of human time, effort and mental energy goes into reading.
- printed documents are static. They do afford users the convenience and flexibility we have come to associate with electronic data; the ability to copy, edit, search, classify, annotate and distribute information with ease.

- a system for interacting with rendered documents is described.
- the system is based in part on the process of capturing and interpreting rendered marks in documents (e.g., text and supplemental marks). Captures from rendered documents enable a rich set of user functions and interactions, some of which will be described below.
- the described system makes use of the observation that text documents are comprised of many individual text fragments which can serve as signatures or identifiers. These fragments can identify particular documents (or groups of documents) and, in some embodiments, the location within each document where the text fragment or fragments occurred.
- the system captures text from a rendered document and associates some action, data, or functionality with that capture - thus making printed paper interactive.
- Any printed or rendered document can have associated supplemental materials.
- These materials can include information and actions such as comments to and from other readers, comments to and from the author, addendum and errata, glossaries and supplemental data, additional graphics (including motion video), help with specific topics, discussion groups, related news stories, audio segments, spoken pronunciation of words, opportunities to purchase products, highlights and annotations from other readers, other rendered and/or printed documents, including other locations in the current document being scanned.
- These materials may be considered an interactive environment that can be accessed by a user of the described system.
- the described system provides a way for authors and publishers to add value to printed documents by endowing them with an electronic life which is easily accessible to the reader.
- Some embodiments of the described system perform aggregate analysis of text captures performed by multiple users.
- the system uses a sample of text captured from a paper document, for example using a handheld scanner, to identify and locate an electronic counterpart of the document.
- the amount of text needed by the facility is very small in that a few words of text from a document can often function as an identifier for the paper document and as a link to its electronic counterpart.
- the system may use those few words to identify not only the document, but also a location within the document.
- the system implements these and many other examples of "paper/digital integration" without requiring changes to the current processes of writing, printing and publishing documents, giving such conventional rendered documents a whole new layer of digital functionality.
- a typical use of the system begins with using an optical scanner to scan text from a paper document, but it is important to note that other methods of capture from other types of document are equally applicable.
- the system is therefore sometimes described as scanning or capturing text from a rendered document, where those terms are defined as follows:
- a rendered document is a printed document or a document shown on a display or monitor. It is a document that is perceptible to a human, whether in permanent form or on a transitory display.
- Scanning or capturing is the process of systematic examination to obtain information from a rendered document.
- the process may involve optical capture using a scanner or camera (for example a camera in a cellphone), or it may involve reading aloud from the document into an audio capture device or typing it on a keypad or keyboard.
- a scanner or camera for example a camera in a cellphone
- an audio capture device for example a microphone
- a keypad or keyboard for example a keyboard
- Figure 1 is a data flow diagram that illustrates the flow of information in one embodiment of the core system. Other embodiments may not use all of the stages or elements illustrated here, while some will use many more.
- Text from a rendered document is captured 100, typically in optical form by an optical scanner or audio form by a voice recorder, and this image or sound data is then processed 102, for example to remove artifacts of the capture process or to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
- a recognition process 104 such as OCR, speech recognition, or autocorrelation then converts the data into a signature, comprised in some embodiments of text, text offsets, or other symbols.
- the system performs an alternate form of extracting document signature from the rendered document.
- the signature represents a set of possible text transcriptions in some embodiments. This process may be influenced by feedback from other stages, for example, if the search process and context analysis 110 have identified some candidate documents from which the capture may originate, thus narrowing the possible interpretations of the original capture.
- a post-processing 106 stage may take the output of the recognition process and filter it or perform such other operations upon it as may be useful. Depending upon the embodiment implemented, it may be possible at this stage to deduce some direct actions 107 to be taken immediately without reference to the later stages, such as where a phrase or symbol has been captured which contains sufficient information in itself to convey the user's intent. In these cases no digital counterpart document need be referenced, or even known to the system.
- next stage will be to construct a query 108 or a set of Queries for use in searching.
- Some aspects of the query construction may depend on the search process used and so cannot be performed until the next stage, but there will typically be some operations, such as the removal of obviously misrecognized or irrelevant characters, which can be performed in advance.
- the query or queries are then passed to the search and context analysis stage 110.
- the system optionally attempts to identify the document from which the original data was captured.
- the system typically uses search indices and search engines 112, knowledge about the user 114 and knowledge about the user's context or the context in which the capture occurred 116.
- Search engine 112 may employ and/or index information specifically about rendered documents, about their digital counterpart documents, and about documents that have a web (internet) presence). It may write to, as well as read from, many of these sources and, as has been mentioned, it may feed information into other stages of the process, for example by giving the recognition system 104 information about the language, font, rendering and likely next words based on its knowledge of the candidate documents.
- the sources of the documents 124 may be directly accessible, for example from a local filing system or database or a web server, or they may need to be contacted via some access service 122 which might enforce authentication, security or payment or may provide other services such as conversion of the document into a desired format.
- Applications of the system may take advantage of the association of extra functionality or data with part or all of a document.
- advertising applications discussed in Section 10.4 may use an association of particular advertising messages or subjects with portions of a document.
- This extra associated functionality or data can be thought of as one or more overlays on the document, and is referred to herein as "markup.”
- the next stage of the process 130 is to identify any markup relevant to the captured data.
- markup may be provided by the user, the originator, or publisher of the document, or some other party, and may be directly accessible from some source 132 or may be generated by some service 134.
- markup can be associated with, and apply to, a rendered document and/or the digital counterpart to a rendered document, or to groups of either or both of these documents.
- some actions may be taken 140. These may be default actions such as simply recording the information found, they may be dependent on the data or document, or they may be derived from the markup analysis. Sometimes the action will simply be to pass the data to another system. In some cases the various possible actions appropriate to a capture at a specific point in a rendered document will be presented to the user as a menu on an associated display, for example on a local display 332, on a computer display 212 or a mobile phone or PDA display 216. If the user doesn't respond to the menu, the default actions can be taken.
- FIG. 2 is a component diagram of components included in a typical implementation of the system in the context of a typical operating environment.
- the operating environment includes one or more optical scanning capture devices 202 or voice capture devices 204.
- Each capture device is able to communicate with other parts of the system such as a computer 212 and a mobile station 216 (e.g., a mobile phone or PDA) using either a direct wired or wireless connection, or through the network 220, with which it can communicate using a wired or wireless connection, the latter typically involving a wireless base station 214.
- the capture device is integrated in the mobile station, and optionally shares some of the audio and/or optical components used in the device for voice communications and picture-taking.
- Computer 212 may include a memory containing computer executable instructions for processing an order from scanning devices 202 and 204.
- an order can include an identifier (such as a serial number of the scanning device 202/204 or an identifier that partially or uniquely identifies the user of the scanner), scanning context information (e.g., time of scan, location of scan, etc.) and/or scanned information (such as a text string) that is used to uniquely identify the document being scanned.
- scanning context information e.g., time of scan, location of scan, etc.
- scanned information such as a text string
- the operating environment may include more or less components.
- the network 220 may be a corporate intranet, the public Internet,- a mobile phone network or sor ⁇ e other network, or any interconnection of the above.
- the devices may all be operable in accordance with well-known commercial transaction and communication protocols (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP)).
- IP Internet Protocol
- the functions and capabilities of scanning device 202, computer 212, and mobile station 216 may be wholly or partially integrated into one device.
- scanning device, computer, and mobile station can refer to the same device depending upon whether the device incorporates functions or capabilities of the scanning device 202, computer 212 and mobile station 216.
- some or all of the functions of the search engines 232, document sources 234, user account services 236, markup services 238 and other network services 239 may be implemented on any of the devices and/or other devices not shown.
- the capture device may capture text using an optical scanner that captures image data from the rendered document, or using an audio recording device that captures a user's spoken reading of the text, or other methods. Some embodiments of the capture device may also capture images, graphical symbols and icons, etc., including machine readable codes such as barcodes.
- the device may be exceedingly simple, consisting of little more than the transducer, some storage, and a data interface, relying on other functionality residing elsewhere in the system, or it may be a more full-featured device. For illustration, this section describes a device based around an optical scanner and with a reasonable number of features.
- Scanners are well known devices that capture and digitize images. An offshoot of the photocopier industry, the first scanners were relatively large devices that captured an entire document page at once. Recently, portable optical scanners have been introduced in convenient form factors, such as a pen-shaped handheld device.
- the portable scanner is used to scan text, graphics, or symbols from rendered documents.
- the portable scanner has a scanning element that captures text, symbols, graphics, etc, from rendered documents.
- rendered documents include documents that have been displayed on a screen such as a CRT monitor or LCD display.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a scanner 302.
- the scanner 302 comprises an optical scanning head 308 to scan information from rendered documents and convert it to machine-compatible data, and an optical path 306, typically a lens, an aperture or an image conduit to convey the image from the rendered document to the scanning head.
- the scanning head 308 may incorporate a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD), a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) imaging device, or an optical sensor of another type.
- CCD Charge-Coupled Device
- CMOS Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
- a microphone 310 and associated circuitry convert the sound of the environment (including spoken words) into machine-compatible signals, and other input facilities exist in the form of buttons, scroll-wheels or other tactile sensors such as touch-pads 314.
- Feedback to the user is possible through a visual display or indicator lights 332, through a loudspeaker or other audio transducer 334 and through a vibrate module 336.
- the scanner 302 comprises logic 326 to interact with the various other components, possibly processing the received signals into different formats and/or interpretations.
- Logic 326 may be operable to read and write data and program instructions stored in associated storage 330 such as RAM, ROM, flash, or other suitable memory. It may read a time signal from the clock unit 328.
- the scanner 302 also includes an interface 316 to communicate scanned information and other signals to a network and/or an associated computing device.
- the scanner 302 may have an on-board power supply 332.
- the scanner 302 may be powered from a tethered connection to another device, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection.
- USB Universal Serial Bus
- a reader may scan some text from a newspaper article with scanner 302. The text is scanned as a bit-mapped image via the scanning head 308.
- Logic 326 causes the bit-mapped image to be stored in memory 330 with an associated time-stamp read from the clock unit 328.
- Logic 326 may also perform optical character recognition (OCR) or other post-scan 005/025732
- Logic 326 may optionally extract a signature from the image, for example by performing a convolution-like process to locate repeating occurrences of characters, symbols or objects, and determine the distance or number of other characters, symbols, or objects between these repeated elements. The reader may then upload the bit-mapped image (or text or other signature, if post-scan processing has been performed by logic 326) to an associated computer via interface 316.
- a reader may capture some text from an article as an audio file by using microphone 310 as an acoustic capture port.
- Logic 326 causes audio file to be stored in memory 328.
- Logic 326 may also perform voice recognition or other post-scan processing on the audio file to convert it to text.
- the reader may then upload the audio file (or text produced by post-scan processing performed by logic 326) to an associated computer via interface 316,
- End-to-end feedback can be applied by performing an approximation of the recognition or interpretation, identifying a set of one or more candidate matching documents, and then using information from the possible matches in the candidate documents to further refine or restrict the recognition or interpretation.
- Candidate documents can be weighted according to their probable relevance (for example, based on then number of other users who have scanned in these documents, or their popularity on the Internet), and these weights can be applied in this iterative recognition process.
- the selective power of a search query based on a few words is greatly enhanced when the relative positions of these words are known, only a small amount of text need be captured for the system to identify the text" s location in a corpus.
- the input text will be a contiguous sequence of words, such as a short phrase.
- the system can identify the location in that document and can take action based on this knowledge.
- the system may also employ other methods of discovering the document and location, such as by using watermarks or other special markings on the rendered document.
- the document identity and other information related to previous captures, especially if they were quite recent, may form part of a search query.
- the identity of the user may be determined from a unique identifier associated with a capturing device, and/or biometric or other supplemental information (speech patterns, fingerprints, etc.).
- the search query can be constructed taking into account the types of errors likely to occur in the particular capture method used.
- One example of this is an indication of suspected errors in the recognition of specific characters; in this instance a search engine may treat these characters as wildcards, or assign them a lower priority.
- the capturing device may not be in communication with the search engine or corpus at the time of the data capture. For this reason, information helpful to the offline use of the device may be downloaded to the device in advance, or to some entity with which the device can communicate. In some cases, all or a substantial part of an index associated with a corpus may be downloaded. This topic is discussed further in Section 15.3.
- this pre-loaded information can improve the performance of the local device, reduce communication costs, and provide helpful and timely user feedback.
- the queries may be saved and transmitted to the rest of the system at such a time as communication is restored.
- multiple queries may be launched in response to a single capture, either in sequence or in parallel.
- queries may be sent in response to a single capture, for example as new words are added to the capture, or to query multiple search engines in parallel.
- the system sends queries to a special index for the current document, to a search engine on a local machine, to a search engine on the corporate network, and to remote search engines on the Internet.
- results of particular searches may be given higher priority than those from others.
- search engine that handles traditional online queries also to handle those originating from rendered documents.
- Conventional search engines may be enhanced or modified in a number of ways to make them more suitable for use with the described system. .
- the search engine and/or other components of the system may create and maintain indices that have different or extra features.
- the system may modify an incoming paper-originated query or change the way the query is handled in the resulting search, thus distinguishing these paper-originated queries from those coming from queries typed into web browsers and other sources.
- the system may take different actions or offer different options when the results are returned by the searches originated from paper as compared to those from other sources.
- the same index can be searched using either paper-originated or traditional queries, but the index may be enhanced for use in the current system in a variety of ways. 4.1.1. Knowledge about the paper form
- Extra fields can be added to such an index that will help in the case of a paper-based search.
- the first example is a field indicating that the document is known to exist or be distributed in paper form.
- the system may give such documents higher priority if the query comes from paper.
- Another important example may be recording information about the layout of a specific rendering of a document.
- the index may include information about where the line breaks and page breaks occur, which fonts were used, any unusual capitalization.
- the index may also include information about the proximity of other items on the page, such as images, text boxes, tables and advertisements.
- a second factor that may modify the nature of the index is the knowledge of the type of capture likely to be used.
- a search initiated by an optical scan may benefit if the index takes into account characters that are easily confused in the OCR process, or includes some knowledge of the fonts used in the document.
- the query is from speech recognition, an index based on similar-sounding phonemes may be much more efficiently searched.
- An additional factor that may affect the use of the index in the described model is the importance of iterative feedback during the recognition process. If the search engine is able to provide feedback from the index ar the text is being captured, it can greatly increase the accuracy of the capture.
- the system stores the appropriate offset or signature information in an index.
- Indices may be maintained on several machines on a corporate network. Partial indices may be downloaded to the capture device, or to a machine close to the capture device. Separate indices may be created for users or groups of users with particular interests, habits or permissions. An index may exist for each filesystem, each directory, even each file on a user's hard disk. Indexes are published and subscribed to by users and by systems. It will be important, then, to construct indices that can be distributed, updated, merged and separated efficiently.
- a search engine may take different actions when it recognizes that a search query originated from a paper document.
- the engine might handle the query in a way that is more tolerant to the types of errors likely to appear in certain capture methods, for example.
- It may be able to deduce this from some indicator included in the query (for example a flag indicating the nature of the capture), or it may deduce this from the query itself (for example, it may recognize errors or uncertainties typical of the OCR process).
- queries from a capture device can reach the engine by a different channel or port or type of connection than those from other sources, and can be distinguished in that way.
- some embodiments of the system will route queries to the search engine by way of a dedicated gateway.
- the search engine knows that all queries passing through the dedicated gateway were originated from a paper document.
- Section 13 below describes a variety of different factors which are external to the captured text itself, yet which can be a significant aid in identifying a document. These include such things as the history of recent scans, the longer-term reading habits of a particular user, the geographic location of a user and the user's recent use of particular electronic documents. Such factors are referred to herein as "context.”
- search engine may keep track of a user's scanning history, and may also cross-reference this scanning history to conventional keyboard-based queries. In such cases, the search engine maintains and uses more state information about each individual user than do most conventional search engines, and each interaction with a search engine may be considered to extend over several searches and a longer period of time than is typical today.
- Some of the context may be transmitted to the search engine in the search query (Section 3.3), and may possibly be stored at the engine so as to play a part in future queries. Lastly, some of the context will best be handled elsewhere, and so becomes a filter or secondary search applied to the results from the search engine. 2
- the described system can emit and use not only information about documents as a whole, but also information about sub-regions of documents, even down to individual words.
- Many existing search engines concentrate simply on locating a document or file that is relevant to a particular query. Those that can work on a finer grain and identify a location within a document will provide a significant benefit for the described system.
- the search engine may use some of the further information it now maintains to affect the results returned.
- the system may also return certain documents to which the user has access only as a result of being in possession of the paper copy (Section 7.4).
- the search engine may also offer new actions or options appropriate to the described system, beyond simple retrieval of the text. 5. Markup, Annotations and Metadata
- the described system In addition to performing the capture-search-retrieve process, the described system also associates extra functionality with a document, and in particular with specific locations or segments of text within a document. This extra functionality is often, though not exclusively, associated with the rendered document by being associated with its electronic counterpart. As an example, hyperlinks in a web page could have the same functionality when a printout of that web page is scanned. In some cases, the functionality is not defined in the electronic document, but is stored or generated elsewhere. 2005/025732
- markup This layer of added functionality is referred to herein as "markup.”
- markup is as an "overlay" on the document, which provides further information about — and may specify actions associated with- -the document or some portion of it.
- the markup may include human-readable content, but is often invisible to a user and/or intended for machine use. Examples include options to be displayed in a popup-menu on a nearby display when a user captures text from a particular area in a rendered document, or audio samples that illustrate the pronunciation of a particular phrase.
- Any document may have multiple overlays simultaneously, and these may be sourced from a variety of locations.
- Markup data may be created or supplied by the author of the document, or by the user, or by some other party.
- Markup data may be attached to the electronic document or embedded in it. It may be found in a conventional location (for example, in the same place as the document but with a different filename suffix). Markup data may be included in the search results of the query that located the original document, or may be found by a separate query to the same or another search engine. Markup data may be found using the original captured text and other capture information or contextual information, or it may be found using already-deduced information about the document and location of the capture. Markup data may be found in a location specified in the document, even if the markup itself is not included in the document.
- the markup may be largely static and specific to the document, similar to the way links on a traditional html web page are often embedded as static data within the html document, but markup may also be dynamically generated and/or applied to a large number of documents.
- An example of dynamic markup is information attached to a document that includes the up-to-date share price of companies mentioned in that document.
- An example of broadly applied markup is translation information that is automatically available on multiple documents or sections of documents in a particular language. 5.1.2. Personal "plug-in" layers
- Users may also install, or subscribe to particular sources of, markup data, thus personalizing the system's response to particular captures.
- Some elements in documents may have particular "markup" or functionality associated with them based on their own characteristics rather than their location in a particular document. Examples include special marks that are printed in the document purely for the purpose of being scanned, as well as logos and trademarks that can link the user to further information about the organization concerned. The same applies to "keywords" or "key phrases” in the text. Organizations might register particular phrases with which they are associated, or with which they would like to be associated, and attach certain markup to them that would be available wherever that phrase was scanned.
- Any word, phrase, etc. may have associated markup.
- the system may add certain items to a pop-up menu (e.g., a link to an online bookstore) whenever the user captures the word "book,” or the title of a book, or a topic related to books.
- digital counterpart documents or indices are consulted to determine whether a capture occurred near the word "book," or the title of a book, or a topic related to books - and the system behavior is modified in accordance with this proximity to keyword elements.
- markup enables data captured from non-commercial text or documents to trigger a commercial transaction.
- Annotations are another type of electronic information that may be associated with a document.
- a user can attach an audio file of his/her thoughts about a particular document for later retrieval as voice annotations.
- a multimedia annotation a user may attach photographs of places referred to in the document.
- the user generally supplies annotations for the document but the system can associate annotations from other sources (for example, other users in a work group may share annotations).
- markup data may often be supplied by third parties, such as by other readers of the document. Online discussions and reviews are a good example, as are community-managed information relating to particular works, volunteer-contributed translations and explanations.
- markup By analyzing the data captured from documents by several or all users of the system, markup can be generated based on the activities and interests of a community.
- An example might be an online bookstore that creates markup or annotations that tell the user, in effect, "People who enjoyed this book also enjoyed " The markup may be less anonymous, and may tell the user which of the people in his/her contact list have also read this document recently.
- Other examples of datastream analysis are included in Section 14.
- Markup will often be based on external events and data sources, such as input from a corporate database, information from the public Internet, or statistics gathered by the local operating system.
- Data sources may also be more local, and in particular may provide information about the user's context - his/her identity, location and activities.
- the system might communicate with the user's mobile phone and offer a markup layer that gives the user the option to send a document to somebody that the user has recently spoken to on the phone. 6. Authentication. Personalization and Security
- the identity of the user will be known. Sometimes this will be an “anonymous identity,” where the user is identified only by the serial number of the capture device, for example. Typically, however, it is expected that the system will have a much more detailed knowledge of the user, which can be used for personalizing the system and to allow activities and transactions to be performed in the user's name.
- One of the simplest and yet most useful functions that the system can perform is to keep a record for a user of the text that s/he has captured and any further information related to that capture, including the details of any documents found, the location within that document and any actions taken as a result.
- the user can be presented with a "Life Library," a record of everything s/he has read and captured. This may be simply for personal interest, but may be used, for example, in a library by an academic who is gathering material for the bibliography of his next paper.
- the user may wish to make the library public, such as by publishing it on the web in a similar manner to a weblog, so that others may see what s/he is reading and finds of interest.
- the capture can be stored in the library and can be processed later, either automatically or in response to a user request.
- a user can also subscribe to new markup services and apply them to previously captured scans.
- a record of a user's past captures is also useful for the system. Many aspects of the system operation can be enhanced by knowing the user's reading habits and history. The simplest example is that any scan made by a user is more likely to come from a document that the user has scanned in the recent past, and in particular if the previous scan was within the last few minutes it is very likely to be from the same document. Similarly, it is more likely that a document is being read in start-to-finish order. Thus, for English documents, it is also more likely that later scans will occur farther down in the document. Such factors can help the system establish the location of the capture in cases of ambiguity, and can also reduce the amount of text that needs to be captured.
- the capture process generally begins with a device of some sort, typically an optical scanner or voice recorder, this device may be used as a key that identifies the user and authorizes certain actions.
- a device of some sort typically an optical scanner or voice recorder
- the device may be embedded in a mobile phone or in some other way associated with a mobile phone account.
- a scanner may be associated with a mobile phone account by inserting a SIM card associated with the account into the scanner.
- the device may be embedded in a credit card or other payment card, or have the facility for such a card to be connected to it. The device may therefore be used as a payment token, and financial transactions may be initiated by the capture from the rendered document.
- the scanner may also be associated with a particular user or account through the process of scanning some token, symbol or text associated with that user or account.
- scanner may be used for biometric identification, for example by scanning the fingerprint of the user.
- the system may identify the user by matching the voice pattern of the user or by requiring the user to speak a certain password or phrase.
- An advantage of the described system is that there is no need to alter the traditional processes of creating, printing or publishing documents in order to gain many of the system's benefits. There are reasons, though, that the creators or publishers of a document - hereafter simply referred to as the "publishers" - may wish to create functionality to support the described system.
- the system allows for printed documents to have an associated electronic presence.
- Conventionally publishers often ship a CD-ROM with a book that contains further digital information, tutorial movies and other multimedia data, sample code or documents, or further reference materials.
- some publishers maintain web sites associated with particular publications which provide such materials, as well as information which may be updated after the time of publishing, such as errata, further comments, updated reference materials, bibliographies and further sources of relevant data, and translations into other languages. Online forums allow readers to contribute their comments about the publication.
- the described system allows such materials to be much more closely tied to the rendered document than ever before, and allows the discovery of and interaction with them to be much easier for the user.
- the system can automatically connect the user to digital materials associated with the document, and more particularly associated with that specific part of the document.
- the user can be connected to online communities that discuss that section of the text, or to annotations and commentaries by other readers. In the past, such information would typically need to be found by searching for a particular page number or chapter.
- Some publishers may have mailing lists to which readers can subscribe if they wish to be notified of new relevant matter or when a new edition of the book is published.
- the user can register an interest in particular documents or parts of documents more easily, in some cases even before the publisher has considered providing any such functionality.
- the reader's interest can be fed to the publisher, possibly affecting their decision about when and where to provide updates, further information, new editions or even completely new publications on topics that have proved to be of interest in existing books.
- the printed document is a gateway to extra materials and functionality, access to such features can also be time-limited. After the expiry date, a user may be required to pay a fee or obtain a newer version of the document to access the features again.
- the paper document will, of course, still be usable, but will lose some of its enhanced electronic functionality. This may be desirable, for example, because there is profit for the publisher in receiving fees for access to electronic materials, or in requiring the user to purchase new editions from time to time, or because there are disadvantages associated with outdated versions of the printed document remaining in circulation. Coupons are an example of a type of commercial document that can have an expiration date.
- Section 10.5 discusses the use of the system's statistics to influence compensation of authors and pricing of advertisements.
- the system deduces the popularity of a publication from the activity in the electronic community associated with it as well as from the use of the paper document. These factors may help publishers to make decisions about what they will publish in future. If a chapter in an existing book, for example, turns out to be exceedingly popular, it may be worth expanding into a separate publication. 8. Document Access Services
- An important aspect of the described system is the ability to provide to a user who has access to a rendered copy of a document access to an electronic version of that document.
- a document is freely available on a public network or a private network to which the user has access.
- the system uses the captured text to identify, locate and retrieve the document, in some cases displaying it on the user's screen or depositing it in their email inbox.
- a document will be available in electronic form, but for a variety of reasons may not be accessible to the user. There may not be sufficient connectivity to retrieve the document, the user may not be entitled to retrieve it, there may be a cost associated with gaining access to it, or the document may have been withdrawn and possibly replaced by a new version, to name just a few possibilities.
- the system typically provides feedback to the user about these situations.
- the degree or nature of the access granted to a particular user may be different if it is known that the user already has access to a printed copy of the document.
- Access to the document may be restricted to specific users, or to those meeting particular criteria, or may only be available in certain circumstances, for example when the user is connected to a secure network.
- Section 6 describes some of the ways in which the credentials of a user and scanner may be established.
- Documents that are not freely available to the general public may still be accessible on payment of a fee, often as compensation to the publisher or copyright- holder.
- the system may implement payment facilities directly or may make use of other payment methods associated with the user, including those described in Section 6.2. 8.3.
- Electronic documents are often transient; the digital source version of a rendered document may be available now but inaccessible in future.
- the system may retrieve and store the existing version on behalf of the user, even if the user has not requested it, thus guaranteeing its availability should the user request it in future. This also makes it available for the system's use, for example for searching as part of the process of identifying future captures.
- a trusted "document escrow" service can retrieve the document on behalf of the user, such as upon payment of a modest fee, with the assurance that the copyright holder will be fully compensated in future if the user should ever request the document from the service.
- Variations on this theme can be implemented if the document is not available in electronic form at the time of capture.
- the user can authorize the service to submit a request for or make a payment for the document on his/her behalf if the electronic document should become available at a later date.
- payment may be waived, reduced or satisfied based on the user's existing association with another account or subscription. Subscribers to the printed version of a newspaper might automatically be entitled to retrieve the electronic version, for example.
- association may not be quite so direct: a user may be granted access based on an account established by their employer, or based on their scanning of a printed copy owned by a friend who is a subscriber.
- the described system could be coupled to a database which records the location of an original document, for example in an archiving warehouse, making it easy for somebody with access to a copy to locate the archived original paper document.
- OCR Optical Character Recognition
- a scanning device for use with the described system will often be small, portable, and low power.
- the scanning device may capture only a few words at a time, and in some implementations does not even capture a whole character at once, but rather a horizontal slice through the text, many such slices being stitched together to form a recognizable signal from which the text may be deduced.
- the scanning device may also have very limited processing power or storage so, while in some embodiments it may perform all of the OCR process itself, many embodiments will depend on a connection to a more powerful device, possibly at a later time, to convert the captured signals into text. Lastly, it may have very limited facilities for user interaction, so may need to defer any requests for user input until later, or operate in a "best-guess" mode to a greater degree than is common now.
- OCR optical character recognition
- the OCR process can be informed by the contents of the document corpus as it progresses, potentially offering substantially greater recognition accuracy.
- Such a connection will also allow the device to inform the user when sufficient text has been captured to identify the digital source. 9.4. Using knowledge of likely rendering
- the font may be downloaded to the device to help with the recognition.
- While component characters of a text fragment may be the most recognized way to represent a fragment of text that may be used as a document signature, other representations of the text may work sufficiently well that the actual text of a text fragment need not be used when attempting to locate the text fragment in a digital document and/or database, or when disambiguating the representation of a text fragment into a readable form.
- Other representations of text fragments may provide benefits that actual text representations lack. For example, optical character recognition of text fragments is often prone to errors, unlike other representations of captured text fragments that may be used to search for and/or recreate a text fragment without resorting to optical character recognition for the entire fragment. Such methods may be more appropriate for some devices used with the current system.
- characterizations of text fragments may include, but are not limited to, word lengths, relative word lengths, character heights, character widths, character shapes, character frequencies, token frequencies, and the like.
- the offsets between matching text tokens i.e., the number of intervening tokens plus one are used to characterize fragments of text.
- each token i.e., the particular letter, digit or symbol, or group of these, that corresponds to the token image
- the offset number is the distance (number of tokens) to the next occurrence of the same token. If the token is unique within the text string, the offset is zero (0).
- the sequence of token offsets thus generated is a signature that can be used to identify the scanned text.
- the token offsets determined for a string of scanned tokens are compared to an index that indexes a corpus of electronic documents based upon the token offsets of their contents (Section 4.1.2).
- the token offsets determined for a string of scanned tokens are converted to text, and compared to a more conventional index that indexes a corpus of electronic documents based upon their contents [00176]
- a similar token-correlation process may be applied to speech fragments when the capture process consists of audio samples of spoken words.
- the user may be offered that document for purchase either in paper or electronic form.
- the user may also be offered related documents, such as those quoted or otherwise referred to in the paper document, or those on a similar subject, or those by the same author.
- the capture of text may be linked to other commercial activities in a variety of ways.
- the captured text may be in a catalog that is explicitly designed to sell items, in which case the text will be associated fairly directly with the purchase of an item (Section 18.2).
- the text may also be part of an advertisement, in which case a sale of the item being advertised may ensue.
- the user captures other text from which their potential interest in a commercial transaction may be deduced.
- a reader of a novel set in a particular country might be interested in a holiday there. Someone reading a review of a new car might be considering purchasing it.
- the user may capture a particular fragment of text knowing that some commercial opportunity will be presented to them as a result, or it may be a side-effect of their capture activities.
- advertisements In a traditional paper publication, advertisements generally consume a large amount of space relative to the text of a newspaper article, and a limited number of them can be placed around a particular article.
- advertising can be associated with individual words or phrases, and can selected according to the particular interest the user has shown by capturing that text and possibly taking into account their history of past scans.
- the system may gather a large amount of information about other aspects of a user's context for its own use (Section 13); estimates of the geographical location of the user are a good example. Such data can also be used to tailor the advertising presented to a user of the system.
- the system enables some new models of compensation for advertisers and marketers.
- the publisher of a printed document containing advertisements may receive some income from a purchase that originated from their document. This may be true whether or not the advertisement existed in the original printed form; it may have been added electronically either by the publisher, the advertiser or some third party, and the sources of such advertising may have been subscribed to by the user.
- Analysis of the statistics generated by the system can reveal the popularity of certain parts of a publication (Section 14.2).
- a newspaper for example, it might reveal the amount of time readers spend looking at a particular page or article, or the popularity of a particular columnist.
- An author whose work becomes a frequently read authority on a subject might be considered differently in future contracts from one whose books have sold the same number of copies but are rarely opened. (See also Section 7.6)
- Advertising and other opportunities for commercial transactions may not be presented to the user immediately at the time of text capture. For example, the opportunity to purchase a sequel to a novel may not be available at the time the user is reading the novel, but the system may present them with that opportunity when the sequel is published.
- a user may capture data that relates to a purchase or other commercial transaction, but may choose not to initiate and/or complete the transaction at the time the capture is made.
- data related to captures is stored in a user's Life Library, and these Life Library entries can remain "active" (i.e., capable of subsequent interactions similar to those available at the time the capture was made).
- a user may review a capture at some later time, and optionally complete a transaction based on that capture. Because the system can keep track of when and where the original capture occurred, all parties involved in the transaction can be properly compensated.
- the author who wrote the story - and the publisher who published the story - that appeared next to the advertisement from which the user captured data can be compensated when, six months later, the user visits their Life Library, selects that particular capture from the history, and chooses "Purchase this item at Amazon" from the pop-up menu (which can be similar or identical to the menu optionally presented at the time of the capture).
- OSs Modern Operating Systems
- other software packages have many characteristics that can be advantageously exploited for use with the described system, and may also be modified in various ways to provide an even better platform for its use.
- New and upcoming file systems and their associated databases often have the ability to store a variety of metadata associated with each file.
- this metadata has included such things as the ID of the user who created the file, the dates of creation, last modification, and last use.
- Newer file systems allow such extra information as keywords, image characteristics, document sources and user comments to be stored, and in some systems this metadata can be arbitrarily extended. File systems can therefore be used to store information that would be useful in implementing the current system. For example, the date when a given document was last printed can be stored by the file system, as can details about which text from it has been captured from paper using the described system, and when and by whom.
- OSs include support for speech or handwriting recognition, though it is less common for OSs to include support for OCR, since in the past the use of OCR has typically been limited to a small range of applications.
- recognition components become part of the OS, they can take better advantage of other facilities provided by the OS.
- Many systems include spelling dictionaries, grammar analysis tools, internationalization and localization facilities, for example, all of which can be advantageously employed by the described system for its recognition process, especially since they may have been customized for the particular user to include words and phrases that he/she would commonly encounter.
- the operating system includes full-text indexing facilities, then these can also be used to inform the recognition process, as described in Section 9.3.
- an optical scan or other capture occurs and is presented to the OS, it may have a default action to be taken under those circumstances in the event that no other subsystem claims ownership of the capture.
- An example of a default action is presenting the user with a choice of alternatives, or submitting the captured text to the OS's built-in search facilities.
- OS has default action for particular documents or document types
- the OS may have a standard action that it will take when that particular document, or a document of that class, is scanned.
- Applications and other subsystems may register with the OS as potential handlers of particular types of capture, in a similar manner to the announcement by applications of their ability to handle certain file types.
- Markup data associated with a rendered document, or with a capture from a document can include instructions to the operating system to launch specific applications, pass applications arguments, parameters, or data, etc.
- a typical use of the system may be for the user to scan an area of a paper document, and for the system to open the electronic counterpart in a software package that is able to display or edit it, and cause that package to scroll to and highlight the scanned text (Section 12.2.1).
- the first part of this process, finding and opening the electronic document is typically provided by the OS and is standard across software packages.
- the second part, however - locating a particular piece of text within a document and causing the package to scroll to it and highlight it - is not yet standardized and is often implemented differently by each package.
- the availability of a standard API for this functionality could greatly enhance the operation of this aspect of the system.
- the system may wish to perform a variety of operations upon that text. As an example, the system may request the surrounding text, so that the user's capture of a few words could result in the system accessing the entire sentence or paragraph containing them. Again, this functionality can be usefully provided by the OS rather than being implemented in every piece of software that handles text. 11.3.3. Contextual (POPUP) menus
- the system uses the application pop-up menus traditionally associated with clicking the right mouse button on some text. The system inserts extra options into such menus, and causes them to be displayed as a result of activities such as scanning a paper document.
- the OS keeps a simple record of when any document was printed and by whom.
- the OS takes one or more further actions that would make it better suited for use with the system. Examples include:
- An OS often maintains certain categories of folders or files that have particular significance.
- a user's documents may, by convention or design, be found in a "My Documents" folder, for example.
- Standard file-opening dialogs may automatically include a list of recently opened documents.
- Categories may be enhanced or augmented in ways that take into account a user's interaction with paper versions of the stored files. Categories such as “My Printed Documents” or “My Recently-Read Documents” might usefully be identified and incorporated in its operations.
- markup Since important aspects of the system are typically provided using the "markup" concepts discussed in Section 5, it would clearly be advantageous to have support for such markup provided by the OS in a way that was accessible to multiple applications as well as to the OS itself. In addition, layers of markup may be provided by the OS, based on its own knowledge of documents under its control and the facilities it is able to provide.
- Digital Rights Management the ability to control the use of particular data according to the rights granted to a particular user, software entity or machine. It may inhibit unauthorized copying or distribution of a particular document, for example. 12.
- the user interface of the system may be entirely on a PC, if the capture device is relatively dumb and is connected to it by a cable, or entirely on the device, if it is sophisticated and with significant processing power of its own. In some cases, some functionality resides in each component. Part, or indeed all, of the system's US2005/025732
- a handheld scanner may have a variety of ways of providing feedback to the user about particular conditions. The most obvious types are direct visual, where the scanner incorporates indicator lights or even a full display, and auditory, where the scanner can make beeps, clicks or other sounds. Important alternatives include tactile feedback, where the scanner can vibrate, buzz, or otherwise stimulate the user's sense of touch, and projected feedback, where it indicates a status by projecting onto the paper anything from a colored spot of light to a sophisticated display.
- Important immediate feedback that may be provided on the device includes:
- the device may provide a variety of ways for the user to provide input in addition to basic text capture. Even when the device is in close association with a host machine that has input options such as keyboards and mice, it can be disruptive for the user to switch back and forth between manipulating the scanner and using a mouse, for example.
- the handheld scanner may have buttons, scroll/jog-wheels, touch- sensitive surfaces, and/or accelerometers for detecting the movement of the device. Some of these allow a richer set of interactions while still holding the scanner.
- the system in response to scanning some text, the system presents the user with a set of several possible matching documents.
- the user uses a scroll- wheel on the side of the scanner is to select one from the list, and clicks a button to confirm the selection.
- the user can indicate a large region of text by scanning the first few words in conventional left-to-right order, and the last few in reverse order, i.e. right to left.
- the user can also indicate the vertical extent of the text of interest by moving the scanner down the page over several lines.
- a backwards scan might indicate cancellation of the previous scan operation.
- the device may be used to capture text when it is out of contact with other parts of the system.
- a very simple device may simply be able to store the image or audio data associated with the capture, ideally with a timestamp indicating when it was captured.
- the various captures may be uploaded to the rest of the system when the device is next in contact with it, and handled then.
- the device may also upload other data associated with the captures, for example voice annotations associated with optical scans, or location information.
- More sophisticated devices may be able to perform some or all of the system operations themselves despite being disconnected. Various techniques for improving their ability to do so are discussed in Section 15.3. Often it will be the case that some, but not all, of the desired actions can be performed while offline. For example, the text may be recognized, but identification of the source may depend on a connection to an Internet-based search engine. In some embodiments, the device therefore stores sufficient information about how far each operation has progressed for the rest of the system to proceed efficiently when connectivity is restored.
- the operation of the system will, in general, benefit from immediately available connectivity, but there are some situations in which performing several captures and then processing them as a batch can have advantages. For example, as discussed in Section 13 below, the identification of the source of a particular capture may be greatly enhanced by examining other captures made by the user at approximately the same time. In a fully connected system where live feedback is being provided to the user, the system is only able to use past captures when processing the current one. If the capture is one of a batch stored by the device when offline, however, the system will be able to take into account any data available from later captures as well as earlier ones when doing its analysis.
- a scanner will often communicate with some other device, such as a PC 1 PDA, phone or digital camera to perform many of the functions of the system, including more detailed interactions with the user. 12.2.1. Activities performed in response to a capture
- the host device When the host device receives a capture, it may initiate a variety of activities. An incomplete list of possible activities performed by the system after locating and electronic counterpart document associated with the capture and a location within that document follows.
- the document may be retrieved from local storage or a remote location. (Section 8)
- a software application may be started to edit, view or otherwise operate on the document.
- the choice of application may depend on the source document, or on the contents of the scan, or on some other aspect of the capture. (Section 11.2.2, 11.2.3)
- the application may scroll to, highlight, move the insertion point to, or otherwise indicate the location of the capture. (Section 11.3)
- Annotations may be associated with the document or the captured text. These may come from immediate user input, or may have been captured earlier, for example in the case of voice annotations associated with an optical scan. (Section 19.4) [00256] • Markup may be examined to determine a set of further possible operations for the user to select.
- the scanner device projects a popup menu onto the paper document.
- a user may select from such menus using traditional methods such as a keyboard and mouse, or by using controls on the capture device (Section 12.1.2), gestures (Section 12.1.3), or by interacting with the computer display using the scanner (Section 12.2.4).
- the popup menus which can appear as a result of a capture include default items representing actions which occur if the user does not respond - for example, if the user ignores the menu and makes another capture.
- the system provides a real-time display of the documents or the locations found, for example in list, thumbnail-image or text-segment form, and for the number of elements in that display to reduce in number as capture continues.
- the system displays thumbnails of all candidate documents, where the size or position of the thumbnail is dependent on the probability of it being the correct match.
- the text captured will occur in many documents and will be recognized to be a quotation.
- the system may indicate this on the screen, for example by grouping documents containing a quoted reference around the original source document.
- Some optical scanners may be able to capture text displayed on a screen as well as on paper. Accordingly, the term rendered document is used herein to indicate that printing onto paper is not the only form of rendering, and that the capture of text or symbols for use by the system may be equally valuable when that text is displayed on an electronic display.
- the user of the described system may be required to interact with a computer screen for a variety of other reasons, such as to select from a list of options. It can be inconvenient for the user to put down the scanner and start using the mouse or keyboard.
- Other sections have described physical controls on the scanner (Section 12.1.2) or gestures (Section 12.1.3) as methods of input which do not require this change of tool, but using the scanner on the screen itself to scan some text or symbol is an important alternative provided by the system.
- the optics of the scanner allow it to be used in a similar manner to a light-pen, directly sensing its position on the screen without the need for actual scanning of text, possibly with the aid of special hardware or software on the computer. 13. Context Interpretation
- Another example of useful context is the user's geographical location.
- a user in Paris is much more likely to be reading Le Monde than the Seattle Times, for example.
- the timing, size and geographical distribution of printed versions of the documents can therefore be important, and can to some degree be deduced from the operation of the system.
- the time of day may also be relevant, for example in the case of a user who always reads one type of publication on the way to work, and a different one at lunchtime or on the train going home.
- Section 14 covers the analysis of the data stream resulting from paper- based searches, but it should be noted here that statistics about the popularity of documents with other readers, about the timing of that popularity, and about the parts of documents most frequently scanned are all examples of further factors which can be beneficial in the search process.
- the system brings the possibility of Google-type page-ranking to the world of paper.
- One example is connecting one user with others who have related interests. These may be people already known to the user.
- the system may ask a university professor, "Did you know that your colleague at XYZ University has also just read this paper?"
- the system may ask a user, "Do you want to be linked up with other people in your neighborhood who are also how reading Jane Eyre?"
- Such links may be the basis for the automatic formation of book clubs and similar social structures, either in the physical world or online.
- Section 10.6 has already mentioned the idea of offering products and services to an individual user based on their interactions with the system.
- Current online booksellers for example, often make recommendations to a user based on their previous interactions with the bookseller. Such recommendations become much more useful when they are based on interactions with the actual books.
- the user will also not just be capturing some text, but will be causing some action to occur as a result. It might be emailing a reference to the document to an acquaintance, for example. Even in the absence of information about the identity of the user or the recipient of the email, the knowledge that somebody considered the document worth emailing is very useful.
- a capture device for use with the system needs little more than a way of capturing text from a rendered version of the document.
- this capture may be achieved through a variety of methods including taking a photograph of part of the document or typing some words into a mobile phone keypad.
- This capture may be achieved using a small hand-held optical scanner capable of recording a line or two of text at a time, or an audio capture device such as a voice-recorder into which the user is reading text from the document.
- the device used may be a combination of these - an optical scanner which could also record voice annotations, for example - and the capturing functionality may be built into some other device such as a mobile phone, PDA, digital camera or portable music player.
- the device will incorporate many of these, sometimes very few.
- the capture device will be able to communicate with another device that already has them (Section 15.6), for example using a wireless link, and sometimes the capture functionality will be incorporated into such other device (Section 15.7).
- the device implements the majority of the system itself. In some embodiments, however, it often communicates with a PC or other computing device and with the wider world using communications facilities.
- these communications facilities are in the form of a general- purpose data network such as Ethernet, 802.11 or UWB or a standard peripheral- connecting network such as USB, IEEE-1394 (Firewire), BluetoothTM or infra-red.
- a wired connection such as Firewire or USB
- the capture device may appear to a connected machine to be a conventional peripheral such as a USB storage device.
- the device may in some circumstances “dock” with another device, either to be used in conjunction with that device or for convenient storage. 15.3. Caching and other online/offline functionality
- Sections 3.5 and 12.1.4 have raised the topic of disconnected operation.
- the device can still be useful, though the functionality available will sometimes be reduced.
- the device can record the raw image or audio data being captured and this can be processed later.
- it can be important to give feedback where possible about whether the data captured is likely to be sufficient for the task in hand, whether it can be recognized or is likely to be recognizable, and whether the source of the data can be identified or is likely to be identifiable later.
- the user will then know whether their capturing activity is worthwhile. Even when all of the above are unknown, the raw data can still be stored so that, at the very least, the user can refer to them later.
- the user may be presented with the image of a scan, for example, when the scan cannot be recognized by the OCR process.
- the SimpleScanner has a scanning head able to read pixels from the page as it is moved along the length of a line of text. It can detect its movement along the page and record the pixels with some information about the movement. It also has a clock, which allows each scan to be time-stamped. The clock is synchronized with a host device when the SimpleScanner has connectivity. The clock may not represent the actual time of day, but relative times may be determined from it so that the host can deduce the actual time of a scan, or at worst the elapsed time between scans.
- the SimpleScanner does not have sufficient processing power to perform any OCR itself, but it does have some basic knowledge about typical word- lengths, word-spacings, and their relationship to font size. It has some basic indicator lights which tell the user whether the scan is likely to be readable, whether the head is being moved too fast, too slowly or too inaccurately across the paper, and when it determines that sufficient words of a given size are likely to have been scanned for the document to be identified.
- the SimpleScanner has a USB connector and can be plugged into the USB port on a computer, where it will be recharged. To the computer it appears to be a USB storage device on which time-stamped data files have been recorded, and the rest of the system software takes over from this point.
- the SuperScanner also depends on connectivity for its full operation, but it has a significant amount of on-board storage and processing which can help it make better judgments about the data captured while offline.
- the captured pixels are stitched together and passed to an OCR engine that attempts to recognize the text.
- a number of fonts including those from the user's most-read publications, have been downloaded to it to help perform this task, as has a dictionary that is synchronized with the user's spelling-checker dictionary on their PC and so contains many of the words they frequently encounter.
- Also stored on the scanner is a list of words and phrases with the typical frequency of their use - this may be combined with the dictionary. The scanner can use the frequency statistics both to help with the recognition process and also to inform its judgment about when a sufficient quantity of text has been captured; more frequently used phrases are less likely to be useful as the basis for a search query.
- the full index for the articles in the recent issues of the newspapers and periodicals most commonly read by the user are stored on the device, as are the indices for the books the user has recently purchased from an online bookseller, or from which the user has scanned anything within the last few months.
- the titles of several thousand of the most popular publications which have data available for the system are stored so that, in the absence of other information the user can scan the title and have a good idea as to whether or not captures from a particular work are likely to be retrievable in electronic form later.
- the system informs user that the captured data has been of sufficient quality and of a sufficient nature to make it probable that thfi Piprtroni ⁇ CODV can be retrieved when connectivity is restored. Often the system indicates to the user that the scan is known to have been successful and that the context has been recognized in one of the on-board indices, or that the publication concerned is known to be making its data available to the system, so the later retrieval ought to be successful.
- the SuperScanner docks in a cradle connected to a PC's Firewire or USB port, at which point, in addition to the upload of captured data, its various onboard indices and other databases are updated based on recent user activity and new publications. It also has the facility to connect to wireless public networks or to communicate via Bluetooth to a mobile phone and thence with the public network when such facilities are available.
- Some embodiments of the system use a scanner that scans in contact with the paper, and which, instead of lenses, uses an image conduit a bundle of optical fibers to transmit the image from the page to the optical sensor device.
- a scanner that scans in contact with the paper, and which, instead of lenses, uses an image conduit a bundle of optical fibers to transmit the image from the page to the optical sensor device.
- Such a device can be shaped to allow it to be held in a natural position; for example, in some embodiments, the part in contact with the page is wedge-shaped, allowing the user's hand to move more naturally over the page in a movement similar to the use of a highlighter pen.
- the conduit is either in direct contact with the paper or in close proximity to it, and may have a replaceable transparent tip that can protect the image conduit from possible damage.
- the scanner may be used to scan from a screen as well as from paper, and the material of the tip can be chosen to reduce the likelihood of damage to such displays.
- some embodiments of the device will provide feedback to the user during the scanning process which will indicate through the use of light, sound or tactile feedback when the user is scanning too fast, too slow, too unevenly or is drifting too high or low on the scanned line.
- the capture device may form an important part of identification and authorization for secure transactions, purchases, and a variety of other operations. It may therefore incorporate, in addition to the circuitry and software required for such a role, various hardware features that can make it more secure, such as a smartcard reader, RFID, or a keypad on which to type a PIN.
- the scanning head may also be able to read a fingerprint.
- the voice pattern of the user may be used.
- the device is able to form an association with other nearby devices to increase either its own or their functionality.
- it uses the display of a nearby PC or phone to give more detailed feedback about its operation, or uses their network connectivity.
- the device may, on the other hand, operate in its role as a security and identification device to authenticate operations performed by the other device. Or it may simply form an association in order to function as a peripheral to that device.
- An interesting aspect of such associations is that they may be initiated and authenticated using the capture facilities of the device. For example, a user wishing to identify themselves securely to a public computer terminal may use the scanning facilities of the device to scan a code or symbol displayed on a particular area of the terminal's screen and so effect a key transfer. An analogous process may be performed using audio signals picked up by a voice-recording device.
- the functionality of the capture device is integrated into some other device that is already in use.
- the integrated devices may be able to share a power supply, data capture and storage capabilities, and network interfaces. Such integration may be done simply for convenience, to reduce cost, or to enable functionality that would not otherwise be available.
- Some examples of devices into which the capture functionality can be integrated include:
- an existing peripheral such as a mouse, a stylus, a USB “webcam” camera, a BluetoothTM headset or a remote control
- the phone hardware is not modified to support the system, such as where the text capture can be adequately done through voice recognition, where they can either be processed by the phone itself, or handled by a system at the other end of a telephone call, or stored in the phone's memory for future processing.
- voice recognition can either be processed by the phone itself, or handled by a system at the other end of a telephone call, or stored in the phone's memory for future processing.
- Many modern phones have the ability to download software that could implement some parts of the system.
- voice capture is likely to be suboptimal in many situations, however, for example when there is substantial background noise, and accurate voice recognition is a difficult task at the best of times.
- the audio facilities may best be used to capture voice annotations.
- the camera built into many mobile phones is used to capture an image of the text.
- the phone display which would normally act as a viewfinder for the camera, may overlay on the live camera image information about the quality of the image and its suitability for OCR, which segments of text are being captured, and even a transcription of the text if the OCR can be performed on the phone.
- the phone is modified to add dedicated capture facilities, or to provide such functionality in a clip-on adaptor or a separate Bluetooth- connected peripheral in communication with the phone.
- the phone has connectivity with the wider world, which means that queries can be submitted to remote search engines or other parts of the system, and copies of documents may be retrieved for immediate storage or viewing.
- a phone typically has sufficient processing power for many of the functions of the system to be performed locally, and sufficient storage to capture a reasonable amount of data. The amount of storage can also often be expanded by the user. Phones have reasonably good displays and audio facilities to provide user feedback, and often a vibrate function for tactile feedback. They also have good power supplies.
- the Life Library (see also Section 6.1.1) is a digital archive of any important documents that the subscriber wishes to save and is a set of embodiments of services of this system. Important books, magazine articles, newspaper clippings, etc., can all be saved in digital form in the Life Library. Additionally, the subscriber's annotations, comments, and notes can be saved with the documents. The Life Library can be accessed via the Internet and World Wide Web. [00326] The system creates and manages the Life Library document archive for subscribers. The subscriber indicates which documents the subscriber wishes to have saved in his life library by scanning information from the document or by otherwise indicating to the system that the particular document is to be added to the subscriber's Life Library.
- the scanned information is typically text from the document but can also be a barcode or other code identifying the document.
- the system accepts the code and uses it to identify the source document. After the document is identified the system can store either a copy of the document in the user's Life Library or a link to a source where the document may be obtained.
- One embodiment of the Life Library system can check whether the subscriber is authorized to obtain the electronic copy. For example, if a reader scans text or an identifier from a copy of an article in the New York Times (NYT) so that the article will be added to the reader's Life Library, the Life Library system will verify with the NYT whether the reader is subscribed to the online version of the NYT; if so, the reader gets a copy of the article stored in his Life Library account; if not, information identifying the document and how to order it is stored in his Life Library account.
- NYT New York Times
- the system maintains a subscriber profile for each subscriber that includes access privilege information.
- Document access information can be compiled in several ways, two of which are: 1) the subscriber supplies the document access information to the Life Library system, along with his account names and passwords, etc., or 2) the Life Library service provider queries the publisher with the subscriber's information and the publisher responds by providing access to an electronic copy if the Life Library subscriber is authorized to access the material. If the Life Library subscriber is not authorized to have an electronic copy of the document, the publisher provides a price to the Life Library service provider, which then provides the customer with the option to purchase the electronic document.
- the system can archive the document in the subscriber's personal library and/or any other library to which the subscriber has archival privileges. For example, as a user scans text from a printed document, the Life Library system can identify the rendered document and its electronic counterpart. After the source document is identified, the Life Library system might record information about the source document in the user's personal library and in a group library to which the subscriber has archival privileges.
- Group libraries are collaborative archives such as a document repository for: a group working together on a project, a group of academic researchers, a group web log, etc.
- the life library can be organized in many ways: chronologically, by topic, by level of the subscriber's interest, by type of publication (newspaper, book, magazine, technical paper, etc.), where read, when read, by ISBN or by Dewey decimal, etc.
- the system can learn classifications based on how other subscribers have classified the same document. The system can suggest classifications to the user or automatically classify the document for the user.
- annotations may be inserted directly into the document or may be maintained in a separate file.
- the article is archived in his Life Library with the scanned text highlighted.
- the article is archived in his Life Library along with an associated annotation file (thus leaving the archived document unmodified).
- Embodiments of the system can keep a copy of the source document in each subscriber's library, a copy in a master library that many subscribers can access, or link to a copy held by the publisher.
- the Life Library stores only the user's modifications to the document (e.g., highlights, etc.) and a link to an online version of the document (stored elsewhere). The system or the subscriber merges the changes with the document when the subscriber subsequently retrieves the document.
- the source document and the annotation file are provided to the subscriber and the subscriber combines them to create a modified document.
- the system combines the two files prior to presenting them to the subscriber.
- the annotation file is an overlay to the document file and can be overlaid on the document by software in the subscriber's computer.
- Subscribers to the Life Library service pay a monthly fee to have the system maintain the subscriber's archive. Alternatively, the subscriber pays a small amount (e.g., a micro-payment) for each document stored in the archive. Alternatively, the subscriber pays to access the subscriber's archive on a per-access fee. Alternatively, subscribers can compile libraries and allow others to access the materials/annotations on a revenue share model with the Life Library service provider and copyright holders. Alternatively, the Life Library service provider receives a payment from the publisher when the Life Library subscriber orders a document (a revenue share model with the publisher, where the Life Library service provider gets a share of the publisher's revenue).
- a small amount e.g., a micro-payment
- subscribers can compile libraries and allow others to access the materials/annotations on a revenue share model with the Life Library service provider and copyright holders.
- the Life Library service provider receives a payment from the publisher when the Life Library subscriber orders a document (a revenue share model with the publisher, where
- the Life Library service provider acts as an intermediary between the subscriber and the copyright holder (or copyright holder's agent, such as the Copyright Clearance Center, a.k.a. CCC) to facilitate billing and payment for copyrighted materials.
- the Life Library service provider uses the subscriber's billing information and other user account information to provide this intermediation service. Essentially, the Life Library service provider leverages the pre-existing relationship with the subscriber to enable purchase of copyrighted materials on behalf of the subscriber.
- the Life Library system can store excerpts from documents. For example, when a subscriber scans text from a paper document, the regions around the scanned text are excerpted and placed in the Life Library, rather than the entire document being archived in the life library. This is especially advantageous when the document is long because preserving the circumstances of the original scan prevents the subscriber from re-reading the document to find the interesting portions. Of course, a hyperlink to the entire electronic counterpart of the paper document can be included with the excerpt materials.
- the system also stores information about the document in the Life Library, such as author, publication title, publication date, publisher, copyright holder (or copyright holder's licensing agent), ISBN, links to public annotations of the document, readrank, etc.
- information about the document is a form of paper document metadata.
- Third parties may create public annotation files for access by persons other than themselves, such the general public. Linking to a third party's commentary on a document is advantageous because reading annotation files of other users enhances the subscriber's understanding of the document.
- the system archives materials by class. This feature allows a Life Library subscriber to quickly store electronic counterparts to an entire class of paper documents without access to each paper document. For example, when the subscriber scans some text from a copy of National Geographic magazine, the system provides the subscriber with the option to archive all back issues of the National Geographic. If the subscriber elects to archive all back issues, the Life Library service provider would then verify with the National Geographic Society whether the subscriber is authorized to do so. If not, the Life Library service provider can mediate the purchase of the right to archive the National Geographic magazine collection.
- a variation on, or enhancement of, the Life Library concept is the "Life Saver," where the system uses the text captured by a user to deduce more about their other activities.
- the scanning of a menu from a particular restaurant, a program from a particular theater performance, a timetable at a particular railway station, or an article from a local newspaper allows the system to make deductions about the user's location and social activities, and could construct an automatic diary for them, for example as a website.
- the user would be able to edit and modify the diary, add additional materials such as photographs and, of course, look again at the items scanned. 17. Academic Applications
- Portable scanners supported by the described system have many compelling uses in the academic setting. They can enhance student/teacher interaction and augment the learning experience. Among other uses, students can annotate study materials to suit their unique needs; teachers can monitor classroom performance; and teachers can automatically verify source materials cited in student assignments. 17.1. Children's books
- a child's interaction with a paper document, such as a book, is monitored by a literacy acquisition system that employs a specific set of embodiments of this system.
- the child uses a portable scanner that communicates with other elements of the literacy acquisition system.
- the literacy acquisition system includes a computer having a display and speakers, and a database accessible by the computer.
- the scanner is coupled with the computer (hardwired, short range RF, etc.).
- the literacy acqi 'isition system compares the scanned text with the resources in its database to identify the word.
- the database includes a dictionary, thesaurus, and/or multimedia files (e.g., sound, graphics, etc.).
- multimedia files e.g., sound, graphics, etc.
- the system uses the computer speakers to pronounce the word and its definition to the child.
- the word and its definition are displayed by the literacy acquisition system on the computer's monitor.
- Multimedia files about the scanned word can also be played through the computer's monitor and speakers. For example, if a child reading "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" scanned the word "bear," the system might pronounce the word "bear” and play a short video about bears on the computer's monitor. In this way, the child learns to pronounce the written word and is visually taught what the word means via the multimedia presentation.
- the literacy acquisition system provides immediate auditory and/or visual information to enhance the learning process.
- the child uses this supplementary information to quickly acquire a deeper understanding of the written material.
- the system can be used to teach beginning readers to read, to help children acquire a larger vocabulary, etc.
- This system provides the child with information about words with which the child is unfamiliar or about which the child wants more information.
- the system compiles personal dictionaries. If the reader sees a word that is new, interesting, or particularly useful or troublesome, the reader saves it (along with its definition) to a computer file. This computer file becomes the reader's personalized dictionary. This dictionary is generally smaller in size than a general dictionary so can be downloaded to a mobile station or associated device and thus be available even when the system isn't immediately accessible.
- the personal dictionary entries include audio files to assist with proper word pronunciation and information identifying the paper document from which the word was scanned.
- the system creates customized spelling and vocabulary tests for students. For example, as a student reads an assignment, the student may scan unfamiliar words with the portable scanner. The system stores a list of all the words that the student has scanned. Later, the system administers a customized spelling/vocabulary test to the student on an associated monitor (or prints such a test on an associated printer).
- the arrangement of notes on a musical staff is similar to the arrangement of letters in a line of text.
- the same scanning device discussed for capturing text in this system can be used to capture music notation, and an analogous process of constructing a search against databases of known musical pieces would allow the piece from which the capture occurred to be identified which can then be retrieved, played, or be the basis for some further action.
- Teachers can use the system to detect plagiarism or to verify sources by scanning text from student papers and submitting the scanned text to the system. For example, a teacher who wishes to verify that a quote in a student paper came from the source that the student cited can scan a portion of the quote and compare the title of the document identified by the system with the title of the document cited by the student. Likewise, the system can use scans of text from assignments submitted as the student's original work to reveal if the text was instead copied.
- capturing text from an academic textbook links students or staff to more detailed explanations, further exercises, student and staff discussions about the material, related example past exam questions, further reading on the subject, recordings of the lectures on the subject, and so forth. (See also Section 7.1.)
- the system is used to teach foreign languages. Scanning a Spanish word, for example, might cause the word to be read aloud in Spanish along with its definition in English.
- the system provides immediate auditory and/or visual information to enhance the new language acquisition process.
- the reader uses this supplementary information to acquire quickly a deeper understanding of the material.
- the system can be used to teach beginning students to read foreign languages, to help students acquire a larger vocabulary, etc.
- the system provides information about foreign words with which the reader is unfamiliar or for which the reader wants more information.
- Reader interaction with a paper document, such as a newspaper or book, is monitored by a language skills system.
- the reader has a portable scanner that communicates with the language skills system.
- the language skills system includes a computer having a display and speakers, and a database accessible by the computer.
- the scanner communicates with the computer (hardwired, short range RF, etc.).
- the database includes a foreign language dictionary, thesaurus, and/or multimedia files (sound, graphics, etc.).
- the system compares the scanned text with the resources in its database to identify the scanned word. After the word has been identified, the system uses the computer speakers to pronounce the word and its definition to the reader.
- the word and its definition are both displayed on the computer's monitor.
- Multimedia files about grammar tips related to the scanned word can also be played through the computer's monitor and speakers. For example, if the words "to speak” are scanned, the system might pronounce the word “hablar,” play a short audio clip that demonstrates the proper Spanish pronunciation, and display a complete list of the various conjugations of "hablar.” In this way, the student learns to pronounce the written word, is visually taught the spelling of the word via the multimedia presentation, and learns how to conjugate the verb. The system can also present grammar tips about the proper usage of "hablar" along with common phrases.
- the user scans a word or short phrase from a rendered document in a language other than the user's native language (or some other language that the user knows reasonably well).
- the system maintains a prioritized list of the user's "preferred" languages.
- the system identifies the electronic counterpart of the rendered document, and determines the location of the scan within the document.
- the system also identifies a second electronic counterpart of the document that has been translated into one of the user's preferred languages, and determines the location in the translated document corresponding to the location of the scan in the original document.
- the system identifies a small region (e.g., a paragraph) that includes the corresponding location of the scanned location.
- the corresponding translated location is then presented to the user. This provides the user with a precise translation of the particular usage at the scanned location, including any slang or other idiomatic usage that is often difficult to accurately translate on a word-by-word basis.
- a user researching a particular topic may encounter all sorts of material, both in print and on screen, which they might wish to record as relevant to the topic in some personal archive.
- the system would enable this process to be automatic as a result of scanning a short phrase in any piece of material, and could also create a bibliography suitable for insertion into a publication on the subject. 18.
- Conventional Internet search engines typically provide free search of electronic documents, and also make no charge to the content providers for including their content in the index.
- the system provides for charges to users and/or payments to search engines and/or content providers in connection with the operation and use of the system.
- subscribers to the system's services pay a fee for t searches originating from scans of paper documents.
- a stockbroker may be reading a Wall Street Journal article about a new product offered by Company X.
- the stockbroker uses the system to search special or proprietary databases to obtain premium information about the company, such as analyst's reports.
- the system can also make arrangements to have priority indexing of the documents most likely to be read in paper form, for example by making sure all of the newspapers published on a particular day are indexed and available by the time they hit the streets.
- Content providers may pay a fee to be associated with certain terms in search queries submitted from paper documents. For example, in one embodiment, the system chooses a most preferred content provider based on additional context about the provider (the context being, in this case, that the content provider has paid a fee to be moved up the results list). In essence, the search provider is adjusting paper document search results based on pre-existing financial arrangements with a content provider. See also the description of keywords and key phrases in Section 5.2.
- Such content may be protected by a firewall and thus not generally indexable by third parties.
- the content provider may nonetheless wish to provide an index to the protected content.
- the content provider can pay a service provider to provide the content provider's index to system subscribers.
- a law firm may index all of a client's documents. The documents are stored behind the law firm's firewall.
- the law firm wants its employees and the client to have access to the documents through the portable scanner so it provides the index (or a pointer to the index) to the service provider, which in turn searches the law firm's index when employees or clients of the law firm submit paper-scanned search terms via their portable scanners.
- the law firm can provide a list of employees and/or clients to the service provider's system to enable this function or the system can verify access rights by querying the law firm prior to searching the law firm's index.
- the index provided by the law firm is only of that client's documents, not an index of all documents at the law firm.
- the service provider can only grant the law firm's clients access to the documents that the law firm indexed for the client.
- the search function revenue can be generated from paid subscriptions from the scanner users, but can also be generated on a per-search charge.
- the content delivery revenue can be shared with ihe content provider or copyright holder (the service provider can take a percentage of the sale or a fixed fee, such as a micropayment, for each delivery), but also can be generated by a "referral" model in which the system gets a fee or percentage for every item that the subscriber orders from the online catalog and that the system has delivered or contributed to, regardless of whether the service provider intermediates the transaction.
- the system service provider receives revenue for all purchases that the subscriber made from the content provider, either for some predetermined period of time or at any subsequent time when a purchase of an identified product is made.
- Consumers may use the portable scanner to make purchases from paper catalogs.
- the subscriber scans information from the catalog that identifies the catalog. This information is text from the catalog, a bar code, or another identifier of the catalog.
- the subscriber scans information identifying the products that s/he wishes to purchase.
- the catalog mailing label may contain a customer identification number that identifies the customer to the catalog vendor. If so, the subscriber can also scan this customer identification number.
- the system acts as an intermediary between the subscriber and the vendor to facilitate the catalog purchase by providing the customer's selection and customer identification number to the vendor.
- a consumer scans paper coupons and saves an electronic copy of the coupon in the scanner, or in a remote device such as a computer, for later retrieval and use.
- An advantage of electronic storage is that the consumer is freed from the t burden of carrying paper coupons.
- a further advantage is that the electronic coupons may be retrieved from any location.
- the system can track coupon expiration dates, alert the consumer about coupons that will expire soon, and/or delete expired coupons from storage.
- An advantage for the issuer of the coupons is the possibility of receiving more feedback about who is using the coupons and when and where they are captured and used. 19.
- the system may be used to auto-populate an electronic document that corresponds to a paper form.
- a user scans in some text or a barcode that uniquely identifies the paper form.
- the scanner communicates the identity of the form and information identifying the user to a nearby computer.
- the nearby computer has an Internet connection.
- the nearby computer can access a first database of forms and a second database having information about the user of the scanner (such as a service provider's subscriber information database).
- the nearby computer accesses an electronic version of the paper form from the first database and auto-populates the fields of the form from the user's information obtained from the second database.
- the nearby computer then emails the completed form to the intended recipient.
- the computer could print the completed form on a nearby printer.
- the system has a portable scanner that contains the user's information, such as in an identity module, SIM, or security card.
- the scanner provides information identifying the form to the nearby PC.
- the nearby PC accesses the electronic form and queries the scanner for any necessary information to fill out the form.
- the system can be used to automatically populate electronic address books or other contact lists from paper documents. For example, upon receiving a new acquaintance's business card, a user can capture an image of the card with his/her cellular phone. The system will locate an electronic copy of the card, which can be used to update the cellular phone's onboard address book with the new acquaintance's contact information.
- the electronic copy may contain more information ahniit thp npw acniiaintanne than can be s ⁇ ueezed onto a business card.
- the onboard address book may also store a link to the electronic copy such that any changes to the electronic copy will be automatically updated in the cell phone's address book.
- the business card optionally includes a symbol or text that indicates the existence of an electronic copy. If no electronic copy exists, the cellular phone can use OCR and knowledge of standard business card formats to fill out an entry in the address book for the new acquaintance. Symbols may also aid in the process of extracting information directly from the image. For example, a phone icon next to the phone number on the business card can be recognized to determine the location of the phone number.
- the system can enhance the proofreading and editing process.
- One way the system can enhance the editing process is by linking the editor's interactions with a paper document to its electronic counterpart.
- the system will make the appropriate annotations or edits to an electronic counterpart of the paper document. For example, if the editor scans a portion of text and makes the "new paragraph" control gesture with the scanner, a computer in communication with the scanner would insert a "new paragraph” break at the location of the scanned text in the electronic copy of the document.
- a user can make voice annotations to a document by scanning a portion of text from the document and then making a voice recording that is associated with the scanned text.
- the scanner has a microphone to record the user's verbal annotations. After the verbal annotations are recorded, the system identifies the document from which the text was scanned, locates the scanned text within the document, and attaches the voice annotation at that point. In some embodiments, the system converts the speech to text and attaches the annotation as a textual comment.
- the system keeps annotations separate from the document, with only a reference to the annotation kept with the document.
- the annotations then become an annotation markup layer to the document for a specific
- the system identifies the document, opens it using a software package, scrolls to the location of the scan and plays the voice annotation. The user can then interact with a document while referring to voice annotations, suggested changes or other comments recorded either by themselves or by somebody else.
- a markup layer associated with a paper document contains help menu information for the document. For example, when a user scans text from a certain portion of the document, the system checks the markup associated with the document and presents a help menu to the user. The help menu is presented on a display on the scanner or on an associated nearby display.
- the portable scanner is used to scan information from computer monitors and televisions.
- the portable optical scanner has an illumination sensor that is optimized to work with traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) display techniques such as rasterizing, screen blanking, etc.
- CTR cathode ray tube
- a voice capture device which operates by capturing audio of the user reading text from a document will typically work regardless of whether that document is on paper, on a display, or on some other medium.
- a public kiosk displays a dynamic session ID on its monitor.
- the kiosk is connected to a communication network such as the Internet or a corporate intranet.
- the session ID changes periodically but at least every time that the kiosk is used so that a new session ID is displayed to every user.
- the subscriber scans in the session ID displayed on the kiosk: bv scanning the session ID, the user tells the system that he wishes to temporarily associate the kiosk with his scanner for the delivery of content resulting from scans of printed documents or from the kiosk screen itself.
- the scanner may communicate the Session ID and other information authenticating the scanner (such as a serial number, account number, or other identifying information) directly to the system.
- the scanner can communicate directly (where "directly" means without passing the message through the kiosk) with the system by sending the session initiation message through the user's cell phone (which is paired with the user's scanner via BluetoothTM).
- the scanner can establish a wireless link with the kiosk and use the kiosk's communication link by transferring the session initiation information to the kiosk (perhaps via short range RF such as BluetoothTM, etc.); in response, the kiosk sends the session initiation information to the system via its Internet connection.
- the system can prevent others from using a device that is already associated with a scanner during the period (or session) in which the device is associated with the scanner. This feature is useful to prevent others from using a public kiosk before another person's session has ended.
- the user scans a barcode on a monitor of a PC which s/he desires to use; in response, the system sends a session ID to the monitor that it displays; the user initiates the session by scanning the session ID from the monitor (or entering it via a keypad or touch screen or microphone on the portable scanner); and the system associates in its databases the session ID with the serial number (or other identifier that uniquely identifies the user's scanner) of his/her scanner so another scanner cannot scan the session ID and use the monitor during his/her session.
- the scanner is in communication (through wireless link such as BluetoothTM, a hardwired link such as a docking station, etc.) with a PC associated with the monitor or is in direct (i.e., w/o going through the PC) communication with the system via another means such as a cellular phone, etc.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing some of the components typically incorporated in at least some of the computer systems and other devices used by the system.
- These computer systems and devices 400 may include one or more central processing units (“CPUs") 401 for executing computer programs; a computer memory 402 for storing programs and data while they are being used; a persistent storage device 403, such as a hard drive for persistently storing programs and data; a computer-readable media drive 404, such as a CD-ROM drive, for reading programs and data stored on a computer-readable medium; and a network connection 405 for connecting the computer system to other computer systems, such as via the Internet.
- CPUs central processing units
- a computer memory 402 for storing programs and data while they are being used
- a computer-readable media drive 404 such as a CD-ROM drive, for reading programs and data stored on a computer-readable medium
- a network connection 405 for connecting the computer system to other computer
- FIG. 5 is a data flow diagram showing a typical manner in which the system generates and applies markup.
- An optical scan 501 is made from a rendered document by the user.
- the data is passed to an image processing/OCR engine 502, which outputs data that can be used as the basis of a query, for example, recognized text.
- a query processing stage 504 takes this outputted data and uses it to create a query or queries suitable for the query engine 506. It may remove characters which are likely to be OCR errors, for example, or assign them a lower priority. It may produce several queries, for example in cases where the content of the scan is not entirely clear.
- the query engine 506 performs or triggers a search on one or more indices 510 for each of the queries passed to it, and produces a set of references to the documents it find.
- the system produces an index 510 from a set of source documents 512, which may include the electronic counterpart of the rendered document from which the scan occurred.
- the process of creating the index starts with the gathering 514 of those source documents. In the case where those documents are available on the web, this includes the process of finding and retrieving them from their web server.
- the system retrieves markup associated with the documents at the same time. In some embodiments, a local cache of the documents and markup 515. The system processes these gathered documents 516, for example to remove formatting instructions or to extract the basic text before being passed to the indexing process 518 which produces the index.
- the query engine 506 may take into account the real-world context in which the scan occurred using a subsystem 522 which may maintain its own database 524. For example, the geographical location of the user, if known, can be taken into account at this stage, as can information from the gathering process 514 such as the geographical location of the publisher of the documents.
- the query engine 506 also typically takes into account the "scan context" 532, which includes information such as information about the other scans the user has made recently, and which font and language they were in.
- the scan context handling process 532 also maintains its own database 534.
- the references produced by the query engine 506 typically include information about the source documents 512 that are relevant to the scan.
- the response processing step 508 takes these references and produces output for the user. In the simplest case, this may be a list of document references from which the user may choose. More typically, it will involve the use of the context systems 522 and 532 to determine certain aspects of the presentation, such as the prioritization of the options presented to the user or the formatting of the display.
- the response processing stage 508 may also make use of markup 542. Such markup may already have been retrieved or generated, may be retrieved or generated at the time of use, may be based on information or rules in an associated database 544. As an example, the response processing stage 508 may request from the markup handling system 542 any markup associated with the documents mentioned in the references. The markup handling system may contact the "gather" system 514 which retrieves any such markup from the original source of the documents or from its own cache. The markup handling system returns this markup to the response processing system 508, which uses it to determine the options available to the user. The response processing system may also make use of information provided by the context handling stages 522 and 532. The system thus produces a results document and presents it to the user.
- results processing stage 562 If the user makes a selection 509 from the results document, for example to retrieve a particular document, that request may be passed to the access/billing system 552 which is responsible for retrieving said document and/or any associated data and, optionally, charging a fee for doing so. Other actions may be performed depending on the user's selection. Any results, such as the retrieved document, are presented to the user by the results processing stage 562, which may also make use of the markup handling system 542 to identify information relevant to the presentation.
- one aspect of the described system is to associate online forums or discussion groups or chat rooms, or other multi-way communications, with printed material. For example, one choice available to a system user who scans a portion of a story in the New York Times is to join a discussion, chat, or post a comment about this article (or this specific topic or passage within this article, or other subject related to this article).
- supplemental sources or channels associated with printed content.
- the availability of additional sources or channels can be enabled or disabled (e.g., by a publisher) for specific rendered content.
- the system optionally prints some indication along with this rendered content to indicate to a system user that additional material is available (or unavailable).
- supplemental sources or channels may also be accessed by other users (i.e., those not using the described capture devices) - such as by visiting a website associated with a rendered document.
- supplemental materials are available on various topics related to a printed document. For example, when a user marks a portion of a document they are offered an opportunity to participate in a discussion about, view or post messages about, or otherwise communicate with, an author of this article, periodical containing this article, an issue containing this article, this article itself, a topic of this article, a specific portion of text marked (or nearby or overlapping text), or other subject of interest.
- Figure 6 is a flow diagram showing actions typically performed to access supplemental content in some embodiments.
- the system receives data captured from a rendered document.
- the system locates associated markup data and/or the digital source document by a user.
- step 603 the system consults the markup data, source document, and/or other data sources (e.g., a database of supplemental materials associated with various documents known to the system) to determine whether supplemental materials are available for this document - and for the specific location and/or content captured by the user.
- data sources e.g., a database of supplemental materials associated with various documents known to the system
- step 604 the system verifies the user's access permissions.
- step 605 the system verifies pre-existing content. If pre-existing content does not exist, the system optionally creates new associated supplemental content for this document in steps 606, 607, and 608.
- step 609 the system accesses supplemental content associated with the user's capture such as via a web browser interface.
- system users can view "related materials" when they mark or indicate items in a document the system automatically derives the related materials by determining the actions of other system users who have also marked or interacted with the same or nearby content - for example, where these other users have browsed online, what they have purchased, or other actions fnllrwi/in ⁇ frnm nr assrtr-.iated with nantur ⁇ H material.
- the system enables users to file or bookmark a particular article, story, excerpt, or a highlighted item in their personal account (e.g., Life Library) associated with their use of the described system.
- this filing system is by topic, then other items filed/bookmarked under this topic by a particular user may be of interest to other users interested in this same topic.
- the system can suggest items classified/organized by this first user as supplemental material to a second user.
- system collects various responses and interactions of one or more system users and applies them in a publication of a successive edition, issue, version, or other member of a set, of this material, or a revision to this material or other embodiment of this material.
- system users may have noted and indicated possible errors in an original document, such as, for example, spelling errors, punctuation errors, errors of fact or other mistakes.
- system users may have indicated, directly or indirectly, items or areas of specific interest - or, directly or indirectly, items or areas which were not of interest (e.g., no highlights, excerpts, or other indications were associated with these items, or user's comments or actions suggested a lack of interest).
- items highlighted or otherwise emphasized in one version of a document appear in a successive version of the same document with these items or regions emphasized or marked (for example, rendered with underlining, in bold type).
- Figure 7 shows a document revision process in the described system.
- Unedited Version 1 of a document 701 document contains ordinary text at location 702.
- action 704 a system user highlights the text at location 702.
- a subsequent printing of the document 705 has highlighting applied to the text at 706 (formerly 702).
- the ordering and arrangement of items within a document are altered based on responses received by system users in an earlier publication of this material.
- this rearranged material was published in various periodicals, documents, or other formats and is appearing for the first time together in this subsequent aggregated publication, with arrangement, emphasis, or other aspects of this publication determined in part by a response of one or more system users to an earlier publication of some or all of this material.
- which stories appear in a new volume of short stories, and the order in which these stories appear depend on how system users interacted with these same stories when they were published separately.
- activities and/or responses of one or more system users are also used to determine or modify how a document or publication is distributed, marketed, sold, or otherwise embodied.
- a document found to be of interest to system users who are young male skateboarders can be included in a magazine about skateboarding, or published with or near advertisements for skateboards.
- the system uses a response of one or more system users to specific published materials to determine, estimate or otherwise influence or affect the volume or scale of a subsequent publishing, printing, distribution, marketing, or other production of these specific materials.
- an initial response of a small set of system users can be used to judge how much interest a larger audience would have in a newly published book. From this information,. a publisher can determine how many copies to print in the next edition of this book, or how much effort to spend on marketing this book.
- the system responds to actions or responses of a first group of system users by adding special margin marks, icons, highlighting, or other indicators to a subsequent version of a document to indicate to successive readers that additional content or opportunities are available.
- special margin marks, icons, highlighting, or other indicators For example, the system can add marks that indicate a discussion group is discussing this topic (perhaps indicated by a group-of-people icon), one or more users left annotations about this passage, topic, or other part of a document (perhaps indicated by an icon suggestive of additional text), this item is available for purchase (perhaps indicated by a dollar sign icon), or other possible features.
- the system indicates a degree of interest shown by some group or groups of system users, and/or other individuals or groups, for example, by rendering areas of higher interest in a darker or more saturated color, more heavily underlined, or with other increasing emphasis.
- the described system is used to determine the likely success of an article, advertisement, or other content.
- a publisher publishes a preview or trial of this material, and gauges the potential success based on responses received.
- the material in question can then be released, or not, depending on these responses, or it can be improved according to what was learned in this trial, and an improved version published.
- the described system tracks which advertisements are most successful, and how placement of an advertisement in a publication, or on a given page, affects its success.
- identical advertisements are placed in different locations in otherwise similar or identical versions of a document, and the system measures user response by the number of system users who interact with this ad and the nature of these interactions (e.g., users who request further information, visit the website, make a purchase.)
- the system enables a user to forward captured material email or to post this material on a network, for example to a blog, a newsgroup, a personal website, etc. It is thus useful in some situations for the captured content to be checked for copyright and other rights-management issues.
- authors, publishers, copyright holders, etc. can specify allowed usage scenarios for their documents/material. These usage attributes are then associated with the documents and consulted to insure compliance when a system user is copying, forwarding, posting, etc.
- the system stores allowed usage data in the source documents themselves. In other cases, the system stores these permissions and other rights-related and usage-related data in a separate database or data store - optionally organized according to the documents they apply to.
- the system associates allowed usage data with text by creating an index of the text and querying this index with data related to captured content to determine whether the content is the subject of the usage data. For example, assume a copyrighted technical paper is in wide circulation, with many copies available at various locations on the internet, and many copies also available in print. The author of this technical paper wishes to prevent users from copying, printing, blogging, emailing, etc., parts or all of this document.
- the system creates a copy of the document, or an index derived from the document, and associates the desired permissions and restrictions applicable to various parts of the document with the derived index or copy.
- rights-management data e.g., what a specific user in a specific context is allowed to do with data related to a specific capture
- Rights-related attributes and behaviors can include (to mention a few of the many possible):
- FIG 8 is a flow diagram showing steps typically performed by the system when a system user captures content for posting to his personal blog.
- the user places his capture device in Blogging mode, for example via inputs 314 in Figure 3.
- the user captures a text fragment to be posted.
- step 803 the system identifies the document and/or location within document.
- step 804 the system uses the captured text fragment, or data related to this fragment, to query a rights management database.
- the document identity and/or location within document are provided as inputs.
- step 805 the system evaluates the associated permissions. If the user has the necessary permissions, the facility posts the captured content in step 806. Otherwise, the system blocks post and notifies the user in step 807.
- the system compensates users for assisting in the publishing process. For example, users who catch or correct spelling errors, grammar errors, punctuation errors, errors of fact, or other errors can receive compensation - perhaps a reduced bill, monetary prize, public recognition, or other desirable occurrence. In some embodiments, the system corrects such errors in a subsequent printing or rendering of this material, based on input received from these users.
- compensation to a system user depends on fees, charges or bills, or other transactions, paid by other readers or system users.
- a first system user notes useful supplemental material exists on the internet about a topic they are reading about in a rendered document
- this first user can annotate a document by, for example, marking (e.g., by scanning) relevant material in the rendered document, selecting an option to "create a link" from a menu presented by the described system, optionally entering data (e.g., a description and URL) about a link, selecting "publish this link” in a subsequent menu, and optionally further selecting individual groups or audience as a target for this link.
- the created link then generates revenue (for example, by connecting other users to an e-commerce web site where they make purchases) the first user can receive a portion of these revenues.
- a scanned phrase is not unique because it is part of a quote or excerpt which occurs in multiple documents.
- the described system can determine this situation with good confidence using statistical analysis and probability. For example, even in a huge corpus it is highly unlikely that a phrase containing more than 100 characters is ambiguous, i.e., occurs in multiple documents - unless it is part of a quote or excerpt which also appears in those other documents.
- FIG. 9 is a flow diagram showing steps typically performed by the system to detect quoted material.
- the system receives content captured by a user from a rendered document.
- the system locates multiple matches for the captured content - i.e., the fragment is ambiguous.
- step 903 the described system analyzes the captured text fragment for possible quoted content. Number of characters, word lengths, word and letter n- gram frequencies can each optionally be taken into account.
- One simple algorithm employed in some embodiments is to remove all stop words, then calculate the product of the probabilities of each remaining word in the captured phrase (e.g., 1/frequency of each word in a chosen reference corpus). This number is roughly proportional to the probability that two independent authors would use this identical phrase - and this result can be compared to a reference value set in the system (for example, set by using statistical analysis to empirically determine a value such that 99.99% of phrases will be quotes if they exceed this threshold).
- step 904 the system compares a calculated value related to phrase uniqueness to a system threshold. Phrases having probabilities below this threshold cause the system to set the quote_flag in step 905. Phrases having probabilities above this threshold cause the system to clear the quote_flag in step 906.
- SUPs Shortest Unique Phrases
- the described system is based on part on the remarkable result that typically only a short fragment of text is needed to identify a document.
- it further employs the result that, once a context is known (e.g., which document, page, chapter, paragraph, etc., a system user recently scanned), a still smaller amount of text is required to identify the user's unique location within a document.
- a "Shortest Unique Phrase” is a phrase which is unique in a particular context (e.g., unique to a specific document, within a document, within a portion of a document, etc.), and which is no longer unique in that context if leading or trailing content is removed (leading or trailing words for word-based SUPs aligned to word boundaries; leading or trailing letters for letter-based SUPs not required to start and end on word boundaries).
- SUPs represent the least amount of material (e.g., least number of adjacent words) which uniquely identifies a context (e.g., the least amount of material which a system user must scan to uniquely identify a document, chapter, page, paragraph, etc.).
- the SUP beginning at each word position in a document can be identified by searching the corpus in turn for the phrases starting at this word position and having length 1 word, 2 words, 3 words, etc.
- the shortest phrase that starts at this word position and matches only this document is the SUP for this word position.
- the index or database of SUPs is stored as either a sorted list of SUP hash values, or as a tri structure. In either case, the index or database can be queried as a user is capturing data. In some embodiments, as soon as the captured data is unique to a single document, or when no documents match the user's input, a signal is sent to the user's device to indicate that no further data is required. [00442] In some embodiments the described system maintains separate or distinct indices for individual documents or document groups, and, optionally, one or more composite indices which are effectively the result of merging sub-indices.
- One reason for maintaining the component sub-indices, or for incorporating in the system the ability to generate these sub-indices from the larger composite index, is to allow the indices for specific documents to be moved or located close to the system user, without requiring that a larger composite index be relocated.
- sub-indices for documents likely to be encountered by a particular user are downloaded to that user's capture device so as to be available when the user is working offline (for example, while traveling in an airplane).
- Figure 10 shows a system employing separate indices based on SUP hashes.
- a first document has a hash-based index 1001.
- the index includes fields for hash value 1002, document ID 1003, and offset within document 1004.
- a second document has a hash-based index 1005. It also includes fields for hash value 1006, document ID 1007, and offset within document 1008.
- both indices 1001 and 1005 are stored in sorted order by hash value.
- the system generates a composite or merged index 1009, also stored sorted by hash value.
- Index 1009 has the same fields as sub-indices 1001 and 1005. Because the sub-indices 1001 and 1005 are sorted, the composite index 1009 can be created by a simple, efficient merge operation.
- the system uses a hash created from captured text to query the composite index 1009. Once a context is known, subsequent, more efficient queries can be made to the appropriate sub-index 1001 or 1005. In the event a query is not found in the sub- index (for example because the user has changed documents) it can be submitted to the composite index 1009 to again ascertain the user's context.
- SUPs for a single document are shorter than SUPs for a larger corpus (since more words or letters will be generally required to determine document and position within the entire corpus.
- sub-indices 1001 and 1005 might store hashes for shorter SUPs.
- these sub-indices will also be used (for example, in a merge step) to create the composite index 1009, hence the longer SUP hashes will also be needed.
- both long and short SUPs are stored in the sub- indices.
- the sub-indices 1001 and 1005 and the composite index 1009 are created separately, rather via a merge step. In these systems, the sub-index only needs to store the shorter SUP hash values.
- the ambiguity of multiple matches to scanned data in the described system can be further reduced by considering the history, preferences, etc., of the user performing the scan, or by considering the history, preferences, etc., of other users or groups of users. For example, if this user recently scanned another phrase which only matches a limited subset of the multiple matches to the current scan, it is very likely that the current scan is within this subset. For example, assume a system user has previously scanned a phrase which matches documents A and B. Assume that they now scan a (different) phrase which matches documents B and C. It is quite likely that the correct document, i.e., the one currently being scanned is B, since this is the only document matching both scans.
- the actions of other system users can also be used to decide among multiple matching documents (i.e., multiple documents matching ambiguous phrases or data from scans). For example, if many other system users have scanned in or annotated in or marked in or bookmarked, etc., some particular subset of the matched documents, these can be taken to have a higher probability than those without this property.
- the actions of people who have interacted with documents, web pages, searches, etc. on the internet can also be used to prioritize or decide among multiple matches to scans from rendered documents - even though these environments are quite different. For example, hits to a web page containing one of the matched documents, or links to this page, or searches for the specific topic of this page, etc., are used to rate or rank multiple matching documents.
- the system user is presented with a list or other representation of some or all of the matching documents associated with single scan or multiple scans. It will assist the user in these cases if the higher probability matches are indicated among the candidate documents. This can be done by placing associated marks or symbols next to or near to high probability matches, by ordering the items according to ascending or descending probability, by emphasizing higher or lower probabilities with special graphics, fonts, font attributes, typefaces, etc.
- matches displayed to a user can be limited to only the most probable matches, or to a set containing some fraction or proportion of the highest probability matches.
- capture devices perform scans when they are not connected to a network, or when they generally do not have access to information about documents being scanned.
- An example is when a system user is reading a document traveling on an airplane.
- the indices or other data about documents are downloaded, stored, cached, or otherwise represented on this user's capture device, or associated devices (e.g., cell phone, PDA, etc).
- the indices for documents of likely interest are downloaded automatically to a device available to the user when this information becomes available. For example, data about the most recent issues of a magazine or newspaper which this user subscribes to are cached or stored on their local scanner or associated device. Optionally, data about older issues of these periodicals can also be cached or stored, with the length of time to keep various materials available as a system parameter (which can be set by the user or by the system, for example, and/or which can be determined from prior behavior or activities of the user). In some embodiments the historical activities of this user, and/or other similar or related users, can also be used to help determine which materials to make available, and how long to keep them available.
- One form of data representing a document in the described system is a digital (electronic) copy or instance of the document itself. This can be searched to locate matching phrases or data from the user's scans, and data from this copy can also be rendered on a display device for the user, printed to a printer, etc. In some embodiments, such a representation is compressed to save storage space. In some embodiments, digital rights management techniques are employed to allow certain types of access to this material, and to prevent other forms of access. For example, a user can be allowed to view an image of the document, but not to print the document.
- the system represents a document as an index, similar to a search engine index, which stores data for one or more documents or parts of documents.
- the system typically converts captures into queries against this index, with a returned result optionally including the identity of the matching document(s), location within the document, etc.
- the system can store markup data close to the user (e.g., cached or stored on a local device associated with their capture device), or at another point in the described system (e.g., on a markup server, or with documents on a document server, or associated with, or integrated in, an index, etc.). Markup data allows users to experience the various behaviors and displays which are governed by these markups (some of which are discussed above).
- the system can store markup data in or with the corresponding documents to which the data applies, or stored with a document index, or on a separate server, etc. Parametric Determination of Uniqueness
- the system employs parametric descriptions of phrase or scan ambiguity. While the system often cannot know exactly whether a particular scan is ambiguous without consulting a database, index, electronic source document, etc., containing information about possible matching documents, a reasonable estimation regarding ambiguity/uniqueness can be made.
- these estimations are based on rules, which in turn are based empirically on various document data and system parameters. For example, one can empirically determine that any random phrase containing at least 40 characters has an .85 probability of being unique in a certain context, for example in the context of all documents indexed by Google, or in the context of all documents likely to be read by this particular user. One can further determine that any phrase of at least 32 characters, which also has at least two words having 8 or more letters, also has a .85 probability of being unique in the relevant context. One can further observe that whenever a scan crosses a sentence boundary (i.e., includes words from two adjacent sentences) the phrase length required to establish uniqueness is reduced by, on average, 5 characters. From this data one can construct a set of rules which parametrically relate to or determine ambiguity with reasonable precision:
- Similar parametric rules can be developed for raw image data obtained from scanning text, without any necessity to locate and/or identify characters, punctuation, etc.
- a raw scanned image of text can be captured to memorv. and analyzed (oDtionallv. in real time as the data is bein ⁇ scanned) into temporal and spatial spectral components (which can be adjusted or normalized for font size and other rendering attributes and artifacts). Similar parameters to those above can be found for these spectral components, such that the user can be given reasonable feedback about completion of scans while working in a document offline.
- phrase length and uniqueness It is possible to perform statistical analyses to determine the empirical relationship between phrase length and uniqueness. This knowledge can then be applied to various aspects and behaviors in the described system (such as the parametric indication of uniqueness described above). In some embodiments, the system considers other aspects besides simple phrase length. For example, the word lengths of the various words in the phrase also play a role. A larger proportion of longer words generally results in less ambiguity. Conversely, very short words add comparatively little information, so phrases which incorporate many short words generally need to be longer to be unambiguous.
- the described system identifies and considers exceptions - those circumstances where the model (e.g., parametric description) doesn't apply, or fails. These exceptions can then be used to "fine-tune" the model (i.e., change the model to address the exceptions), or to measure it's reliability. Analyzing exceptions for their common elements can lead to additional rules and refinements. For example, by observing that many phrases which meet a minimum length requirement are still ambiguous if they are comprised of too many short words, the following rule can be added:
- a parametric description and/or exception handling approach can explicitly include various exceptions, or knowledge which leads to these exceptions.
- the system can include a list of high-frequency (common) long words or phrases, and, optionally, their frequencies, along with rules or instructions to increase the amount of material required to be scanned, or make other adjustments, when these words occur in scanned material.
- the system incorporates knowledge about frequent short words and/or frequent word pairs, frequent word colocations, etc., in order to provide a reasonable estimate of uniqueness.
- word frequency (as, e.g., in a corpus) can be used in computing the probability that a given phrase is unique within a certain context. Since word frequency distributions of common words can be somewhat similar across multiple documents or corpora, the frequency data employed does not necessarily need to come from the corpus with which this data will be used. Thus, a corpus of text not indexed by Google can do a reasonable job of predicting word frequencies in the documents indexed by Google (which predictions are improved by choosing a corpus containing similar materials). Similarly, statistical data derived from currently available documents can be used in interactions with documents published in the future.
- the system employs the rough approximation that the uniqueness of a phrase (e.g., probability that it is unique in a corpus) is inversely related to the product of the normalized frequencies (count in corpus / total words in corpus) of the individual words in the phrase.
- a somewhat better approximation can be had by noting that certain word n-grams (groups of 2, 3, 4, etc., adjacent words) occur more often than is be predicted by their individual word frequencies.
- Knowledge about individual word frequencies and word n-gram frequencies can thus be used to estimate degree of uniqueness of a phrase.
- a uniqueness- estimating system can incorporate a list of common words and information related to their frequencies (or to their relative frequencies), and similar information about word n-grams.
- word frequency and/or word n-gram frequency the frequency of single words, word pairs, word triplets, etc.
- word frequency and/or word n-gram frequency the frequency of single words, word pairs, word triplets, etc.
- word n-gram frequency the frequency of single words, word pairs, word triplets, etc.
- a parametric model of uniqueness allows the described system to function well even when it has no access to data about source documents. This is of use when a system user is using a scanning device while disconnected from other parts of the described system. However, a parametric approach can also be of use in reducing bandwidth usage and latency, thus leading to a more efficient and more responsive system.
- the document context is optionally set when the user explicitly captures specific elements in the rendered document.
- the title of every document is indexed and capturing the title line of any document is a good way to set context.
- the first paragraph or first 100 words of every document are indexed, and users are instructed to capture from these regions to initially set a document context.
- the user optionally captures explicit document ID to set a document context.
- the system places a document identifier at a specific location in a document.
- a document identifier is placed with the table of contents to determine that when this identifier is scanned this user probably saw the table of contents.
- the system places a document identifier at multiple locations - e.g., at start or end of every article, on a front or back cover, with (or integrated in) an address label.
- these multiple identifiers also have distinguishing information related to their specific location - thus they identify both document and specific location within document. Examples include placing identifiers on the front or back covers of a document, at chapter boundaries, on each page, at the beginning of each article, etc.
- the system can determine user sentiment, response to or interest in printed material, interest in a particular topic, etc.
- the system normalizes statistical analysis.
- An example is to measure how quickly this article on page 7 is read compared to other articles which appear (currently or historically) on page 7.
- Another example is to track how much attention is being paid (based on user actions) to this particular story about beekeeping compared to other stories about beekeeping.
- the described system tracks the order in which, and speed with which, material is read and/or markec. This is used to gauge user interest, response, comprehension, and other reactions.
- the system aggregates users into groups. These groups are chosen for specific properties. In some embodiments, the system finds these groups by cluster analysis, and the system can find correlations among various groups using standard statistical techniques. The system then uses these correlations to predict behavior related to interacting with rendered documents.
- system users can form ad-hoc or self-organized groups or associations by which data and experiences can be shared. For example, a system user can locate and join a group of individuals having similar interests, reading preferences, or other similarities. Thus a good article, story, book, or other document, located and/or read by some members of this group can be recommended or suggested automatically to other members (for example, when these latter members receive an automatic email about "What Your Group is Reading", or when they visit an automatically generated profile web page showing their groups recent behavior, statistics, or other information.)
- the system assesses for individual users, or groups of system users, an associated credibility or reliability rating.
- the system derives such a rating by collecting data over time about how an individual or user uses the described system, and then analyzing this data using statistical techniques. Such analysis can reveal that certain individuals or groups are good predictors of some behavior of certain larger populations.
- the system infers with reasonable probability some of the interests, preferences, tastes, age, gender, education, intelligence, or other attributes of a user or group of users.
- an individual user or group of users optionally have access, for example via a website (which can be automatically generated and/or updated), to their attributes as determined by these observations or analyses.
- the system uses this information to help an individual locate products or services of interest to them, to connect this individual to others who have similar attributes (or different attributes, or a specific set of attributes, or a subset of a specific set, or any other combination of attributes), to aid marketers in reaching certain groups of individuals, or other segment of system users.
- the system observes the behavior of individual system users or groups of system users to discover trends.
- a level of interest in a particular topic, brand name, company, political or social issue, publicly-traded stock, or other subject of interest is tracked over time, for example by noting how often various associated or related keywords are scanned, and what actions are derived from these scans (e.g., by menu selections) by a group of system users.
- samples or measurements of data associated with the described system are normalized or adjusted by other available data. For example, in measuring or interpreting a frequency or relative frequency at which certain keywords are scanned, it is helpful to normalize this data by considering a relative frequency of these words in printed materials generally. If the term "recession" is scanned twice as often in a second business quarter as it was in the corresponding first business quarter, but it also appears twice as often in print, any assumed increase in consumer interest based on counting scans might need to be adjusted downwards.
- the system groups users according to their known personal traits, such as education, gender, age, income, employment, spending habits, or other demographics.
- One result of such groupings is to optionally identify behaviors which reflect or predict a behavior of other individuals or groups having similar traits.
- the importance or rank of a document or region within a document can be different for its online and printed versions.
- the system maintains these different ranks as separate values.
- the relative values of these online document and rendered document ranks are useful. For example, if a document is important in print, but not ranked highly online, this can indicate that websites hosting this document are not widely visited. Conversely, documents that receive a lot of attention online, but which are not read (or not widely read) in print, can indicate a commercial opportunity to publish and distribute printed copies of the document.
- the popularity of a document, quote, website, author, or other segment of a publishing universe as determined by various means on the internet can in turn be shown or used in the context of rendered documents - for example, when indicating popularity of rendered documents.
- Document popularity and ranking are of interest when the described system searches for a document from which a user's scan was made. In some cases the text or data captured is ambiguous, resulting in multiple documents being found. Here it is useful to determine which documents are most likely to have been scanned by this user.
- the popularity of a document with other system users can be considered (as well as how recent the document was published, this user's history and preferences, and many other attributes mentioned elsewhere) - but it can also be useful to consider the popularity of a document in the web context, for example how many web pages link to this document, how often it is searched for and/or retrieved on the web, or other indicators of popularity or readership.
- a document's popularity or importance can be normalized in various ways. This may be viewed as a relative or differential measurement. For example, the absolute number of readers who mark a particular story about model trains may be small. However, if this number is compared to the number of system users who marked other stories about model trains, this first number becomes more meaningful.
- the described system can consider whether an article is of particular interest to young readers between the age of 20 and 25.
- the system can compare how many readers in this age category paid attention to this article (e.g., highlighted, bookmarked or forwarded it) as compared to readers in another category.
- the data can be normalized by considering how these two groups interacted with other articles historically.
- the number of scans coming from a specific rendered document can be taken as an indication of interest or used to rank rendered documents - somewhat akin to how browser hits and/or hypertext links are used to rank online content.
- the described system can optionally keep track of activity on rendered pages and thus infer which pages are important, topical, or otherwise desirable.
- the granularity or resolution of this activity tracking can be entire documents, document sub-regions, chapters, pages, paragraphs, sentences, quotations, etc.
- the described system tracks user activity over time. Aspects such as reading speed, topics of interest, frequently read periodicals, taste in literature, items of interest and/or purchased, or time of day when reading is done, can be tracked (ideally only with the user's permission). These user statistics can be employed in ranking rendered documents. For example, the described system can determine that a particular advertisement is of special interest to people of a particular socioeconomic class, that a particular story is widely read by people of a particular age, or that particular content is scanned by a particular demographic group.
- the system applies common statistical or data analysis techniques to determine some of the above information.
- One technique is for the described system to make differential measurements by creating multiple contexts which vary in a known or controlled way, and then to measure the relative response to these different contexts.
- An example is to run two advertisements for the same product, both advertisements appearing in the same identical context, and then to measure which advertisement is receiving more traffic from system users.
- One use of statistical data in the described system is to locate groups of users who indicate aspects or attributes of a larger population.
- An example is a group of system users who, aggregated, reliably indicate (by their purchasing, reading or paying attention to) bestselling fiction. In one scenario, this group would be discovered by locating groups of users who were the first to read books which subsequently became bestsellers.
- the system applies a similar technique to advertisements - locating groups of system users who historically have indicated interest (e.g., by purchasing, visiting an associated website, or requesting more information) in products or services which were or became successful products.
- the system ranks some of the quality, degree of interest, credibility, value or other intangible aspects of a particular rendered document or portion thereof based on properties, attributes, or other aspects of those users who marked and/or otherwise interacted with particular material via the described system.
- This data can further be combined with data from behavior of these same individuals in an online context (e.g., browsing, purchasing, or other interactions) and/or with some of the statistics gathered from the same or related material presented online.
- the system identifies users having specific attributes by considering quality/rank of documents they read, marked, or otherwise interacted with, and the specific nature of those interactions (e.g., what was highlighted, annotated, emailed, purchased, etc.) In some embodiments this quality/rank by aggregating responses of many users; the system determines this metric can optionally be developed after a particular user has already interacted with this document.
- This metric can optionally be developed after a particular user has already interacted with this document.
- One example of how this is used is in identifying a group of individuals who, on average, are early indicators of success or failure for advertisements, literature, or other content Generally, these are individuals who historically have ignored or paid attention to items which are known to have been successful or to have failed.
- the described system can further identify individuals who are early indicators, that is, who consistently identify properties of rendered documents in advance of a larger general public. These individuals might, for example, include a literature professor who reliably reads the New York Times Book Review early every Sunday morning, and who reliably marks (and perhaps advance orders or purchases) books which subsequently turn out to be successful.
- the system gathers data about material directly from system users.
- a rendered version of a movie review can include a poll asking, "how good is this movie," with input being made by having a system user scan one in a scale of 10 digits, numbered 1 to 10.
- This poll result can then appear associated with a review of this same movie on the web, e.g.: "system users rated this movie a 7.”
- a poll can be published at the end of an article or book, asking a system user, "what's your opinion?"
- Such a poll can include any number of questions, and the answers can optionally be entered by scanning the correct response rendered in the document.
- scanning a link rendered in the poll material sends the system user's browser to a web site where a web-based poll is located.
- the described system assists users in publishing, exposing, forwarding, or otherwise communicating various aspects of their system usage.
- Users can have an option, for example, to publish titles of the last 10 books they read, their most often read magazines, their favorite authors, their favorite quotations, or other information about their reading.
- these materials are modified by, or combined with, similar items from other users.
- an aggregate view can be determined and/or published - for example, the 10 most popular books on the west coast of the United States, favorite authors of women over 30, most popular passages in a popular novel, most popular quotations, most popular poems, and other aggregated information.
- one activity which can be associated with any material scanned by a system user is to search for additional information related to this scanned data.
- This search can be in a user's local data repository, an internet search engine database, a proprietary database such as Lexis-Nexus, a combination of databases, or other data store.
- search engine users, administrators, etc. have the option to specify that the search engine only return results from documents that have been rendered in print. This can be further refined by specifying other parameters related to rendered documents, such as a minimum or maximum circulation threshold, a specific publication, a geographical or national region, etc.
- Results from a search engine can be displayed along with a "popularity meter” or other visual indicator or measurement indicating how much readership, attention, response, highlighting, etc., this material received from users of the described system and/or other print readers.
- the system automatically formulates search engine queries from system users (or other sources) in one or more ways. For example, when a user scans "hello world” they can automatically get three types of results - “hello AND world”, “hello OR world”, and the exact phrase "hello world.” Knowledge about capture context
- Queries derived from captures in rendered documents have a known and very rich context.
- Conventional web-based search queries generally have little or no associated context; they are autonomous requests (though user history is not being tracked and applied by some search engines).
- queries in the described system typically come from rendered documents whose identity is either known at the time of the query, or can subsequently be determined.
- supplemental information available, for example the text immediately surrounding the captured text, other system users' interactions with the same document, etc.
- search engines can be useful for search engines to keep track of rendered-document- based traffic separately from other queries, and/or to keep additional information about these queries, such as the document or document sub-region from which the query originated.
- a search query derived from a capture serves as an indication that a source document is important to this user. More specifically, an item searched from within a source document (i.e., with knowledge of where/what this user is scanning) can be taken to indicate specific interest in the user's document context, e.g., the topics embodied in the document or sub-region from which the capture was obtained.
- the system notes that a specific user is in possession of a specific rendered document, since in many instances this is a good indication of the user's interests, preferences, etc.
- the corresponding digital version of the document can optionally be located and all of its content associated with this user.
- each of the topics covered in the document can be assumed to be of some interest to this user.
- the system weights these topics according to where in the document they are covered, and the distance between these locations and the location(s) captured by the user, giving less weight to topics that are physically distant from where the user has captured.
- operating systems and applications typically maintain various lists of historical information about the user's activities, examples being the 'history list 1 associated with a web browser or the list of 'Most recently used 1 documents maintained by the OS and by applications.
- the system records the documents from which text is captured in these lists or in similar parallel lists so that paper documents with which the user has interacted are known to the operating system and its associated components and applications, so that they are readily available as electronic documents.
- the file system, search components, backup processes, and other elements associated with an operating system can be aware of documents the user has read in paper.
- An Operating System often maintains certain categories of folders or files that have particular significance.
- a user's documents may, by convention or design, be found in a "My Documents" folder, for example.
- Standard file-opening dialogs may automatically include a list of recently opened documents.
- the system combines bookmarks and historical data related to the use of a web browser with similar materials from system usage such that a system user can see a history or bookmark list (among other things) which includes both web-based and rendered-docume ⁇ t-based data.
- the system combines operating system and/or application data about which documents a user has recently or historically used with data from the described system.
- a user can view all recent documents, or bookmarks on or within documents, including both computer based (e.g., electronic) documents and rendered documents.
- This model can also be applied to rendered documents plus web-based documents, web-based plus computer-based, or all three (or more) document types: rendered-document-based, web-based, and computer-based.
- the system is integrated with aspects of an online world.
- a "Life Library” allows each system user to have a history archive containing documents (or reference to documents), marks and highlighting, annotations, or other records of interactions over a period of time.
- a system user's online experience is integrated into the described rendered-document environment.
- this archive also contains links to each web page visited or bookmarked by this user.
- the experience of one system user is modified or enhanced by actions of other users.
- the system makes supplemental material (e.g., related stories or content on the web, related books available for purchase, comments from other users) available based on what supplemental materials used or other activities of users. If many users who marked this particular passage or story went on to purchase a related book, for example, then this user can, upon highlighting the same or a nearby passage) be offered this same book to purchase - and/or an option to purchase this book can be given a higher priority in a menu of choices presented to this user.
- supplemental material e.g., related stories or content on the web, related books available for purchase, comments from other users
- this application of other users' experiences to modify an experience of a current user is further enhanced because the described system locates groups of other users who have one or more attributes in common with this user. These groups then have special relevance to this user - their collective behavior is used to determine what choices, opportunities, or other options should be presented to this user. For example, if this user is a person between 20 and 25 who likes to read about model trains, and if other system users with these attributes purchased a specific product, then an opportunity to purchase this specific product is also offered to this user.
- the actions taken to apply data from a group of users to modify the experience of an individual user are:
- ambiguity is relative to context. That is, any short phrase of a few words is likely to be unique in a single paragraph. A word or two may need to be added to this phrase or scan to make it unique within a chapter. One or two additional words may be needed to make the scan unique in an entire book. Yet more words may be required to make this phrase unique among all documents indexed by Google.
- any parametric description, and indeed any approach to handling and/or resolving ambiguity can optionally incorporate an understanding of this issue. For example, in some embodiments there are separate thresholds which trigger different events to notify the user that their scan is unique in a document vs., unique among all documents.
- Audio signals or other means can be used for this purpose.
- the system provides to the user a confirmation, acknowledgment, or other communication when a particular scan has been completed successfully.
- the system provides to the user a warning indication when there are known or probable errors in a scan or input (for example, when supplemental data such as a checksum indicates an error, or when a template matching algorithm encounters difficulty).
- These indications can be audible tones, visual indicators such as from an LED, tactile feedback such as from a vibration, or other sensory feedback.
- the system employs additional indicators to inform a user that a document or specific indicated/scanned item was or was not found and/or not recognized.
- a first indicator is activated when the system recognizes the capture context - e.g., the documents, section, page, etc., from which the capture was taken. In some cases this indicator remains active (e.g., if an LED, it remains on) until something indicates a possible or probable change of context.
- a change of context can be indicated by elapsed time since the previous capture or activity, by a change in font, by a capture containing material not found in the previous context, etc.
- a second indicator is activated when the system recognizes that a particular capture comes (either uniquely, or with reasonable probability) from a particular document or context.
- This second indicator can be thought of as a "capture recognized” indication.
- it can be viewed as a "capture is sufficient” - i.e., when this indicator comes on while the user is scanning, the user knows that they have the option of stopping the capture, since the system has sufficient information to determine the source and location of the capture.
- a user can be informed regarding how unique a scanned item is. This can include an indication of how many possible or known matches have been located.
- the system stores user data such as saved articles, excerpts or quotes, bookmarks, or other document references in, or associates it with, classifications or categories.
- individual system users can manually create these categories, and/or manually associate their data with these categories.
- the system automatically or semi- automatically creates categories and/or an association of data with these categories. For example, in some embodiments system users have an option of viewing how a particular item has been categorized by other users, and selecting one or more of these for their own use.
- standard categories are provided by a system. In some embodiments users may suggest or create new categories.
- visitors to web sites which host and/or display materials which also appear in rendered (e.g., print) form have the option to view or download these materials with additional highlights, notes, annotations, and other markings as entered by system users.
- markings can be stored as a separate layer, document, database, markup instructions which are subsequently combined with, overlaid on, or otherwise viewed or rendered with the original document. This combining can occur on a remote server or on a local server or machine - including a user's PC.
