Definitions
- This invention relates generally to labeling documents within a set of documents, and more particularly, to network-based methods and system for labeling documents organized within a cluster.
- Automated classification, or “labeling,” of data may be used to efficiently organize, route, and/or process large quantities of data.
- support centers receive large amounts of documents related to support requests.
- Document labeling techniques such as clustering, may be used to group together similar documents.
- Documents can include different types of electronic files such as text files, e-mails, images, metadata files, audio files, and presentations.
- a cluster can be labeled based on a common characteristic shared by the documents organized into the cluster.
- a label can identify various types of information such as a subject or theme of a given cluster and therefore facilitate classification.
- document clusters can be labeled by manual inspection where an operator retrieves samples from different clusters and labels the clusters based on information from the samples.
- a computer implemented method including executing instructions stored on a computer-readable medium.
- the method includes assembling a set of documents.
- the set of documents includes a first plurality of previously clustered documents and a second plurality of documents.
- Each of the first plurality of previously clustered documents has at least one label identifying a topic to which content of the document relates.
- the method includes partitioning documents from the set of documents into multiple clusters, determining if a dominant topic exists within one of said multiple cluster, determining a metric value for one of the multiple clusters based on the number of documents within said one of the multiple clusters having a label identifying the determined dominant topic, and labeling at least documents from the second plurality of documents within said one of the multiple clusters with the label identifying the dominant topic when the metric value exceeds a predetermined threshold.
- a system in another aspect, includes a storage device, a clustering engine and a labeling engine.
- the storage device is configured to store a set of documents, the set of documents including a first plurality of previously clustered documents and a second plurality of documents, each of the first plurality of previously clustered documents having at least one label identifying a topic to which content of the document relates.
- the clustering engine is configured to partition documents from the set of documents into multiple clusters, determine if a dominant topic exists within one of said multiple clusters, determine a metric value for said one of the multiple clusters based on the number of documents within said one of the multiple clusters having a label identifying the determined dominant topic.
- the labeling engine is configured to assign a label identifying the dominant topic to at least documents from the second plurality of documents within said one of the multiple clusters when the metric value exceeds a predetermined threshold.
- one or more computer-readable media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon When executed by a processor, the computer-executable instructions cause the processor to partition documents from the set of documents into multiple clusters, determine if a dominant topic exists within one of said multiple clusters, determine a metric value for said one of the multiple clusters based on the number of documents within said one of the multiple clusters having a label identifying the determined dominant topic, and assign the label identifying the dominant to at least documents from the second plurality of documents within said one of the multiple clusters when the metric value exceeds a predetermined threshold.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example environment for grouping documents.
- FIG. 2 is a diagram of a system for automatic labeling of document clusters.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an exemplary method for labeling documents that may be performed by the system shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 .
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing example or representative computing devices and associated elements that may be used to implement the systems of FIGS. 1 and 2 .
- the present disclosure describes methods and systems for use in automatically labeling documents within one or more clusters created by clustering a set of documents.
- the set of documents is generally made up of a plurality of documents previously clustered (whether labeled or not labeled), and a plurality of new documents, often received after a prior clustering and/or labeling operation.
- a set of documents can be separated into various clusters.
- a cluster can be a combination of documents in which all of the documents share one or more characteristics based on one or more common characteristics.
- the clusters produced from a set of documents are labeled with an identifier that identifies the commonly shared characteristic of the documents that are members of the cluster. For example, if a set of documents includes electronic mails (e-mails) from users to a customer support department of a computer manufacturer, such e-mails can be clustered into various clusters depending on, for example, the type of complaints or comments that the e-mails pertain to.
- e-mails electronic mails
- the clusters may be assigned labels or identifiers such as “hardware comments,” “software complaints,” and “firmware” to facilitate ease of further processing.
- the emails can be distributed for further analysis.
- One process for labeling document clusters could involve an individual reviewing a number of samples from each of the clusters and labeling the clusters based on the manual review of the limited sample. The accuracy of a labeling process based on manual review however may be affected by mislabeling or other mistakes made by the individual reviewer. Further, manual review can be time consuming if the number of clusters and/or the sizes of the samples are large.
- technical effects of the methods, systems, and computer-readable media described herein include at least one of: (a) assembling a set of documents, the set of documents including a first plurality of previously clustered documents and a second plurality of documents, each of the first plurality of previously clustered documents having at least one label identifying a topic to which content of the document relates, (b) partitioning documents from the set of documents into multiple clusters, (c) determining if a dominant topic exists within one of said multiple clusters, (d) determining a metric value for said one of the multiple clusters based on the number of documents within said one of the multiple clusters having a label identifying the determined dominant topic and (e) labeling at least documents from the second plurality of documents within said one of the multiple clusters with the label identifying the dominant topic when the metric value exceeds a predetermined threshold.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example environment 100 for partitioning a set of documents 110 .
- users of a product (illustrated as users 102 , 103 and 104 ) provide information, such as complaints, comments relating to the product, etc. that form at least a portion of documents 110 .
- the product can be considered as any type of goods or service.
- the product can be, but is not limited to, an e-mail service, an advertising service, an Internet Protocol (IP) telephone service, a computer operating system, an electronic device such a computer or smartphone, or an automobile.
- IP Internet Protocol
- the information can be provided, for example, in customer-related meetings such as customer support sessions.
- User-provided information forming the documents may be received from the number of users continually, over a period of time (e.g., days, weeks, months, years, or more) such that comments and/or complaints related to the product, etc. are current on the perception and/or performance of the product as understood by the users.
- a period of time e.g., days, weeks, months, years, or more
- the user-provided information can include feedback about the product's performance including, but not limited to, general complaints about the product, issues relating to specific features or operation of the product, and positive comments about the product.
- the feedback may include statements such as “my laptop would not boot,” “my wireless keyboard does not seem to work,” “I can't access my advertising account,” and “color prints from my printer are getting smudged.”
- the set of documents 110 relates to customer service or support scenario, it should be noted that the present disclosure applies to various other environments in which documents are grouped into clusters. For example, the methods and systems described can be applied/used to cluster patents or technical literature based on different technologies, or to cluster a collection of movie reviews based on genres.
- the set of documents 110 can vary according to the environment or application.
- the set of documents 110 includes feedback documents from the users 102 - 104 through any appropriate mechanisms, including telephones and computers.
- the information may include documents such as e-mail messages 105 , posts to discussion forums 106 , transcriptions of telephone calls 107 , and any other document 108 that conveys feedback information, including, for example, records of chat sessions.
- Documents 110 are provided to a server 120 , which can include a clustering module 125 and a ranking module 130 .
- Clustering module 125 may execute a clustering algorithm to group together documents included in the set of documents 110 that are similar to each other in some sense.
- the clustering module 125 can be a part of a clustering engine that resides on the server 120 .
- clustering can include partitioning documents based on some information that is common to the documents.
- the clustering module 125 can identify information, such as words, phrases, or other textual elements that are common to two or more documents of the corpus.
- the words are not predefined, but rather are identified based simply on their presence in the documents.
- Such information, that is not pre-defined but extracted based on parsing the documents may be referred to as unplanned information.
- the clustering module 125 can define clusters corresponding to such unplanned information (e.g., words), and associate documents with corresponding clusters.
- the clustering module 125 may identify one or more words or phrases, such as “inbox” and “capacity” that are common to at least some of the documents.
- the clustering module 125 can define clusters that might not have been predicted and, therefore, might not otherwise have been identified.
- the clustering module 125 may define a cluster that contains documents (or references to documents) having both the words “inbox” and “capacity” in their text. Another cluster may include documents having both the words “drop” and “call,” and so on.
- one or more rules can specify, e.g., what words may be used for clustering, the frequency of such words, and the like.
- the clustering module can be configured to group together documents where a given word or synonyms of the given word are present more than five times.
- the clustering module 125 can be configured to group together documents where any of a pre-defined set of words is present at least once.
- the clustering module 125 produces document clusters 150 , 151 , 152 . Although only three clusters are shown, any number (e.g., one or more) of clusters may be produced. In unsupervised clustering, the significance of a given cluster (e.g. what the cluster represents) is generally unknown. Accordingly, each cluster may need to be labeled. Labeling a cluster with a label can include assigning the label to each document within the cluster. The labeling process may be automatic or manual. For example, a sample 155 may be chosen (e.g. pseudo randomly) from the cluster 152 and read by an operator 160 to identify the subject matter of the sample 155 .
- the cluster 152 may be characterized based on the subject matter identified for one sample (e.g., sample 155 ) or multiple samples. For example, in a cluster where the words “inbox” and “capacity” occur frequently in the documents, one or more samples can be analyzed to identify that the subject matter generally pertains to complaints on e-mail inbox capacity. In such cases, the cluster can be labeled accordingly (e.g., with a label: “problems with email inbox capacity”).
- a cluster (e.g. cluster 150 ) can be labeled by automatically analyzing one or more samples (e.g. a sample 165 ) from the cluster 150 .
- the automatic analysis of the sample can be performed on a computing device, such as the server 120 or other type of computing device.
- the server 120 can include a labeling engine (not shown) that facilitates operations to automatically label document clusters.
- a cluster can be automatically labeled based on determining a distribution of the previously clustered documents contained in the cluster. For example, a cluster can be automatically labeled based on the number of previously clustered documents with a given label that end up in the cluster.
- a cluster can be automatically labeled based on a relative proportion of a given label to the total number of previously clustered documents. Such a determination, and hence the automatic labeling on the cluster can be facilitated by the clustering engine and/or the labeling engine. Examples of such automatic labeling are described below with reference to FIG. 2 .
- the labeling engine can reside or execute on a computing device such as the server 120 and/or server 220 .
- the server 120 can also include a document module 135 for processing the set of documents 110 .
- the document module 135 may retrieve different types of communications from various users, locations, and format and process the communications such that they share a common document (e.g., textual) format.
- the communications may be retrieved from a voicemail server (e.g., transcribed telephone calls), from a forum server (e.g., forum posts), from an e-mail server (e.g., e-mails), or from other sources (e.g., servers or other devices) not described here.
- Retrieval may include requesting and receiving communications relating to a product or service from the various sources and/or performing a direct memory access of storage locations in the various sources for the communications.
- each source can maintain one or more databases or the like, that stores the various communications, and each source can perform keyword searches of their databases, e.g., to identify communications relating to particular products, services or other items.
- a communication can be parsed to identify the communication.
- the document module 135 may format the documents that it receives so that the resulting documents have a common format. For example, tags or other identifiers, if present, may be removed from the retrieved documents or otherwise modified. Other types of formatting may also be performed, e.g., to remove or modify any formatting codes, headers or other such information.
- the document clusters may be ranked using the ranking module 130 , which may also be executed on the server 120 .
- the ranking module 130 ranks document clusters according to one or more metrics. For example, the ranking module 130 may rank the clusters 150 , 151 and 152 according to an estimated time to resolution of an issue represented by the cluster (e.g., issues represented by a cluster “software update” may typically be resolved faster than issues represented by a cluster “hardware malfunction”), a label assigned to the cluster, a number of documents in a cluster, a designated importance of subject matter associated with a cluster, identities of authors of documents in a cluster, or a number of people who viewed documents in a cluster, etc.
- issues represented by a cluster “software update” may typically be resolved faster than issues represented by a cluster “hardware malfunction”
- a cluster representing an issue that historically has taken a longer time to resolve may be ranked higher than a cluster representing an issue with a shorter historical time to resolution.
- several metrics are weighted and factored to rank the clusters.
- the ranking module 130 can be configured to output the rankings to a storage device (e.g., in the form of a list or other construct).
- the information obtained by grouping documents into clusters and labeling the clusters may be used to identify problem(s) or other issues with a product or service and to provide appropriate resolution paths. For instance, in response to identifying a cluster (with a label) as “problems with e-mail inbox capacity,” a person or department responsible for maintenance of e-mail systems can be contacted to resolve the problem. The resolution could involve instructing the person or department to increase the capacity of e-mail inboxes, or to provide users with an option to increase the inbox capacity (e.g., for an additional fee).
- the rankings provided by the ranking module 130 may indicate level(s) of importance to the document clusters.
- the topic(s) e.g., problems or other issues
- identified by the labels assigned to the document clusters may be addressed in order of importance.
- FIG. 2 is a conceptual diagram of a system 200 for automatic labeling of document clusters.
- the system 200 includes a server 220 that supports the automatic labeling of clusters described herein.
- the server 220 can include a labeling engine that facilitates operations for automatic labeling of the document clusters.
- the server 220 can be substantially similar to the server 120 described with reference to FIG. 1 .
- the server 220 can be configured to store, receive or otherwise access the set of documents 110 .
- the set of documents 110 includes a plurality of previously clustered and labeled documents 210 and a plurality of new documents 210 . Generally, after performing one or more clustering and labeling operations, additional new documents are continually received from users.
- server 220 is configured to access the set of documents 110 , including the previously clustered documents 212 and new documents 210 .
- the clustering and/or labeling of the documents 212 is preserved, such that the efficiency and speed of labeling the plurality of new documents 210 is improved.
- the set of documents may further include one or more additional previously clustered documents that do not have labels.
- one or more metrics e.g., a purity score
- one or more documents may be previously clustered, yet unlabeled. Accordingly, when the set of documents 110 includes a plurality of previously clustered and labeled documents 210 , other previously clustered and unlabeled document may also included.
- FIG. 2 depicts only three labels for previously clustered documents 212 , many more different labels can be used.
- the labels associated with the previously clustered documents 212 can be assigned in various ways, or combination of ways.
- the labels can be assigned by a manual review process, derived from metadata associated with the documents, and/or assigned by a prior automated process of labeling the documents.
- the server 220 can be configured to group documents from a document corpus into various clusters (e.g. 215 , 217 , 225 , 230 and 235 ).
- the server 220 executes a clustering algorithm on the set of documents 110 .
- the clustering algorithm analyzes features from the documents in the set of documents 110 and groups documents based on some similarity of the document features or other similarities.
- Various clustering algorithms can be used to group documents from the set of document 110 .
- the clustering algorithm determines the intrinsic grouping in a set of unlabeled data.
- the algorithm may cluster the documents based on their content or features with little or even no consideration given to previously applied labels.
- the nature and type of clustering algorithm in general, depends on the nature of the document corpus and/or on the type of results expected or desired.
- the clusters that are identified may be exclusive, so that every document from the corpus belongs in only one cluster.
- the clusters may allow for overlapping, e.g., one document may be placed into several clusters.
- the clusters could also be probabilistic, whereby a document belongs to a cluster based on a certain assigned probability.
- the clusters can be hierarchical, such that there are different numbers and/or types of clusters at different granularities. For example, customer support documents can be clustered into “questions,” “feedback,” and “complaints” at a high level and further clustered at a finer level into “hardware,” “software” and “firmware” within each of the high level clusters.
- the clustering algorithms can be parametric or non-parametric.
- parametric methods may minimize a cost function or an optimality criterion that associates a cost to each document-cluster assignment.
- Such parametric methods may solve an optimization problem to satisfy the optimality criterion imposed by a model, which often attempts to minimize the cost function.
- Parametric approaches usually include some assumptions about the underlying data structure.
- Non-parametric approaches usually do not include assumptions about the corpus but are based on detecting similarities or dissimilarities among documents of the corpus.
- Parametric clustering algorithms can be based on generative (or probability based) or reconstructive models.
- the basic idea of a generative or probability based model is that the input vector or document corpus x1, x2, . . . , xm are observations from a set of K unknown distributions E1, E2, . . . , EK.
- the density of an observation xk with respect to Ei is given as fi(xk
- the probability that probability that xk belongs to the distribution Ei can be denoted by ⁇ ki.
- the parametric clustering algorithm can be used to determine the parameters ⁇ and ⁇ that maximize a likelihood function such as:
- EM expectation-maximization
- generative models can include a Gaussian mixture model, or a fuzzy clustering model such as the C-Means fuzzy clustering.
- Reconstructive parametric models in general attempt to minimize cost functions associated with the respective models.
- Various reconstructive models are possibly based on the techniques used to model and minimize the cost functions. Examples of reconstructive parametric models include K-means algorithm, K-median algorithm, deterministic annealing, etc.
- Non-parametric approaches to clustering could include algorithms such as agglomerative algorithms or divisive algorithms.
- agglomerative algorithms merge clusters depending on how similar they are, and divisive algorithms split them.
- the number of clusters can also be determined by a threshold sometimes referred to as a merging threshold. For example, for a merging threshold of zero, the number of clusters is equal to the number of data points (e.g. documents), and for a sufficiently high threshold, the data is partitioned into a single cluster.
- non-parametric clustering algorithms do not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. Examples of nonparametric clustering algorithms include vertical clustering algorithms such as average linkage clustering, centroid linkage clustering, complete linkage clustering, single linkage clustering, etc.
- a machine learning paradigm known as conceptual clustering may also be used as a clustering algorithm.
- Other examples of clustering algorithms include quality threshold (QT) algorithm, locally-sensitive hashing, graph theoretic methods, spectral clustering, etc.
- the cluster 215 includes three previously clustered documents labeled as “A” and one previously clustered document labeled as “B.”
- the cluster 217 includes four previously clustered documents labeled as “C,” one previously clustered document labeled as “A,” and one previously clustered document labeled as “B.”
- the previously clustered documents 212 are not treated differently by the clustering algorithm than any other document from the set of documents 110 .
- a previously clustered document ends up in a particular cluster, is dependent on a feature, e.g. content, characteristic, subject, etc., of the previously clustered document and not on the label associated with the previously clustered document.
- a resultant cluster for example the cluster 230 , may end up not having any previously clustered document.
- some of the documents may remain unclassified at the end of the clustering process.
- the distribution of the previously clustered documents in a resultant cluster can be used to identify a characteristic or feature representative of the resultant cluster. For example, if a given cluster includes a large number of a certain type of previously clustered document (e.g. ones with the label “B”), the given cluster may be identified as having documents similar in subject matter identified by the label “B.” In some cases, such a cluster can be automatically assigned the label “B.” In some implementations, automatic labeling of a resultant cluster includes determining a label indicating a dominant topic for the cluster based on the distribution of previously clustered documents within the cluster.
- a characteristic or feature representative of the resultant cluster For example, if a given cluster includes a large number of a certain type of previously clustered document (e.g. ones with the label “B”), the given cluster may be identified as having documents similar in subject matter identified by the label “B.” In some cases, such a cluster can be automatically assigned the label “B.” In some implementations, automatic labeling of a resultant cluster includes
- a labeling engine can be used for the automatic labeling described herein.
- the labeling engine can include any combination of software and hardware modules and may reside on the server 220 .
- FIG. 2 shows only three types of labels for the previously clustered documents 212 , and only five different resultant clusters, many more different types of labels and clusters could be possible.
- the number of different types of labels and/or resultant clusters could be in hundreds, thousands or millions without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure.
- a label with the most number of occurrences in a given cluster can be selected as identifying a dominant topic for the given cluster.
- one or more metric values may be calculated to determine whether a label identifying a dominant topic (or any information related to a dominant label) can be used to identify a given resultant cluster. For example, if the number of previously clustered documents with the label identifying the dominant topic in a given cluster is ten, whereas the number of total documents in the given cluster is ten thousand, the label identifying the dominant topic may not be a representative label for the given cluster.
- the label “A” may not be an accurate representative label for the given cluster. Therefore, the total number of documents in a given cluster as well as the number of previously clustered documents that get partitioned into the given cluster can be used in determining whether a label identifying a dominant topic accurately represents the content of a cluster. In some implementations, calculating the metric values based on the distribution of the previously clustered documents in a given cluster facilitates a determination whether the label from a previously clustered document can be used as a label for the given cluster. The metric values may be calculated by the labeling engine or any other software or hardware module (e.g.
- such metric values may be calculated only after a determination that a threshold number of previously clustered documents are present within the cluster. For example, if a very small number of previously clustered documents end up in a cluster, the labeling engine may flag the cluster for manual review or other suitable labeling processes. In some implementations, more than one label may be selected as a label identifying a dominant topic for a cluster. For example, if a significant number of documents with label “A” and a significant number of documents with label “C” show up in a cluster, both labels “A” and “C” may be assigned to the cluster. In some implementations, the cluster may also be defined using a new label (e.g. “D”) that represents characteristics of labels “A” as well “C.”
- D new label
- the dominant label could more likely be representative of the documents grouped together into the cluster.
- the dominant label is less likely to be a representative of the corresponding cluster.
- additional metrics may be needed to determine whether the dominant label could be used to represent the cluster. For example, consider a cluster that includes eight previously clustered documents with the label “A,” one previously clustered document with the label “B,” one previously clustered document with the label “C,” and the cluster includes ten thousand documents in all.
- identification of the dominant label for a cluster can depend, at least in part, on determining if a high percentage of documents with a given label ends up in the cluster.
- the ratio of the previously clustered documents in a given cluster to the total cluster size can be calculated as a measure of confidence on the previously clustered documents.
- both the purity and confidence metric values are calculated to determine if a dominant label can be reliably used as a label or identifier for a given cluster. In some implementations, whether or not a dominant label can be reliably used for a given cluster, depends on one or more threshold conditions on the metric values. For example, a dominant label may be used as a label for a given cluster if both the purity score and confidence exceed corresponding thresholds. In some implementations, one metric value may be given a higher weight in deciding whether to use the dominant label to identify a cluster. For example, if for a given cluster, the purity score exceeds the corresponding threshold but the confidence metric value does not, the given cluster may still be labeled with the dominant label.
- the weight can be inherently specified by the corresponding thresholds.
- the threshold for the purity score may be specified as 50% whereas the threshold for the confidence metric value is a higher value, such as 70% or 80%, thereby placing a higher weight or importance on the confidence metric value in deciding if the dominant label is a suitable one.
- the thresholds for the metric values can be chosen on a case-by-case basis depending on the size of corpus, nature of documents, reliability of the previously clustered documents, or other factors.
- determining whether the metric values satisfy the threshold conditions can be done in a hierarchical basis. For example, whether or not the purity score satisfies the corresponding threshold condition can be determined only if the confidence metric value satisfies the corresponding threshold condition. In some cases, such determinations may be performed in parallel.
- the corresponding cluster can be designated for manual or further review. For example, if for a given cluster either or both the purity score and the confidence metric value do not exceed the corresponding specified thresholds, the cluster may be designated (for example, by an appropriate identifier or label) for manual or further review. In some cases, a cluster (such as the cluster 230 ) may not have any previously clustered documents and can be flagged for manual or further review. The designation for manual review may be executed by the labeling engine or any other combination of software and hardware modules residing on the server 220 .
- FIG. 3 shows a flowchart 300 that shows exemplary method 300 for use in clustering the set of documents 110 and for automatically labeling the clusters.
- the operations can be performed by any combination of the document module 135 , the clustering module 125 (including clustering engine and/or labeling engine), and the ranking module 130 on one or more servers such as the server 120 and/or the server 220 .
- the method 300 proceeds to assemble 310 a set of documents, including a first plurality of previously clustered documents (e.g. the previously clustered documents 212 described with reference to FIG. 2 ) and a second plurality of documents (e.g., the plurality of new, unlabeled documents 210 described with reference to FIG. 2 ).
- the previously clustered documents often include documents labeled using manual review, automatic labeling consistent with the description of the system of FIG. 1 , or both.
- the labels provided to previously clustered documents 212 during prior processes and/or analysis are maintain with the documents, unless one or more documents is/are re-labeled.
- the labels retained with previously clustered documents 212 may be a basis for labeling other previously clustered and unlabeled documents or new documents 210 , clustered with such previously clustered and labeled documents 212 , as described below.
- the previously clustered documents can be received and/or retrieved from a storage device (e.g., storage device 406 ) where the documents 212 are stored.
- the second plurality of new documents 210 are retrieved, for example by the document module 135 , from various locations (e.g., the storage device), and/or formatted into a common document (e.g., textual) format.
- the documents can pertain to communications more recently received at a customer support division.
- the communications may be retrieved from a voice message server (e.g., transcribed telephone calls), from a forum server (e.g., for forum posts), from an e-mail server (e.g., for e-mail), or from other sources (e.g., servers or other devices).
- Retrieval may include requesting and receiving recent and/or new communications relating to a product from the various sources and/or performing a direct memory access of storage locations in the various sources for the communications.
- each source may maintain a database(s) or the like, which store the various communications, and each source can perform keyword searches of their database(s), e.g., to identify communications relating to particular product(s) or other items.
- method 300 may proceed to identify 312 information that is common to two or more of the documents 110 that are assembled.
- this information may include words, phrases, and/or combinations thereof that are common to two or more of the documents. For example, words such as “e-mail” and “account” may be common to two or more documents.
- phrases such as “e-mail account” and “inbox capacity” may be common.
- combinations of words and/or phrases that are common to two or more documents may also be identified.
- the combination of “e-mail” and “inbox capacity” may be identified as being common to two or more documents.
- the combination can include the phrases “inbox capacity” and “e-mail account”.
- any number of words, and/or phrases can be included in the combination.
- other document characteristics can also be used in identifying common information between documents. For example, images (e.g., based on metadata or tags associated with the images), equations, tables, links, or other content can be used in identifying common information between various documents.
- the clustering module 125 may parse 314 text in two or more, or various documents in order to identify 312 such information. Phrases can be identified in various ways, e.g., by reference to a library of phrases and/or a syntactic lexicon that identifies sentence structure, parts-of-speech, and other grammatical features that may be used to identify words and/or phrases. Data for such a library or syntactic lexicon may be stored in the server 120 or in any other place that is accessible to the clustering module 125 .
- the clustering module 125 identifies 316 words and/or phrases in the parsed text, as part of identifying 312 information common to two or more of the documents.
- the words and/or phrases may be identified without regard to affixes (e.g., prefixes or suffixes).
- the affixes can be identified by, and/or discounted by the clustering module 125 using, e.g., the syntactic lexicon mentioned above. For example, if various documents relate to hard drive crashes, the clustering module 125 can be configured to recognize words such as “crash,” “crashed,” “crashing,” crashes,” to be originating from a single word “crash.”.
- the clustering module 125 can be configured to recognize synonyms as common words.
- a library of synonyms can be accessed to identify commonalities. For example, the clustering module 125 can identify “e-mail,” “electronic mail,” and “email” as referring to the same thing.
- the clustering module 125 can be configured to recognize different words or word combinations as referring to the same thing. For example, the clustering module 125 can be configured to identify “inbox capacity” and “inbox storage,” “cell phone” and “mobile phone,” or “elevator” and “lift” as referring to the same thing in each case.
- the clustering module 125 may partition 318 documents from the set documents 110 into multiple clusters.
- the documents are partitioned into clusters based on the information (e.g., words, phrases) identified as common to two or more documents. Consistent with the system of FIG. 2 , any number of clusters can be defined.
- the words and/or phrases that act as the bases for clustering the documents can be unplanned, i.e. not identified beforehand. In such cases, the clustering module 125 can define clusters that might not have been predicted and, therefore, otherwise identified.
- the clustering module 125 can exclude certain predefined words or “stop words” from consideration as a basis for partitioning documents into clusters. For example, conjunctions, such as “and,” “but,” and “or,” and/or pronouns, such as “I,” “you,” “he,” “she,” and “it” can be excluded. In general, such words and/or phrase are frequently appear in all or most of the documents in the set of documents 110 , for example, and therefore are not useful in determining the topic of the document and/or the topic of a cluster in which the documents is partitioned.
- methods 300 may determine 320 a number of occurrences of such words and/or phrases in each document for which the number exceeds a threshold, in order to partition 318 such documents.
- the clustering module 125 is able to partition 318 documents into clusters based on the words and/or phrases exceeding the threshold.
- the clustering module 125 creates 322 clusters that correspond to words and/or phrases that are common to two or more documents in order to partition such documents.
- clusters can only be created for common words that exceed a minimum number of occurrences in a minimum number of documents.
- the clusters can be stored in a storage device, for example as a database in the server 120 .
- entire documents within a cluster can be stored.
- only a portion, e.g., a chapter, page, paragraph, etc., of each document within a cluster can be stored.
- the identity of each document can be stored, along with information such as the author of the document, a source of the document, a creation date of the document, etc.
- the clustering module 125 may determine 324 if the documents of the cluster have a dominant topic.
- a label associated with previously clustered document 212 that is most abundant within the cluster can be identified as a dominant label, which indicates the dominant topic.
- weights or orders of importance can be associated with the labels in determining a dominant label. For example, previously clustered documents with a given label (e.g., label “A”) may influence labeling twice as much as previously clustered documents with another label (e.g., label “B”). In such cases, each occurrence of documents with label “A” within a cluster is given twice as much weight than documents with label “B” in determining the dominant label.
- label “A” is typically be identified as the dominant label by virtue of the corresponding weight even though the number of documents with label “B” is greater.
- a clear dominant label may not be present within the given cluster. This can happen, for example, when no previously clustered document is present in a given cluster or when the number of previously clustered documents (with or without corresponding weights) for two or more label types is not significantly different. For example, if a given cluster includes twenty documents with label “A”, twenty-one documents with label “B” and nineteen documents with label “C”, a clear dominant label may not be identified.
- the labeling engine may designate 326 documents within the cluster for further processing. This can be done automatically (e.g., without user intervention) or manually.
- method 300 may specifically include designating 326 the cluster and/or document included therein for manual processing.
- a sample of documents can be selected from the cluster parsed or read to determine a new topic or subject matter of the documents. The cluster can then be associated with that new topic. The selecting, reading, and/or parsing be performed manually (e.g., by one or more personnel manually reading documents from the cluster) or automatically (e.g., using word recognition processes), and may be repeated for additional sample documents until an identifying characteristic for a cluster is determined. Additionally, or alternatively, manual and/or automatic review may be performed to determined that the cluster is a mixed cluster having documents related to multiple topics.
- operations can determine 328 a metric value for the cluster based on the number of documents within the cluster having a label identifying the determined dominant topic, i.e., a determined dominant label.
- the metric values determined can include statistical measures that provide information on a relative distribution of the dominant label within the cluster as compared to labels from other previously clustered documents and/or to the total number of documents in the cluster. For example, metrics such as purity score and confidence, described above with reference to equations (2) and (3), respectively, can be calculated.
- Method 300 proceeds to determine 330 if the metric value exceeds or does not exceed a predetermined threshold.
- the predetermined threshold may be different in various implementation. For example, a predetermined threshold may be about 75% in some implementations, and about 80% in other implementations, or a different percentage in other implementations.
- a wide variety of thresholds related to purity score, confidence, or other metric values, presented as percentages and/or absolute values, may be used in various implementations to determine in sufficient confidence exists to label the new documents 210 within the clusters with the dominant label for the cluster.
- labeling engine labels 332 at least the new documents 210 within the cluster with the dominant label.
- Labeling the dominant label to the cluster includes associating the cluster with the dominant label.
- assigning the dominant label can include storing, at a storage location, identification information that ties the documents from the corresponding cluster with the dominant label.
- the dominant label can be assigned to each document within the cluster.
- the dominant label is assigned only to previously unlabeled documents in the cluster while labels of the previously clustered documents are left unchanged.
- Previously unlabeled documents can refer to any document within the cluster as long as they do not belong to the set of previously clustered documents.
- Assigning the dominant label can include assigning a new label or changing an existing label of one or more previously clustered documents. In some cases, a newly assigned labels can co-exist with old labels.
- the cluster is designated 326 for further processing to identify a characteristic associated with the cluster, consistent with the description above.

Abstract
Description
Purity Score=max(n A ,n B ,n C)/(n A +n B +n C) (2)
wherein max(nA, nB, nC) is the number of previously labeled documents corresponding to the dominant label. Therefore, if a high percentage of previously clustered documents within a cluster correspond to the dominant label, the dominant label could more likely be representative of the documents grouped together into the cluster. On the other hand, if only a low percentage of previously clustered documents correspond to the wining label, the dominant label is less likely to be a representative of the corresponding cluster. In some implementations, even when a high percentage of previously clustered documents within a cluster correspond to the dominant label, additional metrics may be needed to determine whether the dominant label could be used to represent the cluster. For example, consider a cluster that includes eight previously clustered documents with the label “A,” one previously clustered document with the label “B,” one previously clustered document with the label “C,” and the cluster includes ten thousand documents in all. In such cases, even though the purity score of the label “A” is significantly high (80%), the label may not be a good representative of all the documents in the cluster because of the very low number of corresponding previously clustered documents compared to the size of the entire cluster. In some implementations, identification of the dominant label for a cluster can depend, at least in part, on determining if a high percentage of documents with a given label ends up in the cluster. In some implementations, the ratio of the previously clustered documents in a given cluster to the total cluster size can be calculated as a measure of confidence on the previously clustered documents. For example, if for a given cluster, the number of previously clustered documents with labels “A,” “B,” and “C” are nA, nB, and nC, respectively, and the total number of documents in the given cluster is N, the measure of confidence can be given by:
Confidence=(n A +n B +n C)/N (3)
