Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to digital content networks, and more particularly to systems and methods for developing a mobile network.
- a mobile network accessed by mobile communications devices may be subject to constraints that do not pertain to the Internet as accessed by personal computers. For example, a page of content displayed on a mobile communications device (e.g., a mobile phone or a personal digital assistant) is far smaller than that which may be displayed on a laptop computer. Also, there are presently fewer mobile network sites on mobile networks than there are Internet web sites on the Internet. Additionally, mobile device communication may entail a wireless component that is slow and unreliable when compared to a standard Internet connection, so an activity on a mobile communications device analogous to surfing the Internet with a personal computer by clicking on a series of links is neither efficient nor fruitful. Accordingly, search techniques that are useful on the Internet are not very useful via the use of mobile communications devices over mobile networks. Consequently, there is a need for systems and methods for developing a mobile network.

Abstract
Description
- The present invention relates generally to digital content networks, and more particularly to systems and methods for developing a mobile network.
- Conventionally, developing a mobile network accessed by mobile communications devices may be subject to constraints that do not pertain to the Internet as accessed by personal computers. For example, a page of content displayed on a mobile communications device (e.g., a mobile phone or a personal digital assistant) is far smaller than that which may be displayed on a laptop computer. Also, there are presently fewer mobile network sites on mobile networks than there are Internet web sites on the Internet. Additionally, mobile device communication may entail a wireless component that is slow and unreliable when compared to a standard Internet connection, so an activity on a mobile communications device analogous to surfing the Internet with a personal computer by clicking on a series of links is neither efficient nor fruitful. Accordingly, search techniques that are useful on the Internet are not very useful via the use of mobile communications devices over mobile networks. Consequently, there is a need for systems and methods for developing a mobile network.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary architecture in which various embodiments of developing a mobile network may be practiced; -
FIG. 2 shows an exemplary mobile network builder; -
FIG. 3 is a screenshot of an exemplary ranked menu of mobile network sites; and -
FIG. 4 is a flow chart of an exemplary method for developing a mobile network. - Exemplary methods for developing a mobile network are provided. Such methods include receiving a request to include a mobile network site in a ranked menu of mobile network sites, including the mobile network site in the ranked menu of mobile network sites, sending the ranked menu of mobile network sites to a mobile communications device, receiving a communication from the mobile communications device indicating that the mobile network site should have a different rank, processing the received communication to update the ranked menu of mobile network sites, and sending the updated ranked menu to the mobile communications device. Further methods include receiving information about each time the mobile network site is accessed by the mobile communications device.
- Exemplary systems for developing a mobile network are also provided. These systems include a communications module that receives a request to include a mobile network site in a ranked menu of mobile network sites, sends the ranked menu of mobile network sites to a mobile communications device, and receives a communication from the mobile communications device indicating that the mobile network site should have a different rank. A ranking engine includes the mobile network site in the ranked menu of mobile network sites, and processes the received communication to update the ranked menu of mobile network sites. A mobile network site database stores information about the mobile network site and the ranked menu of mobile networks sites, and the communications module sends the updated ranked menu to the mobile communications device.
- Various exemplary systems and methods for developing a mobile network are described herein. Such systems and methods include the presentation of a collection or ranked menu of mobile network sites that are interesting and relevant to users of mobile communications devices and encourage the users to visit those mobile network sites. As users discover mobile network sites, publishers of content on mobile network sites are incentivized to join and further develop the mobile network. Users of mobile communications devices may register positive and/or negative reactions to various mobile network sites, so that any given user may be presented with a ranked list or menu of mobile network sites. In some embodiments, a user may personalize their menu to offer the user quick access to mobile network sites that are relevant to the user's interests.
- Also provided herein are various exemplary monetization platforms for publishers of content for mobile communications devices and/or for those that administer or maintain a mobile network. Growth of a mobile network may be monitored and studied, so that, for example, market research may be conducted to provide information such as the demographics of an audience of an ad on a particular publisher's mobile network site, and/or how much traffic of a given publisher may go through the mobile network. This information may increase the accuracy of pricing for inventoried content (such as advertisements) featured on a particular publisher's mobile network site and distributed through the mobile network via a ranked menu or listing of mobile network sites.
- Thus, various exemplary embodiments presented herein take a directory-based approach to mobile network development, rather than a search-driven approach. A directory, such as a database of mobile network sites with associated information about each mobile network site and the relationships among them, may be maintained. Small and succinct content presentations may be composed for mobile communications devices, showing some mobile network sites in the directory, along with descriptors and snippets related to the mobile network sites, so that the need for user actions in exploring the mobile network may be minimized, and user actions may be more fully informed and efficiently directed. The inclusion of icons, such as trademark logos or RSS symbols, in the presentations may contribute to this efficiency, in that a single image may provide the informational equivalent of several words.

engine 206, according to one exemplary embodiment, is configured to include mobile network sites in a ranked menu of mobile network sites, and to update the ranked menu of mobile network sites. Such ranking may be based upon users of mobile communications devices sending information that is received by themobile network builder 102 that indicates whether the user feels a particular mobile network site should have an increased or decreased ranking in a ranked menu. The rankingengine 206 may change the relative ranks of mobile network sites so that thecommunications module 202 may send accurately ranked lists of the mobile network sites to users of mobile communications devices. Additionally, theranking engine 206 may ensure that the ranked menu or directory of mobile network sites maintained in a database (e.g. mobile network site database 204) is in the proper order for presentation to a particular user. - According to further exemplary embodiments, the
ranking engine 206 may take into account and base rankings on such factors as how often a particular mobile network site is accessed by various mobile communications devices. Theranking engine 206 may base rankings on information received about how often a particular advertisement appearing on a mobile network site is clicked or activated by a user of a mobile communications device. Additionally, theranking engine 206 may base rankings on information received about how often a link to a ranked menu on a menu maintained by a carrier of a mobile communications network (e.g. Sprint®) is clicked or activated by a user of the mobile communications device. Theranking engine 206 may process these various forms of received information (in addition to other information) in order to update the ranked menu of mobile network sites. - The embodiments discussed herein are illustrative. As these embodiments are described with reference to illustrations, various modifications or adaptations of the methods and/or specific structures described may become apparent to those skilled in the art. The herein-described components and functions can be comprised of instructions that are stored on a computer-readable storage medium. The instructions can be retrieved and executed by a processor. Some examples of instructions are software, program code, and firmware. Some examples of storage medium are memory devices, tape, disks, integrated circuits, and servers.
