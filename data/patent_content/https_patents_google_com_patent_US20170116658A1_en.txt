- the steps of method 220 need not be performed in the order described herein, one or more steps may be performed simultaneously, or one or more steps may be omitted.
- the product categorization system 120 determines product category tags for each product listing based on title data. For example, the product categorization system 120 determines one or more terms from the title data for a product listing to use as tags for the product listing. For example, for the product listing comprising title data “Pima Cotton Pin-Tucked Open Cardigan,” the product categorization system 120 determines tags comprising ⁇ Cotton> and ⁇ Cardigan>.
- the product categorization system 120 determines product category tags for each product listing based on product description data. For example, the product categorization system 120 determines one or more terms from the description data for a product listing to use as tags for the product listing. In an example, the product categorization system 120 extracts bolded, italicized, highlighted, or otherwise emphasized words, numbers, symbols, or phrases from the description data for the product listing to use for tags. In an example, the description data for a product listing comprises “ ⁇ bolded>Luxuriously soft ⁇ /bolded>—made from the world's finest cotton. Slightly Fitted. Our most popular fit softly shapes the body; falls at low hip.” In this example, the product categorization system 120 determines tags comprising ⁇ soft fabric> based on the bolded word “soft” in the description data.
- the product categorization system 120 determines product category tags for each product listing based on other product data. For example, the product categorization system 120 determines product category tags based on breadcrumb data associated with the product listing.
- Example breadcrumb data comprises hierarchical website 149 location information for the product listing.

- the product categorization system 120 organizes the product listings into categories.
- the method to organize, by a product categorization system 120 , product listings into categories is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the method 230 described in FIG. 5 .
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram depicting a method 230 to organize, by a product categorization system 120 , product listings into categories, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
- the method 230 is described with reference to the components illustrated in FIG. 1 .
- the product categorization system 120 determines an applicability of tags to product listings by comparing product title and description data against each other. For example, the product categorization system 120 determined applicable product category tags for each product listing associated with a merchant system 140 product feed. In an example embodiment, the product categorization system 120 scores a similarity between product listings based on title data and description data associated with each product listing. In this example embodiment, the product categorization system 120 may use a function, such as a vector based cosine similarity function to determine similarities between product listings. In another example embodiment, the product categorization system 120 uses a decision tree based algorithm that trains on existing products in the search index and produces a probability that a particular tag applies to a particular product listing.
- the product categorization system 120 generates category pages comprising product listings with a high probability for respective particular category tag.
- the product categorization system 120 determines whether the probability that a particular product category tag applies to a product listing passes a predefined threshold probability. In this example embodiment, if the probability is higher than the predefined threshold, the product categorization system 120 adds the product listing to the product category associated with the particular product category tag.
- this predefined threshold probability is configurable. A higher probability threshold results in a higher accuracy or relevance when placing products in the categories but may result in too few products being placed in a product category. On the other hand, a relatively lower probability threshold will result in more products being placed in categories but higher percentage of those products may be inaccurately placed or considered irrelevant to users.
- the product categorization system 120 determines a probability that particular product category tags apply to a particular product listings. For example, to determine a probability that a particular category tag belongs to a particular product listing, the product categorization system 120 generates tuples for each product listing. For example, the product categorization system 120 generates a first set of tuples for a corresponding first set of product listings that are already associated with product category tags.
- each tuple of the first set of tuples comprises a title, a description, and a list of tags associated with each corresponding product listing of the corresponding first set of product listings.
- the first set of tuples for product listings that are already associated with product category tags may be received from the merchant system 140 as part of the merchant system 140 product feed data.
- the first set of tuples for product listings that are already associated with product category tags may be defined by a product categorization system 120 operator. For example, the operator assigns product category tags to a first set of product listings to generate the first set of tuples.
- the first set of tuples for product listings that are already associated with product category tags may be determined from data associated with an existing merchant system 140 product sales website 149 , for example, breadcrumb data from a previous or existing version of the website.
- the product categorization system 120 then may generate the first set of tuples by associating the determined product category tags for the first set of product listings with one or more merchant system 140 product feed data associated with each of the first set of product listings.
- the product categorization system 120 may generate the first set of tuples by based on data associated with a search index received from the search system 130 .
- the search index comprises a hierarchical classification of the product listings.
- the search listing, for each product listing may comprise tags associated with each product listing.
- the product categorization system 140 may generate the first set of tuples based on the tags in the search index associated with the first set of product listings.
- the product categorization system 120 generates a second set of tuples for a corresponding second set of product listings that are not yet associated with product category tags. For example, each tuple of the second set of tuples comprises a title and a description but does not include a product category tag listing.
- the product categorization system determines a separate similarity score between the particular tuple and each tuple of the first set of tuples.
- each similarity score may be determined based on a cosine similarity between respective tuples.
- Specific data between each pair of tuples such as title data or description data, may be compared to determine similarity values.
- the similarity scores for each specific data may then be weighted, and an overall cosine similarity score may be determined for a specific pair of tuples being compared.
- An overall cosine similarity score may be determined in a similar manner between each of the tuples of the second set of tuples to each of the tuples of the first set of tuples.
- the product categorization system 120 may normalize the overall cosine similarity scores to determine probability values for each pairing of tuples.
- the product categorization system 120 may assign to a particular tuple of the second set of tuples one or more product category tags from particular tuples of the first set of tuples if the probability values for the particular tuples of the first set of tuples with respect to the particular tuple of the second set of tuples are higher than a predefined threshold.
- the product categorization system 120 may assign to a particular tuple of the second set of tuples one or more product category tags from a predefined number of tuples of the first set of tuples having the highest probability values with respect to the particular tuple of the second set of tuples.
- the product categorization system 120 integrates category pages into a website 149 hierarchy.
- the product categorization system 120 determines one or more product categories that correspond to one or more existing product category pages associated with the merchant system website 149 .

Abstract
Description
- The present disclosure relates to improving the organization of product listings on merchant websites or on merchant system mobile device applications by organizing product listings into categories based on merchant system product information and organizing product listings within categories based on product sales and product search information.
- Generally, to update product listings displayed on merchant system sales websites or merchant system mobile applications, website or mobile application administrators associated with the merchant system must manually add, edit, delete, reorganize, insert, or perform other appropriate actions with respect to product listings on product category pages of merchant system sales websites or product category pages on mobile applications. A website administrator or mobile application administrator creates product category pages for a merchant system website or merchant system mobile application and then may use drag and drop user interface tools to manually edit the product category pages on the website or mobile application.
- Current applications for organizing product listings to display on merchant system sales websites and/or mobile applications do not provide for generating product category pages for product listings based on merchant system product data and organizing product listings within product category pages based on product sales data and product search data. Current applications for organizing a display of product listings on merchant system sales websites and/or mobile applications also do not provide for dynamically re-generating product category pages for product listings and re-organizing product listings within product category pages in response to changes in merchant system product data, product sales data, and/or product search data.
- Techniques herein provide computer-implemented methods to dynamically generate and update product category pages for a merchant sales website based on a merchant product feed, sales data, and search data. In an example embodiment, a product categorization system receives a merchant system product feed, product sales data, and/or product search data from a merchant system and/or a search system. The product categorization system may generate product category tags for each product listing of the merchant system product feed based on merchant system product feed data. The product categorization system assigns product listings to product categories based on the tags associated with each product listing and organizes the product listings within the product categories based on sales data and search data to create product category pages for a merchant system website. The product categorization system may then generate website data comprising the one or more category pages comprising the organized product listings and transmit the website data to the merchant system for display on the merchant system website. The product categorization system may receive updated merchant product feed data, updated search data, and/or updated sales data from the merchant system and/or the search system. The product categorization system may repeat the process for generating product category pages and organizing the product listings within category pages based on the updated data. The updated merchant system website may include additional product category pages not present in a previous version of the website or mobile application display, may include changes to existing product category pages that were present in the previous version of the website, or may delete product category pages that previously existed in the previous version of the website.
- In certain other example aspects described herein, systems and computer program products to dynamically generate and update product category pages for a merchant sales website based on a merchant product feed, sales data, and search data are provided.
- These and other aspects, objects, features, and advantages of the example embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrated example embodiments.

FIG. 10 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and module, in accordance with certain example embodiments. - The example embodiments described herein provide computer-implemented techniques for dynamically generating and updating product category pages for a merchant website or application based on a merchant product feed, sales data, and search data. An example merchant sales website may comprise a traditional website, a mobile website designed to be displayed in mobile user computing device web browsers, an application that displays pages of product information, or any other type of website, application, document, or other data accessible by a user computing device over a network. In certain example embodiments, instead of generating and/or updating a merchant sales website, the product categorization system generates and/or updates mobile computing device applications.
- In an example embodiment, a product categorization system receives a merchant system product feed, product sales data, and/or product search data from a merchant system and/or a search system. The product categorization system may generate product category tags for each product listing of the merchant system product feed based on merchant system product feed data. For example, the tags may be generated based on title data, description data, breadcrumb data, and/or price data associated with each product listing in the merchant system product feed. Then, the product categorization system assigns product listings to product categories based on the tags associated with each product listing and organizes the product listings within the product categories based on sales data and search data to create product category pages for a merchant system website. The product categorization system may then generate website or application page display data comprising the one or more category pages with the organized product listings and transmit the display data to the merchant system for display on the merchant system website or via the merchant application. The product categorization system may receive updated merchant product feed data, updated search data, and/or updated sales data from the merchant system and/or the search system. The product categorization system may repeat the process for generating product category pages and organizing the product listings within category pages based on the updated data. The updated merchant system website may include additional product category pages not present in a previous version of the website, may include changes to existing product category pages that were present in the previous version of the website, or may delete product category pages that previously existed in the previous version of the website. The product categorization system transmits data to the merchant system over the network that enables a merchant system server to provide and support the merchant system website so that user computing devices may access the website via the network and display the website to users. This data may further comprise instructions to create individual product category pages and to display corresponding product listings on each product category page according to the updated merchant system website design and organization generated by the product categorization system. The data may further comprise other instructions to enable the server to provide a virtual shopping cart functionality on the website that enables a user to select product listings displayed on the website to add to the virtual shopping cart and initiate a transaction for those product listings.
- More specifically, the product categorization system receives a product feed from the merchant system. For example, the product feed comprises title data, description data, price data, and other applicable data associated with each product listing of multiple product listings that the merchant system wants to offer for sale on the merchant system website. The product categorization system further receives product sales data associated with each of the product listings from the merchant system. The product sales data may comprise a conversion rate, a bounce rate describing comprising a percentage of users who leave the website after viewing a product listing, an add-to-cart rate, an average time spent on product category listing, bought-together data, and/or current stock data associated with each product listing. The product categorization system may also receive other types of sales data in addition to these specified types. The product categorization system receives product search data from a search system. For example, the product categorization system may determine one or more keywords associated with the product listing based on the title data or the description data and request the search data for each keyword from the search system. Example search data may comprise a search volume and/or a trending indicator associated with each keyword.
- The product categorization system determines product category tags for each product listing based on one or more of the title data, description data, price data, and/or other data received in the merchant system product feed. The product categorization system determines an applicability of each product category tag to each corresponding product listing by comparing the product title and description data against each other. The product categorization system generates category pages comprising product listings with a high probability for respective product category tags. For example, a high probability comprises a probability higher than a predefined threshold probability, for example, 99.5% probability or any other appropriate threshold probability. The product categorization system may integrate product category pages into an existing merchant system website hierarchy if applicable.
- The product categorization system organizes product listings within category pages based on sales data and search data associated with each product listing. For example, the product categorization system may organize product listings based on one or more of conversion data, average time spent on product listing, add-to-cart rate data, trending data, search volume data, bought-together data, bounce rate data, and/or current stock data. The product categorization system may also base an organization of the product listings within a particular product category page based on other appropriate sales data, search data, or even merchant feed data in addition to or instead of one or more of the sales data and search data types described herein. The product categorization system generates merchant system website data incorporating the generated, organized product category pages into the merchant system website. The product categorization system transmits the website data to the merchant system and the merchant system displays the website incorporating the product category pages generated by the product categorization system.
- The product categorization system may update the merchant system website in response to receiving updated product feed data, sales data, and/or search data. The product categorization system, in response to receiving the new data, may edit one or more existing product category pages, rearrange the order of the product listings on one or more of the merchant category pages, delete one or more product listings from one or more product category pages, delete one or more product category pages, rearrange and/or reorganize a hierarchical organization of product category pages, and/or generate one or more new product category pages. In this example, the product categorization system may also add or delete items from existing product category pages based on additions, deletions, or edits that the merchant system made to an updated merchant system product feed. In an example embodiment, the product categorization system generates a code or other data representing the updated website or updated sections of the existing website and transmits the updated website data to the merchant system along with instructions instructing the merchant system how to incorporate the updated website data into the existing website. In an example embodiment, the merchant system overwrites the previous version of the website with the received website data. In another example, the merchant system may insert or overwrite updated website data into the existing website and delete, cut and paste, or otherwise update some or all of the previous website data to integrate updated portions of the website generated by the product categorization system into the existing website data representing the previous version of the website. In an example embodiment, the merchant system displays the updated website comprising any updates, additions, deletions, rearrangements, or other appropriate actions taken by the product categorization system with respect to product category pages, product category page organization within the website, and/or individual product listings in response to the new product feed data, sales data, and/or search data with respect to the previous version of the website. In other example embodiments, instead of updating a merchant system website, the product categorization system generates data comprising a hierarchical grouping of products in product category pages that the user can navigate via the network via a shopping application on the user computing device.
- The user accesses the merchant system website via a user computing device, selects a product category page and further selects a product listing to add the selected product to a virtual shopping cart. In another example, the user may select a product listing and be directed to a web page that describes the selected product listing. For example the web page may comprise information about the selected product listing, such as title data, description data, price data, and one or more user interface objects that allow the user to access further information, add the product listing to the virtual shopping card, or perform another appropriate action with respect to the product listing on the web page devoted to the product listing. The user initiates a checkout process, and the merchant system processes a transaction based on financial account information and shipping information received from the user. The user may also select an option on the merchant system website to make a payment via a digital wallet account associated with a payment processing system.
- By using and relying on the methods and systems described herein, the merchant system, the search system, and the product categorization system enable the merchant system to provide a website or application that is dynamically organized into category pages according to product feed data and comprising product listings organized according to sales data and search data. By using and relying on the methods and systems described herein, the merchant system, the search system, and the product categorization system enable the merchant system to provide a website or application that can be automatically updated with respect to the titles of product category pages, the organization of product category pages, and/or the organization of product listings within the category pages in response to changes in the merchant system product feed data, changes in merchant system sales data, and/or changes in search data provided by the search system. As such, the systems and methods described herein may reduce the inputs required by an operator of the merchant system to maintain an updated merchant system sales website.
- Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like (but not necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, example embodiments are described in detail.

In an example embodiment, thecategory page generator 127 organizes the product listings associated with themerchant system 140 product feed into product category pages based on comparing product category tags of each of the product listings. For example, thecategory page generator 127 determines an applicability of product category tags to product listings by comparing product title and product description data against each other. In this example, thecategory page generator 127 generates product category pages based on the determined applicability of product category tags to product listings and integrates category pages into awebsite 149 hierarchy, if applicable. In an example embodiment, thecategory page generator 127 organizes product listings within product category pages based on one or more statistics, such as conversion rate data, average time spent data, add-to-cart rate data, trending data, bought-together data, bounce rate data, and current stock data. In an example embodiment, thecategory page generator 127 incorporates one or more of these data into a decision tree to organize the product listings within each particular product category page. In an example embodiment, thecategory page generator 127 receives conversion rate data, average time spent data, add-to-cart rate data, bought-together data, bounce rate data, and current stock data from themerchant system 140 via thenetwork 170 as part ofmerchant system 140 sales statistics and/ormerchant system 140 product feed data. In an example embodiment, thecategory page generator 127 receives search data associated with one or more keywords associated with each product listing. For example, thecategory page generator 127 may determine the one or more keywords associated with each product listing based on the product title data and product description data from themerchant system 140 product feed and transmit the one or more keywords associated with each product listing to thesearch system 130 via thenetwork 170 along with a request for search data associated with each of the keywords. Thecategory page generator 127 may receive, from thesearch system 130 via thenetwork 170, search data comprising a search volume and/or trending indicator associated with each of the keywords. In an example embodiment, thecategory page generator 127 generatesmerchant system website 149 data that describes thewebsite 149 incorporating all of the generated product category pages. In an example embodiment, thecategory page generator 127 transmits the generatedwebsite 149 data to themerchant system 140 via thenetwork 170. - An
example search system 130 comprises asearch statistics generator 135, a server 138, and a website 139. Anexample search system 130 comprises a search engine that communicates with theproduct categorization system 120 via thenetwork 170. In other example embodiments, theproduct categorization system 120 comprises thesearch system 130 or thesearch system 130 and theproduct categorization system 120 are otherwise parts of the same system. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 receives one or more keywords associated with one or more product listings along with a request for search data for each of the keywords from theproduct categorization system 120 via thenetwork 170. In this example embodiment, thesearch system 130 may also receive one or more time periods for which to determine search statistics associated with each keyword, for example, one or more historical time periods and/or a current time period. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 determines the search statistics for each keyword and transmits the search statistics to theproduct categorization system 120 via thenetwork 170. - In an example embodiment, the
search statistics generator 135 comprises a component of thesearch system 130 that generates the search statistics associated with each keyword associated with each product listing. In an example embodiment, thesearch statistics generator 135 determines a search volume for each keyword during one or more predefined time periods, which may include time periods defining one or more historical time periods and/or a current time period. In another example embodiment, thesearch statistics generator 135 determines whether each keyword is “trending” or not and generates a trending indicator for each keyword specifying that the keyword is either “trending” or “not trending” as part of the search statistics. In an example embodiment, a trending keyword search comprises a search volume that increases above a predefined threshold rate during a certain time period. In this example embodiment, the search volume threshold required to classify a keyword as “trending” is configurable. A higher search volume threshold results in fewer product listings and keywords being identified as “trending” but the “trending” identifier will be a better indicator of popularity of product listings and have a greater marketing usefulness but may result in a lesser number of product listings being considered “trending.” In another example, a relatively lower search volume threshold will result in more product listings being placed in categories and higher percentage of those products may be inaccurately placed. In an example embodiment, thesearch statistics generator 135 communicates the search data comprising the one or more search volumes for each keyword and/or the trending indicator associated with each keyword to theproduct categorization system 120 via thenetwork 170. - An
example merchant system 140 comprises adata storage unit 143, aproduct feed generator 145, asales data generator 147, aserver 148, and awebsite 149. - In an example embodiment, the
data storage unit 143 comprises a local or remote data storage structure accessible to themerchant system 140 suitable for storing information. In an example embodiment, thedata storage unit 143 stores encrypted information, such as HTML5 local storage. - In an example embodiment, the
product feed generator 145 comprises a component of themerchant system 140 that generates amerchant system 140 product feed. In an example embodiment, themerchant system 140 product feed comprises title data, description data, price data, and/or any other applicable data for product listings that amerchant system 140 desires to offer for sale on amerchant system 140website 149 or application. In an example embodiment, changes to amerchant system 140 product feed are made by one ormore merchant system 140 operators. For example, a marketing strategist associated with themerchant system 140 may make changes to themerchant system 140 product feed by adding product listings, deleting product listings, editing product listings, or other appropriate changes to themerchant system 140 product feed. In an example, theproduct feed generator 145 transmits themerchant system 140 product feed to theproduct categorization system 140 via thenetwork 170 periodically or upon receiving a request from theproduct categorization system 120 for themerchant system 140 product feed. In another example, theproduct categorization system 120 has remote access to theproduct feed generator 145 via thenetwork 170 and may continuously or periodically retrieve themerchant system 140 product feed data via thenetwork 170. - In an example embodiment, the
sales data generator 147 generates sales data associated with product listings associated with amerchant system 140 product feed. Example sales data comprises a conversion rate, a bounce rate, a time spent on product, an add-to-cart rate, a discount percentage, a stock indicator, a bought-together indicator, and a product newness indicator associated with one or more product listings associated with themerchant system 140 product feed. In an example embodiment, the sales data generator monitors data associated with themerchant system website 149 to determine one or more sales data. For example thesales data generator 147 may determine sales data based on transaction records, current and past virtual shopping cart statuses, current web pages of themerchant system website 149 that are being viewed and time spent on each web page, and any other interactions betweenusers 101 and thewebsite 149 that enable thesales data generator 147 to generate the sales data. In an example embodiment, thesales data generator 147 communicates the sales data associated with each product listing to theproduct categorization system 120 via thenetwork 170. For example, thesales data generator 147 communicates the sales data to theproduct categorization system 120 in response to receiving a request for the sales data from theproduct categorization system 120 via thenetwork 170. In another example, in response to updating one or more sales data for one or more product listings, thesales data generator 147 transmits updated sales data to theproduct categorization system 120 via thenetwork 170. - In an example embodiment, the
server 148 provides content accessible by theuser 101 through theweb browser 119 orshopping application 117 on the user computing device 110 via thenetwork 170, including but not limited to html documents, images, style sheets, and scripts.

In another example, themerchant system website 149 already exists and themerchant system 140 transmits the product feed for theproduct categorization system 120 to update product category pages and/orwebsite 149 layout of themerchant system website 149. - An example product listing describes a product for sale by the
merchant system website 149. In an example embodiment, themerchant system 140 product feed comprises, for each product listing, title data of a product associated with the product listing, description data of the product associated with the product listing, and price data of the product associated with the product listing. Example title data comprises a title of the product to be displayed on themerchant system website 149 tousers 101 browsing thewebsite 149 via user computing devices 110. For example, the title data associated with a product listing in amerchant system 140 product feed reads “Pima Cotton PinTucked Open Cardigan.” - Example description data associated with the product listing comprises a text description comprising one or more words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, alphanumeric characters and/or symbols that describe the product associated with the product listing. In an example, description data is displayed in a product listing on the
merchant system website 149. In this example, theuser 101 may view the description data associated with a product listing on thewebsite 149 or may first select the title of a product listing, wherein thewebsite 149 displays the description data to theuser 101. In another example, themerchant system website 149 does not display or intend to display part or all of the description data for a product listing. For example, part or all of the description data may be for themerchant system 140 product feed only and is not marked for display on themerchant system website 149. In an example, the description data for the product listing “Pima Cotton PinTucked Open Cardigan” in themerchant system 140 product feed comprises description data that states “<bolded>Luxuriously soft </bolded>—made from the world's finest cotton. Slightly Fitted. Our most popular fit softly shapes the body; falls at low hip.” Example price data for a product listing in amerchant system 140 product feed comprises a price at which themerchant system 140 offers to sell the product associated with the product listing on themerchant system website 149. In an example, the price data comprises “$24.99” for the product listing comprising the title data “Pima Cotton PinTucked Open Cardigan.” - If the
merchant system website 149 already exists, themerchant system 140 product feed may comprise, for each product listing, a uniform resource locator (“URL”) for the product listing in themerchant system website 149. In another example, themerchant system 140 product feed, for each product listing, comprises one or more breadcrumbs, that is,hierarchical website 149 location information for the product listing. For example, for a product listing titled “Pima Cotton PinTucked Open Cardigan,” a first breadcrumb reads “HomePage>Women's>Shirts>Tees & Knit Tops.” In this example, according to the breadcrumb, one way to navigate to the product listing in the current form of themerchant system 140webpage 149, theuser 101, starting at the “HomePage,” clicks on a “Women's” link, then a “Shirts,” link, then a “Tees & Knit Tops” link to be able to view the product listing titled “Pima Cotton PinTucked Open Cardigan.” Themerchant system 140 product feed may comprise more than one breadcrumb for a product listing. For example, a second breadcrumb for the product listing titled “Pima Cotton PinTucked Open Cardigan” reads “HomePage>Shirts>Women's>Knit Tops.” - In
block 320, theproduct categorization system 120 receives product sales data from themerchant system 140. In this embodiment, either themerchant system 140website 149 already exists or themerchant system 140 comprises one or more second websites (not depicted) that offer one or more product listings associated with themerchant system 140 product feed. For example, product sales data comprises sales statistics for online sales of product listings associated with themerchant system 140 product feed. In another example, theproduct categorization system 120 receives the product sales data from themerchant system 140 and determines sales statistics based on the received product sales data. - In an example embodiment, product sales data for a product listing comprises a conversion rate for the product listing. An example conversion rate comprises a proportion or percentage of
users 101 that, when viewing the particular product listing via a user computing device 110 on themerchant system website 149, click or otherwise select the product listing via the user interface 111 of the user computing device 110 to view more information associated with the product listing. In another example embodiment, product sales data for a product listing comprises a bounce rate associated with the product listing. For example, the bounce rate comprises a proportion or percentage ofusers 101 who enter a web page displaying the product listing and then leave (“bounce”) rather than continuing on to view other pages within the same site. In another example embodiment, product sales data for a product listing comprises a time spent on product. For example, the time spent on product comprises an average time spent viewing a product listing on thewebsite 149 byusers 101. In yet another example embodiment, product sales data for a product listing comprises an add-to-cart rate associated with the product listing. For example, the add-to-cart rate comprises a proportion or percentage ofusers 101 visiting themerchant system website 149 who add an item to a virtual shopping cart associated with themerchant system website 149. - In an example embodiment, product sales data for a product listing comprises a discount percentage associated with the product listing. For example, the discount percentage comprises a percentage discount to be applied to the product listing via the
merchant system website 149 at the time of sale. In certain example embodiments, depending on themerchant system 140 sales strategy, themerchant system 140 may want to either prioritize or deprioritize product listings having discount percentages. In another example embodiment, product sales data for a product listing comprises stock indicator associated with the product listing. For example, an in-stock indicator indicates that the product associated with the product listing is available for sale via themerchant system website 149. In another example, an out-of-stock indicator indicates that the product associated with the product listing is not available for sale via themerchant system website 149. In yet another example, a limited supply indicator indicates that the product associated with the product listing is available for sale via themerchant system website 149 but in a quantity below a predefined threshold. For example, the limited supply indicator indicates that only five units of product associated with product listing A remain for sale. In an example embodiment, the threshold to determine whether a product listing is in stock instead of limited supply is configurable by themerchant system 140. For example, if a number of a product listing in stock is greater than or equal to five units, the product listing is given an “in stock” indicator by themerchant system 140. In this example, if the number of a product listing in stock is less than five units but greater than zero units, the product listing is given a “limited supply” indicator. In this example, if the number of a product listing in stock is zero units, the product listing is given an “out of stock” indicator. - In an example embodiment, product sales data for a product listing comprises a bought-together indicator. An example bought-together indicator comprises a first product listing identifier for the product listing and one or more second product listing identifiers associated with one or more second product listings that
users 101 generally purchase together with the product listing via themerchant system website 149. For example, the bought-together indicator for product listing “youth tennis racket model A” comprises a product listing identifier for product listings “3-pack tennis balls brand B,” indicating that “3-pack tennis balls brand B” are often purchased together with “youth tennis racket model A” on themerchant system website 149. In another example embodiment, product sales data for a product listing comprises a product newness indicator. An example product newness indicator indicates whether the product listing is for a new product or an existing product. For example, a new product comprises a product that has been sold by themerchant system 140 for less than a threshold period of time, for example, for three months or less. An existing product, conversely, may comprise a product that has been sold by themerchant system 140 for more than the threshold period of time. - In an example embodiment, instead of receiving, from the
merchant system 140, one or more statistics describing a conversion rate, a bounce rate, a time spent on product, an add-to-cart rate, a discount percentage, a stock indicator, a bought-together indicator, and a product newness indicator associated with one or more product listings in the product sales data, theproduct categorization system 120 determines the one or more statistics by monitoringmerchant system website 149 data. For example,merchant system 140 grants theproduct categorization system 120 access to current and/or pastmerchant system website 149 data and theproduct categorization system 120 determines the one or more statistics from the current orpast website 149 data.Merchant system website 149 data may comprise data indicating past or current virtual shopping cart status data for online shopping sessions, past or current transaction data forwebsite 149 purchases, past or current inventory data for thewebsite 149, past or current web pages of thewebsite 149 being currently viewed at an associated time, and other past or current data associated with themerchant system website 149 useful to calculate or otherwise determine one or more of the statistics described previously. - In an example embodiment,
merchant system website 149 data may compriseanonymous user 101 behavior data ofusers 101 of thewebsite 149. For example, to determine behavior of one ormore users 101 with respect to thewebsite 149, themerchant website 149 may comprise an analytics code integrated into every web page of thewebsite 149.Example user 101 behavior comprises time spent on a page, actions taken by theuser 101, such as clicks, refreshes, selection of a back button, scrolling a web page, or otherrelevant user 101 interaction with one or more web pages of thewebsite 149 may be detected via the analytics code and transmitted to one or more statistics servers of themerchant system 140. In this example, the one or more statistics servers aggregate theuser 101 behavior data and may determine one ormore website 149 statistics based on theuser 101 behavior data. For example, themerchant system website 149 may determine a bounce rate based on data logging selection of a back button on a web page associated with a particular product listing. - In
block 330, theproduct categorization system 120 receives product search data from thesearch system 130. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 comprises thesearch system 130 or is a component of thesearch system 130 and already has access to product search data. In another example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 is separate from thesearch system 130 and transmits a request via thenetwork 170 to thesearch system 130 for data associated with each product listing of amerchant system 140 product feed. The request may include all or part of the title data, description data, and/or price data associated with the product listing received from themerchant system 140 product feed. The request may further include a historical time period that enables thesearch system 130 to determine search volume during the historical time period for one or more keywords associated with the product listing. For example, the current marketing season is Summer and themerchant system 140 wants to determine what the search volume was for a product listing or keywords associated with the product listing during the previous Summer. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 receives the request from theproduct categorization system 120 via thenetwork 170. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 determines search statistics associated with one or more keywords associated with the product listing. For example, thesearch system 130 determines search statistics associated with a product listing title. In another example, thesearch system 130 determines search statistics associated with a color, style, size, designer name, material, year, manufacturing country of origin, or other appropriate keyword derived from the description data associated with the product listing. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 determines search statistics indicating whether one or more keywords associated with a product listing are currently trending. For example, a trending search indicates that a search volume for a keyword shows an increase higher than a predefined threshold during a certain time period. Thesearch system 130 may also determine search statistics indicating historical trending data or historical search volume for one or more keywords associated with each product listing. For example, thesearch system 130 determines that one or more keywords associated with a product listing were trending during the previous summer or are currently trending and assigns a trending identifier indicating “trending” or “not trending” to each of the keywords as part of the search statistics. In an example embodiment, thesearch system 130 transmits search statistics, for example, a trending identifier, a current search volume, and/or a historical search volume associated with one or more keywords associated with each product listing to theproduct categorization system 120. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 receives the search statistics via thenetwork 170 from thesearch system 130. - From
block 330, themethod 210 proceeds to block 220 ofFIG. 2 . - Returning to
FIG. 2 , inblock 220, theproduct categorization system 120 generates product tags for each product listing based on themerchant system 140 product feed. The method to generate, by aproduct categorization system 120, product category tags for each product listing based on amerchant system 140 product feed is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to themethod 220 described inFIG. 4 . -
FIG. 4 is a block diagram depicting amethod 220 to generate, by aproduct categorization system 120, product category tags for each product listing based on amerchant system 140 product feed, in accordance with certain example embodiments. Themethod 220 is described with reference to the components illustrated inFIG. 1 . The steps ofmethod 220 need not be performed in the order described herein, one or more steps may be performed simultaneously, or one or more steps may be omitted. - In
block 410, theproduct categorization system 120 determines product category tags for each product listing based on title data. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 determines one or more terms from the title data for a product listing to use as tags for the product listing. For example, for the product listing comprising title data “Pima Cotton Pin-Tucked Open Cardigan,” theproduct categorization system 120 determines tags comprising <Cotton> and <Cardigan>. - In
block 420, theproduct categorization system 120 determines product category tags for each product listing based on product description data. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 determines one or more terms from the description data for a product listing to use as tags for the product listing. In an example, theproduct categorization system 120 extracts bolded, italicized, highlighted, or otherwise emphasized words, numbers, symbols, or phrases from the description data for the product listing to use for tags. In an example, the description data for a product listing comprises “<bolded>Luxuriously soft </bolded>—made from the world's finest cotton. Slightly Fitted. Our most popular fit softly shapes the body; falls at low hip.” In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 determines tags comprising <soft fabric> based on the bolded word “soft” in the description data. - In
block 430, theproduct categorization system 120 determines product category tags for each product listing based on other product data. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 determines product category tags based on breadcrumb data associated with the product listing. Example breadcrumb data compriseshierarchical website 149 location information for the product listing. For example, for a product listing titled “Pima Cotton PinTucked Open Cardigan,” a breadcrumb reads “HomePage>Women's>Shirts>Tees & Knit Tops.” In this example, according to the breadcrumb, one way to navigate to the product listing in the current form of themerchant system 140webpage 149, theuser 101, starting at the “HomePage,” clicks on a “Women's” link, then a “Shirts,” link, then a “Tees & Knit Tops” link to be able to view the product listing titled “Pima Cotton PinTucked Open Cardigan.” In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 determines the tags <Women's shirts>, <Tees>, and <Knit Tops> based on the breadcrumb data. In certain example embodiments, theproduct categorization system 120 may consider a combination of title data, description data, and breadcrumb data for a product listing to determine product category tags for a product listing. - From
block 430, themethod 220 proceeds to block 230 inFIG. 2 . - Returning to block 230, in
FIG. 2 , theproduct categorization system 120 organizes the product listings into categories. The method to organize, by aproduct categorization system 120, product listings into categories is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to themethod 230 described inFIG. 5 . -
FIG. 5 is a block diagram depicting amethod 230 to organize, by aproduct categorization system 120, product listings into categories, in accordance with certain example embodiments. Themethod 230 is described with reference to the components illustrated inFIG. 1 . - In
block 510, theproduct categorization system 120 determines an applicability of tags to product listings by comparing product title and description data against each other. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 determined applicable product category tags for each product listing associated with amerchant system 140 product feed. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 scores a similarity between product listings based on title data and description data associated with each product listing. In this example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 may use a function, such as a vector based cosine similarity function to determine similarities between product listings. In another example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 uses a decision tree based algorithm that trains on existing products in the search index and produces a probability that a particular tag applies to a particular product listing. - In
block 520, theproduct categorization system 120 generates category pages comprising product listings with a high probability for respective particular category tag. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 determines whether the probability that a particular product category tag applies to a product listing passes a predefined threshold probability. In this example embodiment, if the probability is higher than the predefined threshold, theproduct categorization system 120 adds the product listing to the product category associated with the particular product category tag. In an example embodiment, this predefined threshold probability is configurable. A higher probability threshold results in a higher accuracy or relevance when placing products in the categories but may result in too few products being placed in a product category. On the other hand, a relatively lower probability threshold will result in more products being placed in categories but higher percentage of those products may be inaccurately placed or considered irrelevant to users. - In an example embodiment to determine a probability that particular product category tags apply to a particular product listings, the
product categorization system 120 generates two groups of tuples, one group of tuples representing product listings already having assigned product category tags and another group of tuples representing product listings not having assigned product category tags. For example, to determine a probability that a particular category tag belongs to a particular product listing, theproduct categorization system 120 generates tuples for each product listing. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 generates a first set of tuples for a corresponding first set of product listings that are already associated with product category tags. For example, each tuple of the first set of tuples comprises a title, a description, and a list of tags associated with each corresponding product listing of the corresponding first set of product listings. In this example, the first set of tuples for product listings that are already associated with product category tags may be received from themerchant system 140 as part of themerchant system 140 product feed data. In another example, the first set of tuples for product listings that are already associated with product category tags may be defined by aproduct categorization system 120 operator. For example, the operator assigns product category tags to a first set of product listings to generate the first set of tuples. In another example, the first set of tuples for product listings that are already associated with product category tags may be determined from data associated with an existingmerchant system 140product sales website 149, for example, breadcrumb data from a previous or existing version of the website. Theproduct categorization system 120 then may generate the first set of tuples by associating the determined product category tags for the first set of product listings with one ormore merchant system 140 product feed data associated with each of the first set of product listings. In yet another example, theproduct categorization system 120 may generate the first set of tuples by based on data associated with a search index received from thesearch system 130. For example, the search index comprises a hierarchical classification of the product listings. The search listing, for each product listing, may comprise tags associated with each product listing. Theproduct categorization system 140 may generate the first set of tuples based on the tags in the search index associated with the first set of product listings. In an example embodiment. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 generates a second set of tuples for a corresponding second set of product listings that are not yet associated with product category tags. For example, each tuple of the second set of tuples comprises a title and a description but does not include a product category tag listing. - In this example embodiment, the product categorization system, for each particular tuple of the second set of tuples, determines a separate similarity score between the particular tuple and each tuple of the first set of tuples. In an example embodiment, each similarity score may be determined based on a cosine similarity between respective tuples. Specific data between each pair of tuples, such as title data or description data, may be compared to determine similarity values. The similarity scores for each specific data may then be weighted, and an overall cosine similarity score may be determined for a specific pair of tuples being compared. An overall cosine similarity score may be determined in a similar manner between each of the tuples of the second set of tuples to each of the tuples of the first set of tuples. The
product categorization system 120 may normalize the overall cosine similarity scores to determine probability values for each pairing of tuples. In this example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 may assign to a particular tuple of the second set of tuples one or more product category tags from particular tuples of the first set of tuples if the probability values for the particular tuples of the first set of tuples with respect to the particular tuple of the second set of tuples are higher than a predefined threshold. In another example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 may assign to a particular tuple of the second set of tuples one or more product category tags from a predefined number of tuples of the first set of tuples having the highest probability values with respect to the particular tuple of the second set of tuples. - In
block 530, theproduct categorization system 120 integrates category pages into awebsite 149 hierarchy. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 determines one or more product categories that correspond to one or more existing product category pages associated with themerchant system website 149. Theproduct categorization system 120 may determine a hierarchical organization of category pages that most closely corresponds to the existingmerchant system 140website 149. For example, the existingmerchant system 140website 149 comprises a product listing in a category page “Button up shirts,” that is within a larger product category page “Men's,” that is within an even larger category page “Clothing.” In this example, a product listing titled “Blue men's cotton button up shirt” comprises tags <Men's>, <Shirts>, <Cotton>, <Clothing>, <Blue>, and <Natural fiber> determined by theproduct categorization system 120 based on title data, description data, and breadcrumb data associated with the product listing in themerchant system 140 product feed. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 creates a subcategory page “Natural Fibers” or “Natural Fibers, cotton” within the existing subcategory page <Clothing><Men's><Button up shirts> in the existingmerchant system website 149 and adds the product listing to the generated subcategory page. In another example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 determines a logical hierarchy for one or more generated category pages that may not correspond to the existing category page hierarchy of themerchant system website 149. For example, a narrower product category page may comprise product listings and may be nested within a broader product category page comprising a larger number of product listings - From
block 530, themethod 230 proceeds to block 240 inFIG. 2 . - Returning to block 240, in
FIG. 2 , theproduct categorization system 120 organizes the product listings with categories. The method to organize, by a merchantproduct categorization system 120, product listings within categories is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to themethod 240 described inFIG. 6 . -
FIG. 6 is a block diagram depicting amethod 240 to organize, by a merchantproduct categorization system 120, product listings within categories, in accordance with certain example embodiments. Themethod 240 is described with reference to the components illustrated inFIG. 1 . The steps ofmethod 240 need not be performed in the order described herein, one or more steps may be performed simultaneously, or one or more steps may be omitted. - In an example embodiment, the
product categorization system 120 places higher priority product listings at the top of category pages of amerchant system website 149. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 generates category pages that display product listings tousers 101 in order of priority from top to bottom of the category page and from left to right across the category page. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 scores each product listing based on one or more product sales data received from themerchant system 140 and/or based on search data received from thesearch system 130. In this example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 gives higher priority to product listings having a higher score and lower priority to product listings having a lower score. In certain example embodiments, themerchant system 140 transmits, in addition to sales data associated with product listings, a marketing strategy or sales strategy that indicates what sales data and/or search data themerchant system 140 considers important and/or how theproduct categorization system 120 should interpret certain of the sales data received from themerchant system 140 and/or search data received from thesearch system 130. For example, themerchant system 140 marketing strategy may specify prioritizing, within product category pages, product listings having a discount percentage or prioritizing product listings not having a discount percentage. In another example, themerchant system 140 marketing strategy may specify that conversion rate is the most important consideration in organizing the product listings within product category pages. In yet another example, themerchant system 140 marketing strategy may specify weights associated with each sales statistic and/or search statistic and instructions to calculate a weighted score for each product listing and organize the product listings according to the weighted score. - In
block 610, theproduct categorization system 120 organizes product listings within category pages based on conversion rate data of respective product listings onmerchant system website 149. Example conversion rate data comprises a proportion or percentage ofusers 101 that, when viewing the particular product listing via a user computing device 110 on themerchant system website 149, click or otherwise select the product listing via the user interface 111 of the user computing device 110 to view more information associated with the product listing. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 receives sales data comprising the conversion rate data of respective product listings associated with themerchant system 140 product feed from themerchant system 140 via thenetwork 170. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 prioritizes product listings within each generated category page having higher conversion rates. For example, theproduct categorization system 120, for product listings within each category page, generates a score for each product listing based on the respective conversion rate of the product and ranks or prioritizes the products based on the generated score. For example, in category page A, product listing 1 has a conversion rate of 0.05%, product listing 2 has a conversion rate of 0.07%, and product listing 3 has a conversion rate of 0.003%. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 may give product listing 1 a score of 50, product listing 2 a score of 70, and product listing 3 a score of 3. In this example, within category page A and based on the generated scores for each product listing, theproduct categorization system 120 generates a category page that prioritizes product listing 2 over product listings 1 and 3, product listing 1 over product listing 3, and product listing 3 as the least prioritized of the product listings. - In
block 620, theproduct categorization system 120 organizes product listings within category pages based on average time spent byusers 101 on respective product listings on themerchant system website 149. An example time spent on product comprises an average time spent viewing a product listing on thewebsite 149 byusers 101. For example, theproduct categorization system 120, for product listings within each category page, generates a score for each product listing based on the respective time spent on product rate of the product and ranks or prioritizes the products based on the generated score. Themerchant system 140 sales strategy may specify prioritizing product listings that have a higher time spent on product rate over product listings having a lower time spent on product rate and theproduct categorization system 120 may generate a score based on the time spent on product rate for each product listing according to the sales strategy. For example, in category page A, product listing 1 has a time spent on product rate of 35 seconds, product listing 2 has a time spent on product rate of 68 seconds, and product listing 3 has a time spent on product rate of 250 seconds. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 may give product listing 1 a score of 35, product listing 2 a score of 68, and product listing 3 a score of 120. In this example, within category page A and based on the generated scores for each product listing, theproduct categorization system 120 generates a category page that prioritizes product listing 3 over product listings 1 and 2, product listing 2 over product listing 1, and product listing 1 as the least prioritized of the product listings. - In
block 630, theproduct categorization system 120 organizes product listings within category pages based on an add-to-cart rate of respective product listings on merchant website. An example add-to-cart rate comprises a proportion or percentage ofusers 101 visiting themerchant system website 149 who add a product listing to a virtual shopping cart associated with themerchant system website 149. For example, theproduct categorization system 120, for product listings within each category page, generates a score for each product listing based on the respective add-to-cart rate of the product and ranks or prioritizes the products based on the generated score. Themerchant system 140 sales strategy may specify prioritizing product listings that have a higher add-to-cart rate over product listings having a lower add-to-cart rate and theproduct categorization system 120 may generate a score based on the add-to-cart rate for each product listing according to the sales strategy. For example, in category page A, product listing 1 has an add to cart rate of 0.02, product listing 2 has an add to cart rate of 0.001, and product listing 3 has an add to cart rate of 0.035. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 may give product listing 1 a score of 20, product listing 2 a score of 1, and product listing 3 a score of 35. In this example, within category page A and based on the generated scores for each product listing, theproduct categorization system 120 generates a category page that prioritizes product listing 3 over product listings 1 and 2, product listing 1 over product listing 2, and product listing 2 as the least prioritized of the product listings. - In
block 640, theproduct categorization system 120 organizes product listings within category pages based on trending data of respective product terms fromsearch system 130. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 requests and receives search data from thesearch system 130 via thenetwork 170 for one or more keywords associated with each product listing. The search data may comprise a trending indicator for each keyword indicating whether the keyword is “trending” or “not trending” and an associated time period or time for when the trending indicator applies. For example, the trending indicator may indicate “currently trending,” “trending last Summer,” “trending last month,” or “trending Aug. 15, 2013.” The search data may comprise a search volume indicator for each keyword indicating a search volume along with an associated time or time period for when the search volume was measured. For example, search volume comprises a number of searches over a specified time period for a keyword. In an example, theproduct categorization system 120, for product listings within each category page, generates a score for each product listing based on the respective trending indicator and/or search volume associated with one or more keywords associated with each product listing and ranks or prioritizes the product listings based on the generated scores. Themerchant system 140 sales strategy may specify prioritizing product listings that, for a particular time period, have a higher search volume and/or a “trending” indicator over product listings having a lower search volume and/or a “not trending” indicator. Theproduct categorization system 120 may generate a score based on the trending indicator and search volume for one or more keywords associated with a product listing according to the sales strategy. In an example embodiment, the product categorization system may assign a “trending” indicator to the product listing if a majority of the keywords associated with the product listing comprise “trending” indicators and a “not trending” indicator to the product listing if only a minority of the keywords comprise “trending” indicators for a certain time period. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 assigns an average search volume for a certain time period for the product listing by averaging the search volumes for each of the associated product listing keywords for that certain time period. - In an example embodiment, the
product categorization system 120 may calculate a score for each product listing based on one or more of a trending indicator and a search volume, the trending indicator and the search volume being specific to a certain time period. For example, search data associated with product listing 1 in category page A comprises keyword I having a “trending” indicator, keyword II having a “not trending” indicator, and keyword “III” having a “trending” indicator for the time period of Summer, 2015. Since two of the three keywords comprise “trending” indicators in the search data, theproduct categorization system 120 may assign an overall “trending” indicator to the product listing. In this example, the search data associated with product listing 1 also comprises a search volume of 20000 for keyword I, 5000 for keyword II, and 5000 for keyword III. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 may first determine an average search volume for the product listing based on each of the three keywords, determine a score for the product listing based on the average search volume, and modify the score based on the trending indicator for the product listing. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 determines a score of 20 for keyword I, 5 for keyword II, and 5 for keyword III based on the example search volumes described above and an overall search volume score of 10 for the product listing based on the average of the scores for keywords I, II, and III. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 may multiply the overall search volume score for the product listing, 10, by a factor, for example, 1.5, based on the sales strategy or marketing strategy associated with themerchant system 140 to determine an overall search score of 15 for the product listing. In other examples, instead of multiplying by a factor, theproduct categorization system 120 may add, subtract, or use some other appropriate method to modify the overall search score based on a trending indicator. In an example, in category page A, if product listing 1 has a an overall search score of 10, product listing 2 has an overall search score of 15, and product listing 3 has an overall search score of 100. In this example, within category page A and based on the generated overall search scores for each product listing, theproduct categorization system 120 generates a category page that prioritizes product listing 3 over product listings 1 and 2, product listing 2 over product listing 1, and product listing 1 as the least prioritized of the product listings. - In
block 650, theproduct categorization system 120 organizes product listings within category pages based on bought-together data of respective product listings frommerchant system website 149. An example bought-together indicator comprises a first product listing identifier for the product listing and one or more second product listing identifiers associated with one or more second product listings thatusers 101 generally purchase together with the product listing via themerchant system website 149. For example, the bought-together indicator for product listing “youth tennis racket model A” comprises a product listing identifier for product listings “3-pack tennis balls brand B,” indicating that “3-pack tennis balls brand B” are often purchased together with “youth tennis racket model A” on themerchant system website 149. - In an example embodiment, after organizing product listings on a category page, the
product categorization system 120 may prioritize a product listing by promoting it to a position next to a second product listing based on its bought-together indicator. In other example embodiments, instead of promoting a product listing, theproduct categorization system 120 may demote a product listing in a similar manner based on its associated bought-together identifier and the one or more product listings identified so that products that are generally bought together on thewebsite 149 are in close proximity to one another on the product category page. In certain example embodiments, theproduct categorization system 120 may promote and/or demote multiple product listings within a particular category page based on the bought-together indicators of each product listing. In certain example embodiments, theproduct categorization system 120 may ignore bought-together indicators according to a marketing strategy received form themerchant system 140 or may not receive bought-together indicators as part of product sales data. - In an example, if the category page comprises, in order of priority, product listing 1, product listing 2, product listing 3 . . . product listing 30, and product listing 31, product listing 32, product listing 33, and product listing 34, and a bought-together indicator associated with product listing 30 indicates that it is frequently bought together with product listing 2 and product listing 32, the
product categorization system 120 may promote product listing 30 and/or product listing 32 to a position in the priority ranking immediately before or immediately after product listing 2. Alternatively, theproduct categorization system 120, in this example, may demote product listing 2 to a position immediately before product listing 30, between product listings 30 and 32, or immediately after product listing 32. In this example, the revised priority ranking for the product category page may then comprise, in order of priority, product listing 1, product listing 2, product listing 30, product listing 2, product listing 32, product listing 3 . . . product listing 31, product listing 33, and product listing 34—or, alternatively, product listing 1, product listing 3 . . . product listing 30, product listing 2, product listing 31, product listing 32, product listing 33, and product listing 34. - In
block 660, theproduct categorization system 120 organizes product listings within category pages based on bounce rate data of respective product listings frommerchant system website 149. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 scores and/or prioritizes product listings based on a bounce rate for each product listing. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 receivesmerchant system 140 sales data comprising bounce rate data associated with each product listing associated with amerchant system 140 product feed. An example bounce rate comprises a proportion or percentage ofusers 101 who enter a web page displaying the product listing and then leave (“bounce”) rather than continuing on to view other pages within thesame website 149. For example, theproduct categorization system 120, for product listings within each category page, generates a score for each product listing based on the respective bounce rate of the product and ranks or prioritizes the products based on the generated score. Themerchant system 140 sales strategy may specify prioritizing product listings that have a lower bounce rate over product listings having a higher bounce rate and theproduct categorization system 120 may generate a score based on the bounce rate for each product listing according to the sales strategy. For example, in category page A, product listing 1 has a bounce rate of 95%, product listing 2 has a bounce rate of 99%, and product listing 3 has a bounce rate of 96%. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 may give product listing 1 a score of 5, product listing 2 a score of 1, and product listing 3 a score of 4. In this example, within category page A and based on the generated scores for each product listing, theproduct categorization system 120 generates a category page that prioritizes product listing 1 over product listings 2 and 3, product listing 3 over product listing 2, and product listing 2 as the least prioritized of the product listings. - In
block 670, theproduct categorization system 120 organizes product listings within category pages based on current stock data of respective product listings frommerchant system website 149. In an example embodiment, current stock data associated with a product listing may comprise one of an in-stock indicator, out-of-stock indicator, or a limited supply indicator. An example in-stock indicator indicates that the product associated with the product listing is available for sale via themerchant system website 149. In another example, an out-of-stock indicator indicates that the product associated with the product listing is not available for sale via themerchant system website 149. In yet another example, a limited supply indicator indicates that the product associated with the product listing is available for sale via themerchant system website 149 but in a quantity below a predefined threshold. For example, the limited supply indicator indicates that only five units of product associated with product listing A remain for sale. - In an example, the
product categorization system 120, for product listings within each category page, generates a score for each product listing based on the in-stock indicator, out-of-stock indicator, or a limited supply indicator. Themerchant system 140 sales strategy may specify not advertising product listings that are out of stock and preferring to offer product listings that are not in limited supply. For example, in category page A, product listing 1 has an in-stock indicator, product listing 2 has an out-of-stock indicator, and product listing 3 has a limited supply indicator. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 may give product listing 1 a score of 0, product listing 2 a score of 1, and product listing 3 a score of 5. In this example, within category page A and based on the generated scores for each product listing, theproduct categorization system 120 generates a category page that prioritizes product listing 1 over product listings 2 and 3, product listing 3 over product listing 2, and product listing 3 as the least prioritized of the product listings. - In another example embodiment, current stock data comprises a newness indicator that indicates whether the product listing is for a new product or an existing product. For example, a new product comprises a product that has been sold by the
merchant system 140 for less than a threshold period of time, for example, for three months or less. An existing product, conversely, may comprise a product that has been sold by themerchant system 140 for more than the threshold period of time. In an example, theproduct categorization system 120, for product listings within each category page, generates a score for each product listing based on an associated newness indicator indicating that the product listing is “new” or “not new.” Themerchant system 140 sales strategy may specify not advertising product listings that are out of stock and preferring to offer product listings that are not in limited supply. For example, in category page A, product listing 1 has an “new” indicator, product listing 2 has a “not new” indicator. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 may give product listing 1 a score of 15, product listing 2 a score of 1. In this example, within category page A and based on the generated scores for each product listing, theproduct categorization system 120 generates a category page that prioritizes product listing 1 over product listing 2. - In
block 680, theproduct categorization system 120 organizes product listings within category pages based on a decision tree incorporating all data from themerchant system 140 and thesearch system 130. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 may first exclude product listings comprising stock indicators indicating that the product associated with the product listing is out of stock and/or in limited supply and then rank the product listings based on a conversion rate associated with each product listing. In another example, theproduct categorization system 120 may first rank product listings within a category page based on an add-to-cart rate associated with each product listing and then add a number of new product listings, for example, five new product listings, at the top of the category page or other highest priority position on the category page. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 may then rank the five new product listings at the top of the category page based on current search volume data received from thesearch system 130. Theproduct categorization system 120 may use a decision tree that includes any number of steps including ranking product listings, excluding product listings, adding product listings, promoting product listings, demoting product listings, or other appropriate actions associated with one or more product listings on a category page and based on the one or more sales statistics and/or search statistics. An example decision tree or part of an example decision tree may also prescribe an algorithm to calculate a weighted score for each product listing. For example, the decision tree may instruct theproduct categorization system 120 to first calculate an initial score based the conversion rate for each product listing within a product category, then multiply each of the initial scores by a multiplier value determined based on the newness factor associated with each of the product listings, where the initial score and multiplier values being determined according to a receivedmerchant system 140 sales strategy. In this example, the decision tree may next instruct that theproduct categorization system 140 rank the product listings within the product category page based on the final score from highest to lowest. - In an example embodiment, the
product categorization system 120 organizes product listings on one or more product category pages based on one or more objective functions. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 organizes product listings within a particular product category page based on an objective function that promotes older product listings (based on the newness indicator for each product listing) while not allowing an overall conversion rate of the product listings on the category page to decrease by more than ten percent from an initial overall conversion rate of a previous version of the category page. In another example, theproduct categorization system 120 organizes a product category page based on an objective function that selects an optimum set of product listings to display on the page in a way such that no one brand of product listing occupies more than twenty percent of available display space on the product category page. Any other appropriate objective function may be used by theproduct categorization system 120 to organize product listings within a product category page. In an example, an objective function may combine one or more of sales data, search data, product feed data, or other applicable data associated with one or more product listings. In this example, the objective function may be incorporated into a decision tree. In another example, a decision tree may comprise multiple objective functions to organize product listings within one or more particular product category pages. - In certain example embodiments, the
product categorization system 120 may generate a weighted score for each product listing based on the importance of one or more of the one or more product sales data and/or search data associated with the product listing. For example, theproduct categorization system 120 may assign a weight to each of one or more sales statistics describing a conversion rate, a bounce rate, a time spent on product, an add-to-cart rate, a discount percentage, a stock indicator, a bought-together indicator, and a product newness indicator associated with each of the one or more product listings in the product sales data. Theproduct categorization system 120 may also assign a weight to each applicable search statistic, such as a trending indicator, current search volume, or historical search volume associated with each product list. In this example, based on the sales strategy or marketing strategy of themerchant system 140, theproduct categorization system 120 assigns a higher weight to some sales or search statistics over other sales or search statistics. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 determines, for each product listing, a sum of the scores for each applicable sales statistic and/or search statistic, each score multiplied by the corresponding weight associated with the sales statistic or search statistic on which the score is based. In this example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 orders the product listings on each generated category page according to the weighted score for each product listing. In certain example embodiments, the weighted score for each product listing may be based on one, some, or all of the available sales statistics and/or search statistics associated with the product listing. - From
block 680, themethod 240 proceeds to block 250, inFIG. 2 . - Returning to
FIG. 2 , inblock 250, theproduct categorization system 120 generates product category pages and transmits the pages to themerchant system website 149 for display. The method to generate, by a product categorization system, product category pages and transmit product category pages to a merchant website for display is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to themethod 260 described inFIG. 7 . -
FIG. 7 is a block diagram depicting amethod 250 to generate, by a product categorization system, product category pages and transmit product category pages to a merchant website for display, in accordance with certain example embodiments. Themethod 250 is described with reference to the components illustrated inFIG. 1 . - In example embodiments described herein, the
product categorization system 120 generates amerchant system website 149 comprising multiple product category pages or otherwise incorporates product category pages into an existingmerchant system website 149. In other example embodiments, theproduct categorization system 120 generates data that supports a display of product category pages within a user computingdevice shopping application 117 associated with themerchant system 140. In the example embodiments described herein, the functions described as being performed by theproduct categorization system 120 with respect to generating all or parts of thewebsite 149 may also be embodied by theproduct categorization system 120 performing functions with respect toserver 148 data that supports a display of a hierarchy of product category pages within ashopping application 117 interface associated with themerchant system 140. - In
block 710, theproduct categorization system 120 generatesmerchant system website 149 data incorporating the generated product category pages. In an example embodiment, after ordering the product listings within each category page based on sales data and/or search data received via thenetwork 170 from themerchant system 140 and/or thesearch system 130, theproduct categorization system 120 creates the final version of each product category page to incorporate into themerchant system website 149. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 uses HTML or other appropriate language understandable to a user computing device 110web browser 119 orshopping application 117 to describe each product category page. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 generates data for theentire website 149 comprising each product category page. In another example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 generates data for each product category page of the website separately. In an example embodiment, in addition to each product category page, theproduct categorization system 120 generates product listing web pages, each product listing web page associated with a particular product listing. For example, an example product listing page comprises title data, description data, price data, other data from themerchant system 140 product feed, or other relevant data that auser 101 viewing thewebsite 149 may find helpful when deciding whether to purchase the product listing on thewebsite 149. The example product listing page may further comprise one or more user interface 111 objects that enable auser 101 to initiate one or more actions with respect to the product listing being advertised on the product listing page, for example, add the product listing to a virtual shopping cart, request further information from themerchant system 140 about the product listing, or other appropriate or relevant action. Theproduct categorization system 120 may generate product category pages comprising links to the individual product listing pages and/or comprising links to one or more other product category pages. These links may be in the form of tabs, hyperlinks, or other appropriate format to enable auser 101 to navigate themerchant system website 149 hierarchy of web pages. Further, broader - In
block 720, theproduct categorization system 120 transmits thewebsite 149 data to themerchant system 140. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 transmits data describing theentire website 149 comprising each product category page. In another example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 transmits separate data for each product category page of thewebsite 149. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 transmits thewebsite 149 data to themerchant system 140 via thenetwork 170 and themerchant system 140 receives thewebsite 149 data via thenetwork 170. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 generates instructions to themerchant system 140 to include in thewebsite 149 data instructing themerchant system 140 how to incorporate thenew website 149 data into existingmerchant system website 149 data to create an updatedwebsite 149 comprising the organized category pages as generated by theproduct categorization system 120. - In
block 730, themerchant system 140 displays thewebsite 149 incorporating the product category pages generated by theproduct categorization system 120. In an example embodiment, themerchant system 140 overwrites all or part of the underlying code of thewebsite 149 with thewebsite 149 data received from theproduct categorization system 120. In this example embodiment, themerchant system 140 may insert receivedwebsite 149 data into the existingwebsite 149 data where appropriate. In this example embodiment, themerchant system 140 may delete existingwebsite 149 data. In an example embodiment, the receivedwebsite 149 data comprises instructions to themerchant system 140 instructing themerchant system 140 how to incorporate thenew website 149 data into the existingwebsite 149 data to create an updatedwebsite 149 comprising the category pages generated by theproduct categorization system 120. - From
block 730, themethod 250 proceeds to block 260 inFIG. 2 . - Returning to
FIG. 2 , inblock 260, theproduct categorization system 120 determines whether updated product sales data and/or product search data are available. For example, themerchant system 140 may periodically transmit an updatedmerchant system 140 product feed and/or new product sales data to theproduct categorization system 120 via thenetwork 170. In another example, thesearch system 130 may periodically transmit new search data to theproduct categorization system 120 via thenetwork 170. Also, in response to receiving updatedmerchant system 140 product feed and/or product sales data from themerchant system 140, theproduct categorization system 120 may request and receive updated search data associated with the merchant system product feed via thenetwork 170. In yet another example, theproduct categorization system 120 periodically requests and receives updated merchant system product feed data from themerchant system 140 and/or periodically requests and receives updated merchant system sales data from themerchant system 140 via thenetwork 170. In yet another example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 has continuous remote access to a computing device associated with themerchant system 140 that stores themerchant system 140 product feed and/or merchant system sales data and theproduct categorization system 120 receives an alert signal comprising the updated sales data and/or updated product feed data via thenetwork 170 when the merchant system product feed is updated on that computing device. Amerchant system 140 may update merchant system product feed data by adding a product listing, deleting a product listing, or editing a product listing in the existing product feed data. For example, themerchant system 140 may make changes to the title data, price data, breadcrumb data, description data, or other applicable data associated with one or more product listings of the product feed data via adding, inserting, deleting, editing, or other appropriate action. Amerchant system 140 may update merchant system sales data by editing one or more sales data associated with one or more existing product listings. For example, themerchant system 140 may change one or more of one a conversion rate, a bounce rate, a time spent on product, an add-to-cart rate, a discount percentage, a stock indicator, a bought-together indicator, a product newness indicator, or other appropriate statistic or indicator associated with one or more product listings in the product sales data. - If the
product categorization system 120 determines that updated merchant system product feed data and/or merchant system sales data are available, themethod 200 returns to block 210. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 receives an merchant system updated product feed, updated product sales data, and/or updated product search data from themerchant system 140 and/or thesearch system 130. As previously discussed, theproduct categorization system 120 may generate product tags for each product listing based on the merchant system product feed data. For example, the tags may be generated based on the title data, description data, breadcrumb data, and/or price data associated with each product listing in themerchant system 140 product feed as discussed previously herein. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 assigns product listings to product categories based on the tags associated with each product listing and organizes the product listings within the product categories based on sales data and search data to create product category pages for themerchant system website 149. Theproduct categorization system 120 may then generate an updatedwebsite 149 comprising one or more updated product category pages. The updatedwebsite 149 may include additional product category pages not present in the previous version of thewebsite 149, may include changes to existing product category pages that were present in the previous version of thewebsite 149, or may delete product category pages that previously existed in the previous version of thewebsite 149. For example, theproduct categorization system 120, in editing an existing product category page, may rearrange the order of the product listings on the pages in response to changes in merchant system sales data and/or changes in the sales data. In this example, theproduct categorization system 120 may also add or delete items from existing product category pages based on additions, deletions, or edits that themerchant system 140 made to an updatedmerchant system 140 product feed. In an example embodiment, theproduct categorization system 120 generates a code or other data representing the updatedwebsite 149 or updated sections of the existingwebsite 149 and transmits the updatedwebsite 149 data to themerchant system 140 via thenetwork 170 along with instructions instructing themerchant system 140 how to incorporate the updatedwebsite 149 data into the existingwebsite 149. In an example embodiment, themerchant system 140 overwrites the previous version of thewebsite 149 with the receivedwebsite 149 data. In another example, themerchant system 140 may insert or overwrites updatedwebsite 149 data into the existingwebsite 149 and delete, cut and paste, or otherwise some or all of theprevious website 149 data to integrate updated portions of thewebsite 149 generated by theproduct categorization system 120 into the existingwebsite 149 data representing the previous version of thewebsite 149. In an example embodiment, themerchant system 140 displays the updatedwebsite 149 comprising any updates, additions, deletions, rearrangements, or other appropriate actions taken by theproduct categorization system 120 in response to the new product feed data, sales data, and/or search data with respect to the previous version of thewebsite 149. - Returning to block 260, if the
product categorization system 120 determines that updated merchant system product feed data and/or merchant system sales data are not available, the method proceeds to block 270. Inblock 270, theuser 101 interacts withmerchant system website 149 to select a product listing on a product category page. The method to interact, by a user, with a merchant system website to select a product listing on a product category page is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to themethod 270 described inFIG. 8 . -
FIG. 8 is a block diagram depicting amethod 270 to interact, by a user, with a merchant system website to select a product listing on a product category page, in accordance with certain example embodiments. Themethod 270 is described with reference to the components illustrated inFIG. 1 . - In
block 810, theuser 101 accesses themerchant system website 149 via the user computing device 110. In an example embodiment, the user computing device 110 comprises aweb browser 119 application and the user accesses themerchant system website 149 using theweb browser 119 via thenetwork 170. For example, theuser 101 enters thewebsite 149 address into an address bar of theweb browser 119 via the user interface 111. In another example, theuser 101 is on another website and selects via the user interface 111 a link that redirects theweb browser 119 to themerchant system website 149 via thenetwork 170. In another example embodiment, theuser 101 accesses themerchant system website 149 via the user computing device 110 using ashopping application 117. Anexample shopping application 117 is associated with themerchant system 140 and communicates with themerchant system server 148 via thenetwork 170 to display themerchant system website 149 on the user computing device 110. In this example embodiment, to access themerchant system website 149, theuser 101 may select theshopping application 117 icon via the user interface 111 to open theshopping application 117, which accesses themerchant system website 149 via thenetwork 170. - In
block 820, theuser 101 selects a product category page via the user computing device 110. As described in certain example embodiments herein, themerchant system 140website 149, as generated by theproduct categorization system 120, comprises multiple product category pages, each product category page comprising one or more product listings derived from a merchant system product feed. Thewebsite 149 may comprise a hierarchy of product category pages within other product category pages. For example, theuser 101 may first access a home page associated with themerchant system website 149 and select a product category page “Clothing.” In this example, theuser 101 may be presented with a display of the “Clothing” category page comprising one or more product listings associated with a product tag “clothing.” Thewebsite 149 may also display one or more suggested links to subcategories “Men's clothing,” “Women's clothing,” “Girl's clothing,” “Boys clothing,” “Baby Clothing,” “Winter clothing,” and “Summer clothing.” In this example theuser 101 may select the subcategory link “Men's clothing,” and theweb browser 119 is directed to the “Men's clothing” category page comprising one or more product listings associated with product tags “Men's” and “Clothing.” This category page may further comprise one or more suggested links to subcategories “Men's summer clothing,” “Men's winter clothing,” “Men's formal clothing.” In this example, theuser 101 may select the subcategory link “Men's formal clothing,” and theweb browser 119 is directed to the “Men's formal clothing” category page comprising one or more product listings associated with the product tags “Men's,” “clothing,” and “formal clothing.” In an example embodiment, theuser 101 may continue to navigate thewebsite 149 by clicking on category and subcategory links to browse category pages of varying specificity. - In
block 830, theuser 101 views the selected product category page displayed on the user computing device 110. In an example embodiment, the user computing device 110 displays the selected product category page via theweb browser 119 orshopping application 117. For example, theuser 101 may arrive at a product category page titled “Men's natural fiber winter clothing” comprising product listings titled, among others, “herringbone pattern wool Men's blue checkered scarf,” “long sleeve Men's t-shirt, cotton, solid colors” and “100% wool Men's Sanquhar gloves, Prince of Wales pattern.” In an example embodiment, the product category page comprises product listings that are organized in a list, a block pattern, or other appropriate arrangement. In an example embodiment, each product listing comprises one or more links that enable theuser 101 to view more information about the product listing, view the product description and/or the price of the product associated with the product listing, and add the product listing to a virtual shopping cart associated with themerchant system website 149. - In
block 840, theuser 101 selects a product listing displayed on the selected product category page. For example, theuser 101 selects the product listing “100% wool Men's Sanquhar gloves, Prince of Wales pattern.” In this example, theuser 101 may further select, enter, or otherwise input one or more product listing parameters comprising a quantity, color, size, and/or other specific product configuration via one or more drop down menus, text entry areas, checkboxes, and/or other appropriate user interface 111 objects. For example, theuser 101 selects a “medium” size for the gloves and “black and white” for the color of the gloves. In an example embodiment, the user may input one or more product listing parameters for a particular product listing directly on a product category page that comprises the product listing. In another example embodiment, theuser 101 may select the product listing (for example, select a link associated with the product listing) on the product category page, which causes theweb browser 119 orshopping application 117 of the user computing device 110 to be redirected to a web page devoted to the individual product listing selected by theuser 101. In this example embodiment, the user may input one or more product listing parameters on the product listing page associated with the individual, selected product listing. - In
block 850, theuser 101 adds the selected product listing to a virtual shopping cart. In an example embodiment, the product listing displays a user interface 111 object, either on the product category page comprising the selected product listing or on an individual product listing page associated with the selected product listing, that theuser 101 may select via theweb browser 119 on the user computing device 110 that instructs themerchant system website 149 to add the selected product listing to the virtual shopping cart associated with thewebsite 149.

In an example embodiment, the receipt data comprises a notice of successful transaction, an expected shipment date, a summary of the products purchased in the transaction and a total amount charged, an indication of theuser 101 financial account charged, and other useful information to summarize the successful transaction. In another example, the receipt data comprises a notice of declined transaction. - In certain other example embodiments, instead of the
merchant system 140 processing a transaction for a product purchased by theuser 101 from themerchant system 140website 149, apayment processing system 150 associated with a digital wallet account of theuser 101 processes a payment transaction using financial account information selected by theuser 101 via apayment application 115 resident on the user computing device 110. In an example embodiment, theuser 101 establishes a digital wallet account with thepayment processing system 150 by accessing awebsite 159 of thepayment processing system 150 using the user computing device 110 and registering for a digital wallet account via thewebsite 159. In an example embodiment, theuser 101 downloads apayment application 115, such as a digital wallet application, associated with thepayment processing system 150 from the paymentprocessing system website 159 onto the user computing device 110. In an example embodiment, theuser 101 enters financial account information associated with one or more financial accounts of theuser 101 into the digital wallet account maintained by thepayment processing system 150 via thepayment application 115. For example, thepayment application 115 is able to send and receive data to and from thepayment processing system 150 via thenetwork 170. - In an example embodiment, one of the payment options offered by the
merchant system website 149 is an option to pay using thepayment application 115. For example, the payment options displayed may be “credit card type A, credit card type B, bank account, digitalwallet payment application 115,merchant system 140 account.” In this example, theuser 101 selects the payment option comprising “digitalwallet payment application 115,” and in response to theuser 101 selection, thepayment application 115 opens on the user computing device 110. In this example, thepayment application 115 communicates with thepayment processing system 150 to retrieve and display to theuser 101 financial account information associated with one ormore user 101 accounts that theuser 101 has uploaded to the user's 101 digital wallet account. In this example, theuser 101 selects a particular financial account via thepayment application 115 and thepayment application 115 communicates an indication of theuser 101 selection to thepayment processing system 150. In this example, thepayment processing system 150 generates a payment authorization request and communicates the authorization request to anissuer system 160 associated with theuser 101 selected financial account information. In an example, thepayment processing system 150 receives a notice of approval of the payment authorization request and communicates the notice of approval to themerchant system website 149 and/or the user computing device 110 to display confirmation of a successful transaction to theuser 101. - In
block 970, the user computing device 110 receives receipt data and displays the receipt data to theuser 101. In an example, the receipt data comprises a notice of successful transaction, an expected shipment date, a summary of the products purchased in the transaction and a total amount charged, an indication of theuser 101 financial account charged, and other useful information to summarize the successful transaction. In another example, the receipt data comprises a notice of declined transaction. In an example embodiment, theuser 101 receives the receipt data via theshopping application 117, via an email application, via thepayment application 115, or via some other appropriate method to receive the receipt data on the user computing device 110 via thenetwork 170. In an example embodiment, the receipt data showing an approved or declined transaction is displayed to theuser 101 on the user interface 111 of the user computing device 110. -
