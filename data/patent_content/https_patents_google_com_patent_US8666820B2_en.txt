- Information derived from or related to e-mail information may be referred to as “external e-mail information.”
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an advertising environment 100 .
- the environment 100 may include an ad entry, maintenance and delivery system (simply referred to as an “ad server”) 120 .
- Advertisers 110 may directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track ad information in the system 120 .

- a “campaign” or “ad campaign” refers to one or more groups of one or more advertisements, and may include a start date, an end date, budget information, geo-targeting information, syndication information, etc.
- Honda may have one advertising campaign for its automotive line, and a separate advertising campaign for its motorcycle line.
- the campaign for its automotive line may have one or more ad groups, each containing one or more ads.
- Each ad group may include targeting information (e.g., a set of keywords, a set of one or more topics, geolocation information, user profile information, etc.), and price information (e.g., maximum cost (cost per click-though, cost per conversion, etc.)).
- each ad group may include an average cost (e.g., average cost per click-through, average cost per conversion, etc.). Therefore, a single maximum cost and/or a single average cost may be associated with one or more keywords, and/or topics.
- each ad group may have one or more ads or “creatives” (That is, ad content that is ultimately rendered to an end user.).
- Each ad may also include a link to a URL (e.g., a landing Web page, such as the home page of an advertiser, or a Web page associated with a particular product or server).
- the ad information may include more or less information, and may be organized in a number of different ways.

- An ad server 210 may be used to serve ads to user devices 250 .
- the ads may be served in association with search results provided by the search engine 220 .
- content-relevant ads may be served in association with content provided by the content server 230 , and/or e-mail supported by the e-mail server 240 and/or user device e-mail facilities.
- ads may be targeted to documents served by content servers.
- an ad consumer 130 is a general content server 230 that receives requests for documents (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, Web page listings, etc.), and retrieves the requested document in response to, or otherwise services, the request.
- the content server may submit a request for ads to the ad server 120 / 210 .
- Such an ad request may include a number of ads desired.
- the ad request may also include document request information.
- This information may include the document itself (e.g., page), a category or topic corresponding to the content of the document or the document request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the document request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, document information, etc.

- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, document information, etc.
- the content server 230 may combine the requested document with one or more of the advertisements provided by the ad server 120 / 210 . This combined information including the document content and advertisement(s) is then forwarded towards the end user device 250 that requested the document, for presentation to the user. Finally, the content server 230 may transmit information about the ads and how, when, and/or where the ads are to be rendered (e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.) back to the ad server 120 / 210 . Alternatively, or in addition, such information may be provided back to the ad server 120 / 210 by some other means.
- search engine 220 may receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine may retrieve relevant search results (e.g., from an index of Web pages).
- relevant search results e.g., from an index of Web pages.
- An exemplary search engine is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference , Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999 (both incorporated herein by reference).
- search results may include, for example, lists of Web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those Web pages, and hypertext links to those Web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search engine 220 may submit a request for ads to the ad server 120 / 210 .
- the request may include a number of ads desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the ads, etc. In one embodiment, the number of desired ads will be from one to ten, and preferably from three to five.
- the request for ads may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geolocation information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate, and/or as described below, information related to, and/or derived from, the search query), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores such as dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, Page Rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and Page Rank scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., Web pages), full text of identified documents, topics of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- identifiers related to the search results e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”
- scores related to the search results e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores such as dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, Page Rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and Page Rank scores
- snippets of text extracted from identified documents e.g., Web pages
- full text of identified documents e.g., topics of
- the search engine 220 may combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the ad server 120 / 210 . This combined information including the search results and advertisement(s) is then forwarded towards the user that submitted the search, for presentation to the user.
- the search results are maintained as distinct from the ads, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- the search engine 220 may transmit information about the ad and when, where, and/or how the ad was to be rendered (e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.) back to the ad server 120 / 210 .
- information may include information for determining on what basis the ad way determined relevant (e.g., strict or relaxed match, or exact, phrase, or broad match, etc.) Alternatively, or in addition, such information may be provided back to the ad server 120 / 210 by some other means.
- the e-mail server 240 may be thought of, generally, as a content server in which a document served is simply an e-mail.
- e-mail applications such as Microsoft Outlook for example
- an e-mail server 240 or application may be thought of as an ad consumer 130 .
- e-mails may be thought of as documents, and targeted ads may be served in association with such documents. For example, one or more ads may be served in, under over, or otherwise in association with an e-mail.
- servers as (i) requesting ads, and (ii) combining them with content
- a client device such as an end user computer for example
- FIG. 3 is a bubble diagram of exemplary operations which may be performed in a manner consistent with the present invention, as well as information that may be used and/or generated by such operations.
- Ad and ad parameter determination operations 350 may be used to determine rendering parameters (e.g., sizes, layouts, and/or styles) for online ads.
- the layouts are not limited to a simple linear list of results. For example; layouts of the ads may be more similar to page layouts used in yellow pages.
- the ad and ad parameter determination operations 350 may use ad information 310 , query information (which may include user information) 320 , and/or constraint information 330 to determine a set of ads and their parameters 360 .
- Ad information 310 may include ad features 340 having “values” that depend on ad rendering parameters. Further ad information 310 may include one or more of offer information (e.g., price per impression, selection or conversion, maximum offer per impression, selection or conversion, etc.), location information, product information, targeting information, performance information (e.g., selection rate, conversion rate, etc.), etc.
- Query information 320 may include one or more of search terms, content topics, end user location or location of interest, user profile, user behavior, etc.
- Constraint information 330 may include one or more of screen space (or footprint) for the ads, maximum number of ads permitted, etc.
- the constraint information 330 and ad features 340 may be used to determine ads and their rendering parameters.
- Query information 320 and/or other ad information 310 may also be used in this determination.
- the operations 350 can be used to determine a “best” combination of size, style, and/or layout of ads.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an exemplary method 400 that may be used to perform ad rendering parameter (and perhaps ad) determination operations in a manner consistent with the present invention.
- the method 400 may accept a variety of information to determine an optimized set of rendered ads.
- the method 400 may accept ad information (that includes at least one ad feature having a “value” that depends on ad rendering parameters) (Block 405 ), query information (Block 410 ), and/or constraint information (Block 415 ). This obtained information may then be processed to determine an optimized set of ads, including their rendering parameters (Block 420 ).
- ad rendering parameter determination method 400 may accept ad features having values that depend on the ad rendering parameters. These ad features are used by the method 400 to define a constrained optimization problem where the optimum rendering parameters (e.g., size, style, and/or layout) of ads are determined.
- Features that may be used to optimize the ad rendering parameters may include: features having a value that depends on ad rendering parameters (such as selection rate, conversion rate, offer for impression, offer for selection, offer for conversion, ad size (absolute or relative), ad style (absolute or relative), ad layout, etc).
- an example of an optimization problem may be defined as maximizing a weighted combination of the feature values for an advertisement relative to the size of the ad.
- the number of features, constraints, and calculations that may be involved in such a constrained optimization function may be very large and complex. Therefore, standard methods of solving such problems (e.g., linear programming, non-linear programming, integer programming, simulated annealing, etc.) can be used as appropriate (depending on the sort of additional constraints used).
- a simple constrained optimization problem will be described in ⁇ 4.4 below.
- FIG. 5 is high-level block diagram of a machine 500 that may perform one or more of the operations discussed above.
- the machine 500 basically includes one or more processors 510 , one or more input/output interface units 530 , one or more storage devices 520 , and one or more system buses and/or networks 540 for facilitating the communication of information among the coupled elements.
- One or more input devices 532 and one or more output devices 534 may be coupled with the one or more input/output interfaces 530 .
- the one or more processors 510 may execute machine-executable instructions (e.g., C or C++ running on the Solaris operating system available from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. or the Linux operating system widely available from a number of vendors such as Red Hat, Inc. of Durham, N.C.) to perform one or more aspects of the present invention. At least a portion of the machine executable instructions may be stored (temporarily or more permanently) on the one or more storage devices 520 and/or may be received from an external source via one or more input interface units 530 .
- machine-executable instructions e.g., C or C++ running on the Solaris operating system available from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. or the Linux operating system widely available from a number of vendors such as Red Hat, Inc. of Durham, N.C.
- the machine 500 may be one or more conventional personal computers.
- the processing units 510 may be one or more microprocessors.
- the bus 540 may include a system bus.
- the storage devices 520 may include system memory, such as read only memory (ROM) and/or random access memory (RAM).
- the storage devices 520 may also include a hard disk drive for reading from and writing to a hard disk, a magnetic disk drive for reading from or writing to a (e.g., removable) magnetic disk, and an optical disk drive for reading from or writing to a removable (magneto-) optical disk such as a compact disk or other (magneto-) optical media.
- a user may enter commands and information into the personal computer through input devices 532 , such as a keyboard and pointing device (e.g., a mouse) for example.
- Other input devices such as a microphone, a joystick, a game pad, a satellite dish, a scanner, or the like, may also (or alternatively) be included.
- These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit(s) 510 through an appropriate interface 530 coupled to the system bus 540 .
- the output devices 534 may include a monitor or other type of display device, which may also be connected to the system bus 540 via an appropriate interface.
- the personal computer may include other (peripheral) output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers for example.
- rendering parameters e.g., styles, sizes, and/or layouts (e.g., yellow page-like layouts)
- embodiments consistent with the present invention could be used for determining the layout of news stories. For example, the amount of space and size of the font for the news headline could be controlled by a similar method.
- embodiments consistent with the present invention could be refined to support the creation of dynamic yellow book-like pages that work with concept-targeted ads rather than keyword-targeted ads. For instance, if a user conducts a search on the key-word “plumbers”, instead of just providing a list of plumbers, it could also provide a list of hardware stores.
- the invention may be able to further refine the optimized ad sizes and layout by using a variety of optimization algorithms (VLSI layout, stochastic search, dynamic programming, etc.) to determine placement alternatives and may further refine the weights used in the optimization over time, using ad selection rate for different media, different locations, and/or different classes of users.
- VLSI layout stochastic search, dynamic programming, etc.
- Another refinement can be to provide constraints as to how ads with different sizes and shapes can be mixed with respect to one another, thereby preventing a layout that is jumbled (e.g., due to too many sizes on the layout, ad size set discontinuities, etc.). For instance, once sizes for each ad are determined by the methods discussed earlier, the invention can then quantize the ads as necessary to fit the “closest” available ad size. Such quantization can be incorporated into the original optimization problem through additional constraints.
- FIGS. 6-8 illustrate exemplary candidate layouts for displaying yellow page-like ads, used to illustrate exemplary operations in an exemplary embodiment of the invention.
- FIGS. 6-8 serve as layout constraints to an optimization problem since only three (3) ads can be displayed on each layout, and each ad must fit to one of the spaces defined in a layout.
- each ad will have a size of one third of the total allotted space allowed for ads.
- each ad could be sized to fit in any of the three (3) divided spaces.
- one (1) of the ads could have a size of one half, while the other two (2) ads would have a size of one fourth.
- each ad could be sized to fit in any of three (3) divided spaces.
- one of the ads could have a size of two thirds, while the other two (2) ads would have a size of one sixth.
- the optimization problem concerns maximizing a constrained function of weighted combinations of feature values for an advertisement relative to the size of the ad.
- the feature values from these advertisers are distance and CTR (click-through rate) and are represented by the following:
- distance refers to the distance from the user to the advertised location and CTR refers to the click-through rate of the ad. No units are shown for values of distance since they serve no significance for this illustration (they could be miles, kilometers, etc). Also note that the click-through rate is a linear function of the size of the ad which is the variable to be optimized.
- ⁇ is an index of ads
- ⁇ is an index of features
- ⁇ is an index of conditions
- ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( size_ ⁇ ) 1 size_ ⁇ ⁇ 1 ⁇ , ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ [ 1 , 3 ]
- each ad must fit to one of the divided spaces from a layout.
- weight_ ⁇ denotes the weight of the ⁇ th feature of an ad
- Feature_val_ ⁇ denotes the value of the ⁇ th feature for the ad
- size_ ⁇ denotes the size of an ad.

- weight_val — 1 a function that decreases values as the distance between the user and the advertised location increases.
- weight function may be: weight
- weight_ ⁇ 1 30 ( distance + 0.5 ) .
- This weight function will be assigned to Feature_val — 1 and will be used in this example.
- the reward_ ⁇ included in the optimization problem denotes a reward given for satisfying condition ⁇ .
- the reward values and their respective conditions can be represented by the function_satisfied_ ⁇ which indicates the degree to which condition ⁇ is satisfied.
- the rewards are defined as follows:
- advertiser — 1 gets an ad space value of two thirds of the total layout space
- advertiser — 2 gets an ad space value of one sixth of the total layout space
- advertiser — 3 gets an ad space of one sixth of the total layout space.
- the present invention can be used to improve ads by optimizing the size and/or layout of a set of ads.
Abstract
Description
- Advertiser—1: Macy's
- Distance: 0.1
- CTR: 0.05*size of ad
- Advertiser—2: Nordstrom
- Distance: 0.3
- CTR: 0.03*size of ad
- Advertiser—3: Target
- Distance: 0.9
- CTR: 0.06*size of ad
- Feature_val—1=Distance
- Feature_val—2=CTR
This weight function will be assigned to Feature_val—1 and will be used in this example. The weight given to Feature_val—2 which refers to the click-through weight of an ad will be defined as a constant specifically, weight—2=100.
-
- γ=1(refers to advertiser—1)
- If size—1≧0.5, then reward—1=5 else reward—1=0.
- γ=2(refers to advertiser—2)
- If size—2≧0.25, then reward—2=3 else reward—2=0.
- γ=3(refers to advertiser—3)
- If size—3≧⅓, then reward—3=4 else reward—3=0.
