Definitions
- the invention relates generally to the field of video processing, and more particularly to an apparatus and method of estimating optical flow, including motion estimation and analysis of video and multimedia content.
- Determining optical flow or image motion is important to computer vision and image processing. Accurate and efficient motion field estimation is meaningful for general video processing and applications, such as motion compensation coding of digital TV, noise reduction for video sequences, frame rate conversion and target tracking. Motion field estimation is also important for computer vision and human vision, such as for the recovery of 3-D motion and the structure of moving objects, and image registration.
- motion field estimation is particularly useful in MPEG video data compression.
- One of the main techniques to achieve high compression relies on accurately determining blocks of each frame that are in motion. Data describing the motion for only those blocks in the video determined to be in motion are encoded in the video stream between frames. This results in memory and bandwidth savings.
- Optical flow is typically represented as a motion vector field that is a pixel-by-pixel map of image motion from one image frame to the next image frame.
- Each pixel in the frame has a motion vector that defines a matching pixel in the next or previous frame.
- the combination of these motion vectors is the motion vector field.
- Occlusion by definition, means that part of the image cannot find a matching part in another image which corresponds to the same part of the scene. That part of the image was occluded from one image frame to the next. Occlusion appears quite often in real-world images when, for example, one object moves in front of another object, an object moves toward the camera, or an object rotates. If only two frames are used, there may be difficulty in obtaining a good estimate of motions with occlusion because, for at least some parts of one image, there is no corresponding image part in the other image.
- FIG. 1 a video frame is depicted.
- Each rectangle portion corresponds to a respectively different image component which is preferably a pixel or group of pixels.
- the pixels may be referenced by x and y values respectively.
- Each pixel may have a value that is preferably represented by an intensity value E(x,y,t) in the image plane at time t.
- the horizontal location of the pixel is represented by ‘x’ and is preferably numbered between 1 and a maximum value illustrated in this example as ‘a’.
- the vertical location of the pixel is represented by ‘y’ and is preferably numbered between 1 and a maximum value as illustrated here as ‘b’.
- Time is represented as ‘t’.
- the image in FIG. 1 is shown having contrasting central and surrounding parts for clarity in the description.
- FIG. 2 illustrates how a video sequence may be made from a series of successive video frames. Each frame is shown sequentially as time ‘t’ increases. In the present invention, motion is preferably analyzed between a series of adjacent frames.
- a motion vector field 300 such as that shown in FIG. 3 is generated. In this motion vector field, all vector elements are zero, indicating no motion in the image.
- FIG. 4A a central image area 404 moves to the position of a central image area 402 , as indicated by the broken-line box in a field of observation 400 between a current frame and a next frame.
- FIG. 4B shows a motion vector field generated from the frames, one containing the area 404 and the other containing the area 402 .
- a motion vector for each pixel in the area indicates that the pixel has moved in the direction of the motion.
- the following is a mathematical derivation for generating data values representing a motion vector field from other data values representing individual picture elements (pixels) of two or more images.
- E(x,y,t) denote the image brightness of the point (x,y) in the image plane at time t.
- ⁇ c and ⁇ s 2 are the global smoothness and the constant intensity constraints respectively with a relative weighting factor ⁇ 2 .
- u x , u y , v x , and v y denote the partial derivatives of the u and v, with respect to x and y.
- ⁇ 2 u and ⁇ 2 v are the Laplacian of u and v, respectively and may be approximated by ⁇ 2 v ⁇ ( ⁇ overscore (v) ⁇ v) and ⁇ 2 u ⁇ ( ⁇ overscore (u) ⁇ u), where ⁇ overscore (u) ⁇ , and ⁇ overscore (v) ⁇ denote the local average of u and v, respectively.
- E x , E y and E t are the partial derivatives of E in respect to x, y and t at (x,y,t) respectively.
- the notation ⁇ contains the second and higher order terms in u, v, and T. Eliminating ⁇ and combining Eq. 1 with, Eq. 6 leads to the well-known prior art optical flow constraint as shown in equation 7.
- One advantage of the invention is in more accurately and efficiently processing consecutive video frames to determine the motion of objects in video frames and output a representation of that motion as an image motion vector field, wherein each component of the image vector field represents a pixel or group of pixels of a frame.
- Another advantage of this invention is in migrating an observation point gradually, according to current motion estimates.
- Yet a further advantage of this invention is within the inventive methodology in its capability of handling motion discontinuities.
- an apparatus for generating an image motion vector field which describes a motion of individual image components of a first image frame and corresponding image components of a second image frame in a sequence of image frames.
- the apparatus comprises a first frame memory for receiving the first image frame, a second frame memory for receiving a second image frame, and an optical flow calculator.
- the optical flow calculator is configured for generating an image motion vector field by iteratively comparing a predicted image with the second image frame.
- the predicted image is generated according to a current motion estimate in proximity to an observation point, wherein the observation point migrates according to a previous motion estimate and is implemented by the calculator to generate a current motion estimate.
- the optical flow calculator includes a gradient estimator configured to define a gradient function which approximates an image gradient value by performing an averaging function on motion estimates at a plurality of individual image component locations determined by the current motion estimate.
- the optical flow calculator includes a motion estimator configured to define a motion estimate function which approximates a velocity adjustment value by applying a motion function to gradient estimates at a plurality of individual gradient estimate locations determined by the current motion estimate.
- optical flow calculator includes a motion estimate averager configured to define a motion estimate averaging function which averages motion values at a plurality of motion estimate component locations determined by the current motion estimate.
- the averager applies a weighting function component to control outlier rejection of individual motion estimates being averaged.
- an image motion vector field is generated comprising the steps of receiving a first image frame having individual image components with intensity values, receiving a second image frame having corresponding image components with intensity values, initializing motion estimates, generating image motion vectors, and outputting the image motion vector field.
- the image motion vectors are iteratively generated by estimating image gradients in proximity to observation points; generating other motion estimates as the motion estimates, averaging the motion estimates; migrating the observation points according to the motion estimates, generating a predicted image frame according to the motion estimates and the first memory frame, calculating residual errors by taking a difference between the predicted image and the second image frame, determining if the residual error for each image component is less than a predetermined threshold, and accordingly if the motion estimate for the image component has converged, and ending the iterations for each motion estimate that has converged.
- the present invention calculates optical flow, resulting in improved estimates over the prior art and an ability to cope with larger motion.
- the observation point of the Taylor's series expansion of the intensity function preferably moves in accordance with the current motion estimates.
- An local outlier rejection mechanism whose observation point of also preferably moves in accordance with the current motion estimates may then be utilized to handle motion discontinuities in the flow field, significantly reducing the motion compensated mean squared error (MSE) and effectively improving the near motion boundaries observation point estimates.
- MSE motion compensated mean squared error
- Local outlier rejection results in an effective means of sharpening the motion boundaries, which often are blurred due to the global smoothness constraint.
- this new concept offers faster and better convergence and capability to handle a larger degree of motion, effectively reducing the motion compensated intensity difference and motion error.
- this concept may be readily adapted to many optical flow methods and apparatus.

- FIG. 9B is a drawing showing gradient operators used in an example of the present invention.
- the apparatus comprises a first frame memory for receiving the first image frame, a second frame memory for receiving a second image frame, and an optical flow calculator.
- the optical flow calculator is configured for generating an image motion vector field by iteratively comparing a predicted image with the second image frame.
- the predicted image is generated according to a current motion estimate in proximity to an observation point, wherein the observation point migrates according to a previous motion estimate and is implemented by the calculator to generate a current motion estimate.
- the prior art fails to handle a relatively large degree of motion, because for the majority of images the higher order derivatives of the intensity function are not all zero, therefore, the first-order approximation in Eq. 6 and 7 may no longer lead to good motion estimates when the motion is large.
- a second reason comes from an intrinsic local minimum problem from a gradient-based approach. When the motion is large, the initial condition may be too far away from the true solution. In searching for the solution, the optimization process may get stuck at a local minimum and the estimate may not be improved further.
- the value (u,v) may be denoted to be the actual image velocity, or the displacement vector from time t to t+T, and (u n , v n ) the current estimate after the n-th iteration.
- each iteration improves the estimates of the flow field (i.e.,
- the present invention compares the predicted image, E(x+u n ,y+v n ,t+T), with the reference image E(x,y,t), in order to improve the current estimates in the next iteration.
- E x n , E y n are the partial derivatives at (x+u n ,y+v n ,t+T).
- ⁇ ′ contains the second and higher order terms in ⁇ u and ⁇ v. As the estimate preferably approaches the true solution and the optimization process proceeds, ⁇ u and ⁇ v becomes smaller and smaller. This means that the higher order terms represented by ⁇ ′ also becomes smaller.
- FIG. 8A shows the gradient operators used in the original Horn and Schunck's paper.
- FIG. 8B shows the gradient operators used in an embodiment of the present invention.
- the prior art of Horn and Schunck suggest to estimate E x , E y , and E t at the point in the center of a cube formed by eight measurements defined as follows.
- an embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in FIG. 8 uses different gradient operators since they offer a less biased approximation of the gradient function.
- the gradients are approximated considering a 4 neighbor system. Following the original formulation, they are defined as follows. E x ⁇ 1 4 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ E ⁇ ⁇ ( x + 1 , y , t ) - E ⁇ ⁇ ( x - 1 , y , t ) + E ⁇ ⁇ ( x + 1 , y , t + 1 ) - E ⁇ ⁇ ( x - 1 , y , t + 1 ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ E y ⁇ 1 4 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ E ⁇ ⁇ ( x , y + 1 , t ) - E ⁇ ⁇ ( x , y - 1 , t ) + E ⁇ ⁇ ( x , y + 1 , t + 1 ) - E ⁇ ⁇
- E x , E y , and E d n preferably depends on the current motion estimates (û, ⁇ circumflex over (v) ⁇ ).
- bilinear interpolation is preferably used to approximate the image gradient at non-grid locations. Bilinear interpolation of the image gradient may offer much better convergence compared with nearest neighbor approximation.
- the five-point average that is often used for computing E d n may provide some pre-filtering effect.
- Such pre-filtering has been shown to improve Horn and Schunck's prior art. Under our new formulation, on the contrary, this pre-filtering would actually slow down the convergence.
- Eq. 10a to directly compute E d n excludes the unnecessary smoothing effect, and thus leading to a much smaller ⁇ ⁇ and an even faster convergence.
- outlier rejection refers to the mechanism to exclude data which does not fit into the underlying model.
- a decision function may be global or local, binary or probabilistic, error-based or rank-based.
- a global decision function applies a criterion globally in the data domain to reject the potential outlier.
- a local decision function adapts itself to the local error characteristics.
- the decision-making scheme may be categorized as binary (hard) or probabilistic (soft). Comparing between error-based and rank-based schemes, a rank-based decision function may tend to adapt better to the characteristics of the error function, but often with a higher computation cost.
- the present invention preferably adopts a local, binary, and rank-based decision function that is detailed here.
- the outlier rejection mechanism may be naturally carried out by changing the way that the local motion averages, ⁇ overscore (u) ⁇ and ⁇ overscore (v) ⁇ , are calculated, by discarding the outlier in the neighborhood.
- the local motion average depends on all the neighbors in the pre-defined neighborhood.
- u _ ⁇ ( x i ) ⁇ x j ⁇ N ⁇ ( x i ) ⁇ ⁇ u ⁇ ( x j ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( x j ) ⁇ x j ⁇ N ⁇ ( x i ) ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( x j ) ( 14 )
- ⁇ (x j ) is the weight for neighbor x j , x j ⁇ N(x i ).
- MDS motion difference square
- Equation 15 is a function of the motion similarity measure between two neighboring pixels. Depending on whether g takes a binary or continuous form, a hard or soft decision mechanism may be designed.
- a hard decision approach may preferably define g to be a binary function, which either accepts or rejects a particular neighbor, using a thresholding technique.
- ⁇ tilde over (d) ⁇ r denote the r-th rank (in ascending order) of the ordered MDS in the neighborhood: ⁇ d(x i , x j ), x j ⁇ N(x i ) ⁇ , i.e., ⁇ tilde over (d) ⁇ 0 ⁇ . . . ⁇ tilde over (d) ⁇
- g g ⁇ ⁇ ( x i , x j ) ⁇ 1 if ⁇ ⁇ d ⁇ ⁇ ( x i , x j ) ⁇ T or ⁇ ⁇ d ⁇ r , x j ⁇ N ⁇ ⁇ ( x i ) 0 otherwise ⁇ ( 16 )
- the present invention is a significant improvement over the prior art.
- the integrated outlier rejection (OR) also provides an effective means to further improvements as evidenced by a more accurate motion field and a smaller MSE.
- the outlier rejection routine is not imposed in order to refine the estimates near motion boundaries until the motion estimates have converged under global smoothness.
- the OR is effective for sharpening the motion boundaries. The motion boundary is much more apparent, especially near the forearm of the player, when the outlier rejection is used for final refinement.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a motion detection apparatus 500 which may be used to generate motion vector fields in accordance with the present invention.
- This apparatus 500 preferably accepts a video sequence 502 as input.
- the video sequence 502 takes two separate routes.
- a first route preferably takes the video sequence 502 through a frame delay device 506 to a first frame memory 512 .
- a second route preferably takes the video sequence to a second frame memory 514 .
- the first memory frame 512 and the second frame memory 514 provide their respective frames to an optical flow calculator 508 .
- the optical flow calculator 508 then preferably processes a pair of images from the video sequence 502 as previously described and outputs an image motion vector field 510 , which describes any motion that may have occurred between the frames.
- motion detection apparatus 500 is shown as receiving two frames of data, it is contemplated that, in a steady state operation, only one new frame of data may be applied to the apparatus 500 at any given time.
- Data located in frame memory 514 may simply be moved to delayed frame memory 512 thereby becoming the first frame when the frame memories are moved to the optical flow calculator.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an optical flow calculator 600 in accordance with the present invention.
- the optical flow calculator an optical flow calculator generates an image motion vector field 660 by iteratively comparing a predicted image with a reference image.
- the predicted image is generated according to a current motion estimate around an observation point.
- the observation point migrates according to a previous motion estimate and is used to generate a new current motion estimate.
- the optical flow calculator 600 includes a controller 602 , a memory 610 , a gradient estimator 620 , a motion estimator 630 , a motion estimate averager 640 , an outlier switch 642 , a image predictor 650 and a convergence checker 660 .
- a controller 602 controls the optical flow calculator 600 to generate the image motion vector field 670 from a first image frame 602 a the second image frame 604 .
- the memory 610 includes a first frame memory 612 which preferably accepts as input the first image frame 602 , and a second frame memory 614 which preferably accepts as input the second image frame 604 .
- the memory 610 may also include locations to hold variables such as iteration counts, iteration thresholds, weighting parameters, and current estimates for use in assisting the controller 602 in controlling the operation of the optical flow calculator 600 .
- the image frames contained in the first frame memory 612 and the second frame memory 614 are made up of a plurality of image components, each image component represented by an intensity value. Each image component may be a pixel or group of pixels.
- the optical flow calculator 600 controller may initialize several variables at the beginning of each image component calculation including the iteration count, the initial motion estimate, and the outlier rejection weighting values.
- the gradient estimator 620 inputs intensity values from the first and second frame memories to calculate a gradient estimate.
- the points used are determined in part by the previous estimate. Equation 13 describes the calculation.
- the gradient estimate output from the gradient estimator is inputted to the motion estimator 630 which calculates the adjusted velocity ( ⁇ u and ⁇ v) for the iteration as described by equation 11.
- the motion estimates are averaged by the motion estimate averager 640 .
- the motion estimate averager is configured to execute equation 14 which performs a local average of the velocity estimates around the neighborhood.
- An outlier rejector switch 642 may switch the mode of the motion estimate averager 640 to input outlier weighting values and reconfigure the motion estimate averager 640 to execute equation 15 instead of equation 14. Equation 15 adds a weighting function that controls the outlier rejection. This switch may normally be made after the convergence detector 660 has detected convergence or after a predetermined number of iterations.
- the output of the motion estimate averager 640 is input to the image reconstructor 650 which will create a predicted image around the point of interest based on the first frame memory and the predicted motion vector using motion compensation.
- the convergence checker 660 will then compare this image with the values stored in the second frame memory 614 and determine if the error is below a predetermined threshold value. If the image converges before the outlier rejection is implemented, then the convergence detector 660 informs the controller that the iterations need to continue, but that optical flow calculator 600 needs to switch into an outlier rejection mode.
- the image motion vector is output to the image motion vector field 670 and the process will continue to the next image component until all of the image components in the frame memories 612 and 614 have been processed.
- FIG. 7 is a flow-chart diagram which illustrates the operation of the optical flow calculator 508 in an exemplary embodiment of the invention.
- the process begins at step S 702 where a second image frame is input to the optical flow calculator 508 .
- a first image frame is input to the optical flow calculator 508 .
- the first frame is delayed such that the second frame represents a frame from video sequence 502 that is later in time than the first frame by delta time T.
- a pixel pointer that points to the pixels in each frame is initialized at step S 706 .
- An estimate of current pixel motion is made at step S 708 .
- step S 712 a determination is made as to whether the whole image has been analyzed.
- step S 716 the pixel pointer is incremented and the method then resumes at step S 708 . If the whole image has been analyzed, then at step S 714 a determination is made as to whether all frames in the sequence have been analyzed. If not, then the image stored in the first memory frame is moved to the second memory frame and the process resumes at step S 704 . If at step S 714 , it is determined that all frames had been analyzed, then the process is complete.
- FIG. 8 is a flow-chart diagram which illustrates an aspect of an exemplary embodiment of the invention that calculates a motion vector for an image component of a first and second image frame.

- the results of this calculation are used at step S 806 where a motion estimate is made using equation 13, which was previously described.
- an average motion estimate is performed on the data at step S 808 .
- Step S 808 is initially configured to perform equation 14 which was previously described, and will continue to perform this equation until reconfigured.
- Step S 810 generates a predicted image based on the first image frame and the current motion estimate.
- a determination is made as to whether a predetermined number of iterations ‘c 1 ’ or if the current motion estimate has converged.
- the predicted image is compared with a reference image to see if it's difference is less than a predetermined threshold value. If the determination at step S 812 is positive, then processing proceeds to step S 814 where step S 808 is reconfigured to perform equation 15 which has been previously described, after which processing proceeds to step S 816 .
- step S 816 a determination is made as whether the number of iterations has past a second predetermined value ‘c 2 ’ or of the image has converged. If the determination at step S 814 is positive, then processing stops and the present estimate may be used as the image vector for this image component. If the determination at step S 816 is negative, then processing proceeds to step S 818 where the iteration counter ‘i’ is incremented. Finally execution is passed back to step S 804 to perform another iteration.
