There is many dissimilar sensors and sensor output.Usually, sensor export to the parameter of some types, machine state, structural state, computing mode or physical environment parameter directly or indirectly relevant.Fig. 9 illustrates the general characteristic that sensor exports.As shown in Figure 90 of first in Fig. 92, sensor can export the signal (representing with curve 904) along with time variations, and this signal and the parameter P drawn about the longitudinal axis 906 are directly or indirectly relevant.Sensor can continuously or compartment of terrain output signal, the time of output draws about transverse axis 908.In some cases, sensor output can be relevant to two or more parameters.Such as, in Figure 91 0, the parameter P that sensor output value is different from two in time
1and P
2directly or be indirectly correlated with, parameter P
1with parameter P
2be draw about axle 912 and axle 914 respectively, the time draws about the longitudinal axis 916.In the following discussion, for the purpose of simplifying the description and discuss, suppose sensor generation and single parameter directly or indirectly relevant output, as in Figure 90 2 in fig .9.In the following discussion, suppose that sensor exports as one group of parameter value for parameter P.This parameter can be relevant to ambient conditions, and ambient conditions is such as temperature, ambient light levels, sound level and other this class feature.But this parameter also can be one or more positions of machine part, the pressure of memory storage address data mode in a data storage device, the flow rate of electric current, gas or fluid of drawing from power supply, gas or fluid and comprise the parameter of other types many of the useful information for controlling object.
Figure 10 A-Figure 10 D illustrates intelligent controller handled information with producing during control operation.All these illustrate the figure of the Figure 90 2 be similar in Fig. 9, wherein, about the value of longitudinal axis rendering parameter or the value of another group relevant controlling, draw the time about transverse axis.Figure 10 A illustrates the idealized specification of the result for controlled entity operation.The longitudinal axis 1002 in Figure 10 A represents the parameter value P specified
s.Such as, when intelligent thermostat, this parameter value of specifying can be temperature.By contrast, for irrigation system, this parameter value of specifying can be flow velocity.Figure 10 A is the figure of the parameter value continuous curve 1004 in time representing expectation, and the parameter value that intelligent controller tends to be expected by these realizes the control to one or more equipment, machine or system.This this parameter value of specification indicative of desired is initially low 1006, then rises to relatively high value 1008, then drops to intermediate value 1010, rise to high value 1012 more afterwards.Control specification and visually can be displayed to user, as an example, be shown as Control and Schedule.
Set point change can be stored as the record with multiple field, and whether multiple field comprises field that whether instruction set point change is the set point that the set point that produces of system or user produce, instruction set point change is the field of the set point change of instant control inputs or the set point change of scheduling, the field of time and date of the establishment of instruction set point change, the field of the time and date of the last editor of instruction set point change and other this kind of field.In addition, set point can be associated with two or more parameter values.As an example, range set point can the scope of indication parameter value, and within the scope of this, intelligent controller should keep controlled environment.Set point change is commonly called " set point ".
Figure 10 B illustrates another view of the Control and Schedule corresponding to the control specification shown in Figure 10 A or the view of coded data.Control and Schedule comprises the parameter value increase 1016 corresponding to the edge 1018 in Figure 10 A, the parameter value reduction 1020 corresponding to the edge 1022 in Figure 10 A and increases the instruction of 1024 corresponding to the parameter value at the edge 1016 in Figure 10 A.The direction arrow drawn in Figure 10 B can be regarded as set point change, or the instruction of the expectation Parameters variation at particular point in time place within certain period.
Figure 10 C illustrates the control that intelligent controller exports, and it can come from the Control and Schedule shown in Figure 10 B.In detail in this figure, the amplitude exporting control signal is drawn about the longitudinal axis 1026.Such as, controlling to export can be the voltage signal exported to heating unit by intelligent thermostat, and high voltage signal indicates that heating unit is current should operate, and low voltage signal indicates heating system should not operate.Edge 1028 in Figure 10 C corresponds to the set point 1016 in Figure 10 B.The width of positive control output 1030 can be relevant with the length of the parameter value variation expected or amplitude, indicated by the length of set point arrow 1016.When obtaining the parameter value expected, intelligent controller does not continue output HIGH voltage signal, as represented with edge 1032.Set point 1020 in Figure 10 B and set point 1024 cause similar positive output control signal 1034 and export control signal 1036.
Finally, Figure 10 D illustrate observe as come from intelligent controller the sensor of the control of one or more controlled entity exported indicated by Parameters variation.In figure 10d, draw directly or indirectly relevant to parameter P sensor about the longitudinal axis 1040 to export.The level and smooth continuous curve 1042 of the parameter value observed represents.Although this continuous curve can be regarded as relevant with the initial specifications curve drawn in Figure 10 A, the curve of observation inaccurately mates this specification curve.First, the controlled entity parameter value variation representated by set point 1016 that limited a period of time 1044 may be spent to realize in Control and Schedule drawn in fig. 1 ob.And once obtain parameter value and controlled entity tends to discontinuous operation, then parameter value can start to decline 1046, form the control starting feedback and export with the operation recovering controlled entity, to keep the parameter value of expectation.Therefore, the senior constant parameter value 1008 of the expectation in Figure 10 A in fact may terminate with time dependent curve 1048, and this time dependent curve 1048 inaccurately corresponds to and controls specification 1004.Intelligent controller uses the above first order feedback discussed with reference to Fig. 8 to control one or more controlled entity, makes the parameter value observed in time as shown in Figure 10 D mate the time behavior of specifying of the parameter in Figure 10 A as closely as possible.The second level feedback control loop discussed with reference to Fig. 8 above can relate to the change of the specification that user carries out in time, as shown in Figure 10 A, utilize the change to the Control and Schedule stored, the input of instant steering order is utilized, to generate the specification of amendment, the specification of this amendment produces the parameter value/time curve of the operating result that reflection user expects.
There is eurypalynous controlled entity and the controller be associated perhaps.In some cases, control to export the instruction that can comprise the current instruction that whether should operate of controlled entity and the rank operated when controlled entity operate, handling capacity or output.In other cases, control output and can be only binary activation/deactivation signal.For the purpose of simplifying the description and discuss, in discussion hereafter, after hypothesis, a kind of control exports.
Figure 11 illustrates distributed control environment.The intelligent controller discussed above with reference to Fig. 4-Fig. 8 is discussed under the background of the single controller in environment, this environment comprise by intelligent controller control system or be operated in by intelligent controller control system on.But, as shown in figure 11, multiple intelligent controller 1102-1104 can control to be operated in multiple intelligent controller together and to be positioned at wherein or by one or more systems environmentally of multiple intelligent controller Long-distance Control, in some implementations, multiple intelligent controller 1102-1104 cooperates with remote computing system 1106.As discussed further below, multiple energy controller can to have control distribution and the one or more system of Cooperation controlling of various degree.Usually, indicated by the double-headed arrow (such as double-headed arrow 1108) in Figure 11, in each intelligent controller and multiple intelligent controller, remaining intelligent controller exchanges data, and all intelligent controllers and remote computing system exchange data.In some cases, a controller in multiple controller or the subset in multiple controller are used as the local router or bridge that represent remaining intelligent controller in multiple intelligent controller, thus being sent to the data of Intelligent target controller or target remote computing system from the first intelligent controller and message can be transferred to the second intelligent controller and be forwarded by the second intelligent controller, this second intelligent controller is used as the router or bridge of going to target.
Figure 12 illustrates the sensing that is associated with each controller in group multiple controller of in environment and infers region.In fig. 12, the environment controlled by multiple controller represents by peripheral dashed rectangle 1202.This environment comprises three controller 1204-1206.In some implementations, this environment comprises the sensor carrying out with corresponding remote intelligent controller communicating, but not intelligent controller.In this discussion, in order to simplified characterization, intelligent controller is discussed as the environment being positioned at it and controlling, but before indicated by statement, they can be positioned at outside its environment controlled physically.Each controller uses one or more sensor to carry out receiving sensor and exports, and this sensor exports and allows controller directly measurement or the characteristic of testing environment or parameter in the region of direct perception.Region for the direct perception of controller c1 1204 is shown the border circular areas 1208 being drawn as shade with oblique line.With the region of the direct perception of controller c3, the border circular areas 1210 and 1212 becoming shade with line drawing is shown respectively similarly for controller c2.In environment in fig. 12, each controller can be responsible for characteristic and the parameter of the characteristic of direct measurement environment in sensing region and parameter or deduction measurement environment.In fig. 12, the sensing region dotted line of three controllers indicates and comprises the region of corresponding direct perception.Such as, for the sensing region of controller c2 by ambient boundary 1202 and dotted line 1214-1217 limited boundary.Visible in fig. 12, can be overlapping corresponding to the region of the direct perception of different controller and sensing region.Such as, represent with the region of the direct perception that controller c1 1204 and controller c3 1206 are associated with the region 1220 that two-wire is drawn as shade overlapping.Similarly, with the region representation of phantom line segments 1222-1224 limited boundary and the overlapping of the sensing region that controller c1 and controller c3 are associated.
Figure 12 illustrates that the distributed AC servo system of the environment with multiple intelligent controller can be associated with the consideration of complexity.Intelligent controller can be responsible for sensing a part of environment, is called above " sensing region " that be associated with intelligent controller, and it exceeds the region (being called in " region of direct perception ") that intelligent controller can directly be accessed by sensor above.In order to provide the control about sensing region determine needed for variously to determine, intelligent controller can use various rule and different technologies that the determination exported based on sensor is extended to larger sensing region.When intelligent controller comprises multiple sensor, the various determination having probability of inconsistent execution that this intelligent controller also can export about the sensor of multiple sensor, and can utilize continuously from sensor export the environmental characteristics of inferring and parameter independently determine calibrate and verificating sensor data.When overlapping with the region of the sensing region that multiple controller is associated and direct perception, distributed AC servo system can comprise adopt multiple controller to carry out multiple and determine and the determination managed conflict.In many cases, controller based on this controller can the deduction carried out of incomplete sensing data can utilize the supplementary data of the determination provided about its intelligent controller to strengthen.
Figure 13 illustrates the control field in the environment that controls by multiple intelligent controller.In the environment shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13, each intelligent controller in three intelligent controller 1204-1206 is associated with control field (becoming shade to indicate with line drawing).In the example depicted in fig. 13, three the control field 1302-1304 be associated with intelligent controller 1204-1206 are respectively rectangular shapes.Overlapping in the region 1308 that the first two-wire is drawn as shade with the control field that intelligent controller c1 1204 and intelligent controller c3 1206 are associated, and overlapping in the region 1310 that the second double line is drawn as shade with the control field that intelligent controller c2 1205 and intelligent controller c3 1206 are associated.
Complicacy is also added to the distributed AC servo system of multiple intelligent controller to environment by the concept of control field.Intelligent controller uses and controls from the information (comprising Control and Schedule, the sensing data of history and the history of environmental characteristics and parameter to determine) of sensing data to the various characteristic of environment and the determination of parameter and Electronic saving characteristic and parameter that one or more system provides expectation in the control field be associated with intelligent controller intelligently.But, because control field can be overlapping and because the direct control that can not be undertaken by the control to one or more system by any intelligent controller of a part of environment (region 1312 in such as Figure 13), so the distributed AC servo system carrying out many complexity determines and considers many balances, so that at the distributed AC servo system environmentally providing intelligence.As an example, intelligent controller c1 and intelligent controller c3 controls its each control field with can terminating some non-optimal, so that in the overlapping region 1308 preventing unacceptable characteristic and parameter value from appearing between their control field.In addition, because control field strictly can not have equivalents with sensing region, the part that complicated control determines indirectly to control environment outside each control field can therefore be carried out.
In Figure 12 and Figure 13, the region of direct perception, sensing region and control field are shown the region in environment.In some Based Intelligent Control problem domain, the region of direct perception, sensing region and control field can be that larger environment holds Nei Zirong district of district.Such as, can describe individual layer house fully by the multiple regions in total residence area, and multilayer apratment building may need to consider compared with the multiple Zi Rong districts in great Rong district, it comprises all apartments in multilayer apratment building.Illustrate in order to simplify and facilitate and discuss, in the following discussion, adopt the area view of Based Intelligent Control but not hold district's view.
The application relates to intelligent controller, this intelligent controller senses the existence in sensing region that one or more dissimilar entity is associated in its environment directly or indirectly, then carry out intelligent scheduling adjustment individually or with the distributed way together with other intelligent controller and/or remote computer, and can according to one or more entity in whole environment or some partial memory of environment or disappearance carry out additional active and task.In the following discussion, as an example, the intelligent controller determining the existence of people in the environment controlled by intelligent controller is discussed.But intelligent controller can detect the existence of the entity of any other type various or disappearance and use this detection to adjust Control and Schedule or to carry out additional active.Such as, the intelligent controller in manufacturing environment can detect sub-component in automatic assembling stage or near existence, and correspondingly control automatic assembling stage upon and perform various manufacturing process.The various intelligent controller relevant to mechanical transport can detect the existence of automobile in specific region or disappearance, and correspondingly control signal lamp, suspension bridge, street lamp and/or miscellaneous equipment and system.
Detect people to exist in the environment or in a part for environment and/or the intelligent controller of disappearance usually constructs and keeps the existence probability map of continuous updating or scalar to there is probability instruction, after continuous updating is included in each new sensor reading, after the threshold level change of sensor reading, according to the interval of rule, after timer expiry or after field is interrupted, or based on many basic update probability figure At All Other Times or scalar instruction.Then use existence probability map or scalar instruction according to people's being subject to the existence in the region of intelligent controller control or disappearance adjustment Control and Schedule and starting any various control operation in whole environment or at environment.Noting, " there is probability " and can refer to the probability that is present in region or holds the one or more entities in district or from region or the probability of one or more entities holding district's disappearance, be equivalent to the polarity exchanging probability interval [0,1] in phrase.
There is probabilistic information in what Figure 14 A-Figure 14 C illustrated various Electronic savings in one or more intelligent controller and/or the addressable remote computer system of one or more intelligent controller.Figure 14 A illustrates the existence probability map in the region for the environment be associated with intelligent controller.In the example shown in Figure 14 A, region 1402 is rectangle, and the coordinate of Descartes (Cartesian) coordinate system of the some rectangle in region describes, and this coordinate system comprises x-axis 1404 and y-axis 1406.The longitudinal axis 1408 represents that people is present in the probability P (x, y) at position (x, the y) place in region 1402.Usually, in grid-like mode, this Region dividing can be become the subregion of the minimum particle size of two-dimensional array, such as subregion 1410.There are for non-zero those subregions that probability correlation joins, the height indicator of the cylinder risen from subregion is leted others have a look at the current probability being present in this subregion.Therefore, in the example shown in Figure 14 A, the people had with existence probability map describes is present in the first subregion 1412 in region 1402 and the nonzero probability in the second subregion 1414.In many cases, probability graph is standardized, make the integration for the cylindrical volume of whole existence probability map can provide in scope [0,1] for whole environment accumulation there is probability.But the standardization of other type is fine, and much control is determined, do not need standardization.
Figure 14 B illustrates dissimilar existence probability map.In the existence probability map 1420 shown in Figure 14 B, represent that the rectangle 1422 of whole environment or a part of environment controlled by intelligent controller is divided into subregion 1424-1428.In this existence probability map, represent that people is present in the probability this subregion from the height 1430 of the cylinder of subregion rise.Usually, this second existence probability map is more coarse than the existence probability map granularity shown in Figure 14 A, and minimum particle size subregion is divided size or the region be positioned at regularly described by existence probability map or environment 1422 regularly.As an example, the existence probability map of the type may be used for residential environment, and every sub regions corresponds to a room in house.
Usually, as above indicated by, intelligent controller keeps existence probability map in the past along with the time, based on the Electronic saving information of current sensor reading, history with adjust existence probability map at certain intervals from the information that remote source obtains, to reflect preferably estimation people being present in the probability in the subregion of figure.Figure 14 C illustrates the existence probability map that intelligent controller kept in the past along with the time.(comprise at each time point and be designated as t along time transverse axis 1444

In some cases, the single scalar that one or more intelligent controller can carry out the probability that people is present in whole environment is determined, and there is probable value along with the time calculates scalar at certain intervals.Figure 14 D illustrates portion of time line 1460, and the scalar of calculating exists the cylinder that probable value is shown above the time interval along this part-time line.
Intelligent controller can use in many dissimilar data that are that receive and/or Electronic saving any one construct the existence probability map and scalar value discussed above with reference to Fig. 4 A-Fig. 4 D.Figure 15 many dissimilar receptions are shown with some in the information of Electronic saving, intelligent controller can use these information to determine that people is in whole environment or in the subregion of environment or the probability that exists of some some place.In fig .15, rectangle 1502 represents intelligent controller.Unfilled circle (such as unfilled circle 1504) represents sensor.Arrow (such as arrow 1516) represents data input.Except sensing data with from the data that remote information and data source input, intelligent controller can also in the many dissimilar data 1520 of storage inside, comprise the sensing data of history, non-present there is probability scalar sum figure, the existence of people and/or the history of disappearance is determined, Control and Schedule, control inputs and other dissimilar data any.
Various types of sensors for carrying out the determination existing in the environment about people or lack comprise proximity detector 1504, passive infrared (" PIR ") motion detector 1505, the motion detector 1506 of other type, the voice detector 1507 of microphone or other type, the digital camera 1508 of charge-coupled detector(CCD) (" CCD ") or low resolution, thermoelectric pile or thermopair 1509, carbon dioxide sensor 1510, water vapor detecting device 1511, pressure transducer 1512, various types of flowmeter 1513, safety in home security system/entrance detecting device 1514, and various types of field strength sensors 1515 of sensing magnetic field and electric field.Proximity detector comprises various dissimilar sensor, comprises the sensor of capacitance type sensor, capacitive displacement transducer, conductive sensor, magnetic sensor, optical sensor, thermal sensor, sonar sensor and other type.The cataclysm of the infrared radiation detection temperature that the sensor of PIR motion detector is launched based on biology.The motion detector of other type comprises ultrasonic motion detecting device, microwave motion detecting device and tomography motion detector.Voice detector can detect various types of sound or the acoustic pattern of the existence of assignor.The camera of low resolution and CCD equipment can the changes of ambient light, comprise the change because of the surround lighting caused by mobile object.Thermoelectric pile or thermopair may be used for the change detecting the temperature relevant with the existence of other live body to people.Similarly, carbon dioxide indicator and water vapor detecting device can detect the gas that people discharges with other biology.The pressure change that pressure transducer can be caused by the motion of the switch of air detection environment internal cause door and window, large object and other this kind of pressure change.Flowmeter can detect water, rock gas and in other gas of the ACTIVE CONTROL current downflow of people and the flow rate of fluid.The entrance detecting device of various types of security system may be used for detecting occupant's entered environment or going out from environment.Field strength sensor can by the change of the relevant field intensity of environment measuring and the existence of people or the motion of people.
Intelligent controller can receive data input from the various intelligent devices (existence of assignor) in environment and monitoring position cell phone and other this kind of device 1516, receive information from various internet resource 1517 (wherein can collect existence and/or missing information), receive information from remote computer system 1518 (being such as assigned with the remote computer system of various Based Intelligent Control task and data) and various remote controllers 1519 (comprising other intelligent controller in the environment of multiple intelligent controller control).
Figure 16 illustrates the control flow chart of the operation of intelligent controller.Usually, high level intelligent controller continuously operates in the background of event handling or event loop.In step 1602, intelligent controller waits for next control event.Then when the next one control event occur with a series of conditional statement time, the type of intelligent controller determination event also calls corresponding control routine.In such as step 1604 when determined instant control event, in step 1606, intelligent controller calls instant control routine to carry out the part of the user interactions of intelligent controller, to receive one or more instant control inputs, other behavior that above-mentioned instant control inputs instructs intelligent controller initiation control signal, adjustment Control and Schedule and/or execution user to be formulated by instant control inerface.When control event is the control event of scheduling, such as when current time corresponds to the time of the execution control activity that Control and Schedule is specified, as determined in step 1608, in step 1610, call scheduling controlling routine with the control event of operation dispatching.When control event is scheduling interface event, as determined in step 1612, in step 1614, intelligent controller calls the mutual routine of scheduling to perform being inputted session by the scheduling of scheduling interface and user or dispatched the part changing session of intelligent controller.When control event is Sensor Events, as determined in step 1616, in step 1618, intelligent controller calls sensor routine and carrys out processes sensor event.Sensor Events can comprise interruption that sensor produces because of change that sensor exports, the cut-off of timer of sensing data at interval being arranged to the sensing data process waking intelligent controller up to process next scheduling and other this kind of event.When event is for existing event, as determined in step 1620, then in step 1622, intelligent controller calls exists routine.There is event and be generally timer expiry, interruption or other this kind of event, to the time, its notice intelligent controller determines that next current probability exists scalar value or constructs next current probability existence figure.Indicated by omission 1624 in figure 16, the control event of many addition type can occur and can by intelligent controller process, the various events comprising various types of error event, communication event, energising and power cut-off incident and produced by the inside setting parts of intelligent controller.
Have and how describe various different intelligent controller in response to the existence of detected people and/or the many different model of disappearance.As discussed above, during intelligent controller operation, intelligent controller is assessed various dissimilar Electronic saving data continuously and is inputted the instruction of the probability that data exist to the people in each region in the one or more regions in the environment controlled by intelligent controller upgrading storage.In a model, intelligent controller relates generally to the operation of two kinds of different conditions: (1) comes from the existence that one or more people that intelligent controller carries out are present in the determination in one or more region; (2) not existence, wherein, intelligent controller has determined that nobody is present in one or more region.
Figure 17 A-Figure 17 B illustrates the modification in the presence/absence of model.Figure 17 A illustrates simple in the presence/absence of model, and it comprises the two states for the whole sensing region be associated with controller or control field.When the probability that people is present in sensing region is elevated to higher than first threshold 1702, intelligent controller is transformed into existence 1704.When the probability that people is present in sensing region drops to lower than Second Threshold 1706, intelligent controller is transformed into not existence 1708.In this case, assess current scalar probable value or existence probability map continuously or iteratively relative to one or more threshold value, to determine current which kind of state be in two states 1704 and 1708 of intelligent controller.As seen in this fig. 17b, when intelligent controller for the multiple regions in environment carry out existing and/or lack determine time, then each region and existence and not existence be associated.In Figure 17 B, each element of column vector 1710 corresponds to zones of different, and each zones of different is associated with in the presence/absence of state transition graph, such as state transition graph 1712 and region R
11714 are associated.
Figure 18 A-Figure 18 B is provided for the state transition graph of intelligent controller, and this intelligent controller operates according to the bifurcation transition diagram shown in Figure 17 A.In Figure 18 A, each state ring (ring 1802 such as marked) of mark represents, the bending arrow (such as bending arrow 1804) of State Transferring represents.Figure 18 B provides a table, in the table, matches corresponding to the lowercase of each State Transferring in Figure 18 A and the explanation of this State Transferring.In Figure 18 A, the state of intelligent controller is mainly divided in existence and not between existence.In other words, the state transition graph of Figure 17 A be superimposed on intelligent controller state transition graph on to produce existence and not existence.But, two states 1806,1808 do not have and exist and there is not counter pair, this is because in the simple example intelligent controller described by Figure 18 A-Figure 18 B, people must exist to come with intelligent controller mutual by scheduling interface or instant control inerface.In other words, for this example, this two states is restricted to existence.In fact, many intelligent controllers by the existence that has for dispatching interaction mode 1806 and instant state of a control 1808 and not existence, this is because user can come remotely access scheduling interface or instant control inerface by cell phone and other mobile computing device.But the intelligent controller described by the state transition graph provided in Figure 18 A-Figure 18 B characterizes the simple scheduling display or instant control inerface that need user to exist.Usually, intelligent controller takies any one in two kinds of state of a controls 1802,1808.Under such conditions, intelligent controller can perform various different activity constantly, comprises exchanging data with other intelligent controller and remote computer system, responding error event and other this kind of activity.
When user by scheduling interface and intelligent controller mutual time, this intelligent controller from any one state of a control 1802 and 1808 be transformed into scheduling interaction mode 1806.Once it is mutual to stop scheduling, then intelligent controller directly can turn back to state of a control 1802 or turn back to state of a control 1802 due to the current time corresponding to scheduling set point by the variable condition 1810 of scheduling.But, when directly never there is state of a control 1808 and reaching scheduling interaction mode 1806, not there is the State Transferring being turned back to by intelligent controller and there is not state of a control 1808.This is because the fact providing people to exist by the user interactions of scheduling interface in this example know evidence, therefore state is subsequently and there is relevant state.Similar consideration is applied to instant state of a control 1812.Intelligent controller can according to exist state-event 1814 to exist relevant State Transferring to there is not relevant state, there is state-event 1814 times, intelligent controller determines the probability of current people's existence.The similar state-event 1816 that exists provides towards the conversion of the event relevant to existence.Therefore, the state transition graph in Figure 18 A-Figure 18 B replaces the senior control flow chart shown in Figure 16 to represent the operation of intelligent controller.
In the realization of other intelligent controller, the additional state relevant to existence can be had.Figure 19 and Figure 20 illustrates the intelligent controller of three kinds of existences, and it uses the illustration conventions similar with illustration conventions used in Figure 17 A and Figure 18 A.In the intelligent controller of three kinds of existences of a type, this intelligent controller can be operated in existence 1902, not existence 1904 or long-term not existence 1906.State 1902 and state 1904 and conversion 1908-1909 are in response to the state transition graph shown in Figure 17 A.But the state transition graph shown in Figure 19 also comprises state 1906, this state 1906 reaches corresponding to the disappearance of people in the one or more regions controlled by intelligent controller and is greater than threshold time amount.Can never existence 1904 or existence 1902 enter this state respectively by conversion 1910 and conversion 1911.But once be in long-term not existence 1906, then intelligent controller only can be transformed into existence 1902 from long-term not existence 1906.Figure 20 is provided for the state transition graph of the operation of intelligent controller, and it is similar to the state transition graph provided in Figure 18 A.But, in this case, there is the state that three of being associated with the existence 1902 shown in Figure 19, not existence 1904 and long-term not existence 1906 are dissimilar.In other words, the state transition graph of Figure 19 has been superimposed on the state transition graph for the operation of intelligent controller, to produce the state transition graph shown in Figure 20.As in the state transition graph in Figure 18 A, scheduling interaction mode 2002 and instant state of a control 2004 are defined as the existence of assignor, therefore be not replicated, with create three kinds with exist associate, with do not exist associate and with there is not the state associated for a long time.
Figure 21 illustrates the distributed degrees of the change of the Based Intelligent Control about the multiple intelligent controllers in environment.Distributed degrees is indicated with the longitudinal axis 2102.At extreme 2104 places of one, each intelligent controller 2106-2108 is separated and different sub-controllers completely, in order to the zones of different monitored and control in whole environment.At another extreme 2110 places, three intelligent controller 2112-2114 can be regarded as the subassembly of distributed intelligence controller 2116, process all the sensors data, the data of Electronic saving and out of Memory in a distributed way so that monitoring and controling environment.Other distribution of any a specific order that multiple intelligent controllers that the many different intermediate rule of distribution between these two extremes can describe distributed intelligence controller present.Such as, intelligent controller can be responsible for controlling different subregions, but can shared sensor data, existence and/or disappearance is determined and other data and deduction, so that each intelligent controller is provided in the control of the best in the control field that is associated with intelligent controller in the background of whole environment or almost the best.
Figure 22 A-Figure 22 C illustrates three kinds of dissimilar Control and Schedules.In Figure 22 A, Control and Schedule is the continuous curve 2202 of representative as the parameter value of the function of time, draws this parameter value, draw the time about transverse axis 2206 about the longitudinal axis 2204.This continuous curve only comprises horizontal component and vertical portion.Horizontal component represents to be expected the time period of parameters constant, and vertical portion represents the expectancy changes of the parameter value at particular point in time place.This is the Control and Schedule of simple types, and is used in hereinafter in the various examples of automatic Control and Schedule study.But automatic Control and Schedule learning method also can learn the scheduling compared with complicated type.Such as, Figure 22 B illustrates the Control and Schedule not only comprising horizontal segment and vertical section, also comprise straight-line segment at any angle.Therefore, utilize such Control and Schedule, the change of parameter value can be designated as and occur with given speed, but not be designated as the moment in the simple Control and Schedule as shown in Figure 22 A occurs.Automatic Control and Schedule learning method also can hold the Control and Schedule based on level and smooth continuous curve, such as Control and Schedule as shown in fig. 22 c.Usually, compared to the better simply Control and Schedule shown in Figure 22 B and Figure 22 A, the characteristic based on the Control and Schedule (such as Control and Schedule) as shown in fig. 22 c of smooth continuous curve describes and data encoding is more complicated and comprises more substantial storage data.
In the following discussion, hypothesis parameter value is without trending towards towards lower value release during Dynamic System usually, such as, when parameter value is temperature and controlled system is heating unit.But, in other cases, parameter value without can trend towards during Dynamic System towards high value release, such as, when parameter value is temperature and controlled system is air-conditioning.The direction of release often uses the direction compared with low-resource or expense corresponding to system.In still other cases, environment or other external condition can be depended in the direction of release, such as when parameter value for temperature and controlled system for comprise heating and refrigerating function both HVAC system time.
Forward the Control and Schedule shown in Figure 22 A to, the Control and Schedule 2202 that continuous curve represents can be encoded into the discrete set point corresponding to vertical portion or edge in continuous curve alternatively.In the following discussion, the Control and Schedule of usual use continuous curve represents the Control and Schedule of storage, Control and Schedule or the schedule creating interface provided by intelligent controller by user or remote entity of this storage create, or are created based on the instant control inputs of already present Control and Schedule, record and/or the combination of the sensing data of record or the information of these types by intelligent controller.
Graphically instant control inputs in the figure of parameter value to the time.Figure 23 A-Figure 23 G illustrates the diagram of instant control inputs, this instant control inputs can be received by intelligent controller and perform, then record and cover on Control and Schedule (such as above with reference to the Control and Schedule that Figure 22 A-Figure 22 C discusses), as the part that automatic Control and Schedule learns.Utilize the vertical line segment ending at little filling or shade circle, graphically instant control inputs.Figure 23 A illustrates the diagram of two instant control inputs 2302 and 2304.Instant control inputs is equivalent to the edge of Control and Schedule (such as shown in fig. 22) substantially, this Control and Schedule is input to this intelligent controller by the user or remote entity that perform input control immediately by expection intelligent controller, thus covers any current Control and Schedule of the operation of specifying intelligent controller.Therefore, instant control inputs is the real-time set point being input to intelligent controller by control inputs interface.
Because instant control inputs changes current Control and Schedule, so instant control inputs is associated with interim Control and Schedule subsequently usually, in Figure 23 A, this interim Control and Schedule is shown level and vertical dotted line, these dotted lines form the curve of interim Control and Schedule parameters versus time, and this curve extends forward in time from instant control inputs.Interim Control and Schedule 2306 and interim Control and Schedule 2308 are associated with the instant control inputs 2302 in Figure 23 A and instant control inputs 2304 respectively.
The example of interim Control and Schedule that Figure 23 B illustrates instant control inputs and is associated.Instant control inputs 2310 is essentially input set point, this input set point covers current Control and Schedule and instructs intelligent controller to control one or more controlled entity, to reach the parameter value of the ordinate of the filling circle 2312 in the diagram of control inputs when equaling in sight.Time in sight after control inputs, interim thermostatic control scheduling interval 2314 extends a period of time after instant control inputs, then utilizes instant control inputs terminal subsequently or set point subsequently 2316 that instant control inputs is discharged.In interval 2314, keep the time span of instant control inputs to be the parameter that automatic Control and Schedule learns.The direction of instant control inputs terminal set point 2316 subsequently and amplitude represent the parameter of one or more additional automatic Control and Schedule study.Note that the parameter that automatic Control and Schedule learns is adjustable parameter, it controls the operation of automatic Control and Schedule study, and is different from the one or more parameter values about time drafting comprising Control and Schedule.The parameter value about longitudinal axis drafting in the example Control and Schedule referenced by current discussion is directly or indirectly relevant with observed quantity, and observed quantity comprises ambient conditions, machine state etc.
Figure 23 C illustrates existing Control and Schedule, and instant control inputs is added on this existing Control and Schedule.This existing Control and Schedule requires the increase of parameter value P in point in the morning 7 (in Figure 23 C 2322), and this increase edge 2320 represents.Instant control inputs 2324 specifies the parameter value variation comparatively early of smallish a little amplitude.Figure 23 D-Figure 23 G illustrates various interim Control and Schedule subsequently, and it can obtain according to the currency of the parameter value that various differences realize and/or automatic Control and Schedule learns of intelligent controller logic.In Figure 23 D-Figure 23 G, the interim Control and Schedule be associated with instant control inputs is shown by phantom line segments, the part of the existing Control and Schedule that instant control inputs covers is shown with a line segment.In a method, as shown in fig. 23d, expectation parameter value indicated by instant control inputs 2324 is kept to reach regular time section 2326, after that time, interim Control and Schedule release (representing with the edge 2328) parameter value of specifying at the time point place of the instant control inputs of execution to Control and Schedule.This parameter value is kept 2330, until the set point of next scheduling, the set point of this next one scheduling corresponds to the edge 2332 in Figure 23 C, and intelligent controller recovers the control according to Control and Schedule at this some place.
In the other method shown in Figure 23 E, the parameter value specified by instant control inputs 2324 is kept 2332, until reach the set point of next scheduling, in this case, this set point corresponds to the edge 2320 in the Control and Schedule shown in Figure 23 C.At this next set point place, intelligent controller recovers the control according to existing Control and Schedule.Many users want the method, and these users expect that the set point of manually input is able to effective maintenance, until the set point change of scheduling.
In diverse ways, as shown in figure 23f, intelligent controller keeps the parameter value specified by instant control inputs 2324 to reach regular time section 2334, and after this time period 2334, the parameter value that existing Control and Schedule has been specified at this time point place is resumed 2336.
In the method shown in Figure 23 G, the parameter value specified by instant control inputs 2324 is kept 2338, until reach set point reciprocal with instant control inputs, at this set point place, existing Control and Schedule is resumed 2340.In other alternative method, instant control inputs can be discharged into minimum rational rank further, to attempt about resource and/or the operation of energy expenditure optimization system.Usually be used in these methods between the invasion learning period, user has to select energetically to be greater than or less than the parameter value of the parameter value be associated with minimum or low energy or resource utilization.
In the example implementation that automatic Control and Schedule learns, intelligent controller monitors instant control inputs and scheduling change in the process of monitoring period, this monitoring period is usually consistent with the time interval that Control and Schedule or son dispatchs, while according to existing Control and Schedule (except changed by instant control inputs and input scheduling the part that covers) control one or more entity.At the end of the monitoring period, the data of record are added on existing Control and Schedule, and generate new temporary scheduling by the feature combining existing Control and Schedule and scheduling change and instant control inputs.Follow various types of resolution, new temporary scheduling is promoted to the existing Control and Schedule for future time intervals, and in this future time intervals, existing Control and Schedule is used for control system operation.
Figure 24 A-Figure 24 D illustrates to there is not event and the impact on Control and Schedule thereof.Figure 24 illustrates the simple Control and Schedule being used in Figure 22 A and the identical illustration conventions adopted in Figure 23 A-Figure 23 G.This scheduling comprises initial time section 2402, first set point 2404 of relative low parameter value, after which, this scheduling comprises the interval 2406 of relative senior staff officer's numerical value, be the second set point 2408 afterwards, parameter value reduction is got back to relatively low parameter value and is used for the follow-up time period 2410 by this second set point 2408.
In Figure 24 B, the intelligent controller carrying out operating according to the Control and Schedule shown in Figure 24 A is at time t
12412 places determine that people is present in controlled environment.This determines that formation does not exist event 2416, and this does not exist event 2416 vertical dotted line 2414 and the circle with half dash area 2418 (instruction exists) and unblanketed part 2420 (instruction does not exist) and represents.Owing to there is not event, therefore intelligent controller adjusts Control and Schedule by relatively low value 2422 is got back in the reduction of the parameter value of expection.Such as, in family's heating background, parameter value can correspond to temperature, and at time t
1place does not have fact proved of occupant and reduces temperature setting so that it is reasonable for saving energy.
In Figure 24 C, at time t
22424 places, user inputs instant control inputs 2426 to reset temperature by the Based Intelligent Control interface of intelligent controller.Therefore, user exists.Due in this case, there is not the time period 2428 of the disappearance between event 2416 and instant control inputs 2426 lower than threshold value, there is event in what therefore instant control inputs represented correction, the event bar 2436 that circle 2430 and top couch that exists of this correction represents, this circle 2430 has unblanketed part 2432, dash area 2434 afterwards, this indicates the conversion of never existence to existence, and this 2436 instruction has intelligent controller and establishes the recent strong probability that there is not event formerly mistakenly.Exemplarily, the occupant of house can at time t
1take a nap very a little while short, therefore, the sensor of intelligent controller does not detect occupant, and creates and there is relevant event 2416 before.When waking up, occupant notices that temperature reduces, and is arranged by instant control inerface adjustment temperature.
Figure 24 D illustrates another situation about the Control and Schedule shown in Figure 24 A.In Figure 24 D, after initially there is not event 2416, intelligent controller 2440 adjusts scheduling accordingly, and there is not event and occur in the time period of adjustment scheduling.Afterwards, at time point t
32442 places, intelligent controller determines that people is present in controlled environment now, thus causes and there is event 2444.But, in this example, intelligent controller continue operate according to Control and Schedule, this is because do not have occupant will coverage control scheduling instruction.In a further implementation, intelligent controller can adjust for there is event but not there is not the Control and Schedule of event, or for there is event and there is not the Control and Schedule of both events.In many cases, can be specified about there is event and there are not the various Dispatching adjustment of event by the scheduling interface of intelligent controller or other inputting interface.Alternatively, intelligent controller can utilize and to exist and the pattern of non-existent pattern and immediately control inputs and Dispatching adjustment learns Dispatching adjustment along with the time.
Figure 25 illustrates much dissimilar information, and intelligent controller can use these information to determine that one or more people is in controlled environment or the existence in the Huo Zirong district, region of controlled environment and/or disappearance.As discussed above, intelligent controller comprise continuously or interval in the presence/absence of probability calculation subsystem and state change switch 2502, this switch 2502 realizes the state transfer discussed with reference to Figure 17 A.State change switch changes the state variable in intelligent controller between the state that two or more are relevant to existence, as discussed above.Start and the conversion existed between relevant state based on current existence probability map or scalar value and various threshold value.Intelligent controller is edited based on the information of the potential type of many differences exists probability scalar or figure.Various types of information can comprise photostat and export 2504 and in one or more output carrying out sensor 2506 of recording on the first time interval.This information can also comprise table, expression formula or other data, these information sensor output value is associated with to export to sensor 2508 relevant in the presence/absence of probability.In addition, intelligent controller can be preserved for reliability information or the reliability information 2510 of one or more sensor.Sensors'credence value along with time variations, and about the information change that the Local or Remote of the output of other sensor, environmental baseline, parameter and characteristic and other type stores.Information also can comprise the Control and Schedule of history and set point information 2512 and current Control and Schedule 2514, and intelligent controller is current to be operated according to current Control and Schedule 2514.Information can also comprise history in the presence/absence of information, such as this intelligent controller or carry out before carrying out other intelligent controller of communicating and remote computer system with this intelligent controller in the presence/absence of determining 2516.In addition, intelligent controller can keep the various result that there is the analysis 2518 that pattern is determined.Finally, information for editing existence probability map and scalar value can comprise the information obtained from remote entity, it comprise the data 2520 from the distance sensor in remote intelligent controller, the data 2522 from remote computation facility, from the data 2524 of various subscriber equipment (comprising cellular handset and cell phone) and the data 2526 from the various intelligent devices in controlled environment.The much information editor existence probability map used by intelligent controller and scalar value, in difference realization and background, this probability graph and scalar value can comprise the information of many addition type.As an example, intelligent controller can provide exists instruction interface, and this interface allows user to indicate its existence relative to controlled environment or disappearance clearly, as an example.
Figure 26 A-Figure 28 B is respectively provided in the sensor called in the step 1618 of the control flow chart provided in Figure 16 and step 1622 and the control flow chart that there is routine.Figure 26 A provides the control flow chart of sensor routine.In step 2602, sensor routine is received in the instruction of the Sensor Events detected in the event loop of intelligent controller.When this event is sensor interruption, as determined in step 2604, in step 2606, call following routine sensor interrupt.Otherwise in one implementation, trigger event is other instruction that timer expiry or intelligent controller need the various sensors of its monitoring controlled environment of poll.This poll occurs in for circulation of step 2608-step 2612.Each sensor is repeated to for circulation of step 2608-step 2614.In step 2609, intelligent controller reads current sensor and exports and recorded in memory.In step 2610, intelligent controller determines whether the sensor reading obtained in step 2609 can indicate existence to change.If so, then in step 2611, intelligent controller produce there is event, thus intelligent controller will carry out the next one existence determine the cycle.After for circulation of completing steps 2608-step 2612, intelligent controller is by resetting timer, arranging subsequent interrupt or arrange subsequent sensor event by some other means.
Figure 26 B illustrates the sensor input routine called in the step 2606 of Figure 26 A.In step 2614, intelligent controller receive interruption.In step 2616, intelligent controller determines the particular sensor be associated with this interruption, and in step 2618, reads current sensor and export and this sensor is exported record in memory.When the sensor recorded export can indicate to exist relevant state change time, as determined in step 2620, then in step 2622, intelligent controller produce exist event with start next exist determine the cycle.
Figure 27 A provides the control flow chart that there is routine called in the step 1622 of the control flow chart provided in figure 16.In step 2702, intelligent controller calculates exists probability for controlled environment or for the sensor-based of the zone-accumulation in this controlled environment.Intelligent controller by calculating the probability that exports for each sensor of considering in succession and keeping sliding average or continue the cumulative probability of adjustment, can carry out this calculating.Such as, the sliding average that probability can be calculated as the individual Probability p calculated from the output of multiple individual sensor (using variable i index) is existed for region r, realized by the routine f (P (r), p, i) repeatedly calling sliding average:
Alternatively, arranging P (r) and have some initial values, such as 0, then there is probability P (r) in that can be accumulated by following formula adjustment for each sensor output:
(P (r), if p)=p > P (r), returns P (r)+(p-P (r))/k to f;
Otherwise, if p < P (r), return P (r)-(P (r)-p)/k;
Otherwise, return P (r)
Wherein, k is predetermined constant.
Once calculate the sensor-based of accumulation to there is probability in step 2702, then various rule can be applied to this and sensor-basedly there is probability by intelligent controller, there is probability to adjust according to rule-based consideration in step 2704.In a method, there is probability P (r) in what utilize each applicable rule adjustment accumulation, as follows:
F (P (r), rule)=P (r) assesses (rule).
Many Different Rule and dissimilar rule can be used.Four kinds of example rules supposed hereafter are provided, exemplarily:
Rule 1: if P (r) < is T
1and
there is the subscriber equipment of GPS,
Distance (position (subscriber equipment), r) > T
2, return 0.5;
Otherwise return 1.0
Rule 2: if
sensor, for P (r) the > T that sensing data calculates
2, return 1.3;
Otherwise return 1.0
Rule 3: if
report P (s) distance sensor and overlapping (s, r) > T
3
If P (s) > is T
4, return 1.5;
P (s) < T else if
5, return 0.6;
Otherwise return 1.0
Rule 4: if similarity (current scheduling, scheduling method) > T
6and
The quantity > T do not existed to there is event during the schedule fragments of the adjustment relevant to scheduling method
4the quantity that scheduling method occurs, returns 0.4;
Otherwise return 1.0
Wherein, T
xit is the threshold value of various numerical value.Rule is provided for introducing the convenient mechanism explored.Such as, correcting the generation of event can store in memory, and rule can be applied to and adjusts the sensor-based of accumulation according to the quantity of the correction event be associated with the time window centered by current time and type and there is probability.In other cases, can no matter current time, adjust the sensor-based of accumulation according to the quantity of the correction event in the time quantum before occurring in and type and there is probability.This rule-like is converted to a kind of punishment of form and the Dispatching adjustment of correspondence of the state of leaving automatically, thus effectively increase from disappearance or exist the time of carrying out based on non-existent Dispatching adjustment detected.In some cases, before can carrying out the Dispatching adjustment based on unoccupied, rule may be used for implementing minimum time lapse.Such as, in some implementations, reaching for after there is probability to accumulation sensor-based of the conversion leaving state, how no matter there is probability in the sensor-based of accumulation, this Control and Schedule cannot be carried out, until minimum 10 minutes (in some implementations) or 20 minutes or 30 minutes (in alternative realizes).In some implementations, when correcting the occurrence frequency of event and exceeding threshold frequency value, this rule-like one can be used from forbidding to the conversion leaving state.As discussed elsewhere, can consider that high-ranking officers' positive event is weighted according to type and other, these weights count such as rule as discussed above as the factor.In some implementations, weighting can be used to increase significantly reach first for the sensor-based delay existed between the time of probability threshold value and the time in fact allowing this conversion to occur of accumulation of conversion leaving state.
Then, in for circulation of step 2706-step 2715, current existence is determined in each region that intelligent controller is monitored in order to the existence of people for intelligent controller.When the region for current consideration calculate exist probability be greater than first threshold time, as determined in step 2707, and when the current state in this region be do not exist time, as determined in step 2708, then in step 2709 by status modifier for existing, and adjust Control and Schedule accordingly in step 2710.When there is probability and being less than Second Threshold, as determined in step 2711, and when the current state in this region be exist time, as determined in step 2712, then in step 2713 by the status modifier in this region for not exist, and adjust Control and Schedule accordingly in step 2714.After for circulation of completing steps 2706-step 2715, intelligent controller determines its current distributed AC servo system whether participating in one or more region.If so, then in step 2717, current existence is reported one or more remote intelligent controller and/or remote computer system by intelligent controller.Then, in step 2718, intelligent controller carries out any additional data processing relevant to existence.To exist relevant data processing can comprise locally or remotely upgrade various Electronic saving information (comprising existence history), carry out and exist be correlated with pattern match, reevaluating and adjust sensors'credence value, reevaluating for there is the rule and other this kind of data processing task determined.Finally, in step 2719, follow-uply there is event in intelligent controller arrangement, such as, reset timer or arrange and there is the interruption that event is associated and occur on certain time point in future.
Figure 27 B provides the sensor-based control flow chart that there is the routine of probability calculation performing the accumulation of calling in the step 2702 of the control flow chart provided in Figure 27 A.This routine considers the region of each monitoring, and considers that each sensor exports for the region of each monitoring, the accumulation of getting it right in this region to fall into a trap in step 2720 there is probability, as mentioned above.Similarly, Figure 27 C is provided in the step 2704 of the control flow chart provided in Figure 27 A the control flow chart of the routine of the rule-based amendment of calling.
Figure 28 A-Figure 28 B illustrates the example implementation of the Dispatching adjustment routine called in the step 2710 of the control flow chart provided in Figure 27 A and step 2714.Figure 28 A illustrates the realization of the adjustment for the Control and Schedule that there is event.Correspond to for when not depositing Dispatching adjustment carried out before the event in current time, as determined in step 2802, there is event in what correct about Control and Schedule record in step 2804, and the Dispatching adjustment reversion carried out before making it.Otherwise in step 2806, intelligent controller makes not exist and enters Control and Schedule to there is event and make follow-up Dispatching adjustment reverse based on the recent event that do not exist.It should be noted that and can consider in various rule that correction exists event (correction be associated with Control and Schedule such as in step 2804 exists event), in order to adjust sensors'credence and to adjust for calculating the rule that there is probability.Correct and there is the instruction that there is not event that event is the possible errors produced during there is probability calculation, therefore as the valuable chance for adjusting sensors'credence and probability regulation rule, to reduce the possibility that there is not event of follow-up mistake.Additionally, event difference can be there is according to dissimilar correction and weighted correction exists event.Such as, occur in the correction event automatically left in the threshold time of Dispatching adjustment can be weighted to significantly as occurring in the twice of the correction event after this threshold time.The correction event of quick generation, especially with the correction event manually inputting set point change and be associated, provide not only false transitions to leave state but also user or occupant angry realized the strong instruction of this conversion.In some implementations, other twice correcting event is weighted to the angry correction event be associated large.Similarly, compared to the correction event be associated with instant control inputs, the sensor existed with user detects the correction event be associated and can be differently weighed.As an example, for weight for the correction event of being correlated with instant control inputs can be significantly less than to the weight that sensor detects relevant correction event.Along with the time can reduce the weight that is associated with correction event.In one implementation, as an example, the weight be associated with correction event can reduce 1% every day.The speed reduced can according to the Change of types of the event of correction.Usually, in some implementations, too fast can not reduce to the weight be associated with angry relevant correction event, or even not reduce.In some implementations, intelligent controller provides user interface, and whether this user interface allows user to indicate this user current in controlled environment, and the active of this kind of seizure condition instruction also can be associated with correction event and difference weighting.
Figure 28 B illustrates the example restriction for adjusting the routine of Control and Schedule for the state change of arriving not existence.Correspond to when or really can should set the tone the interval in whole Control and Schedule according to unmanned existence in current time, as determined in step 3810, then exist in step 2812 and be associated with Control and Schedule to there is not event, and apply corresponding one or more Control and Schedule adjustment.Otherwise application should be applied to any subsequent control Dispatching adjustment of Control and Schedule in step 2814.
As mentioned above, in other background, the generation that there is not event can trigger the reversion of Dispatching adjustment, and can carry out Dispatching adjustment owing to there is the generation of event.In other background, the generation that there is event and there is not both events can trigger the reversion of Dispatching adjustment, and can owing to there is event and there is not the generation of both events and carry out Dispatching adjustment.
Figure 29 A-Figure 29 D illustrates the various Dispatching adjustment relevant to existence.Figure 29 A illustrates example Control and Schedule.Figure 29 B illustrates in some implementations can in response to occurring in very first time point t
1the Dispatching adjustment that the existence at 2904 places is carried out to there is not event 2902.In this case, usually by this Dispatching adjustment to low parameter value, such as, in interval 2906-2908, but in Control and Schedule, keep the set point of the scheduling by improving parameter value 2910-2912.Allow the parameter value variation of these set points to continue to reach a period of time 2914, after this, there is not Dispatching adjustment (such as there is not Dispatching adjustment 2907) and then produce.When exist continue to lack reduce further to there is probability estimate time, this period can reduce along with the time, and can reach more quickly after set point change and there is not threshold value.In addition, reduce scheduling according to the time period, such as, linearly reduce scheduling, clear and definite rule can be used to reduce the time period.When reproducing scheduling, utilizing and existing to there is not event 2902, also can keep set point 2916.As shown in Figure 29 C, in some implementations, when remain in Control and Schedule cycle and certain following sessions detect do not exist time, then can more strictly adjust Control and Schedule 2920, even remove the set point that can increase the scheduling of parameter value in other side.In some implementations, under not existence, intelligent controller can carry out the Control and Schedule adjustment shown in Figure 29 B, and can carry out the stricter adjustment shown in Figure 29 C under long-term not existence, as above with reference to Figure 19 discuss.In different background with can carry out in realizing for there is event and there is not the Dispatching adjustment of many alternative types of both events.Figure 29 D illustrates the reversion do not existed to the Dispatching adjustment that there is event based on correcting.After there is not event 2902, adjustment scheduling 2922 downwards, but all Dispatching adjustment reversions making to carry out after there is not event 2902 do not existed to there is event 29 corrected, such as, shown in Figure 29 B.
Figure 30 A-Figure 30 C illustrates some in the various considerations when there is probability from the output calculating of sensor.Figure 30 A illustrates that the sensor on Control and Schedule interval (such as the period of 24 hours) exports the figure to the time.Exemplarily, this sensor completely or partially can reflect ambient light levels, thus sensor to export be high during the time 3002 by day, in night hours 3004, drop to lower, relevant to interior lighting rank, and at dead of night 3006 and early morning 3008 during drop to low-down rank.Figure 30 B illustrates that sensor actual in specific 24 hours exports, itself and exporting from sensor the probability that exists calculated and align in Figure 30 C.Usually, actual sensor output curve 3010 is reflected in the master curve shown in Figure 30 A.But the apparent of sensor output value had from expection leaves.Such as, in very first time interval 3012, sensor exports and sharply reduces on very short interval and increase.This can other changes relevant to the ambient light level caused because of the people passed by, and therefore there is probability and promptly raises 3014 in section at one time.There is probability and can remain height in specific interval 3016, then can decline relatively rapidly.The follow-up rising 3018 that there is in probability the decline slowly and sensor output that can not reflect that sensor exports increased.Such as, can determine by automatic learning or to the application that there is relevant rule, ambient light level other reduce slowly to increase usually slowly and people exists irrelevant with follow-up, but more may be relevant with the cloud passed by, weather system or other environmental phenomenon.In second time interval 3020, the additional Rapid Variable Design 3022 of observing environment light level, it has the corresponding rising 3024 fast that there is probability.But occurring in other the single change sharply of ambient light level in the 3rd time interval 3026 may have nothing to do with the increase that there is probability.This reduction can occur too close to the reduction 3010 of expection caused because of the normal daily circulation of light level, or can have been found that single sharp-pointed spike is for instrument reason or there is irrelevant reason with people and occur in the past.Increase exist probability 3030 can reflect the surround lighting occurred in the 4th time interval 3028 not only fast but also change slowly, this is because it is strong relevant to find that this changes all in night hours all exists to people.Also other the short single change of ambient light level in the 5th time period 3032 can be reflected in, this is because any increase of time ambient light rank at dead of night all exists strong relevant to people in the significantly increase 3034 that there is probability.
The point of Figure 30 A-Figure 30 C is, the probability that the people calculated from the output of particular sensor exists can be the result comprising the more complicated calculating that many differences are considered.A time point exists to people relevant sensor output level consumingly only weakly can be existed relevant on another time point with people.The change of the temporal proximity of change and the event of scheduling that sensor exports, the cycle of various expection, the output of other sensor and other considerations many can together with imply to there is probability for the various different of arbitrary particular sensor output level.These consider the type that also can depend on sensor consumingly.
Figure 31 illustrates the determination of the confidence level in the probability estimate exported based on single-sensor.In Figure 31, various instant control inputs and there is Figure 31 02 that event has been added to the Control and Schedule on it and align for two Figure 31 04 and 3106 that there is probability that controlled area r calculates relative to time and the input based on particular sensor.In the scheduling of annotation, two existence cause Dispatching adjustment 3114 and 3116 respectively to there is not event 3110 and 3112, and conversely, these two Dispatching adjustment are not existed to be covered to there is event 3118 and 3120.In addition, two instant control inputs and not existing of occurring within the time period that Control and Schedule is shown have nothing to do to there is event 3122 and 3124.Instant incoming event 3122 and 3124 and with the input do not existed to there is instant incoming event that event 3118 and 3120 is associated and be all assumed to correspond to the instant control inputs that user is undertaken by the instant control inputs interface be physically associated with intelligent controller.Therefore, people is present in probability in controlled environment r and (supposes that intelligent controller is arranged in and r) corresponding to the input of intelligent controller and not exist to each time that there is event 3118,3120,3122 and 3124 be 1, as with indicated by " p==1 " note 3 126-3129.On the contrary, with exist to not existing on time point that event 3110 and 3112 is associated, intelligent controller based on intelligent controller can all information determine that the probability that people exists is very low on the time that these events occur, as with indicated by note 3 130 and 3132.Therefore, in Figure 31 02, in the interval that Control and Schedule is shown, have six time points, it is associated with note 3 126-3130, during this period intelligent controller have maybe can distribute there is high confidence level there is probability.In order to determine the confidence level target for the probability calculated from each sensor, these relative particular persons can be existed probability and exporting compared with determined probability with on these same time points from sensor.In Figure 31, use vertical dotted line (such as vertical dotted line 3134) that Figure 31 02, time unifying between 3104 and 3106 are shown.
First Figure 31 04 is considered.Locate in the time corresponding to note 3 130, the probability that people exists is low, and from sensor export calculate there is probability 3136 and look it is significant, although be less than 0.5 at vertical dotted line 3134 and the infall of probability curve 3138 drawn among Figure 31 04.But, relative to time point 3126-3129 and 3132 of other annotations all, exports from sensor the probability calculated on those time points, accurately correspond to the probability that relatively specifically controller determines.Therefore, even if export the probability that calculates corresponding to note 3 126-3130 and six time points of 3132 from sensor inaccurately mate relative specific probability, when producing the sensor of Figure 31 04 from it, associate that to export the relatively high confidence level of the probability calculated from sensor also seemingly rational.By contrast, between the probability calculated according to the sensor producing Figure 31 06 from it and the relative specific probability caused by the Control and Schedule annotated, not there is corresponding relation, as visible in the bottom graph 3106 in Figure 31.In this case, the relatively low confidence level of distributing the probability calculated from the output of the second sensor is rational.This diagram indicates a kind of method, hereafter describe with mathematical way, the method is used for calculating confidence level multiple or weight for each sensor, to be weighted exporting from sensor the probability calculated when exporting based on sensor the probability based on user calculating accumulation:
If d < 0.1, weight=10;
Wherein, i indexs to the set of some probability, represents in Figure 31 with annotation; P (t) be calculate for sensor there is probability at time t place.
Figure 32 A-Figure 32 B illustrates to separate to exist and can determine whether a rear event is regarded as the fact of correction event to there is not event and not existing to the length in the time interval that there is event.In Figure 32 A, by the instant control inerface of the existence 3204 of assignor, instant input control relatively quickly immediately following in existence to after there is not event 3202, therefore form and do not exist to there is event.Because the time interval 3206 between these two events is relatively short, therefore this do not exist to exist event be regarded as correct not existing to there is event 3208.By contrast, as shown in fig. 32b, when two this kind of events are separated by long time interval 3210, do not exist and be not regarded as not existing to there is event of correction to there is event 3212.As mentioned above, correction do not exist to exist event be the intelligent controller mistake of carrying out there is not the strong designator determined.The analysis of the generation of this kind of event can cause the change of sensors'credence, is used in the change of the threshold value in various rule, the deletion of new regulation or interpolation and intelligent controller use and change with other determining to exist in the calculating of probability.
Figure 33 illustrate for not existing of correcting to the factor existed in event and exist probability determine and to the out of Memory that there is probability and determine in relevant Dispatching adjustment, intelligent controller spendable to there are relevant Dispatching adjustment and the various changes that there is probability and determine.Figure 33 illustrates Figure 33 02 of a part of Control and Schedule, on Figure 33 04 that there is probability that this Figure 33 02 calculates relative to the time at intelligent controller and the two alignment.Usually, when the calculated probability that exists drops to lower than threshold value 3306, intelligent controller is inferred from current state and is gone through to the conversion that there is not relevant state to not existence or another.When correct do not exist to exist event frequently occur, this threshold value can be reduced.Alternatively, this threshold value can be raised, occur with starting high-frequency, to determine the maximum reasonable threshold value forming best Based Intelligent Control to the correction event existed until do not exist.Such as, under family's heating background, usually cause significant energy to save with existing to the Dispatching adjustment that there is not event, therefore, intelligent controller can as far as possible highly continuous setup threshold value.
For with there is Dispatching adjustment that event is associated another can be to adopt the probability that exists calculating to drop to lower than the time 3312 of threshold value with because there is not retardation time between time 3314 of determining and carrying out Dispatching adjustment or surge time 3310 by Row sum-equal matrix.During retardation time 3310, if the probability that exists calculated is elevated to again higher than threshold value, then that can avoid potential correction does not exist to there is event.For the Dispatching adjustment relevant to there is event, have many additional can Row sum-equal matrix, these adjustment may be used for optimizing the Based Intelligent Control existed about people.
In discussion before, usually owing to carrying out Dispatching adjustment from existence to the conversion of not existence, but in other realizes, Dispatching adjustment can be carried out relative to not existing to there is event.Such as, under the background that critical air regulates, no matter when detect that people exists and can activate air-conditioning system.As mentioned above, there is various dissimilar Dispatching adjustment, these Dispatching adjustment can and to there is relevant event and occur simultaneously, or to occur on the time close to the event relevant to existence.In distributed intelligence control realization, exist probability calculation, sensors'credence and other result of deriving and with there are the data that probability determines to be associated and can relate to even more complicated consideration, but due to the sensor of larger quantity and the data of storage, the room and time distribution of more favourable sensor and the collection of sensing data, can be also therefore more accurately substantially.
As the part that there is probability calculation, intelligent controller can calculate and be stored in the various time interval upper calculate there is probability so that detect various types of to there is relevant circulation and pattern.Figure 34 illustrates the determined example that there is pattern on the various different time period.First Figure 34 02 illustrates that calculate on the time interval reaching one week common exists conceptual schema.As an example, the probability that can exist in living environment for people observes this pattern.In two days 3404-3405 of a week, the probability that people exists is relatively low, and in all the other five days 3406 of one week, there is probability relatively high.In this case, the occupant of house went out at weekend.Note, time transverse axis 3408 is according to a hour growth.Second Figure 34 10 illustrate observe on the interval reaching a day there is conceptual schema.In this case, occupant exists usually, except during 3412 working time of 6 in the morning 9 to evening.Figure 34 14 illustrates to there is conceptual schema on the interval reaching month.In this case, the occupant of house first day 3416 in every month and frequently not existing for the 15th day 3418, but other sky exists usually.Finally, Figure 34 20 illustrates year interval to exist conceptual schema reaching.In this case, the occupant of house not existing for first week usually in last Dec 3422 and January, and during summer months 3426, related frequency ground does not exist.There is conceptual schema in that can consider these types cumulatively or continuously during there is probability calculation.Such as, the threshold value that there is probability for the calculating of trigger state conversion can be lowered existing in the time period that probability correlation joins with height, and with low exist in the time period that probability correlation joins be raised.Alternatively, rule can by develop into adjustment based on sensor export calculate accumulation there is probability, there is conceptual schema with what reflect detection.
existence under intelligent thermostat background and/or the adjustment of disappearance detection and control
The realization for the method adjusted based on the Control and Schedule existed and/or disappearance is determined is comprised at following intelligent thermostat.Intelligent thermostat is provided with the function of selective layering, and this function makes the simple user of thinking be exposed to simple user interface, but provides access to advanced level user and handle the ability of many different energy-conservation and energy following functions.Even for the situation of the simple user of the thinking being only exposed to simple user interface, intelligent thermostat is also provided in the senior power saving function of running background.Intelligent thermostat uses multi-sensor technology to learn this intelligent thermostat to be positioned at heating and cooling environment wherein, and Optimization of Energy Saving is arranged.
Intelligent thermostat also understands user, to arrange session for starting, wherein, user asks some simple questions, uses the mode of dispatching change and instant control inputs control temperature afterwards along with the time continues to use multi-sensor technology to detect CU pattern and follows the tracks of user.Intelligent thermostat process constantly the information knowing and sense, thus automatically adjust environmental Kuznets Curves and arrange and use with optimization energy, according to the pattern that takies of known one or more users and comfortable preference the temperature in environment remained on simultaneously and expect in rank.
Advantageously, the valid function in the various different technologies circumstances of the function permission of the selective layering of intelligent thermostat in family and business environment.For the simple environment without wireless home network or Internet connection, under intelligent thermostat operates in offline mode effectively, thus know based on multi-sensor technology and user's input and conform.But for the environment with home network or Internet connection, intelligent thermostat operates under network connection mode effectively to provide additional capabilities.
When intelligent thermostat is connected to the Internet by home network (such as by IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) connect), intelligent thermostat can: (1) by real time or the home energy performance data of assembling be supplied to intelligent thermostat in utility company, intelligent thermostat data service provider, other family or other data destination; (2) from the intelligent thermostat utility company, intelligent thermostat data service provider, other family or other data sources in real time or the home energy performance data of assembling; (3) new energy hole instruction and/or other upgrading is received from one or more intelligent thermostat data service provider or other source; (4) Weather information that is current and forecast is received, for being included in Energy Saving Control algorithm process; (5) user control command is received from the TV of the computing machine of user, interconnection network, smart mobile phone and/or other motionless or portable data communication device; (6) by digital device, interactive user interface is supplied to user; (7) receive control command and information from the energy management director of outside, such as, based on the service of subscribing to, this service is intended to balance the information of collecting from multiple source to produce the configuration file of Energy Saving Control instruction and/or its subscriber; (8) control command and information is received from the energy management authoritative institution of outside, this authoritative institution is such as utility company, spontaneously limited power has been supplied to this utility company to control intelligent thermostat in the exchange for discount or other cost excitation; (9) based on the event relevant to HVAC of intelligent thermostat sensing, warning, alarm or out of Memory are supplied to user by digital device; (10) based on the event relevant to non-HVAC of intelligent thermostat sensing, warning, alarm or out of Memory are supplied to user by digital device; And (11) provide network to connect other the useful functions various started.
Figure 35 A illustrates the skeleton view of intelligent thermostat.Intelligent thermostat 3500 has the succinct appearance of fashion.Intelligent thermostat 3500 comprises the circular body 3508 being directly about 8cm, and this main body 3508 has visually pleasant outer polishing, such as smooth nickel or chrome polish.The cap-like structure comprising the display monitor 3502 of rotatable outer shroud 3506, sensor ring 3504 and circle is separated with main body 3508 by little peripheral clearance 3510.Outer shroud 3506 can have the outer polishing identical with main body 3508, and sensor ring 3504 and circular display monitor 3502 can have the outer covering of usually circular glass (or plastics), this outer covering gradually forms arcuation in outward direction and provides fashion but look solid and durable overall appearance.Sensor ring 3504 comprises any one in various sensor, comprises infrared sensor, visible light sensor and sound transducer.The glass of covering sensor ring 3504 or plastics can be with cigarette process or mirror-polishing, thus sensor itself is sightless to user.Can provide ventilation function by peripheral clearance 3510, this allows internal sensor sensing surrounding air, and does not need the cheek or cheek shape air vent.
Figure 35 B-Figure 35 C illustrates just by the intelligent thermostat that user controls.Intelligent thermostat 3500 is by two kinds of user's input controls: the rotation (Figure 35 B) of (1) outer shroud 3506; (2) inwardly push away on outer shroud 3506 (Figure 35 C), until audible and/or palpable " click " occurs.Inwardly push away and outer shroud 3506 can be caused to move forward, but in a further implementation, whole cap-like structure (comprise outer shroud 3506 and sensor ring 3504 covers with the glass of circular display monitor 3502) when being pushed away together with move inward.In one implementation, sensor ring 3504, circular display monitor 3502 and shared glass cover not along with outer shroud 3506 rotates.
Rotated by the rotation of outer shroud 3506 or ring and inwardly the pushing away or inwardly click of outer shroud 3506, intelligent thermostat 3500 can receive from user the information in need being used for basic setup and operation.To provide smooth to user but the mode of glutinous sensation mechanically installs outer shroud 3506, also reduce that forge or undesired rotations simultaneously input for improving overall succinct sensation further.Intelligent thermostat 3500 identifies three kinds of basic user's inputs: (1) hoop anticlockwise, (2) hoop right rotation, and (3) are inwardly clicked.In other realizes, more complicated basic user's input can be identified, the rotation input of such as double-click or the three inside pressings of hitting and speed sensitive or acceleration sensitive.
Figure 36 illustrates the decomposition diagram of the wall connector of intelligent thermostat and coupling HVAC.When intelligent thermostat 3500 is removed, the wall connector 3606 of HVAC has the function identical with very simple, basic, independent thermostat, and this basic thermostat comprises standard temperature and reads/arrange dial 3608 and simple refrigeration-cut out-heater switch 3609.This can prove to be applicable to various situation, such as when intelligent thermostat 3500 need be removed in order to service or repair reach the time period of prolongation time.In one implementation, intelligent thermostat parts 3608 and 3609 are entirely mechanical in itself, thus do not need electric power to skip control lag.In other realizes, provide simple electric control, the up/down button of such as electricity and/or LCD reader.In other realizes, can provide the advanced function of a subgroup of intelligent thermostat 3500, such as elemental network access is to allow the Long-distance Control providing brainstem function when temporarily removing intelligent thermostat.
Figure 37 A to Figure 37 B illustrates front perspective view and the back perspective view of the decomposition of intelligent thermostat.Figure 37 A to Figure 37 B illustrates intelligent thermostat 3702:(1 about two critical piece) head unit 3604; (2) backboard 3706.In shown accompanying drawing, z direction is outside from wall, and y direction is the head-to-toe direction relative to the user upwards walked, and x direction is user direction from left to right.
Figure 38 A to Figure 38 B illustrates the front and back skeleton view of the decomposition of head unit respectively.Head unit 3604 comprises head unit framework 3710, outer shroud 3711, head unit front assembly 3712, front lens 3713 and front grid 3714.Electric parts on head unit front assembly 3712 can be connected to the electric parts on backboard 3706 by the electric connector of flat cable and/or other grafting type.
Figure 39 A to Figure 39 B illustrates the front and back skeleton view of the decomposition of head unit front assembly respectively.Head unit front assembly 3712 comprises head unit circuit board 3716, head unit front plate 3718 and LCD module 3722.In Figure 39 A, the parts in the front of head unit circuit board 3716 are hidden in after RF guard shield.Rechargeable lithium ion battery 3725 is positioned on the back side of head unit circuit board 3716, and in one implementation, this lithium ion battery 3725 has the nominal voltage of 3.7 volts and the nominal capacity of 560mAh.In order to extending battery life, battery 3725 does not charge more than 450mAh by thermostat capacitor charging circuit usually.In addition, can be charged to 4.2 volts although operated into by battery 3725, intelligent thermostat does not charge more than 3.95 volts by thermostat capacitor charging circuit.In Figure 39 B, optical finger navigation module 3724 is also shown, this module 3724 is configured and is positioned to the rotation sensing outer shroud 3711.Module 3724 uses the method being similar to the operation of optical computer mouse to sense the movement of metal surface on the periphery, opposite of outer shroud 3711.Note, module 3724 is one of little several sensors, and these sensors are subject to the head unit microprocessor of relative power sensitivity but not the backboard Microprocessor S3C44B0X of relatively low electric power.This is attainable, and does not need excess power, because when user manually rotates dial, head unit microprocessor is waken up, thus avoids the excessive electric power waken up to consume.Advantageously, head unit microprocessor also can provide response quickly.Figure 39 A also illustrates Fresnel (Fresnel) lens 3720, these lens 3720 and the PIR motion sensor joint operation placed thereunder.
Figure 40 A to Figure 40 B illustrates the front and back skeleton view of the decomposition of backboard unit respectively.Backboard unit 3706 comprises plate 3730 after backboard, backplane circuit board 3732 and backboard capping 3739.Figure 40 A illustrates HVAC wire connector 3734, and connector 3734 comprises integrated electric wire and inserts sensing circuit large capacitor 3736 relative to two, and the stealing circuit be arranged on the dorsal part of backplane circuit board 3732 makes electricity container 3736.
Figure 41 illustrates the skeleton view of the head unit of sections fit.In some implementations; the placement of grid members 3714 on Fresnel Lenses 3720 with the PIR motion sensor 3744 be associated covers and protects these PIR sensing elements, and the transverse groove simultaneously in grid members 3714 allows PIR motion-sensing hardware (although being covered) to detect the transverse movement of the occupant in room or region.Temperature sensor 3740 uses a pair thermal sensor to measure environment temperature more accurately.Be associated with temperature sensor 3740 first or top thermal sensor 3741 collect the temperature data in the apparent region of or thermostat outside near thermostat, and second or bottom thermal sensor 3742 collect the closely-related temperature data in inside with shell.In one implementation, each TMP112 digital temperature sensor chip comprising Texas Instrument (Texas Instruments) company in temperature sensor 3741 and 3742, and PIR motion sensor 3744 comprises the DigiPyro Series P YD 1998 dual-element 1,2,3,-thrihydroxy-benzene sensor of PerkinElmer company.
In order to determine environment temperature more accurately, when determining effective environment temperature, the temperature in conjunction with top thermal sensor 3741 measurement considers the temperature obtained from bottom thermal sensor 3742.This configuration may be used for the effect compensating the internal heat produced in thermostat by one or more microprocessor and/or other electronic unit, thus eliminates or minimize the temperature measurement errors that may stand in other side.In some implementations, by the top thermal sensor 3741 of temperature sensor 3740 is thermally coupled to grid members 3714 (therefore top thermal sensor 3741 reflects environment temperature better than bottom thermal sensor 3742), the accuracy that environment temperature is measured can be improved further.
Figure 42 illustrates head unit circuit board.The oscillator 4204 that head unit circuit board 3716 comprises head unit microprocessor 4202 (the AM3703 chip of such as Texas Instruments) and is associated, and DDRSDRAM storer 4206 and Large Copacity nand memory 4208.Wi-Fi module 4210 (such as the LBWA19XSLZ module of Murata Wireless Solutions company) is based on the WL1270 chipset of the support 802.11b/g/n wlan standard of Texas Instruments, and be arranged in the independent compartment of RF guard shield 4234, in order to provide Wi-Fi ability.Wi-Fi module 4210 is associated with support circuit 4212, and this circuit 4212 comprises oscillator 4214.ZigBee module 4216 (can be such as the C2530F256 module from Texas Instruments) is also arranged in the RF compartment of protection separately, in order to provide ZigBee ability.This ZigBee module 4216 is associated with support circuit 4218, and this circuit 4218 comprises oscillator 4219 and low noise amplifier 4220.Display backlight voltage conversion circuit 4222, piezoelectric driving circuit 4224 and power management circuitry 4226 can be additionally set.Proximity sensor and ambient light sensor (PROX/ALS), more particularly there is the SI1142 degree of approach/ambient light sensor of the Silicon Labs company at I2C interface, be arranged on flexible circuit 4228, this flexible circuit 4228 utilizes flexible circuit connector 4242 to be attached to the back side of head unit circuit board.Battery additionally can be provided to charge and to supervise disconnecting circuit 4232 and spring/RF antenna 4236.Temperature sensor 4238 and PIR motion sensor 4240 can be additionally provided.
Figure 43 illustrates the rear view of backplane circuit board.Backplane circuit board 3732 comprises backboard processor/microcontroller 4302, and the MSP430F SOC (system on a chip) microcontroller of such as Texas Instruments, it comprises machine carried memory 4303.Backplane circuit board 3732 also comprises power circuit 4304 (comprising stealing circuit) and the on-off circuit 4306 for each HVAC HVAC function separately.For each this kind of function, this on-off circuit 4306 comprises isolating transformer 4308 and back-to-back NFET wraps 4310.The use of the FET in on-off circuit allows to reach very closely-spaced (such as 100 microseconds) next initiatively stealing by simply the electric power from HVAC delay circuit being transferred to electric power storage appearance, such as, during the HVAC startup cycle, adopt electric power.This time is too short and be not enough to skip HVAC and postpone to enter closed condition, but is enough to for electric power storage capacity charge.The use of FET allows this fast switching time (100 microsecond), and this will be difficult to realize using postpone (it keeps connection to reach tens microseconds).And this delay will be easy to make to switch degeneration fast, and they also will produce audible noise.By contrast, substantially without audible noise when FETS operates.Additionally can provide the temperature/humidity sensor module 4312 of combination, the SHT21 module of such as Sensirion company.Mechanical electric wire when backboard microcontroller 4302 performs the poll of various sensor, sensing is installed inserts, change head unit relative to electric current to set point temperatures situation and correspondingly activation switch and other function, such as, on the electric wire inserted, finds appropriate signals when installing.
Although a large amount of effort and concern continue towards upgrading the development with more continuable Power supply, the energy of protection to the world of the energy caused by energy efficiency increased will remain critical future.According to the report in the October, 2010 from USDOE, in typical American family, heating and cooling account for 56% of energy use, become the ceiling capacity expense of most of family.Along with the improvement (heat insulation material, the more high efficiency stove that such as improve) of the physical equipment be associated with family heating and cooling, by the better control and management to family's heating and cooling equipment, the significantly increase of energy efficiency can be realized.By activating wise select time interval and carefully selecting other heating ventilation of operation level and artificial atmosphere (HVAC) equipment, large energy can be saved, keep living space to be suitably comfortable to its occupant simultaneously.
In recent years, in view of Energy Star (U.S.) and TCO (Europe) standard, programmable thermostat has become more popular, and its for HVAC system can each self-steering difference arrange quantitative aspects obtain suitable progress.Some programmable thermostats have the built-in default program of standard.Additionally, user can adjust manufacturer's acquiescence item to optimize the energy use of himself.Ideally, use scheduling, this scheduling reflects the conventional behavior of occupant in the period slept, wake up and do not take exactly.But due to the difficulty when programming many thermostats, therefore many scheduling inaccurately reflect the conventional behavior of occupant.Such as, scheduling can unoccupied period of more not responsible routines.Additionally, even if when being programmed in thermostat by suitably dispatching, also inevitably there is the behavior of going against the established rules.User manually can arrange thermostat backward when leaving house, then the restoration schedule when returning, but many users always or seldom carry out these tasks.Therefore, if thermostat automatically can arrange set point temperatures backward during unoccupied time, then there is the chance that cost of energy is saved.
What intelligent thermostat controlled to be restricted usually encloses ground, the residence of the various temperature (as utilized the temperature specified by instant control inputs and one or more Control and Schedule) such as providing human occupants to expect during the different piece of every day.Intelligent thermostat can comprise existence and/or disappearance detects and the Dispatching adjustment relevant to disappearance, for reducing temperature at intelligent thermostat according to automatically leaving when feature is determined to be present in environment without occupant.In some implementations, once the probability that exists of people or there is probability and drop to lower than threshold value, just automatically leave temperature adjustment, and in other realizes, after a period of time without occupant being detected, only automatically leave temperature adjustment.This usually predetermined time period without occupant can be 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes or longer.In some implementations, the predetermined time period without occupant is about 120 minutes.The predetermined time period without occupant can be revised with the Electronic saving data (comprising the rule for determining when automatically to leave Control and Schedule adjustment) of the pattern of unoccupied and other type based on the sensing data of various types of user input, record, the data obtained from remote source, taking of storage.
Intelligent thermostat can control heating ventilation and artificial atmosphere (" HVAC ") system, and this HVAC system provides both heating and cooling, only heating to the occupant of environment (such as house or commercial mansion) or only cools.Intelligent thermostat also can control additionally or individually to provide humidification, dehumidifying, throw light on, flow to device and system electric current and go to the system of the fluid of device and subsystem or the controlled flow of gas.
Figure 44 A-Figure 44 D illustrates the setting point diagram automatically leaving/automatically arrive the time diagram contrast real work of the standard Control and Schedule corresponding to operation of feature of intelligent thermostat.For the object simplifying disclosure, for the relatively simple intelligent thermostat scheduling 4402 for particular job day (such as Tuesday) of user shown in Figure 44 A.Scheduling 4402 is included in the interval that wakes/be in (preferred temperature is 76 degree in this interval) between at 7 in the morning and at 9 in afternoon and the sleep interval in the afternoon between and at 7 in the morning (preferred temperature is 66 degree in this interval) at 9.Scheduling 4402 represents the normal Control and Schedule for house.
According to automatically leaving feature, use many sensing technologies of intelligent thermostat, such as, use passive infrared proximity sensor and ambient light sensor, continuously and automatically sense the seizure condition of house or other environment.For determining that one or more sensors of the seizure condition of environment are hereinafter referred to as " taking sensor ".In some implementations, take sensor to measure with quite high frequency (such as 1Hz-2Hz).Then by measurement collection in the period (bucket) with set time length (such as 5 minutes) or interval.For each period, intelligent controller determines whether to detect and takies.Such as, when plural in the period take sensor reading illustrate detect mobile time, then this period is regarded as being in or representing the state detecting and take.Therefore, each period is classified into one of two states: the state taken and state unoccupied being detected detected.In some implementations, when threshold percentage take sensor reading instruction take time, the period is classified into the state being in and detecting and take.Such as, can find, even if having the arrangement of relative mistake, when environment is occupied, also have an appointment 10 the instruction of pir sensor reading mobile.In this example, the threshold value of 5 percent may be used for being categorized into the state being in and detecting and take the period.
In some implementations, at least in part based on the state of the period of current sensing, environment classification becomes to have one of four kinds of states by intelligent thermostat: (1) family; (2) normally leave; (3) spend a holiday and leave; (4) sleep.In some implementations, when environment has been in the minimum interval (being called " leaving state confidence level window " (" ASCW ")) state of unoccupied being detected and reach predetermined, automatically leaves feature and triggered from family to the state change normally left.Due to the state change normally left, therefore no matter how dispatching the set point temperatures of instruction by normal intelligent thermostat, is all predetermined energy-conservationly leave state temperature (" AST ") by the operational set-points temperature change of reality.
Automatically the object leaving feature be when do not exist occupant actual experience or experience scheduling 4402 comfortable arrange time avoid unnecessary heating and cooling, thus save energy.Exemplarily, the predetermined value that AST can be arranged for 62 degree of period in winter maybe can ask the ambient temperature heated, and maybe can ask the ambient temperature of cooling for the predetermined value of 84 degree of period in summer.In some implementations, the AST temperature for heating and cooling is that user can be arranged by the independent scheduling interface automatically leaving the interface of feature.
ASCW corresponds to time interval of unoccupied of sensing, and the statistical accuracy of resonable degree can be utilized after this time interval to carry out really operating hypothesis reliably without the reasonable of occupant enclosing in ground.For most of typical environment, have been found that, scheduled time slot in the scope of 90 minutes-180 minutes is the period being suitable for holding general case for ASCW, in these periods, even if occupant exists, take sensor also can not detect and take, the such as quiet reading of these periods, away from keyboard arrive street corner once mailbox, nap and other this kind of period.
Realize according to some, after study event, automatically adjust ASCW.Such as, according to a realization, after manual punishment event, ASCW is extended scheduled volume, such as 10 minutes-30 minutes, manual punishment event is such as, after being transformed into and normally leaving pattern, user manually arranges set point temperatures to keep comfortable, and this instruction is enclosed occupied, although take sensor to indicate other mode.Similarly, in some implementations, when lacking any manual punishment event, can based on several repetition to normally leave state conversion shorten ASCW.This kind of change of ASCW may be used for making the specific tendency that algorithm adapts to occupant better and/or the validity taking sensing caused because of other factors (such as the physical arrangement of intelligent thermostat/sensor).In some implementations, intelligent thermostat keeps there is probability scalar or figure based on the data of many dissimilar storages and reception, as in chapter above discuss, this kind of data comprise and to store and the determination of the pattern that takies of frequent updating, sensors'credence, taking of history are determined and other this kind of data many, therefore intelligent thermostat can reliably testing environment unoccupied and call and automatically leave Control and Schedule adjustment.In these realize, ASCW can not be used, this is because correct do not exist to there is event or punishment event is fed back in the calculating that there is probability scalar or figure, to guarantee when there is probability and dropping to lower than threshold value, the probability of unoccupied suffices to show that automatically to leave Dispatching adjustment reasonable.Alternatively, can ASCW be shortened, or intelligent controller can adjust the probability threshold value that Dispatching adjustment is left in triggering automatically, but not adjustment ASCW.
Figure 44 A-Figure 44 example of D was provided for 120 minutes under the background of the AST heating scene that is 62 degree at ASCW.Figure 44 B illustrates set point Figure 44 02 of scheduling and set point Figure 44 04 of practical operation, and it is along activity time the line (" A of sensing
s") 4403, this timeline illustrates the ellipse mark of little black, and these marks correspond to the activity of sensing, or in other words, period senses the period taken, and this period is current by the morning 11: 4405.By point in the morning 11, sensing have significant User Activity, until the morning 10 point, be the inactive interval 4406 of a hour afterwards, be not categorized into the interval being in and the state taken detected.Because the inactive interval in Figure 44 B is only about one hour (being less than ASCW), therefore automatically leave feature and be not also triggered to the state change normally leaving state.
Figure 44 C illustrate by the scheduling of 4 in afternoon with the setting point diagram of reality.As shown in Figure 44 C, after inactive 120 minutes, 12 automatic triggerings normally leave pattern in the afternoon, the set point 4404 of practical operation are adjusted to the AST temperature of 62 degree from the set point 4402 of normal consistency.By point in afternoon 4, after triggering normally leaves pattern, also do not sense activity, state of therefore normally leaving is remained valid.
With reference to Figure 44 D, after the example shown in Figure 44 A-Figure 44 C, show by the scheduling of 12 in the morning with the setting point diagram of reality.As shown in Figure 44 D, in the short time interval 4408 that about at 5 in afternoon is located, start detection and take activity, this is triggered to the auto-returned of home state or automatically arrives conversion, at this place, normal Control and Schedule 4402 is got back in the adjustment of the set point 4404 of practical operation.
The example of Figure 44 A-Figure 44 D illustrates that the method based on ASCW of feature is left in realization automatically.But, as chapter above discussed, in the realization of alternative, when there is probability or acquistion probability drops to lower than threshold value, trigger automatically leave Dispatching adjustment.According to many dissimilar data with consider to upgrade continuously or upgrade off and on to there is probability, these data and consider that the sensor comprising many group records exports, determine and user's mobile device of the pattern that takies determined along with the time of Electronic saving, the relative reliability in particular sensor, the customer location outside report controlled environment and other this kind of data.In this kind of realization, usually trigger more intensely and automatically leave Dispatching adjustment, certainly to arrange according to threshold value, keep and the energy taking relevant Control and Schedule and arrange to avoid the waste when intelligent controller has utilized high confidence level and fiduciary level to determine to there is not occupant.In some implementations, short ASCW can be retained, and other realize in, ASCW can be eliminated completely, utilize completely the acquistion probability of calculating trigger automatically leave Dispatching adjustment, such as there is probability scalar or figure in acquistion probability, as chapter above discussed.
In some implementations, initially can use the method based on ASCW, until have accumulated enough data to there is probability scalar or map generalization accurately in order to provide, and can after the replacement of intelligent thermostat, or after large destructiveness change occurs for controlled environment, the system controlled by intelligent thermostat or the setting of intelligent thermostat and parameter, also use the method based on ASCW.Once the accuracy that there is probability scalar or figure of sensors'credence rank and generation is elevated to acceptable rank, then intelligent thermostat significantly can shorten ASCW or eliminate ASCW, and only depends on and there is probability.In these realize, initial time period can be regarded as the mandate period automatically leaving feature alternatively, wherein, does not only trigger or triggers after very long initial ASCW and automatically leave feature, until sensors'credence is elevated to higher than threshold value.Such as, due to sensor that is wrong or poor placement, intelligent thermostat can not utilize enough fiduciary level determination seizure conditions and unoccupied state, takes risks to make automatically to leave Dispatching adjustment.
Figure 45 is the schematic diagram that the various states that controlled environment can be categorized into are shown.Controlled environment is categorized into one of aforementioned four kinds of states by intelligent thermostat: family 4510; Normally leave 4512; Spend a holiday and leave 4514; With sleep (4520).In the normal operation period, according to time and the normal consistency of one day, controlled environment is classified into and is in home state 4510 or sleep state 4520.Sleep state 4520 can utilize predetermined hour (such as from point at 12 in afternoon to the morning 6) to determine, can be arranged according to user preference by user, can according to the current scheduling (scheduling 4402 in such as Figure 44 A, its reflection at 9 in afternoon and at 7 in the morning hour between sleep state) arrange, and these can be utilized to consider and combination based on the additional consideration of the data of addition type is arranged.
Normal consistency intention is responsible for the routine of occupant or the behavior of expectation.As described in, when unexpected disappearance being detected, the controlled environment being in home state 4510 can be transformed into automatically and normally leave state 4512, so that saving resource and cost.As described in, when unoccupied being detected within the ASCW time period (adopt ASCW those realize in), maybe when there is probability and dropping to lower than threshold value, can occur from home state 4510 to the change normally leaving state 4512.In some implementations, based on the event of sensing, the process of time and/or when there is not occupant and meet other triggering energy-conservation enclosing in ground, can change and normally leave state 4512 pattern.Some are realized, normally leaves state 4512 and set point temperatures is remained on energy-conservation AST temperature, until one of following item occurs: (1) receives manual instant control inputs from user, State Transferring is got back to home state 4510; (2) activity-triggered that takies based on sensing arrives operator scheme automatically, State Transferring is got back to home state 4510; (3) current time dropped in normal occupant length of one's sleep, and current state is not spend a holiday to leave state; Or (4) current time correspond to scheduling set point time and current state is not spend a holiday to leave state.
In some implementations, when sensing the predetermined minimum interval (being called " state of spending a holiday confidence level window " (" VSCW ")) reaching prolongation without occupant's situation, be transformed into being in the controlled environment normally leaving state 4512 state of leaving 4514 of spending a holiday.Leave in state 4514 on holiday, set point temperatures is set to spend a holiday leaves set point temperatures (" AVST "), and this temperature represents radical energy efficiency temperature rank.Such as, in one implementation, AVST acquiescence is 45 degrees Fahrenheits at the time durations of request heating, is 95 degrees Fahrenheits at the time durations of request cooling.VSCW is configured to be longer than ASCW far away usually.Such as, in many cases, the VSCW of 24 hours is suitable.In some implementations, VSCW is variable, such as, during the weekend from Friday afternoon to week-night, change to 60 hours from 48 hours.VSCW longer during weekend makes set point temperatures change to strict AVST during constraining in the shorter unoccupied period (such as short travelling at weekend) mistakenly.In some implementations, when be in spend a holiday leave state time, set point preprocessed features can not be adopted.
In some implementations, during sleep state 4520, automatically leave feature and become inactive.In these realize, this state is not directly be transformed into from sleep normally to leave.Deactivation is automatically left feature and is avoided mistakenly set point temperatures being changed to AST from the set point temperatures at night of scheduling when not sensing and taking.Realizing according to other, due to the low-down expected activity level of time durations of sleeping occupant and different activity patterns and position, therefore during sleep state 4520, when unoccupied being detected, can changing into inertia insensitive by taking sensing.In one example, during sleep state, ASCW is extended to 4 hours or 6 hours.According to other realize, when occupant in fact in bed, reduce the reading of the threshold percentage in the sensor reading of each period, to reduce the probability of the mis-classification of unoccupied.Exist in the realization of probability scalar and/or figure based on various types of data (what comprise history takies pattern) generation, for trigger automatically leave feature based on the method that there is probability threshold value automatically according to generate accumulation there is probability after apply variously there is probability regulation rule and consider sleep scheduling, as in chapter above discuss, thus prevent or significantly reduce to trigger occupant the possibility automatically leaving feature in bed.
Figure 46 A-Figure 46 F illustrates and automatically leaves/setting the point diagram of the automatically time diagram contrast real work of the standard Control and Schedule corresponding to operation of arrival method.Figure 46 A illustrates the scheduling 4602 of the intelligent thermostat for particular job day (such as Wednesday) for the usual user stayed out between at 11 in the morning and at 5 in afternoon.This scheduling 4602 comprises from 7 in the morning at 11 in the morning and again from 5 in afternoon to the interval that wakes/be at 10 in afternoon, and within this time, set point temperatures is 72 degrees Fahrenheits.Sleep temperature and noon temperature can all be set to 62 degrees Fahrenheits.In this example, ASCW is 90 minutes and AST is 60 degree.
In Figure 46 B, the set point Figure 46 04 with practical operation illustrates set point Figure 46 02 of scheduling.Activity time the line (" A of sensing
s") the 4605 ellipses marks comprising the little black of the activity corresponding to sensing, and current by 2 pm.By 2 pm, sensing has significant User Activity, until 8 a.m., is inertia interval 4606 afterwards.When do not detect in the ASCW of 90 minutes take time, the morning 9:30 trigger and automatically leave feature, and the State Transferring of controlled environment is to normally leaving state, automatically leaves Control and Schedule adjustment with the AST towards 60 degrees Fahrenheits.
Figure 46 C scheduling is shown respectively with set point Figure 60 2 and 604 of reality and the current activity by the sensing of 9 in afternoon.Note, though in the afternoon 5 activity do not detected, also state is changed into home state, and set point is changed over the set point of the scheduling of coupling 72 degree.5 expections returned in the afternoon occur because of occupant by this State Transferring towards home state do not sensed when taking, this is because occupant gets home in this time usually, as dispatch 602 reflect.Note, in the example shown in Figure 46 C, about afternoon, 6:15 started again to sense activity.
Figure 46 D illustrate respectively according to the scheduling of different example with set point Figure 46 02 and 4604 of reality and the current activity by the sensing of 9 in afternoon.In the example shown in Figure 46 D, by the current time of 9 in afternoon, unoccupied detected at night.Therefore, 6:30 place is after ASCW in the afternoon, the state of controlled environment is changed to and normally leaves state, and is the AST of 60 degree by set point change.
Figure 46 E illustrate respectively according to the scheduling of example shown in Figure 46 D with set point Figure 46 02 and 4604 of reality and the current activity by the sensing of 12 in afternoon.In this example, by the current time of 12 in afternoon, unoccupied is detected at night.10 points in the afternoon, the set point temperatures that the set point of scheduling causes intelligent thermostat to keep changes to the sleep set point temperatures of 62 degree.According to this example, because at 10 in afternoon is the dormant beginning, therefore automatically leave feature and become inactive.
Figure 46 F illustrate respectively according to the scheduling of example shown in Figure 46 D-Figure 46 E with set point Figure 46 02 and 4604 of reality and current by next sky (Thursday) afternoon the sensing of 11 activity.In this example, Wednesday 8 a.m. and Thursday afternoon 11 between the whole period 4606 during unoccupied detected.In this example, be sluggish during automatically leaving the sleep state of feature in the afternoon between and at 7 in the morning at 10, and increase set point according to scheduling at 7 in the morning in the morning Thursday.But, take owing to not detecting, therefore at 8:30 in the morning, after ASCW interval, automatically leave the change of feature trigger state and get back to and normally leave state, and by set point change to AST.Then, at 9:30 in the morning, the state of controlled environment is changed to spend a holiday and leaves, this is because during transition unoccupied detected since the VSCW starting to have passed through 24 hours towards the initial conversion normally leaving state.At 9:30 in the morning, set point temperatures is lowered to AVST, and in present exemplary, it is 45 degrees Fahrenheits.Note, in some implementations, time taken detected from the last time but not measure VSCW from the time towards the State Transferring normally left, this can cause Thursday 8 a.m. be transformed into spend a holiday and leave state.
In some implementations, user has the ability changing ASCW according to the energy-conservation intensity expected.Such as, selecting the user of strength energy-saving option can have the ASCW of 45 minutes, therefore determining carrying out automatically leaving of system after only 45 minutes inactive.The various methods of activity that can use the subwindow for creating the ASCW time period and filter sensing are improved the triggering of automatically leaving feature and are transformed into the reliability normally leaving state.Also whether the activity for understanding sensing exists to people or other phenomenon is relevant various learning methods can be used to improve by the reliability automatically left feature and trigger.In some implementations, during normally leaving the period, can based on the disappearance of the manual set point input corrected other sensing of context class corresponding to sensed event of the result that interactive mode is known and/or the people that really admits a fault takies movable.Such as, when trigger automatically leave feature after a period of time in do not have correction manual set point change and correct input this kind of disappearance in time repeating in several different occasion, then can draw the following conclusions: and the sensing activity of the type of being associated of those intervals and/or degree to be identified into be there is irrelevant background rank with people, this is because contemplated the corrective action of some other type in one or more this kind of occasion.
According to being similar to the mode automatically left and take estimation, the triggering towards home state carried out of automatic arrival feature can similarly based on the establishment time window of subwindow and/or the filtration to sensing activity, thus there is irrelevant forgery event with the people of reality or other event does not unnecessarily trigger auto-returned pattern.As mentioned above, in some implementations, detection process comprises the subwindow of the subwindow period of 5 minutes or other suitable durations estimated separately, for existence or the disappearance of the sensing activity during these subwindows.When finding to sense threshold quantity movable in two adjacent subwindows, automatically arrive feature according to the time triggered of a day towards home state or dormant State Transferring.Such as referring to the time 4408 of Figure 44 D.Upon activation, auto-returned pattern operates by set point temperatures being turned back to the set point temperatures of normal Control and Schedule 4402.
Some of intelligent thermostat realizes providing based on triggering and/or the automatic Control and Schedule arriving the manual input mode of the pattern that takies that the repetition example that triggers is associated and/or correction is revised with automatically leaving.Monitor constantly with multiple time cycle and filter and automatically leave/automatic manual the input behavior taking and/or correct arriving feature and be associated, to detect the pattern in CU, conversely, these patterns can be balanced with by Control and Schedule finishing or other side be tuned to coupling better actual take pattern.The time cycle of multiple rank can comprise every day, be linked to other cycle that user behavior takies pattern weekly, monthly, every year or in logic.Therefore, such as, when within a series of continuous print Friday observation with when automatically leaving/automatically arrive manual input behavior that be associated specific take and/or correct, the Control and Schedule being used for Friday is adjusted to mate better indicate take pattern.As another example, when the in a few days observation of a series of continuous print Saturday and week is with when automatically leaving/automatically arrive manual input behavior that be associated specific take and/or correct, the Control and Schedule being used for Saturday and Sunday can be adjusted to coupling better and takies pattern weekend.
Figure 47 A-Figure 47 D illustrates the example that the Control and Schedule based on the manual input mode of the pattern that takies be associated with the repetition example automatically leaving and/or automatically arrive triggering and/or correction is revised.For Figure 47 A-Figure 47 C, Figure 47 10 is normal Control and Schedules, and in Figure 47 A, Figure 47 B and Figure 47 C, Figure 47 12, Figure 47 14 and Figure 47 16 illustrate the set point of practical operation respectively.Finally, in Figure 47 D, Figure 47 20 illustrates Control and Schedule that is tuning or amendment.For this example, for user (its normal set point temperatures indicate they on weekdays whole day be all in), along with time observation arrives, during pact high noon of the Wednesday on many weeks, automatically leave feature to trigger and be transformed into and normally leave state, as shown in Figure 47 A-Figure 47 C, not there is the manual user input of any correction, and tap from moving expression patterns the pact afternoon 5 in those days.Such as, this pattern can correspond to retiree, and this retiree has determined that Wednesday does volunteer at native library.Once reliably set up this pattern, such as, after three continuous print Wednesdays, then as shown in Figure 47 D, automatically tuning or repair normal Control and Schedule, thus for later Wednesday or all Wednesdays after this, have dispatch for the interval between at 10 in the morning and at 5 in afternoon leave the period.
In some implementations, utilize two continuous print events reliably establishment model, such as, based on only two in three in Figure 47 A-47C Wednesday, and three Wednesdays of not all.In addition, in some implementations, scheduling 4720 that is tuning or amendment is not automatically used, but is supplied to user first for user's approval.Such as, when user indicated about scheduling upgrade the preference of asking and non-scheduled upgrading automatically adopted, user can be implored and accept.According to some, other realize, and when the cost estimated and/or energy saving are greater than predetermined threshold value or number percent, new scheduling 4720 is only automatically used or is supplied to user.
If the instant control inputs corrected (being called " input of correction " or " punishment input ") has occurred in a day in those days shown in Figure 47 A-Figure 47 C, then Control and Schedule can not carry out the automatic adjustment as shown in Figure 47 D.This correction or punishment input can occur in following circumstances: (1) has been triggered and has automatically been left pattern; (2) arrive for automatic the activity that takies (after filtering for background event) that feature does not have enough sensings for trigger state change; (3) user become uncomfortable and gone to intelligent thermostat to heighten temperature.Except except Dian Qu in the morning 10 Wednesday library, can be following situation: user goes reading upstairs, the intelligent thermostat of now independent ground floor not in the afternoon the existence and triggering of 12:00 sensing user automatically leave, after this user is uncomfortable what about afternoon, 12:45 became, then downstairs goes manually to heighten temperature.It may be invalid that punishment input due to user indicates the potential pattern that takies or needs are authorized further, therefore Control and Schedule not by automatically be tuned to Figure 47 20 as shown in Figure 47 D, and in one implementation, along negative direction, weighting is at least in part carried out to potential pattern, thus the correlativity of even higher degree can be needed subsequently, to set up pattern that is effective or reasonable prediction.For more generally situation, also the punishment of user input can be used to adjust the type and/or degree that are applied to the filtration taking sensing, this is because clearly had the inertia sensed based on the time interval for the correction input causing punishing and the wrong conclusion of making.
The occupied information of current sensing is utilized to trigger automatically leaving in above-mentioned realization/automatically arrive feature.In other realize, automatically leave/automatically arrive the automatic of feature and self trigger based on intelligent thermostat acquistion probability time profile generated over an extended period of time.For a realization, acquistion probability time profile is expressed as the time diagram of scalar value, and this scalar value represents that one or more people is taking the probability of enclosing ground at each particular point in time.Can alternately use any various other express in any one, comprise reflection and take statistics and/or the probability distribution function of probability and stochastic variable and represent.
For a realization, one or more times that intelligent thermostat is configured to meet following standard in one day self trigger and are transformed into and normally leaves state: being in the time interval of (1) normal Control and Schedule instruction scheduling; (2) acquistion probability is lower than predetermined threshold value; (3) take sensor not sense and indicate mankind occupant to be really present in a large amount of activities of enclosing in ground clearly; (4) take sensor also not sense in sufficiently long interval for being transformed into the enough low-level activity automatically leaving pattern in the foregoing manner.Once meet these conditions and pattern of automatically leaving self is triggered, then can be similar to conventional automatically leave that pattern carries out convert, carry out automatically leaving patten transformation out from this.Hands-off tuning based on the Control and Schedule of courses taken can based on the observation of the pattern of automatically leaving triggered from routine with the combination of the method for the pattern of automatically leaving of self triggering.
Have been found that, when compared to tuning (only the considering current instant occupied information in the method) that only automatically leave triggering method based on routine, self trigger based on pattern of automatically leaving above-mentioned of acquistion probability at least partly and to provide the more complete of Control and Schedule and statistically tuning more accurately.Reason relates to a large amount of activity sensing data sample for generating acquistion probability.From an angle, automatic departure process can be regarded as the mode of the environment of automatic test subscriber, take pattern with what learn user in more detail, and do not need to inquire the detailed problem of user, do not need to rely on correctness that user replys and do not need ad hoc to rely on the instant accuracy taking sensing hardware.
Figure 48 is the schematic diagram that the various states that controlled environment can be categorized into are shown.The realization of Figure 48 represents leaves/one or more features of automatic arrival method automatically, these realizations can be used as with reference to the realization described by Figure 45 alternative scheme or combine in some cases with reference to the realization described by Figure 45.Note, for the realization shown in Figure 48, not there is independent sleep state.Situation is provided as to enter normally leaves state 4820, but not comprises independent sleep state, normally leaves state 4820 and specifies, and when controlled environment Bu Shi enterprise, the time of one day is not in the afternoon between 8 and 8 a.m..For the nonbusiness during 8 and 8 a.m. in the afternoon, state will be transformed into home state 4810 from normally leaving state 4820.
Three kinds of states shown in Figure 48: home state 4810, intelligent thermostat follows Control and Schedule usually in this condition; Normally leave state 4820, during this state, set point temperatures is set to energy-conservation rank, such as AST; With state of leaving 4830 of spending a holiday, during this state, set point temperatures is set to energy-conservation rank, such as AVST.AST and AVST is configured to same temperature in some implementations.According to ad hoc fashion (according to which by the State Transferring of controlled environment to home state 4810), home state 4810 can be regarded as arrival state, automatically arrival state alternatively or manually arrive state.
In some implementations, (1) is when meeting the first set condition 4812 whole; Or (2) are when meeting the second set condition 4814 whole, can occur from home state 4810 to the conversion normally leaving state 4820.Condition 4812 comprises automatically to be left feature and to be activated and time from sensing last time is movable is greater than ASCW, and in some implementations, ASCW is initially configured to 120 minutes.In some implementations, activity sensor data were collected in the period, and the method finds the determination that a large amount of continuous print empty period does not have occupant's activity of sensing.Realize according to some, these periods are continuous print 5 minutes, and ASCW is initially realized as and equals 24 periods.But, realize according to some, the period of other sizes and the period of other quantity can be used, maybe can realize other schemes that detection takies (or unoccupied).
Condition 4812 also comprises that to leave set point temperatures be same with the current set point temperatures come into force at least as far as possible effective, normally leaves state can not save energy this is because otherwise move to.As previously mentioned, also comprise for entering the condition normally leaving state from home state: it is between 8 a.m. and at 8 in afternoon (or other suitable time intervals of staying up) that the time of one day installs for house.This kind of restriction cannot be used for enterprise and install, this is because occupant does not sleep usually in corporate environment, and can save significantly a large amount of energy in those time internal conversions to energy-conservation state of normally leaving.Condition 4812 time also comprised from handling recently should be less than the condition of ASCW, wherein, handle and refer to the manually instant control inputs of intelligent thermostat or mutual by remote web and/or PC interface, this makes intelligent thermostat convert from normally leaving state alternately.Such as, consider that occupant leaves the scene of the room of going to office, his or her residence work at 9 in the morning.In an office, user remotely directly or by the server log intelligent thermostat based on cloud, and changes the setting of one or more intelligent thermostat at 10 in the morning.All the other conditions supposing to have satisfied condition from 11 in the morning in 4812, then due in the manipulation of 10 in the morning, therefore until high noon (at 10 in the morning adds the ASCW of two hours) but not the morning 11 point, just enter and normally leave state 4820.
The time that condition 4812 also comprises from the set point change of last scheduled is greater than ASCW.Such as, when occupant in the afternoon 5 leave residence time, 6 have the set point change of scheduling in the afternoon, and ASCW has the duration of two hours, until at least at 8 in afternoon but not afternoon 7 point, just enter and normally leave state.Condition 4812 also comprises following condition: when intelligent thermostat is just carrying out operating according to manual covering or user has carried out equivalent behavior on telecommunication network interface, as long as the set point manually covered comes into force, just do not entering and normally leave state.Note, in some implementations, manually cover maintenance and come into force, until run into the set point of next scheduling.As an example, when user is when being in and manually improving set point temperatures from the set point temperatures of scheduling usually normal working hours, suppose the set point by day without the scheduling come into force, then when the set point dispatched improves this temperature, manual covering maintenance comes into force, until working day terminates.Due to the condition of this non-manual covering, be therefore in and before getting back on bed, manually heightened a day of dial user is sick, normally leaving state will not come into force.Condition 4812 also comprises following condition: intelligent thermostat should not be in disconnection (OFF) pattern.Another condition in condition 4812 is, when intelligent thermostat does not also have enough confidence level (its take sensor producing take data enough reliably), does not enter and normally leaves state 4820.Such as, can be following situation: intelligent thermostat has been installed in family and reliably can not have detected and take movable position, such as, after bookshelf or the end in the corridor of the end.These data and out of Memory (time of such as one day and the manual dial of user walking to go forward mutual) to be compared by process sensor data in automatically a period of time after mounting, intelligent thermostat can cancel the qualification automatically leaving feature because of low sensors'credence.
Condition 4814 belongs to following situation: in same structure, be provided with multiple intelligent thermostat, hereafter describe in further detail.As discussed in detail further, the intelligent thermostat needs being greater than the installation of number of thresholds be cooperative transformed into normally leave state before reach an agreement.When having another long-distance intelligent thermostat (it makes automatically to leave mark (" AAF ") and is set to unlatching (ON)) in controlled environment, if intelligent thermostat also do not sense any activity in ASCW, be not disconnected, start automatically leave and the time not between at 8 in afternoon of nonbusiness's structure and 8 a.m., then its AAF can be set to ON by this intelligent thermostat.In some implementations, what intelligent thermostat did not disturb another intelligent thermostat is transformed into the decision normally leaving state, even if when this intelligent thermostat has low sensors'credence.
Referring again to Figure 48, once intelligent thermostat has been transformed into normally leave state 4820, then this intelligent thermostat has kept this state, until (1) meets the first set condition 4816, in this case, intelligent thermostat is converted back to home state 4810; Or (2) meet the second set condition 4822, in this case, intelligent thermostat is converted back to state of leaving 4830 of spending a holiday.Get back to home state for from normally leaving State Transferring, condition 4816 comprises automatically arriving to be determined.Have been found that the condition be particularly useful realizes for the latch mechanism normally leaving state, thus when intelligent thermostat be transformed into normally leave state time, this state is latched specific a period of time, even if also will not turn back to home state when having in other side and automatically arriving and determine, this period will be called as " automatically arrive and suppress window " (" AAIW ").When from enter normally leave time state 4820 in AAIW time, as described in further detail about Figure 49, even if sense activity and/or run into the set point of scheduling, intelligent thermostat also remains in and normally leaves state 4820.In some implementations, AAIW is configured to 30 minutes.When through AAIW, the sensor activity in N number of continuous time causes turning back to home state 4810.In some implementations, the value that can adjust N is more responsive or more insensitive to the activity detected to make automatically to arrive function.In some implementations, the value of N is initially set to 2, thus when having sensing movable in two continuous times, automatically arrives generation.When through AAIW, the set point of the scheduling run into also causes automatic arrival.Walk to go forward with the manually mutual of intelligent thermostat and/or remote accessly manually intelligent thermostat also can be made to convert from normally leaving state 4820 and turn back to home state 4810 alternately.Finally, when automatically leave feature disabled or intelligent thermostat is disconnected time, intelligent thermostat turns back to home state 4810.Frequent combination is independently manually left and is arrived function and provides automatically leaving of described Figure 44 A-Figure 50 B and automatically arrive function.In some implementations, by walking to go forward intelligent thermostat dial select to leave on menu, or by using remote access facility to select to leave button or menu option, providing direct to user and calling the ability of the pattern of leaving immediately.For being called as this situation manually leaving pattern, intelligent thermostat continued operation under energy-conservation AST, no matter scheduling other side what indicates and no matter any sensing take activity, until user by manually arrive manually by intelligent thermostat from automatically leaving patten transformation out.For some realize, by walk to go forward dial and provide the input of any type or by login remote network access facility time carry out the mutual of any kind, realize manual arrival.
Now referring again to Figure 48, when meeting all conditions 4822, intelligent thermostat can be transformed into from normally leaving state 4820 state of leaving 4830 of spending a holiday.In order to move to state of leaving 4830 of spending a holiday, the time from the activity of sensing last time needs to be greater than VSCW, and realize according to some, VSCW is 48 hours.And the time handling from last time also needs to be greater than VSCW.
In some implementations, when all conditions 4832 meet, the conversion directly leaving state 4830 from home state 4810 to spending a holiday occurs.Note, in many cases, from normally leaving state 4820 but not entering from home state 4810 state of leaving 4830 of spending a holiday.But in other cases, intelligent thermostat directly can be transformed into spend a holiday from home state and leave state.Therefore, such as, there are the set points (such as represent wake, work, evening and sleep) of four scheduling but user has left in the typical case of taking a vacation in every day, intelligent thermostat can first day or a few days ago in change normally leaving between state and home state, set point for each scheduling gets back to home state from normally leaving State Transferring, then turn back to after each ASCW and normally leave state, until reach VSCW.When intelligent thermostat is in home mode on the time reaching VSCW, then state is directly transformed into spend a holiday from home state and leaves state, but, when intelligent thermostat be on the time reaching VSCW normally leave pattern time, then state directly leaves state from normally leaving State Transferring to spending a holiday.When having the set point change of very frequent scheduling, never can enter and normally leaving state, and intelligent thermostat directly will be transformed into spend a holiday from home state when reaching VSCW and leave state.Condition 4832 indicates, and in order to be transformed into from home state 4810 state of leaving 4830 of spending a holiday, needs startup automatically leaves function and activity sensor should have enough confidence levels.Additionally, as when condition 4832, the time from the activity of sensing last time and the time handling from last time should be greater than VSCW.
In some implementations, when satisfy condition arbitrary condition in 4834 time, leave state 4830 from spending a holiday and can occur to the conversion of home state 4820.Condition 4834 comprise intelligent thermostat any manipulation, sense in N number of continuous time activity or when automatically leave disabled or intelligent thermostat is disconnected time.
In some implementations, not existing to there is event of dissimilar correction is identified.What the first corrected do not exist is included in the detection taken in the time of the first threshold amount after being transformed into the state of leaving to there is event, in this case, there is probability can increase the first fixed amount or the amount relevant to present threshold value, to reduce the possibility that subsequent error is transformed into the state of leaving for triggering the threshold value being transformed into the state of leaving.This increase can be lost efficacy after fixing or that user sets up a period of time, or can lose efficacy gradually.The instant control inputs that what the second corrected do not exist by the instant control inerface of local intelligent thermostat within the time that there is event and be included in the Second Threshold amount after being transformed into the state of leaving, in this case, there is probability can increase the second amount for triggering the threshold value being transformed into the state of leaving, this second amount is greater than the first amount do not existed to there is event corrected for the first usually.
Further details about ASCW and AAIW is provided now.Figure 49 illustrates and relates to based on the empirical data from a large amount of actual family members to Figure 49 10 of the determination of Best Times threshold value and Figure 49 20, and Best Times threshold value is used for (1) triggering and automatically leaves state; (2) temporarily suppress automatically to arrive state when entering and automatically leaving state.In the example of Figure 49, single family members is tested, but utilize the suitable statistical combination of each result, be easy to conclude the method for multiple family members.Experiment can be carried out as follows: (can be such as the time period of 30 days for the time periods of N days, although other duration can be easy to application), the activity of sensor of taking is followed the tracks of for family members, and according to period of predetermined lasting time (such as 5 minutes) by its characterization.The feature taking pattern is binary function E (k), and for a specific kth period, when activity not detected in this interval, this function equals 0, and when activity being detected in this interval, this function equals 1.Figure 49 illustrates Figure 49 10 of function E (k), and this Figure 49 10 describes the feature of 288 periods of every day in the period of N days, and wherein, mark 4912 represents each and takies event.According to a realization, any specific feature taking the predicted value that event can have relative to the event that takies of follow-up generation is described, and process these feature interpretation with determine optimize automatically leave threshold value.Can by formed for each take event follow-uply take the figure of event time of arrival and then all those figure taken in event sued for peace to form histogram, generate this kind of feature interpretation.These steps are equivalent to the auto-correlation of computing function E (k), and it illustrates at Figure 49 20 place.Have been found that, for the data of the actual experiment adopted on a large amount of family members, the autocorrelation function of autocorrelation function or suitably smoothed version has central lobe and the first side lobe, this central lobe drops to somewhere near the paddy of very first time value T1, and this first side lobe starts at follow-up time T2 place to rise from from this paddy.In one implementation, value T1 is used as the time threshold that state is left in triggering automatically, and poor (T2-T1) is used as the time interval temporarily suppressing automatically to arrive state when entering and automatically leaving state.In series of experiments, find that T1 is about 120 minutes, and T2 is about 150 minutes.In one implementation, have to be used in and be supplied to list group threshold value T2 in all intelligent thermostat of client and T1, during the product development based on large statistical sample, calculate these quantity before.Other is realized, intelligent thermostat is installed for each individuality and is automatically carried out the process (comprise the tracking of the event of taking, auto-correlation and the lobe from autocorrelogram and determine T2 and T1) shown in Figure 49, thus one group of threshold value T2 and T1 of customization is provided, these threshold values are best for each specific family members.For other other realization, each intelligent thermostat carries out the tracking of the event that takies, and scheme E (k) and be upwards sent to Cloud Server, in order to carry out described auto-correlation and/or any various other for determining the statistic algorithm of the optimum value of T2 and T1.Then the value of T2 and T1 is downloaded to each intelligent thermostat by Cloud Server.
In some implementations, can carry out adjusting or adapt to improve automatically leaving automatic arrival behavior.When user manually enter leave pattern time, can suppose that house is unoccupied, when taking sensor and activity being detected, then can suppose that motion detection is wrong.Therefore, in some implementations, during manually leaving state, carry out checking to check whether activity sensor has detected automatic arrival.When detect this kind of movable time, then will take detection and be adjusted to and make arrival automatically insensitive.According to a realization, when sensor activity being detected in the last N number of continuous time in first 30 minutes that manually leave state, number N is increased 1.
According to another example, when temperature is manually arranged the temperature be input to lower than the set point of minimum energy by user, then can suppose that user wishes that this structure becomes unoccupied.This can be construed as entering manually leaving state, therefore when sensor activity being detected in the last N number of continuous time in first 30 minutes, several N is increased 1 to make arrival automatically insensitive.
In some implementations, based on punishment behavior adjustment ASCW.Such as, when user enter manually to make within first 30 minutes that normally leave state 4820 equipment from normally leave state 4820 get back to home state 4810 time, then increase ASCW.Have been found that in many cases, when this kind of experience, ASCS is increased and improve the operation automatically leaving function in 30 minutes.Intelligent thermostat can automatically operate, and goes back to make ASCW step-down when reaching time span (under this time span, state of normally leaving becomes seldom called).In some implementations, ASCW is increased to maximum ASCW, except the punishment event of adding, does not carry out the further increase exceeding maximum ASCW.
In some implementations, to realize the mode of other expected results, by integrated for the above-mentioned other side automatically leaving the operation of the hardware of function and intelligent thermostat.In one implementation, advantageously balance existence and the details of AAIW, to save power consumption, these electric power will use in the occupied detection hardware of other side and/or trigger.Therefore, in one implementation, owing to not needing when not taking action to sense some things, therefore forbid during AAIW and take sensing hardware in intelligent thermostat.Other is realized, for similar reason, manually leave pattern and/or spend a holiday leave pattern during can forbid and take sensing hardware.
In some implementations, intelligent thermostat improves, many sensings, by intelligent thermostat or the learning intelligence thermostat of Microprocessor S3C44B0X, it provides processing power, intuitively and visually pleasant user interface, the abundant combination of internet connectivity and energy saving capability (comprise aforementioned automatically leave/automatically arrive feature), do not need simultaneously from HVAC system so-called C electric wire or carry out the line power of oneself mesospore plug, even if the electric power that the electric power that this kind of improvement function can attract can provide safely than stealing feature (this stealing feature call delay extract minimal amount of power from one or more HVAC) is many.Intelligent thermostat is at least by using the onboard electric storage medium of rechargeable battery or ability equivalence to realize these targets, above-mentioned rechargeable battery or electric power storage medium are less than in the time interval of the electricity usage that stealing can provide safely in hardware electricity usage and charge, and carry out discharging to provide required additional power within the time interval that hardware electricity usage is greater than the electricity usage that stealing can provide safely.
In order to the conscious mode of battery with the serviceable life of the electricity usage and prolongation that promote the reduction of rechargeable battery operates, intelligent thermostat have following the two: (1) relatively powerful and the first processor that relatively power consumption is large, this first processor can carry out more complicated function rapidly, comprises driving visually pleasant user interface display and carries out various automatic learning calculating; (2) relatively so not powerful and the second processor that power consumption is little relatively, this second processor, for carrying out the task of less calculating strength, comprises driving and control takies sensor.In order to preserve valuable electric power, first processor is remained on the time period that sleep state reaches prolongation, and only first processor is activated for the scene of the ability needing first processor, but the second processor can be activated more continuously or more discontinuously to carry out the task of relative low-power.Manually configure first processor and the second processor, make the second processor can wake first processor up when some event occurs, these events can be called as wakes facility up.Can be switched on and off these as required and wake facility up, to realize various function and/or energy conservation object.Such as, wake PROX facility up can be provided to permission second processor and wake first processor up when the hand of user being detected near intelligent thermostat dial by active proximity transducer, thus can vision be provided to close user to show and be ready to respond more quickly when the hand contact thermostat dial of user.As another example, wake up PIR facility can be provided to permission second processor by passive infrared motion sensor near intelligent thermostat one band in somewhere motion detected time wake first processor up.Note, wake PIR up and automatic arrival is not synonym, this is because need N number of continuous time of the PIR activity sensed to call automatic arrival, and only single enough motion events can wake-up PIR active.
Wake PROX facility up to be the most often continuously enabled following system initialization, this is because PROX sensor is preferably configured to detect very near the significant user movement of intelligent thermostat.In one implementation, do not activate under home state and wake PIR facility up, thus by avoiding unnecessary the waking up of first processor to save electric power for intelligent thermostat, and activation wakes PIR facility up during normally leaving state, thus first processor can assess the intention of the motor activity detected.But, in one implementation, during AAIW, keep waking PIR facility up inactive to save electric power further, this is because intelligent thermostat is not transformed into automatically to expression patterns during AAIW.
In one implementation, below wake that to wake rule up with first processor be applicable up.As discussed above, during home state, forbidding wakes PIR facility up.During normally leaving state, when being less than AAIW from the time entered this state, forbidding wakes PIR facility up, but becomes to wake first processor up at the end of this interval of 30 minutes by set timer.During normally leaving state, when being greater than AAIW from the time entered this state, starting and waking PIR facility up, and become by set timer place's effective time of the next set point in intelligent thermostat scheduling to wake first processor up.During normally leaving state, when to have wake PIR event up time, within the residue duration for automatically arriving the period interval determined, forbidding wakes PIR facility up, and becomes to wake first processor up at the beginning of next period interval by set timer.Which save the electric power of the remainder for this period interval, this is because wake PIR event up be filled with this period and the PIR event of waking up of any additional sensing will be unnecessary during this period.Then again activate at the beginning of next period interval and wake PIR facility up.Save electric power, the sensing that simultaneously can detect N number of continuous time is movable.
Leave state for spending a holiday and also can adopt similar energy-saving scheme.Under leaving state on holiday, when being less than certain threshold time section from the time entered this state, forbidding wakes PIR facility up, but becomes to wake first processor up at the end of this interval by set timer.Under leaving state on holiday, when being greater than this threshold time section from the time entered this state, starting and wake PIR facility up, and set timer was become to wake first processor up in 24 hours.Under leaving state on holiday, when to have wake PIR event up time, within the residue duration for automatically arriving the period interval determined, forbidding wakes PIR facility up, and become to wake first processor up at the beginning of next period interval by set timer, thus save the electric power of the remainder for present period interval.
Further details about the operation when installing multiple intelligent thermostat is hereafter provided in some implementations.Figure 50 A illustrates specific controlled environment, such as family, and it has three thermostats being connected to two different HVAC system.Controlled environment 5000 comprises intelligent thermostat 5010, intelligent thermostat 5020 and intelligent thermostat 5030, intelligent thermostat 5010 and intelligent thermostat 5020 control the HVAC system downstairs 5042 being positioned at one deck downstairs, and intelligent thermostat 5030 controls the HVAC system upstairs 5040 being positioned at one deck upstairs.Become logically with when being associated at the same user account at management server 5060 place based on cloud at intelligent thermostat, three intelligent thermostat cooperate with one another to provide the best HVAC to controlled environment to control.This cooperation between three intelligent thermostat can be direct point-to-point cooperation can be maybe supervised cooperation; in supervised cooperation, central authorities based on cloud management server as under list in one or more supervise them: represent the main frame of two intelligent thermostat, judge mechanism, mediate mechanism, arbitration body and/or communication agency.In one example, what provide improvement leaves ability automatically, only when two intelligent thermostat have all sensed movable disappearance within the period of necessity, just calls and leaves operator scheme.For a realization, each intelligent thermostat sends to management server 5060 state of leaving when sensing inertia within the period of necessity and proposes, but is not transformed into the state of leaving, until receive approval from management server.Meanwhile, each intelligent thermostat sends recalling of state of the leaving proposal of intelligent thermostat when the activity that takies in controlled environment being detected.Only when have automatically leave proposal from each intelligent thermostat current time, central management server 5060 sends to all three intelligent thermostat and leaves state approval.Once be in collective to leave state, then when any intelligent thermostat sense take activity time, intelligent thermostat sends to the management server 5060 based on cloud and recalls, and conversely, management server 5060 sends to all three intelligent thermostat state of leaving and ratifies recall or arrive order.The cooperation of other types many between the intelligent thermostat that can realize common pairing, as in chapter above discuss.
Figure 50 B illustrates the example automatically leaving the realization of function of installing setting for many thermostats.This group intelligent thermostat (comprises intelligent thermostat 5010, intelligent thermostat 5020 and intelligent thermostat 5030) can cooperate to provide a kind of method automatically leaving function of improvement to be each intelligent thermostat maintenance group state information object, this information object comprises: (1) this locality leaves preparation (" AAR ") mark automatically, this mark reflects whether this single intelligent thermostat is carried out and automatically leaves preparation, (2) one or more opposite end AAR marks, in these these groups of mark reflection, whether other intelligent thermostat each is considered itself to carry out and is automatically left preparation.The local AAR of each intelligent thermostat marks the opposite end AAR be rendered as in the group state information object of other intelligent thermostat each in this group and marks.Allow each intelligent thermostat to change the local AAR mark of himself, but only allow each intelligent thermostat reading opposite end AAR to mark.It is central based on the management server of cloud and the function of collective of intelligent thermostat, in order to guarantee to keep the group state information object in each intelligent thermostat to have fresh information, especially, guarantees to keep AAR mark in opposite end to be current.This can such as realize in the following way: be programmed to by each intelligent thermostat and any change of the local AAR mark of this intelligent thermostat is sent to management server immediately, at this moment, other intelligent thermostat each that this change can be sent in this group by management server immediately marks to upgrade corresponding opposite end AAR.Also other method of the direct point-to-point communication between intelligent thermostat can be used.
In one implementation, under intelligent thermostat operates in common recognition pattern, thus when all AAR mark of this group be all configured to be (YES) or prepare (READY) time, each intelligent thermostat only enters and actually leaves state.Therefore, on any particular point in time, all intelligent thermostat in this group are all in the state of leaving, or do not have intelligent thermostat to be in the state of leaving.Conversely, each intelligent thermostat is configured and is programmed to, when meeting two standard sets one or both of, the AAR of intelligent thermostat mark is arranged to YES.First group of standard is met: (1) takies sensor according to intelligent thermostat, had and sense inactive period in the inertia interval of necessity when following content is real; (2) intelligent thermostat has determined to take sensed characteristic for the activation automatically leaving feature is enough reliably and accurately; (3) meeting for entering other reasonable standard automatically leaving pattern, such as, not forbidding before (a) user and automatically leaving function; B (), when controlled environment Bu Shi enterprise, the time is between 8 a.m. and at 8 in afternoon; C () intelligent thermostat is not in OFF pattern; D () leaves state temperature than current set point temperature is that energy is more effective; (e) user is remotely not mutual with intelligent thermostat by the management server based on cloud.Second group of standard is met: (1), according to the sensor of this intelligent thermostat, has had and sensed inactive period in the inertia interval of necessity when following content is real; (2) in this group, the AAR mark of at least one other intelligent thermostat has value YES; (3) above-mentioned all reasonable standards are met.Can be following situation: their rights and interests taking sensing data can be contributed and determine to organizing automatically to leave by intelligent thermostat all in this group, even if when feature is left in the one or more also un-activations in them automatically, as long as at least one member has activated automatically leave feature.Have been found that the method is for increasing energy-conservation reliability and the scalability of automatically leaving feature, wherein, reliability is improved by the multiple sensing station in controlled environment, and scalability is because the mistake of an intelligent thermostat settles validity or the applicability and being improved of the group common recognition do not jeopardized as a whole.
Said method is easy to be extended in the situation with multiple main intelligent thermostat and/or multiple auxiliary intelligent thermostat.Do not require to have the man-to-man corresponding relation between main intelligent thermostat in controlled environment and different HVAC system.Such as, there is many installations, wherein, single HVAC system can by the multiple districts in controlled damper service controlled environment, controlled damper can stop and/or being redirected from HVAC system, the air-flow of going to not same district and the air-flow in not same district.In such cases, can have main intelligent thermostat for each district, each main intelligent thermostat is linked to HVAC system and suitable damper, to regulate the weather in its corresponding district.
In the situation 5050 shown in Figure 50 B, two intelligent thermostat 5010 and 5020 in three intelligent thermostat have the AAR mark being set to YES, and this indicates them in ASCW, also do not sense activity and meet other standard.But the 3rd intelligent thermostat 5030 has the AAR mark being set to not (NO), such as, because it senses activity in the recent period.Because not every intelligent thermostat all has the AAR mark being set to YES, therefore determine it is not unanimous, so any intelligent thermostat does not enter the state of leaving.The example of situation 5050 can be, within the time period extended, the sole occupant in residence 5000 upstairs, therefore only has intelligent thermostat 5030 detecting and takies.
In situation 5052, all intelligent thermostat 5010,5020 and 5030 are all enough believable, in ASCW, also do not sense activity, and its AAR mark are set to YES.Therefore, the decision entering the state of leaving is unanimous, and implements to leave state in all intelligent thermostat.
In situation 5052, one of intelligent thermostat 5020 has not enough confidence level in its activity sensor data.Such as this may be because intelligent thermostat is by the fact of newly installing, or may due to for the poor arrangement taking sensing.Other two intelligent thermostat 5010 and 5030 have enough confidence levels, in ASCW, also activity do not detected, and its AAR mark are set to YES.In this case, intelligent thermostat 5020 sees that other YES marks and marked and change into YES.Decision is unanimous, and implements to leave state.In this case, the intelligent thermostat 5020 with low confidence level is not allowed to veto the decision of those two intelligent thermostat 5010 and 5030.
