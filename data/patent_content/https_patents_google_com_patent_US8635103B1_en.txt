Definitions
- This document relates to information presentation.
- the rise of the Internet has enabled access to a wide variety of content items, e.g., video and/or audio files, webpages for particular subjects, news articles, etc. Such access to these content items has likewise enabled opportunities for targeted advertising.
- One form of online advertising is advertisement syndication, which allows advertisers to extend their marketing reach by distributing advertisements to additional partners.
- advertisement syndication allows advertisers to extend their marketing reach by distributing advertisements to additional partners.
- third party online publishers can place an advertiser's text or image advertisements on webpages that have content related to the advertisement. As the users are likely interested in the particular content on the publisher webpage, they are also likely to be interested in the product or service featured in the advertisement. Accordingly, such targeted advertisement placement can help drive online customers to the advertiser's webpage.
- the development of the advertisements by the advertiser can be optimized by evaluating how an advertisement would perform across the publishers' webpages before the advertisement has actually been placed on the webpages.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method for calculating auction scores for advertisements.
- One or more webpages can be identified based on one or more signals associated with an advertisement, a content of each of the webpages, and a property associated with the advertisement.
- a performance measure for the advertisement for each of the webpages can be determined, and an auction score can be calculated for the advertisement for each of the webpages based on the performance measure and a bid associated with the advertisement.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding methods, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method for calculating auction scores for advertisements.
- An advertisement is received, wherein the advertisement is associated with one or more signals and a bid.

- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example online environment 100 .
- the online environment 100 can facilitate the identification and serving of content items, e.g., webpages, advertisements, etc., to users.
- a computer network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects advertisers 102 a and 102 b , an advertisement management system 104 , publishers 106 a and 106 b , user devices 108 a and 108 b , and a search engine 112 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- search engine 112 a search engine
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of advertisers, publishers and user devices.
- one or more advertisers 102 a and/or 102 b can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and track content item information in the advertising management system 104 .
- One form of a content item is an advertisement.
- Other forms of content items can include video files, image files, and audio files. While the description below refers to advertisements, other forms of content items can also be used.
- the advertisements can be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, advertisements combining one or more of any of such components, etc., or any other type of electronic advertisement document 120 .
- the advertisements may also include embedded information, such as a links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions, such as HTML or JavaScriptTM
- a user device such as user device 108 a , can submit a page content request 109 to a publisher or the search engine 112 .
- the page content 111 can be provided to the user device 108 a in response to the request 109 .
- the page content can include advertisements provided by the advertisement management system 104 , or can include executable instructions, e.g., JavaScriptTM, that can be executed at the user device 108 a to request advertisements from the advertisement management system 104 .
- Example user devices 108 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, television set-top boxes, etc.
- Advertisements can also be provided from the publishers 106 .
- one or more publishers 106 a and/or 106 b can submit advertisement requests for one or more advertisements to the system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending the advertisements to the requesting publisher 106 a or 106 b for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., webpages and other network-distributed content).
- the advertisements can include embedding links to landing pages, e.g., pages on the advertisers' 102 webpages, that a user is directed to when the user clicks an advertisement presented on a publisher webpage.
- the advertisement requests can also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page or other content document), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page or other content document
- category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- a publisher 106 can combine the requested content with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104 .
- This combined page content 111 and advertisements can be sent to the user device 108 that requested the content (e.g., user device 108 a ) as page content 111 for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the publisher 106 can transmit information about the advertisements back to the advertisement management system 104 , including information describing how, when, and/or where the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM)
- Publishers 106 a and 106 b can include general content servers that receive requests for content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, advertisements, music, video, graphics, search results, webpage listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested content in response to the request.
- content servers related to news content providers, retailers, independent blogs, social network sites, or any other entity that provides content over the network 110 can be a publisher.
- Advertisements can also be provided through the use of the search engine 112 .
- the search engine 112 can receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine 112 can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of webpages).
- An exemplary search engine 112 is described in the article S. Brin and L. Page, “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Search Engine,” Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, Brisbane, Australia and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,999.
- Search results can include, for example, lists of webpage titles, snippets of text extracted from those webpages, and hypertext links to those webpages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search engine 112 can also submit a request for advertisements to the system 104 .
- the request may include a number of advertisements desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the advertisements, etc.
- the request for advertisements may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., webpages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.
- the search engine 112 can combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the user device 108 that requested the content as the page content 111 .
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the advertisements, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.
- the advertisers 102 , user devices 108 , and/or the search engine 112 can also provide usage information to the advertisement management system 104 .
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served, such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or a selection related to an advertisement has occurred.
- the system 104 performs financial transactions, such as crediting the publishers 106 and charging the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- Such usage information can also be processed to measure performance metrics, such as a click-through rate (“CTR”), conversion rate, etc.
- CTR click-through rate
- a click-through can occur, for example, when a user of a user device, selects or “clicks” on a link to a content item returned by the publisher or the advertising management system.
- the CTR is a performance metric that is obtained by dividing the number of clicks on the content item, e.g., a link to a landing page, an advertisement, or a search result, by the number of times the content item was delivered. For example, if a link to a content item is delivered 100 times, and the content item was clicked on 3 times, then the CTR for that content item is 3%. Other usage information and/or performance metrics can also be used.
- a “conversion” occurs, for example, when a user consummates a transaction related to a previously served advertisement. What constitutes a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, a conversion may occur when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's webpage, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that webpage.
- a conversion can also be defined by an advertiser to be any measurable/observable user action such as, for example, downloading a white paper, navigating to at least a given depth of a Webpage, viewing at least a certain number of Webpages, spending at least a predetermined amount of time on a Webpage or Webpages, registering on a Webpage, etc. Other actions that constitute a conversion can also be used.
- the advertisements can also be selected from an auction.
- the advertisement management system 104 includes an auction process.
- Advertisers 102 may be permitted to select, or bid, an amount the advertisers are willing to pay for each presentation, interaction or other action (e.g., click of an advertisement) associated with the presentation of an advertisement.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the advertiser is willing to pay for each click of advertisement based on a keyword. For example, advertisers A, B, and C all select, or bid, a maximum cost-per-click of $0.50, $0.75, and $1.00, respectively.
- the maximum amount advertiser A will pay for a click is $0.50
- the maximum amount advertiser B will pay is $0.75
- the maximum amount advertiser C will pay is $1.00.
- the rank of an advertisement that is displayed can be determined by, for example, multiplying the maximum cost-per-click for the advertisement by a quality score of the advertisement.
- the advertisement can then be placed among other advertisements in order of increasing or decreasing rank. For example, suppose the quality score of advertisers A, B, and C are “3,” “1,” and “1,” respectively.
- the advertisers can be ranked as follows:
- An advertisement can also be associated with an actual cost-per-click.
- the actual cost-per-click of the advertisement can be determined by, for example, the maximum cost-per-click of the advertisement, quality score of the advertisement, and by the amount selected or bid by the advertiser directly below.
- the actual cost-per-click can be the price that is necessary to keep the advertisement's position above the next advertisement.
- the system 104 can determine how much the advertiser in position 1 would have to pay to give them a rank equal to the advertiser in position 2, and then the system 104 adds a unit amount, e.g., $0.01, to this determined amount.
- the rank of position 2 can be divided by the quality score of position 1 and $0.01 can be added to that amount.
- the last advertiser in the list can pay a minimum cost-per-click to hold the position in the list. For example, suppose the minimum cost-per-click is $0.20.
- advertiser A would only have to pay $0.34 to hold the first position in the list of advertisements.
- C would have to pay $0.76 to hold the second position.
- Advertiser B would be required to pay the minimum cost-per-click amount of $0.20.
- the advertisements, associated usage data, and bidding parameters described above can be stored as advertisement data in an advertisement data store 114 .
- An advertiser 102 can further manage the serving of advertisements by specifying an advertising campaign.
- the advertising campaign can be stored in campaign data in an advertisement data store 114 , which can, for example, specify advertising budgets for advertisements, when, where and under what conditions particular advertisements may be served for presentation, etc.
- a computer company may design an advertising campaign for a new laptop computer that is scheduled to be released on November 20.
- the advertising campaign may have a budget of $500,000, and may have 30 different advertisements that are to be served for presentation during the month of November.
- Such data defining the advertisement campaign can be stored in the advertisement data store 114 .
- the advertising management system 104 permits the serving of advertisements targeted to documents served by the publishers 106 and the search engine 112 . Additionally, the usage information and quality factors described above can be used by the advertisement management system 104 to serve higher performing advertisements that are more likely to elicit a response from users of the user devices 108 a and 108 b.
- An advertiser might not be able to anticipate where their advertisement will show on a large publisher network, and the system 104 can help the advertiser adjust keywords, creative, and bid to make sure they appear where they intended, and maximize their return on advertising investment.
- the serving of the advertisements can be further optimized by evaluating the competitiveness of the maximum cost-per-click, as well as keywords and creative associated with the advertisement.
- One technique for evaluating the effectiveness of these properties is to determine the content items (e.g., webpages) that an advertisement may be targeted to and providing information to the advertiser 102 about whether the properties associated with the advertisement will allow the advertisement 118 to enter the auction for the webpage and win the auction. Therefore the advertisement will show (i.e., win the auction a significant number of times).
- Information about performance characteristics e.g., number of impressions, clicks, and conversions
- the advertisement management system 104 may contain a contextual system 116 used in making this determination. In some implementations, similar techniques can be used for advertisements billed by conversion, and impression.
- the contextual subsystem 116 can receive an advertisement 118 from an advertiser.
- the advertisement 118 can include one or more properties.
- the advertisement 118 can, for example, include keywords that the advertiser wants to use to target the advertisement 118 .
- the advertisement 118 can also include a creative, as well as the maximum CPC the advertiser is willing to pay for the advertisement 118 .
- a creative can include an image and/or lines of text describing the advertisement 118 .
- the advertisement 118 can also be associated with an audience criterion.
- the audience criterion specifies the audience the advertiser associated with the advertisement 118 wants to see the advertisement 118 . For example, an advertiser may specify that the advertisement 118 can only to be shown on Spanish language websites.
- the contextual subsystem 116 can extract one or more signals 120 , 122 , 124 from the advertisement 118 .
- the signal can, for example, include terms associated with the advertisement 118 , concepts associated with the advertisement 118 , and vertical categories associated with the advertisement 118 .
- the terms can include the keywords submitted by the advertiser.
- the terms can also be extracted from the text of the creative.
- the terms can be extracted from the text of the advertisement landing page.
- the contextual subsystem 116 can extract a concept by analyzing the keywords as well as the creative associated with the advertisement 118 , and identify the concept based on the keywords and creative.
- Each concept includes sets of related words that include the same semantic concept. Concepts are more general than the terms, but are more specific and fine-grained than the broad vertical categories.
- a concept may include “home run, umpire, short stop, baseball stadium,” if the keywords and the creative generally describe baseball.
- the contextual subsystem 116 can also analyze the keywords and the creative and identify a vertical category associated with the advertisement 118 .
- the vertical category can include a broad category associated with the keywords and the creative.
- a vertical category can include “sports” if the keyword and the creative are about sports or even about a particular sport such as baseball.
- the signals 120 , 122 , 124 can include landing page text, historical performance associated with the advertisement 118 , and historical performance associated with advertisements that are similar to the advertisement 118 .
- the advertisement data store 114 can store content items (e.g., webpages, publications) associated with the publishers 106 .
- the contextual subsystem 116 can identify a series of the publishers' webpages 126 , 128 , 130 based on the one or more signals 120 , 122 , 124 as well as the content of the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 .
- the contextual subsystem 116 can identify the publisher's webpages 126 , 128 , 130 by searching for webpages that contain similar signals, i.e., terms, concepts, and vertical categories, as the advertisement 118 .
- the advertisement data 114 can also store information for each webpage about how high the system 116 scored a semantic relevance of the advertisements that recently entered the auction for that webpage and how well the auction winners performed in the auction on each webpage, as will be described in detail below.
- a webpage subsystem 117 can compare the content of the webpages stored in the advertisement data store 114 with the signals 120 , 122 , 124 of the advertisement 118 and calculate ad-page match scores based on how well each of the webpages match the signals 120 , 122 , 124 of the advertisement 118 .
- the ad-page match score can indicate a degree of relevance of each of the webpages to the signals 120 , 122 , 124 .
- the webpage subsystem 117 can calculate the ad-page match scores for a small subset of webpages that appear to have similar signals as the advertisement signals 120 , 122 , 124 .
- the webpage subsystem 117 can calculate the ad-page match score based on the degree of relevance. For example, the more relevant the content of the webpages are to the signals, the higher the ad-page rank score. In some implementations, if the content of the webpages are relevant to the signals, the webpage's content can be converted into the same type of term/cluster/vertical category signals as the advertisement 118 .
- the signals 120 , 122 , 124 can be weighted for the advertisement 118 .
- the content of the webpages are mapped into the same types of signals as the advertisement signals 120 , 122 , 124 .
- a direct comparison of webpage signals and the weights may be used to establish relevance.
- the webpage subsystem 117 can also use the audience criterion prior to calculating the ad-page match scores. For example, the webpage subsystem may compare the webpages that are associated only with the audience criterion with the signals 120 , 122 , 124 . For example, if the audience criterion is that the advertisement is only to be shown on Spanish language websites, the webpage subsystem 117 will only compare the signals with the webpages that are in Spanish.
- the webpage subsystem 117 can rank the webpages based on the scoring.
- the webpage subsystem 117 can, for example, select a select number of the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 , such as the top ranking scoring webpages.
- the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 are returned as matching webpages only if the ad-page match score of the advertisement 118 compared to the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 is at least as high as the ad-page match score of other recent advertisements that appeared on the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 . For example, if the lowest ad-page match score of an advertisement that appeared on a webpage 126 is “5,” the webpage subsystem 117 will only return webpage 126 as an identified webpage if an advertisement 118 has an ad-page match score when compared to webpage 126 of at least “5.”
- a prediction subsystem 131 can determine a predicted click-through rate (pCTR) 132 for the advertisement 118 on each of the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 .
- the pCTR is a prediction of how well the advertisement 118 would perform if the advertisement 118 were to be placed on the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 .
- the prediction subsystem 131 can analyze previous advertisements placed on the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 and compare these advertisements to the advertisement 118 and based on the comparison, predict how well the advertisement 118 may perform on each of the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 . In some implementations, the system can consider how similar advertisements have performed across the entire network. Other performance measures such as the relevance metric may also be used.
- the contextual subsystem 116 can calculate an auction score 134 based on the pCTR 132 and the maximum CPC associated with the advertisement 118 .
- the auction score 134 represents the score of the advertisement 118 if the advertisement 118 is submitted to the auction for each of the webpage 126 , 128 , 130 .
- the auction score 134 can help determine whether the advertisement 118 , with the current CPC bid, would be eligible to show if participating in the auction for the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 .
- the contextual subsystem 116 can, for example, calculate the auction score 134 by multiplying the pCTR 132 of each of the webpages 128 , 130 , 132 by the maximum CPC of the advertisement 118 .
- the contextual subsystem 116 may generate a report.
- the report can include the auction score 134 on each of the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 as well as the auction scores of other advertisements that were previously displayed on the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 .
- the report can be provided to the advertiser 102 associated with the advertisement 118 .
- the report can show the advertiser the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 that were identified as potential websites that the advertisement 118 may appear on as well as the auction scores of advertisements on each of the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 .
- the report may also indicate the auction score of the advertisement 118 on each of the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 .
- the report can also include information about the number of queries for advertisement 118 on each of the webpage 126 , 128 , 130 and the fraction of auctions won to indicate number of impressions.
- the report may also indicate the number of clicks, as determined by the pCTR and the number of impressions.
- the report may also estimate budget spent on the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 , as determined by the number of clicks of the advertisement 118 and the CPC.
- the report might include typical values of these metrics for other advertisements that have shown on the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 .
- the report may also aggregate these metrics into overall metrics and/or by site, domain, or other groupings of pages in addition to or in place of some or all of pages' individual results.
- the advertiser can, for example, see that the maximum CPC of the advertiser was not high enough for the auction score of the advertisement 118 to appear on one of the webpages 126 , 128 , 130 .
- the advertiser 102 may also see that the advertisement's keywords and creative were interpreted by the system in a way that the advertiser 102 did not intend, and that the advertiser 102 needs to add/delete/edit keywords to obtain the desired targeting, or the desired number of impressions, clicks, and conversions. This is explained in detail below.
- FIG. 2 illustrates an example advertisement 202 that is submitted to the system 104 to determine whether the maximum cost-per-click associated with the advertisement 202 is high enough to return an auction score that will allow the advertisement 202 to win the auction for one or more webpages, as well as to determine the specific webpages where the advertiser will win the auction or the set of webpages where the advertiser may enter the auction but fail to win.
- an advertiser of flowers may submit an advertisement 202 to the advertisement management system 104 .
- the advertisement 202 is associated with a creative “Gorgeous Flowers Roses, Marigolds, and Daffodils! Get nature's most beautiful here!
- the advertiser may also submit the keywords “flowers, pretty flowers, beautiful flowers, gorgeous flowers, roses, marigolds, daffodils.”
- the advertiser also submit a maximum CPC of $1.00, therefore the advertiser is willing to pay a maximum cost-per-click amount of $1.00 for each click on the advertisement 202 .
- the advertiser also indicates that the advertisement 202 should only appear on English webpages shown to users in the United States.
- the contextual subsystem 116 can submit the audience criterion of the advertisement, e.g., English webpages, users from the United States with to the webpage subsystem 117 to identify webpages that meet the audience criterion. Once the webpages that meet the audience criterion are determined, the contextual subsystem can extract signals from the advertisement 202 . The contextual subsystem 116 can, for example, extract terms, a concept, and a vertical category from the keywords and the text associated with the advertisement 202 . The contextual subsystem 116 can submit the signals to the webpage subsystem 117 to identify webpages on which the advertisement 202 may appear. The webpage subsystem 117 can compare the signals to the publisher's webpages previously identified as matching the audience criterion in the advertisement data store 114 and determine an ad-page match score for the webpages and the advertisement 202 .
- the contextual subsystem 116 can submit the audience criterion of the advertisement, e.g., English webpages, users from the United States with to the webpage subsystem 117 to identify webpages that meet
- ad-page match scores are calculated for a small subset of all the webpages in the advertisement data store 114 . For example, the webpages that have signals that are similar to the signals of the advertisement 202 .
- the webpage subsystem 117 identified three webpages, www.flowers.com 204 , www.roses.com 206 , and www.beauty-products.com 208 as the highest ranked pages according to the ad-page match scores.
- the webpage subsystem 117 calculated ad-page match scores of 5.0 for www.flowers.com 204 , 10.0 for www.roses.com 206 , and 2.5 for www.beauty-products.com 208 for the gorgeous-flowers.com advertisement 202 .
- the webpage subsystem 117 can then compare the three ad-page match scores calculated for each of the webpages 204 , 206 , 208 against a cumulative distribution of past matching scores to determine what fraction of each of the webpage's 204 , 206 , 208 auctions the gorgeous-flowers.com advertisement 202 is expected to enter.
- the contextual subsystem 116 determines for all the auctions ran for www.flowers.com 204 , the worst-targeted advertisements had ad-page match scores between 2.0 and 4.0. For www.roses.com 206 , the worst-targeted advertisements had ad-page match scores between 3.0 to 5.0, and for www.beauty-products.com 208 the worst-targeted advertisements had ad-page match scores between 4.0 to 6.0.
- the www.gorgeous-flowers.com advertisement 202 had an ad-page match score of 5.0 on www.flowers.com 204 , so it could potentially enter all of www.flowers.com's auctions because the range of the worst-targeted advertisements on www.flowers.com 204 was between 2.0 and 4.0, and 5.0 is higher than this range, so www.flowers.com 204 is returned as a matching page.
- www.roses.com 206 because the range of the worst-targeted advertisements on www.roses.com 206 was between 3.0-5.0, and the ad-page match score 10 of the advertisement 202 is higher than this range, so www.roses.com 206 is returned as a matching page.
- www.beauty-products.com 208 the advertisement was targeted with an ad-page match score of only 2.5, while the worst-targeted advertisement that entered an auction on www.beauty-products.com 208 had a score of 4.0.
- the contextual subsystem 116 can determine that the gorgeous-flowers.com advertisement 202 does not match the content of www.beauty-products.com 208 as well as the advertisements we have typically auctioned there, and therefore that it won't enter www.beauty-product.com's advertisements auction. Therefore, www.beauty-products.com 208 is not returned as a matching webpage, even though it had superficially similar content to the input advertisement 202 and matched the initial query.
- the contextual subsystem 116 has established that the gorgeous-flowers.com advertisement 202 can enter the auction for www.flowers.com 204 and www.roses.com 206 .
- the contextual subsystem 116 can then determine whether the advertisement 202 can win the auction on either of these sites.
- the contextual subsystem 116 uses a prediction subsystem 131 to find predicted click-through rates for the advertisement 202 on www.flowers.com 204 and www.roses.com 206 , and combines those click-throughs with the advertisement 202 's bid to obtain an auction score for the advertisement 202 on each of the pages www.flowers.com 204 and www.roses.com 206 .
- the contextual subsystem 114 can keep distributions of the minimum auction score that is needed to win the auction in the same way that it kept distributions of minimum ad-page match scores that are needed to enter each auction. If, for example, the worst advertisement in all auctions on www.flowers.com 204 always had an auction score of at least 0.5 and the worse advertisement in all auctions on www.roses.com 206 always had an auction score of at least 2.5, then even though the advertisement 202 has a higher auction score on www.roses.com (auction score 2) than it does on www.flowers.com (auction score of 1), only on www.flowers.com 204 can the new advertisement 202 ever win the auction and display on the webpage.
- the contextual subsystem 116 can determine that the advertisement 202 will only display on www.flowers.com 204 .
- the contextual subsystem 116 can, for example, generate a report with the information that the advertisement 202 will win the auction on www.flowers.com 204 and not on www.roses.com 206 , and return it to the advertiser of the advertisement 202 .
- the advertiser can then determine that in order to enter the auction on www.roses.com 206 , the advertiser may need to raise the maximum CPC from $1.00 to win the auction on www.roses.com 206 .

- the webpage subsystem 117 can compare the one or more signals to the one or more webpages.
- the webpage subsystem 117 can compare an audience criterion with the webpages and identify the webpages that match the audience criterion. Then the webpage subsystem 117 can compare the one or more signals to the identified webpages.
- the process 400 determines a relevancy measure for each of the one or more first content items, each relevancy measure indicating a degree of relevance of a respective first content item to the signals ( 404 ).
- the webpage subsystem 117 can determine a relevancy measure for each of the one or more webpages, each relevancy measure indicating a degree of relevance of a respective webpage to the signals.
- the relevancy measure can, for example, include an ad-page match score.
- the process 400 identifies the one or more first content items based on the determination ( 406 ).
- the webpage subsystem 117 can identify the one or more webpages based on the determination.
- FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of an example process 500 for calculating auction scores for the second content item (e.g., advertisement).
- the process 500 can, for example, be implemented in the advertisement management system 104 of FIG. 1 , or in some other hardware and software computing device.
- the process 500 receives a second content item, wherein the second content item is associated with one or more signals and a bid ( 502 ).
- the contextual subsystem 116 can receive an advertisement, wherein the advertisement is associated with one or more signals and a bid.
- the advertisement can also be associated with an audience criterion.
- the process 500 identifies one or more first content items based on the one or more signals ( 504 ).
