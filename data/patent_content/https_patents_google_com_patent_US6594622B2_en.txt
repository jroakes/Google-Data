Definitions
- This invention relates generally to systems and methods for recording and processing time series data, i.e., numeric data that are recorded in time sequence, and particularly to a system and method for predicting an extreme change in a time series given past given past values of the series using symbol extraction.
- Noise can be due to measurement error of the time series, or due to process noise which arises in situations where the data that are measured are subject to shocks due to the data generation process.
- a future stock value of a time series
- process noise due to the impact of every trader on the market.
- the measurements are due to process noise.
- Moving averages are computed by taking subsets of sequences of numbers, computing the average of those numbers, recording the result, and then shifting the subset by one unit in time.
- Other noise reduction techniques include the application of a digital filter. Essentially, most of the noise reduction techniques rely on moving averages of the data, which do not generate symbol sequences.
- a method for extracting symbols from a numeric time series comprising the steps of: receiving a finite time series of data elements for a particular application, the data elements characterized as having one or more sharp changes in values; for each sharp change in the finite time series, extracting a window of elements from the time series that precedes each sharp change; building a matrix from the time series window extracts; performing singular value decomposition on the built matrix to obtain characteristic matrices; and, obtaining vectors of symbols from resulting characteristic vectors determined from the singular value decomposition step, wherein the resulting symbols are used by forecasting algorithm to predict a future sharp change in subsequent finite time series received for the application.
- the sets of finite symbols obtained may be used as the basis for applications requiring the prediction of an extreme change in a received time series.
- FIG. 1 ( a ) indicates an example disaster indicator indicating an extreme event relating to a time series of data.
- FIGS. 1 ( b ) and 1 ( c ) indicate respective example time series data signals e(t) and y(t) signals for determining extreme behavior signals used for forecasting extreme events in accordance with the principles of the invention.
- FIGS. 2 ( a )- 2 ( f ) illustrate a first six “extreme event” symbols that are derived for the example time series data according to the invention.
- FIG. 3 is a flow chart depicting the methodology for extracting symbols from numeric time series data for forecasting extreme events according to the invention.
- the method of the present invention as depicted in FIG. 3 includes steps for:
- step ( 20 ) (1) extracting a window of the time series data that immediately precedes each sharp change (step ( 20 ));
- step ( 60 ) (4) using the resulting characteristic vectors as the symbols in a forecasting algorithm to predict a future sharp change in subsequent numeric finite time series data received (step ( 60 )).
- a sharp (extreme) change is defined as being a change of 30% in the time series over 10 units of time.
- symbol extraction algorithm is as follows:
- the next step involves computing the well known singular value decomposition (“svd”) of the resulting matrix X. That is:
- the columns of the matrix U are the left singular vectors of the matrix A and the column space of the matrix V (or the row space of V T ) are the right singular vectors of the matrix A;
- the symbols to be used for subsequent forecasting are held in the matrix V.
- the predetermined number of columns of the characteristic matrix V in which the dot product is computed is the first five (5) columns. In theory, it may be any number between 1 and W.
- FIG. 1 ( a ) illustrates a disaster indication 50 for a company with ticker XXXX.
- FIG. 1 ( b ) illustrates the extreme behavior signal e(t) indicating variations in stock price as compared to the 30% disaster threshold 60 .
- the location of the disaster is indicated in the FIG. 1 ( b ) by arrow A.
- an extreme events library in the form of a matrix X is formed.
- Each row of the matrix X corresponds to the W values of the time series that precede an extreme event.
- the size of the matrix X is N ⁇ W.
- FIG. 2 illustrates the first six (6) “extreme event” symbols 101 - 106 that are derived for the stock index for that particular year according to the invention.
- the extreme event symbols are generated, a search is conducted for those symbols in another time series. Thus, if there is a window in time where the time series includes those symbols, it is likely that an extreme event will occur.
- the next step includes mapping new signals onto the extreme event signals: For example, if it is desired to predict extreme events for the Russell 200 stock index for the next year, the following steps are performed:
