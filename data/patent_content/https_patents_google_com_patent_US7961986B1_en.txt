Definitions
- the subject matter of this specification relates generally to image annotation.
- Image search engines have become a popular tool on the Internet. These search engines help users find images that match their criteria. Some of these search engines index images by keywords or labels. Such image search engines retrieve images by matching users' search queries against these keywords or labels.
- the keywords or labels for indexing an image can be drawn from text surrounding the image in a web page or other text associated with the image (e.g., the filename of the image, metadata associated with the image), for example.
- the keywords or labels can provide some indication of the content of an image. For example, an image of a horse can be associated with the keyword “horse.”
- the keywords for an image that are extracted from the text may be uninformative or not useful. For example, words such as “cool” and “wow” generally are uninformative with regard to the content of an image. Poorly labeled images can degrade the quality of an image search result.
- a method in a first general aspect, includes determining a score for an image of a plurality of images with respect to each of one or more terms, identifying one or more of the terms for each of which the score for the image with respect to the respective identified term satisfies a criterion, and associating the identified terms with the image. Determining the score for the image with respect to a respective term includes determining probabilities of navigating between images in the plurality of images and determining the score for the image with respect to the respective term based on the probabilities.
- a system in a second general aspect, includes a computer-readable medium, one or more processors, and instructions stored in the computer-readable medium and configured for execution by the one or more processors.
- the instructions include instructions to determine a score for an image of a plurality of images with respect to each of one or more terms, identify one or more of the terms for each of which the score for the image with respect to the respective identified term satisfies a criterion, and associate the identified terms with the image.
- the instructions to determine the score for the image with respect to a respective term comprises instructions to determine probabilities of navigating between images in the plurality of images and determine the score for the image with respect to the respective term based on the probabilities.
- a system in a third general aspect, includes means for determining a score for an image of a plurality of images with respect to each of one or more terms, means for identifying one or more of the terms for each of which the score for the image with respect to the respective identified term satisfies a criterion, and means for associating the identified terms with the image.
- the means for determining the score for the image with respect to a respective term includes means for determining probabilities of navigating between images in the plurality of images and means for determining the score for the image with respect to the respective term based on the probabilities.
- a method in another general aspect, includes identifying a set of images. One or more of the images are associated with a set of one or more terms. The method also includes determining probabilities of navigating between images in the set of images, ranking each term in the set of terms with respect to an image of the set of images based on the probabilities, and associating with the image a term of the set of terms that has a highest ranking with respect to the image.
- a method in yet another general aspect, includes identifying a set of images. At least a subset of the images is associated with a term. The method also includes determining probabilities of navigating between images in the set of images, ranking each of the set of images with respect to the term based on the probabilities, and selecting an image of the set of images that has a highest ranking with respect to the term.

- the image search system 104 can determine terms to be associated with an image based on user testing. For example, the image search system 104 can show a population of users an image and ask the users to specify terms that come to mind when they see the image and optionally order them.

Further details regarding the identification of features and the determination of the degree of similarity are described below.
- the probabilities module 208 determines estimated transitional probabilities for pairs of images.
- a transitional probability between images is a probability that a user will select an image given another image under particular conditions. Further details regarding transitional probabilities are described below.
- Image indexing module 210 indexes images according to the terms associated with an image. The indexing enables searching of the images based on the terms, and in particular, using queries that contain terms.
- the image search server 212 processes search queries for images and returns search results in response to the queries.
- a search query for images can include one or more terms.
- the image search module 212 receives a query (from a user device 108 , for example), finds images (e.g., images from content hosts 106 and indexed in image repository/index 214 ) that satisfy the search query, and returns the search results.

- FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating an example process 300 for associating terms with an image.
- the process 300 will be described with reference to a system (e.g., image search engine 200 ) that performs the process.
- images are received ( 302 ).
- the images can be received as part of a crawl, by image crawling module 202 , for example, of content hosts hosting the images.
- the images can also or alternatively be received from an upload of images to the system.
- content associated with the images e.g., web pages in which the images are located
- These received images are indexed by the image indexing module 210 .
- a received image can be associated with one or more terms.
- the image search engine can read the metadata of the image for an image and extract any title, description, category, keyword, or other terms from the metadata and associate the terms with the image.
- terms that can be associated with the image can be determined from other content associated with the image (e.g., web page in which the image is located or anchor text of hyperlink to the image). Any number of the images can be associated with a particular term, and an image can be associated with multiple terms.
- the terms are extracted from the metadata or other content associated with the image, without any discrimination as to whether a term is useful.
- a metric can be determined for terms, and terms with values for the metric that are above a threshold or satisfy some criterion are selected and associated with the image.
- the metric is the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) of the term. For example, say that an image is included in a web page that includes terms X and Y. If term X has a TFIDF with respect to the web page that is above a predefined threshold and the TFIDF for term Y is not above the threshold, then term X, and not term Y, is associated with the image. Using the TFIDF as a metric can be useful for removing relatively uninformative terms (e.g., “a,” “the,” prepositions, etc.) from consideration.
- Similarity scores are determined for pairs of images ( 304 ). For example, an image can be paired with one or more of the remaining images, and for each pair, image similarity module can determine a degree of similarity between the image pair. Further details regarding the determination of a degree of similarity between a pair of images are described below in reference to FIG. 4 .
- Probabilities of navigation between the images are determined ( 306 ).
- probabilities module 208 can determine a transitional probability P(A ⁇ >B) (i.e., the transitional probability as described in relation to the image term ranking functions TRA or TRB described above).
- P(A ⁇ >B) is approximated using the similarity between images A and B and exploiting the insights that: (1) the user is likely to navigate to an image that is more similar to A than to an image that is less similar to image A, and (2) the user is likely to ignore images that are too similar to image A.
- the transitional probability is estimated by defining a beta distribution over the image similarity. An example beta distribution is illustrated in graph 500 in FIG. 5 .
- the x-axis is the image similarity ([0,1]) between two images and the y-axis is the corresponding transitional probability.
- the transitional probability increases monotonically as the image similarity increases, up to a certain point. After the image similarity has reached a certain point, the transitional probability decreases monotonically. In other words, the transitional probability decreases when the two images are too similar to each other.
- the function can be linear.
- the function can also be specified explicitly by the user (diversity, etc), or estimated and learned from how user interacts with the images from usage data.
- the function can be estimated/learned for each user, or for a collection of users (those fit into one demographic group).
- the determination of the transitional probability can be augmented by including one or more additional factors.
- a metric of the quality of image B is included.
- image quality can be measured using one or more query-independent indicia of image quality (e.g., color depth of the image, how much of the image is in focus, level of saturation in the image, and so on).
- the image quality metric is a score between 0 and 1, inclusive, that is a function of the one or more indicia of image quality.
- another additional factor is a similarity of images A and B based on a relationship between pages or locations from which images A and B were crawled (e.g., pages or locations where images A and B are hosted). For example, images crawled from related web pages (e.g., same blog, same website, pages in the same social network) can be considered to be more similar than images from unrelated web pages.
- An example of a relationship-based similarity is a structural-context similarity, which is disclosed in Jeh et al., “SimRank: A Measure of Structural-Context Similarity,” Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, July 2002, pages 538-543.
- a score for the relationship-based similarity (e.g., a structural-context similarity score) can be calculated and used as an additional factor in the approximation of the transitional probability.
- Click data can also be used to enhance the transitional probability estimate. For example, “co-click data” may measure the likelihood that an image is viewed before or after another image. Given a sufficient amount of co-click data, then transitional probability can be computed from it. Given limited co-click data, then it can be used to refine an estimation of image transition from similarity measurements.
- the additional factors can be used, along with the image similarity, to approximate, estimate, or otherwise determine the transitional probability.
- the probability P(A ⁇ >B) is a function of a product of the image similarity and the additional factors.
- P(A ⁇ >B) can be proportional to the product of the image similarity score between images X and Y, the image quality score of image Y, and the relationship-based similarity score between images X and Y.
- the probability P(X ⁇ >Y) is a function of a linear combination of the image similarity and the additional factors.
- P(X>Y) can be proportional to a linear combination of the image similarity score between images X and Y, the image quality score of image Y, and the relationship-based similarity score between images X and Y.
- any suitable function can be used to derive a transitional probability value from an image similarity metric and any number of additional factors.
- the transitional probability is 0.
- scores with respect to each of one or more terms are determined ( 308 ).
- the scoring and ranking module 209 can determine a score under image term ranking function TRA or TRB for an image with respect to each of one or more terms.
- the output is one or more scores for an image, where each score is with respect to a respective term.
- the output is a score for I with respect to a term M, a score for I with respect to a term N, and so on.
- Terms for which the score for the image with respect to the term satisfies a criterion are identified ( 310 ).
- the scoring and ranking module 209 can identify terms for which the score for an image with respect to the term satisfies one or more particular criteria.
- the particular criteria depend on the particular objective. For example, if the objective is to identify a single “best” term for an image, then a criterion can be that the score for the image with respect to the term is the highest among the scores for the image with respect to each of one or more terms.
- a criterion can be that the score for the image with respect to the term is greater than a predetermined threshold and/or that the score be in the top N among the scores for the image with respect to each of one or more terms, where N is a natural number greater than 0.
- the image search engine 200 associates the identified terms with the image ( 312 ). For example, the image indexing module 210 can add the identified terms as keywords for the image in the index 214 . When a user enters a query that includes the identified terms, the image can be included as a search result.
- Process 300 determines scores for an image with respect to each of one or more terms and identifies terms for which the scores for the image with respect to the terms satisfy a criterion.
- the reverse i.e., determining scores for one or more images with respect to a term and identifying images whose scores with respect to a term satisfy a criterion, can be performed.
- the objective can be the identification of a “most relevant” image or “relatively more relevant” images for a term among one or more images; the criteria for identifying images can be the image with the highest score with respect to the term or images whose scores with respect to the term are above a predetermined threshold and/or are in the top N, respectively. Further details regarding determining scores for one or more images with respect to a term are described below.
- FIG. 4 illustrates the determination of a degree of similarity between a pair of images (in reference to block 304 , FIG. 3 ) in further detail.
- FIG. 4 will be described with respect to a pair of images “Image A” and “Image B.”
- the described process can be performed on any pairing of images, and thus degrees of similarities can be determined for any number of pairs of images in the received set of images.
- One or more global and/or local features of Image A and one or more global and/or local features of Image B are identified ( 402 ).
- image features include image features based on, for example, intensity, color, edges, texture, or other aspects of the image.
- Features can be extracted using wavelet transforms or other convenient techniques. For example, regarding intensity, each image may be divided into small patches (e.g., rectangles, circles or polygons) and an intensity histogram computed for each patch. Each intensity histogram may be used as a feature for the image. Similarly, as an example of a color-based feature, a color histogram may be computed for each patch (or for different patches) within each image.
- a color histogram can be similarly computed to obtain a color-based histogram.
- the color histogram may be calculated using any color space, e.g., the RGB (red, green, blue) color space, YIQ (luma and chrominance), or another color space.
- Histograms can also be used to represent edge and texture information. For example, histograms can be computed based on patches of edge information or texture information in an image. For wavelet based techniques, a wavelet transform may be computed for each patch and used as an image feature.
- the features discussed above represent an exemplary list of possible image features that may be used for determining similarities between images. Other image features may be used.
- the features are identified using the known scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT).
- SIFT scale-invariant feature transform
- An examples of the SIFT technique is described in Lowe, “Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints,” International Journal of Computer Vision , Vol. 60, Issue 2 (2004), pp. 91-110.
- a global feature is a feature that is identified for the image as a whole. For example, a color or intensity histogram of the entire image is a global feature.
- a local feature is a feature that is identified for a portion of the image. For example, a color or intensity histogram of a patch in the image is a local feature.
- features may be computed only for certain areas within images. For example, “objects of interest” within an image may be determined and image features may only be computed for the objects of interest. For example, if the image feature being used is a color histogram, a histogram may be computed for each patch in the image that includes an object of interest.
- Objects of interest within an image can be determined in a number of ways. For example, for color, objects of interest may be defined as points where there is high variation in color (i.e., areas where color changes significantly). Objects of interest can be determined mathematically in a variety of ways and can be based on determining discontinuities or differences from surrounding points.
- the objects of interest are determined based on points of interest (or “keypoints”) identified in the image.
- the SIFT technique is an example of one technique for locating keypoints and objects of interest and features for these keypoints.
- the computed image features are features that are local to the keypoints or objects of interest.
- a feature identified for a keypoint includes a position (e.g., X-Y coordinates of the image, orientation, and scale (e.g., radius of a patch centered on the keypoint).
- a position e.g., X-Y coordinates of the image, orientation, and scale (e.g., radius of a patch centered on the keypoint).
- Image A is an image of the Eiffel Tower, where the Eiffel Tower takes up a large portion of the image
- Image B is an image of a tourist with the Eiffel Tower in the background, where the Eiffel Tower takes up a small portion of the image.
- keypoint identification points on the Eiffel Tower in Image A and on the Eiffel Tower in Image B can be identified as keypoints. The comparison of these features may indicate that Image B contains an object (Eiffel Tower) that is in Image A, and vice versa.
- the various features described above may be computed using different image scales. For example, an image can be examined and features computed in its original scale and then features may be successively examined at smaller scales. Additionally or alternatively, features may be selected as features that are scale invariant or invariant to affine transformations.
- the SIFT techniques for example, can be used to extract distinctive invariant objects from images. The extracted objects are invariant to image scale and rotation.
- the identified features are compared; the features of Image A are compared to the corresponding features of Image B ( 404 ).
- a degree of similarity (or a “similarity score”) between Image A and Image B is determined based on the comparison ( 406 ).
- a comparison function may be selected.
- a number of different comparison functions may be used to compare images.
- the particular comparison function to use may be decided offline or in non-realtime operation.
- the output of the comparison function can be used to determine the similarity.
- the similarity can be a linear combination of the outputs of the comparison functions.
- a comparison function may operate to generate a value defining a similarity measure between a particular feature in one image and the corresponding feature in another image.
- a simple histogram comparison function which is described in pseudo-code in Table I, below. As shown in Table I, the histogram comparison function returns a value that is the sum of the absolute values of the differences between corresponding bins in the input histograms. Smaller values returned from this function indicate greater similarity between the input histograms.
- the histogram comparison function of Table I is exemplary, and other comparison functions can be used to compare histograms. For example, squared differences may be used rather than absolute differences, bin correlations may be taken into account instead of absolute differences, or percent differences may be used instead of absolute differences. Additionally, for image features other than those based on histograms, different comparison functions may be used.
- image features module 204 and image similarity module 206 can be initially configured to use one or more image features and one or more comparison functions. After these initial acts, image features module 204 and image similarity module 206 may function in a realtime mode to determine pairwise degrees of similarity for a set of input images, such as images received from a crawl by image crawling module 202 .
- the similarity between Image A and Image B is a linear combination of scores from comparisons between corresponding features of Image A and Image B.
- An example algorithm for calculating the image similarity is shown in pseudo-code in Table II, below.
- each feature F A of Image A is compared with every feature F B of Image B that is the same feature type.
- F A is a color histogram then the comparison is performed with the color histogram features of Image B, if F A is an edge histogram then the edge histogram features of Image B are compared, etc.
- each image feature is weighted equally.
- different features may be weighted differently. For example, color-based features may be less important than intensity or edge-based features. Accordingly, a features similarity score may be multiplied by a weight that reflects the importance of the particular feature.
- the degree of similarity between two images is calculated as the number of shared keypoints (i.e., keypoints whose feature(s) match) divided by the total number of keypoints.
- Table II can be relatively computationally expensive if repeated for many images, as it requires N 2 comparisons for a set of N images, and for each comparison, M i *M j feature comparisons, for M i and M j local features in each image.
- Techniques are known that may accelerate this type of operation. For example, one such technique is described in Grauman et al., “The Pyramid Match Kernel: Discriminative Classification with Sets of Image Features,” Tenth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (October 2005), Vol. 2, pp. 1458-1465.
- FIG. 4 was described with respect to a single pair of images, Image A and Image B.
- the process described can be repeated for any number of unique pairs of images amongst a set of multiple images, where each image in the set can be paired with each other image in the set.
- a degree of similarity can be determined for each unique pair of images among the set.
- degrees of similarity can be calculated for a subset of all of the unique pairs of images in the set of images.
- the image pairs for which a degree of similarity is to be calculated can be a random sample of all of the unique pairs of images in the set; the degrees of similarity for the rest of the pairs can be approximated by other less computationally expensive metrics. Examples of such metrics include, for example, a shortest path between two nodes, in an image similarity graph, corresponding to a pair of images.
- Process 300 above describes determining scores for an image with respect to a term.
- the method of calculating the score depends on the desired image term ranking function TRA or TRB.
- the method of calculating the score (labeled as “TR A ”) is as follows. Given a set of images M with images M 1 , M 2 , M 3 . . . M n and their pairwise transitional probabilities P, TR A (M i , Q) for an image M i and term Q can be calculated recursively as described below.
- TR A ( M 1 ,Q ) P ( M 1 ⁇ >M 1 )* TR A ( M 1 ,Q )+ P ( M 2 ⁇ >M 1 )* TR A ( M 2 ,Q )+ P ( M 3 ⁇ >M 1 )* TR A ( M 3 ,Q )+ . . .
- TR A ( M n ,Q ) P ( M 1 ⁇ >M n )* TR A ( M 1 ,Q )+ P ( M 2 ⁇ >M n )* TR A ( M 2 ,Q )+ P ( M 3 ⁇ >M n )* TR A ( M 3 ,Q )+ . . . + P ( M n ⁇ >M n )* TR A ( M n ,Q ) Equations II:
- the sum of the transitional probabilities (e.g., P(M 1 ⁇ >M 1 )+P(M 2 ⁇ >M 1 )+P(M 3 ⁇ >M 1 )+ . . . +P(M n ⁇ >M 1 ) in the equation for TR A (M 1 , Q)) is equal to 1.
- the method of calculating the score (labeled as “TR B ”) is as follows. Given a set of images M with images M 1 , M 2 , M 3 . . . M n and their pairwise transitional probabilities P, TR B (M i , Q) for an image M i and term Q can be calculated recursively as described below.
- TR B ( M 1 ,Q ) [(1 ⁇ d )/ n * ⁇ ( M 1 ,Q )] d*[P ( M 1 ⁇ >M 1 )* TR B ( M 1 ,Q )+ P ( M 2 ⁇ >M 1 )* TR B ( M 2 ,Q )+ P ( M 3 ⁇ >M 1 )* TR B ( M 3 ,Q )+ . . .
- TR B ( M 2 ,Q ) [(1 ⁇ d )/ n * ⁇ ( M 2 ,Q )]+ d*[P ( M 1 ⁇ >M 2 )* TR B ( M 1 ,Q )+ P ( M 2 ⁇ >M 2 )* TR B ( M 2 ,Q )+ P ( M 3 ⁇ >M 2 )* TR B ( M 3 ,Q )+ . . . + P ( M n ⁇ >M 2 )* TR B ( M n ,Q )] . . .
- TR B ( M n ,Q ) [(1 ⁇ d )/ n * ⁇ ( M n ,Q )]+ d*[P ( M 1 ⁇ >M n )* TR B ( M 1 ,Q )+ P ( M 2 ⁇ >M n )* TR B ( M 2 ,Q )+ P ( M 3 ⁇ >M n )* TR B ( M 3 ,Q )+ . . . + P ( M n ⁇ >M n )* TR B ( M n ,Q )], Equations III: where ⁇ (M i , Q) is 1 if term Q is associated with image M i and 0 otherwise. d is a predefined value. In some implementations, d is 0.85. In some implementations, a desirable number of iterations for Equations I and II above are based on experiment or on domain knowledge.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an example similarity graph 600 of images.
- the nodes 602 , 604 , 606 , and 608 represent images A, B, C, and D, respectively.
- the edges between the nodes represent similarities between images that are above a predefined threshold, and corresponding non-zero transitional probabilities.
- graph 600 includes no edge between nodes 602 and 608 ; their pairwise similarity is below the threshold and their transitional probability (A ⁇ >D or D ⁇ >A) is 0.
- Graph 600 also includes terms 612 , 614 , 616 , and 618 , that are associated with images A, B, C, and D, respectively.
- the transitional probability from A to B P(A ⁇ >B) is 0.75000
- the transitional probability from B to A P(B ⁇ >A) is 0.25000.
- TR A ( B ,“eiffel tower”) 1 ⁇ 3(“eiffel tower” appears once in the terms associated with image B and appears 3 times among the terms associated with images A, B, C , or D )
- TR A ( C ,“eiffel tower”) 1 ⁇ 3(“eiffel tower” appears once in the terms associated with image C and appears 3 times among the terms associated with images A, B, C , or D )
- TR A ( D ,“eiffel tower”) 1 ⁇ 3(“eiffel tower” appears once in the terms associated with image D and appears 3 times among the terms associated with
- TR A ( B ,“eiffel tower”) 0.75 ⁇ 0.08333+0.25 ⁇ 0.25000+0.25 ⁇ 0.333+
- Equations I and II can also be used to calculate TR A values of an image with respect to each of multiple terms.
- the first step in the calculation is the initialization of the TR B values.
- Equation III in some implementations, the iterations converge to a stable distribution regardless of an initial starting point.
- the example above illustrates calculating the TR B values for the images with respect to a particular term. Equations III can also be used to calculate TR B values of an image with respect to each of multiple terms.
- An image can be associated with multiple terms, where some of the terms may be “noisy” terms that provide little or no information. Examples of “noisy” terms include “and,” “www,” and so on. The noisy terms also tend to be terms that appear very often in documents.
- the initial value of TR A for an image with respect to a term can be normalized to account for the degree of rarity of the term in documents by multiplying the initial TRA value by the inverse document frequency (i.e., number of documents in a corpus (e.g., web pages) that include the term divided by the total number of documents in the corpus). In some implementations, this can also be performed for TR B values.
- the set of images for which, and based on which, the scores are calculated can be limited in scope.
- the set of images can be limited to indexed images from a particular web site, to images associated with a particular term, images having particular characteristics (e.g., black and white, at least 10% green, etc.), or images having any combination of these and any additional criteria.
