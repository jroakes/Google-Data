For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology can alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. Additionally, it is to be appreciated that the methodologies disclosed in this disclosure are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers or other computing devices.
- FIG. 8 illustrated is an example methodology 800 for dynamic display of content consumption by geographic location in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure.
- content consumed by a set of users is recognized (e.g., using the recognition component 106 ).
- the content can include, but is not limited to, songs, movies, television shows, internet videos, websites, video games, applications, online articles, electronic books (e-books), or online searches.
- Users can employ virtually any content enabled device to recognize consumed content and/or consume content, including but not limited to a smart phone, a cell phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet, a laptop, a desktop, a portable music player, a video game system, an electronic reader (e-reader), a television, and so forth, and the user can permit the device to transmit their consumption to the recognition component 106 for recognition and use in accordance with this disclosure.
- content consumed using a device can be recognized based on metadata associated with the consumed content obtained from the device (e.g., using the acquisition component 302 ).
- content consumed using a separate device can be captured using the device (e.g., using the recognition app 204 ), and the consumed content can be identified based on a comparison of the consumed content, or a fingerprint of the consumed content, with known content (e.g., using the matching component 312 ).
- a geographic location and a set of characteristics of the content consumption are identified (e.g., using the recognition component 106 ).
- the set of characteristics of the consumption can include virtually any data related to users consuming the content, or to the consumption of the content, as permitted by the users.
- the set of consumption characteristics can include a frequency of consumption of respective content by the set of users, devices used to consume content, applications used to consume content, times of the content consumption, demographic information associated with respective users consuming content, and so forth.
- the consumed content is ranked as a function of a subset of the consumption characteristics (e.g., using the aggregation component 108 or ranking component 304 ). For example, when location data is available, respective consumed content can be ranked, by location, as a function of a consumption percentage. For instance, if a first song is consumed by 45% of the set of users in a first location (e.g., in the West region 604 A), and a second song is consumed by 11% of the set of users in the first location, then the first song can be ranked ahead of, or higher than, the second song for the first location based on the first and second songs' respective percentages of consumption (e.g., 45% and 10%) at the first location.
- a consumption percentage e.g., 45% and 10%
- a map displaying subsets of the consumed content, or data associated with the subsets of consumed content is generated (e.g., using the display component 110 ) as function of respective rankings and geographic location. For example, a map can be generated displaying the most popular (e.g., highest ranked or highest consumption percentage) songs for a set of locations included on the map. The map can be generated in real-time, e.g., in response to receiving updated user preferences.
- a set of user preferences are received (e.g., using the preferences component 408 ) regarding the consumed content and/or consumption characteristics. For example, a user preference to rank content having a predetermined classification (e.g., country songs, horror movies, etc.) as a function of respective percentages of consumption by a set of users (e.g., a set of anonymized users) in a predetermined location (e.g., United States, Japan, etc.) can be received.
- a predetermined classification e.g., country songs, horror movies, etc.
- a set of anonymized users e.g., United States, Japan, etc.
- a user preference defining a set of social networking friends e.g., other users
- the user preferences can relate to virtually any characteristic of content consumption or content consumers permitted by users.
- consumed content is filtered based on the set of user preferences (e.g., using the filter component 402 ). For example, consumed content not having a predetermined classification (e.g., music, country music, movies, novels, etc.) can be separated, filtered, or otherwise not included in a set of filtered consumed content (e.g., filtered content or a subset of consumed content).
- the set of filtered content is ranked based on a subset of consumption characteristics (e.g., using the ranking component 404 ).
- the subset of consumption characteristics employed in ranking the filtered content can be based in part on the set of user preferences.
- the user preferences can include ranking consumed content based on respective percentages of consumption for a set of locations (e.g., regions in a country, cities in a region, etc.).
- a map displaying a subset of the filtered content as a function of the ranking is rendered based on the capabilities of a device (e.g., using the rendering component 504 ).
- the device employed can be a smart phone or other mobile device, wherein the mobile device may have a screen that is smaller than a screen for a desktop computer, and the map can be rendered based on the capabilities or dimensions of the mobile device.
- a granularity of display for the filtered content can be set or adjusted (e.g., using the zooming component 508 ).
- the granularity displayed can include a globe, a continent, a country, a region, a state, a city, a subset set of users, and so forth.
- the map can be a map of the world displaying consumed content as a function of consumption percentage by continent, and the granularity displayed can be adjusted by zooming in at a country on the map.

Abstract
Description
- This patent application is a continuation of U.S. non-provisional application Ser. No. 13/417,598, filed Mar. 12, 2012, entitled “DYNAMIC DISPLAY OF CONTENT CONSUMPTION BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION” which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.
- This disclosure generally relates to systems and methods that facilitate dynamically displaying content consumption by geographic location.
- Computing technology and the Internet have fundamentally changed the processes of disseminating and consuming information. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have access to multiple means of accessing and consuming a vast array of information at virtually any time. For instance, users can listen to songs using a portable music player, watch television shows or videos using mobile devices, or read newspaper articles from around the globe via an electronic reader. In addition, newer and more efficient means of consuming and disseminating information are constantly being generated.
- The sheer quantity of information options available to users can make selecting information for consumption challenging. Popular online services can receive tens of hours worth of newly uploaded user-generated content every minute. A technique that has been commonly employed to assist users in identifying information for consumption includes ranking information based on quantities of consumption or user rankings. This allows users to select content that has been consumed by a large number of users in the past, or that a large number of users have previously ranked highly.
- However, based on the large quantity of information available, reliance on the ratings and viewership of past users can still result in a relatively large number of information options. In addition, identifying information for consumption based on other users' past opinions may only be marginally helpful with regard to assisting a current user in selecting information for consumption, and can fail to capitalize on quickly changing information consumption trends.
- The following presents a simplified summary of the specification in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification. This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the specification nor delineate any scope of particular embodiments of the specification, or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
- According to an aspect of the subject innovation, systems and methods for dynamic display of content consumption by geographic location are disclosed. A content consumption component includes a recognition component that recognizes content being consumed by a set of users, and identifies geographic locations of the consumption and a set of characteristics associated with the consumption. An aggregation component ranks the consumed content based on a subset of the characteristics associated with the consumption, and a display component generates a map displaying subsets of the consumed content as a function of respective rankings and geographic location.
- In an embodiment, a method is provided that includes recognizing content being consumed by a set of users, identifying a geographic location associated with the content being consumed and a set of content consumption characteristics, ranking respective consumed content as a function of a subset of the content consumption characteristics, and generating a map displaying subsets of the consumed content as a function of respective rankings and geographic location.
- The following description and the annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects of the specification. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the specification may be employed. Other advantages and novel features of the specification will become apparent from the following detailed description of the specification when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this innovation. It may be evident, however, that the innovation can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the innovation.
- As noted in the Background section, techniques that assist users in identifying information or content for consumption that include ranking information based on quantities of consumption or user rankings may only be partially helpful with regard to assisting a current user in selecting information for consumption, and can fail to capitalize on quickly changing information consumption trends.
- In one non-limiting implementation of this disclosure, a dynamic and straightforward display of information consumption is provided. The implementation provides users a map that dynamically displays and identifies quickly changing information consumption trends based on geographic locations, and sets of consumption characteristics. In addition, the user can adjust the display, locations, or consumption to characteristics to provide a personalized information experience.
- More particularly, in accordance with one embodiment, a content consumption component includes: a recognition component that recognizes content being consumed by a set of users, and identifies geographic locations of consumption and a set of consumption characteristics; an aggregation component that ranks respective consumed content as a function of a subset of the consumption characteristics; and a display component that generates a map displaying subsets of the consumed content as a function of respective rankings and geographic location.
- Turning now to
FIG. 1 , illustrated is anexample system 100 for dynamic display of content consumption by geographic location in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. Generally,system 100 can include a memory that stores computer executable components and a processor that executes computer executable components stored in the memory, examples of which can be found with reference toFIG. 10 .System 100 includes acontent consumption component 102. Thecontent consumption component 102 recognizes consumption of content by a set ofusers 104, and generates a map displaying, by location, the content consumption as a function of a set of characteristics of the consumption (consumption characteristics). Thecontent consumption component 102 includes arecognition component 106, anaggregation component 108, and adisplay component 110. - The
recognition component 106 identifies, examines or otherwise recognizes consumption of content by the set ofusers 104 who have permitted their consumption, or a subset thereof, to be identified, examined or otherwise recognized. The content can include, but is not limited to, songs, movies, television shows, internet videos, websites, video games, applications, online articles, electronic books (e-books), or online searches. The set ofusers 104 can employ virtually any content enabled device to recognize consumed content and/or consume content, including, but not limited to, a smart phone, a cell phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet, a laptop, a desktop, a portable music player, a video game system, an electronic reader (e-reader), a television, and so forth. For example, in one implementation, a user in the set ofusers 104 can listen to (e.g., consume) a song by a first musical group via a portable music player, and therecognition component 106 can recognize the user's consumption of the song, as permitted by the user. As an additional or alternative example, the device can include one or more sensors (e.g., microphones, cameras, speakers, etc.), and therecognition component 106 can recognize content being consumed on a different device based on, for example, ambient sounds detected using the sensors, as permitted by the user. For instance, a user in the set ofusers 104 can execute an audio recognition application associated with therecognition component 106 on the device that uses the sensors to capture audio associated with a television show being consumed by theuser 104 via a television. The audio recognition application can send, transmit, or otherwise provide the audio, or a fingerprint of the audio, to therecognition component 106. Therecognition component 106 can compare the audio or fingerprint to audio or fingerprints for known television shows, and identify the television show consumed by theuser 114 based on the comparison (discussed in greater detail with reference toFIG. 2 ). - In addition, the
recognition component 106 can recognize, identify, or otherwise determine a geographic location of the consumption, and a set of consumption characteristics, as permitted by the user. The set of consumption characteristics can include virtually any data related to users in the set ofusers 104, or the consumption of the content by the set ofusers 104. For example, therecognition component 106 can determine a device used to consume the content, an application used to consume the content, demographic information associated with users, and so forth, as permitted by the users. In one embodiment, therecognition component 106 notifies users in the set ofusers 104 of the types of information that are recognized by, stored by, and/or transmitted to or from thecontent consumption component 102, and provides the user the opportunity to opt-in or out of having such information recognized by, stored by, and/or transmitted to or from thecontent consumption component 102. - The
aggregation component 108 grades, categorizes, or otherwise ranks respective consumed content as a function of a subset of the consumption characteristics. For example, theaggregation component 108 can rank songs consumed by the set ofusers 104 as a function of percentages of consumption for the respective songs. For instance, if a first song is consumed by 45% of the set ofusers 104, and a second song is consumed by 11% of the set ofusers 104, then theaggregation component 108 can rank the first song ahead of, or higher than, the second song based on the first and second songs' respective percentages of consumption (e.g., 45% and 10%). - The
display component 110 generates, produces, transmits or otherwise provides a map displaying subsets of the consumed content as a function of the rankings (grades, categorizations, etc.). In one non-limiting embodiment, thedisplay component 110 generates a map displaying a subset of consumed content as a function of respective rankings and geographic location. For example, thedisplay component 110 can generate a map displaying the most popular (e.g., highest ranked or highest consumption percentage) internet videos by location. - The display is provided to a
user 114 via adevice 112. It is to be appreciated that theuser 114 can be a member of the set ofusers 104, or a disparate user. Theuser 114 is authorized to view the consumption data, e.g., by the users in the set of users. Typically, the data displayed on the map is anonymized. In one implementation, the users of the set of users are part of a study, survey, beta test or family or social circle, and have granted permission to theuser 114 to view their specific data. Theuser 114 can send or otherwise provide a request regarding consumption of content in a set of geographic areas to thecontent consumption component 102. The request can include a set of user preferences (discussed in greater detail with reference toFIG. 3 ). It is to be appreciated that although thecontent consumption component 102 is illustrated as being a stand-alone component, such implementation is not so limited. For instance, thecontent consumption component 102 can be included in a device (e.g., device 112), an application, or integrated with an online service that provides content to users (e.g., the set of users 104). -
FIG. 2 illustrates anexample system 200 for dynamic display of content consumption by geographic location in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. As discussed, a user in the set ofusers 114 can use a device, e.g.,device 202, to recognize consumed content and/or consume content. Thedevice 202 can include virtually any content enabled device, including but not limited to a smart phone, a cell phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet, a laptop, a desktop, a portable music player, a video game system, an electronic reader (e-reader), a television, and so forth. The content can include but is not limited to songs, movies, television shows, internet videos, websites, video games, applications, online articles, electronic books (e-books), or online searches. - The
device 202 includes a recognition application 204 (recognition app 204), amedia player 206, a set ofsensors 208, and a global positioning system component 210 (GPS component 210). Therecognition app 204 detects, acquires, or otherwise captures content, or a portion of content, being consumed from asource 212 using the set ofsensors 208, as permitted by the user. The set ofsensors 208 include but are not limited to microphones, cameras, and/or speakers. Thesource 212 can include virtually any device capable of playing or presenting content, including but not limited to audio players, video displays, and/or computers. For example, the user can execute therecognition app 204 on thedevice 202 to recognize a song playing on a juke box (e.g., source 212) in a pub. Therecognition app 204 can capture a portion of the song using a microphone included in the set ofsensors 208. - The
device 202 provides, sends, or otherwise communicates data regarding content consumption (consumption info) to therecognition component 106. For example, in one implementation, thedevice 202 provides the content captured by therecognition app 204 to therecognition component 106. As an additional or alternative example, in one implementation, therecognition app 204 includes afingerprint component 214 that generates a fingerprint of the captured content. The fingerprint can include but is not limited to a hash value or a histogram generated based on the content. Therecognition component 204 identifies the content based on the content or fingerprint received from the device 202 (discussed in greater detail with reference toFIG. 3 ). - Additionally or alternatively, the user can consume content using the
device 202. For example, in one implementation, the user can consume content via themedia player 206 included in the device. Themedia player 206 enables consumption of content maintained on thedevice 202, or streaming of content from a content server. For example, the user can play a set of songs maintained on thedevice 202 using themedia player 206. As discussed, thedevice 202 communicates data regarding content consumption (consumption info) to therecognition component 106. The consumption info can include but is not limited to metadata associated with content consumed using themedia player 206 to therecognition component 106. - The
GPS component 210 determines a geographic location of thedevice 202 via a global positioning system, and provides the geographic location to therecognition component 106, as permitted by the user. For example, in one implementation, location data including the geographic location of thedevice 202 determined by theGPS component 210 is included in the consumption information provided to therecognition component 106. It is to be appreciated that although therecognition component 106 is illustrated as being a stand-alone component, such implementation is not so limited. For instance, therecognition component 106 can be included in thedevice 202, a server, an application, or integrated with an online service that provides content to users. -
FIG. 3 illustrates anexample recognition component 106 in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. As discussed, therecognition component 106 recognizes consumption of content by the set ofusers 104, a geographic location of the consumption, and a set of consumption characteristics associated with the set ofusers 104 or the consumption of the content by the set ofusers 104, as permitted by the users. Therecognition component 106 inFIG. 3 includes anacquisition component 302, alocation component 304, aconsumption characteristics component 306, and anintegration component 308. Theacquisition component 302 receives, obtains, or otherwise acquires data regarding the consumption of content (e.g., consumption info) by users in the set ofusers 104. For example, in one embodiment, theacquisition component 302 can acquire data regarding a movie (e.g., metadata) that a user in the set ofusers 104 is watching on a device associated with the user (e.g., device 202). - As an additional or alternative example, in one embodiment, the
acquisition component 302 receives consumed content (e.g., captured using the recognition app 204) or a fingerprint of consumed content (e.g., generated using the fingerprint component 214) from the device associated with the user. Theacquisition component 302 includes amatching component 312 that matches the consumed content or fingerprints of consumed content with known content based on a set of identification criteria. The identification criteria includes but is not limited to exceeding a matching threshold. For example, theacquisition component 302 can receive a fingerprint for a song, compare the fingerprint to a set of fingerprints for known songs, and identify the consumed song as a known song having a fingerprint that exceeds the predetermined matching threshold. The known content or fingerprints of known content can be maintained, for example, in thedata store 310. - The
location component 304 ascertains, identifies, or otherwise determines a geographic location of the content consumption or user, as permitted by the user. For example, in one embodiment, where the user has enabled or allowed GPS location pinpointing, thelocation component 304 can determine the location of the user via a GPS enabled device employed to consume the content (e.g., a mobile phone or tablet personal computer), or obtain the geographic location from the GPS enabled device. For instance, the geographic location of the device can be included in the data obtained by theacquisition component 302 regarding consumption of content. As an additional or alternative example, thelocation component 304 can determine a location associated with a profile or account of a user if so permitted, or based on an internet protocol address (IP address) associated with the device. For instance, thelocation component 304 can acquire the location information (e.g., via the account or profile) from thedata store 310. - The consumption characteristics component 306 (characteristics component 306) acquires, locates, or otherwise determines consumption characteristics based on the data regarding the consumption of content obtained by the
acquisition component 302. For example, thecharacteristics component 306 can acquire demographic data for the user from a profile, or account, associated with the user maintained in thedata store 310, if so permitted. For instance, if a first user is reading (e.g., consuming) an article from an online service, thecharacteristics component 306 can acquire demographic data (e.g., age, gender, education, etc.) relating to the user maintained in a profile for the online service from thedata store 310, if so permitted by the user. In addition, thecharacteristics component 306 can obtain data relating to the consumed content, such as classifications, user ratings, and so forth from thedata store 310. For example, thecharacteristics component 306 can obtain a categorization (e.g., country, classical, hip hop, pop, etc.) for a consumed song from thedata store 310. It is to be appreciated that although thedata store 310 is illustrated as being associated with therecognition component 106, such implementation is not so limited. For instance, thedata store 310 can be associated with a disparate content service or website, and therecognition component 106 can communicate with thedata store 310 via a network connection. Further, thedata store 310 may include any number of storage units. - The
integration component 308 provides various adapters, connectors, channels, communication paths, etc. to integrate therecognition component 106 into an operating and/or database system(s). In addition, theintegration component 308 can provide various adapters, connectors, channels, communication paths, etc., that provide for interaction with devices (e.g., device 202) employed by the set ofusers 104. It is to be appreciated that although theintegration component 308 is illustrated as incorporated into therecognition component 106, such implementation is not so limited. For instance, theintegration component 308 can be a stand-alone component to receive or transmit data in relation to thecontent consumption component 102. In particular, theintegration component 308 can receive virtually any data relating to content consumed by a user in the set ofusers 104, a device that is associated with a user, or data relating the set ofusers 104, as permitted. - Referring to
FIG. 4 , illustrated is anexample aggregation component 108 in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. As discussed, theaggregation component 108 ranks respective consumed content as a function of a subset of consumption characteristics. Theaggregation component 108 inFIG. 4 includes afilter component 402, and aranking component 404. Thefilter component 402 sorts, separates, or otherwise filters consumed content to be ranked, or consumption characteristics to be employed in ranking the consumed content, based at least in part on a set of filter criteria. The filter criteria can include virtually any criteria associated with content consumers (e.g., set of users 104) or the consumed content as may be available based on data made available and permissions granted. For example, the filter criteria can include locations of consumption, a frequency of consumption threshold, devices used to consume content, applications used to consume content, times of content consumption, demographic information associated with content consumers, and so forth. - The
filter component 402 includes asocial component 406, apreferences component 408, and aclassifier component 410. Thesocial component 406 enables thecontent consumption component 102 to obtain information regarding content consumption by individual users that have enabled sharing content consumption with theuser 114. For example, a friend of theuser 114 may desire to share their content consumption or a subset of content consumption (e.g., songs played, movies watched, articles read, etc.) with theuser 114, and thesocial component 406 enables sharing of said content consumption. The filter criteria can include a set of users that have enabled sharing of content consumption with theuser 114. In addition, thesocial component 406 can provide for sharing filter criteria with other users. For example, theuser 114 can obtain a set of filter criteria employed by a friend or their favorite actor to rank consumed content, or theuser 114 can share their filter criteria with other users. - The
preferences component 408 provides for auser 114 to create, set, or otherwise determine a set of user preferences for filtering consumed content for ranking, and/or a subset of consumption characteristics employed in ranking the consumed content. For example, theuser 114 can set a default user preference to rank content having a predetermined classification (e.g., country songs, horror movies, etc.) as a function of consumption percentage for a set of users in a predetermined location (e.g., United States, Japan, etc.). As an additional example, theuser 114 can set a user preference that defines a set of social networking friends (e.g., other users) for whom the user desires to display consumption as a function of frequency of consumption. The user preferences can relate to virtually any option available for displaying or ranking content consumption, and the filter criteria can be based at least in part on the user preferences. - The
classifier component 410 determines or infers filter criteria for consumed content to be ranked, or consumption characteristics to be employed in ranking the consumed content. For example, theclassifier component 410 can infer of determine a set of filter criteria based in part on social correlations. Theclassifier component 410 can employ, for example, a naïve Bayes classifier, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a support vector machine (SVM), a Bayesian network, a decision tree, a neural network, a fuzzy logic model, a probabilistic classifier, and so forth. The classifier is trained using a set of training data. For example, the set of training data can include consumption characteristics for others users associated with the user 114 (e.g. friends identified by the user), or filters employed by the other users, as permitted by those friends and other users. - The
ranking component 404 classifies, orders, or otherwise ranks a subset of respective consumed content (e.g., filtered consumed content) as a function of a subset of consumption characteristics (e.g., filtered consumption characteristics). For example, the filter criteria can include a filter for a type of consumed content, such as e-books, a filter for a type of e-book, such as mystery novels, and a set of filters for consumption characteristics, such as consumption percentage and a location (e.g., Silicon Valley). Theranking component 404 can rank e-books classified as mystery novels based on consumption percentage by users located in Silicon Valley in the set ofusers 104. -
FIG. 5 illustrates anexample display component 110 in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. As discussed, the display component generates a map displaying subsets of consumed content as a function of respective rankings and geographic location. Thedisplay component 110 inFIG. 5 includes anoptions component 502, arendering component 504, and anarchive component 506. Theoptions component 502 provides for a user to set, select, or otherwise determine a set of display options. Theoptions component 502 includes azooming component 508 that provides for setting, adjusting, or otherwise determining a granularity displayed of the consumed content. The granularity displayed can include a globe, a continent, a country, a region, a state, a city, a subset set of users, and so forth. For example, thedisplay component 110 can generate a map of the United States displaying consumed content as a function of consumption percentage by region (e.g., granularity). Theuser 114 can adjust the granularity displayed, by zooming in at a region, and content consumption can be displayed on the zoomed map as a function of a consumption percentage by states in the region. - The
rendering component 504 renders, displays, or otherwise generates the display map as a function of the rendering capabilities of adevice 112 employed by theuser 114. For example, thedevice 112 can be a smart phone or tablet, wherein thedevice 112 may have a screen that is smaller than a screen for a desktop computer, and therendering component 504 can render a custom map based on the capabilities of the device 112 (e.g., smart phone or tablet). Thearchive component 506 can archive or maintain historical maps of content consumption. For example, theuser 114 may desire to see the most popular songs by region a year ago. Additionally or alternatively, the historical maps maintained by thearchive component 506 can be used to determine, and display, the change (e.g., delta) in consumption for subsets of consumed content over a period of time. For example, theuser 114 may desire to generate a display of how the popularity of an e-book has increased over a period of time in a region. - Referring to
FIG. 6 , illustrated is asystem 600 that provides anon-limiting example display 601 of content consumption on a map in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. Thedisplay 601 includes amap 602. Themap 602 can be separated, split, or otherwise divided into a set of locations 604 (e.g., 604A-604E). For example, themap 602 can be a map of the United States of America that is divided into five locations (e.g., regions), including aWest region 604A, aMidwest region 604B, anEast region 604C, aSoutheast region 604D, and aSouthwest region 604E. - Content consumption can be displayed on the
map 602 as a function of respective rankings. For example, content consumption can be displayed on themap 602 based on consumption percentage by location viacontent consumption indicators 606A-E. The content can include, but is not limited to, songs, movies, television shows, internet videos, websites, video games, applications, online articles, e-books, or online searches. For example, video games having the greatest consumption percentage (e.g., highest ranking) in therespective regions 604A-E can be displayed in thecontent consumption indicators 606A-E for the respective regions. Thecontent consumption indicators 606A-E can include an identifier of the content (e.g., title, artist, etc.), a consumption percentage by users in the region, and so forth. - It is to be appreciated that multiple consumed contents can be included in the
content consumption indicators 606A-E. For example, the content consumption indicators 606 can include a set of five songs (e.g., top five songs) having the greatest consumption percentage in the respective regions. Moreover, thecontent consumption indicators 606A-E can include virtually any graphical display of content consumption, including, but not limited to, a set of icons, a graph, a heat map representation, a color code, or a set of symbols, and so forth. As discussed, the rankings displayed are based on a subset of consumption characteristics (e.g., filtered consumption characteristics). For example, the consumption characteristics can be filtered based on a type of device (e.g., a smart phone, a cell phone, a tablet, a laptop, a desktop, a portable music player, a video game system, a television, etc.) employed to consume the content, or demographic information associated with the content consumers (e.g., age group, education, gender, etc., if provided by the consumer). - Turning to
FIG. 7 , illustrated is asystem 700 that provides a non-limiting example of auser interface 702 in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. The user interface 702 (interface 702) can be displayed via aweb browser 704. Theuser interface 702 can include amap display section 706 that provides for displaying a map of content consumption (e.g., using the display component 110). As discussed, the map can be separated into a set of locations 708 (e.g., states, counties, etc.), and content consumption can be displayed on the map as a function of rankings of one or more content consumption characteristics (e.g., consumption percentage, etc.) for each of the locations 708. - The
interface 702 can also include asettings section 710. Thesettings section 710 provides for a user to set, select, or otherwise determine one or more attributes or settings (e.g., user preferences) for themap display section 706. Thesettings section 710 can include azoom selector 712. Thezoom selector 712 provides for the user to set or adjust the granularity of display for the map by zooming in or out on the map (e.g., using the zooming component 408). For example, the lowest granularity setting on thezoom selector 712 can be a globe, and the highest granularity setting on thezoom selector 712 can be a set of individuals in the user's network. As an additional example, the user can adjust the granularity by increasing the zoom via thezoom selector 712 from a first granularity, such as a country (e.g., United States) to a second granularity, such as a region of the country (e.g., the Southwest United States). - The
interface 702 also includes anoptions section 714 that provides for the user to set, select, or otherwise determine a set of options for the map display section 706 (e.g., using the preferences component 408). For example, the user can determine one or more filters for ranking the consumed content to be displayed on the map via theoptions section 714. For instance, the user can set a first filter for a type of consumed content to be displayed (e.g., music), and a second filter for a category of the type content (e.g., country music), and a third filter for content consumption by users having a set of demographic criteria within a threshold range (e.g., age range). As an additional example, the set of options in theoptions section 714 can include a set of display options. For instance, the user can set a first display option (e.g., display option 1) to display a set of three songs (e.g., top 3) for each location (e.g., 708A-7081) having the greatest consumption percentage (e.g., highest ranking) in the respective locations, and a second display option (e.g., display option 2) to display a set of sources (e.g., stores, websites, online content services, etc.) for acquiring the displayed content. -
FIGS. 8-9 illustrate various methodologies in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, the disclosed subject matter is not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described in this disclosure. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology can alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the disclosed subject matter. Additionally, it is to be appreciated that the methodologies disclosed in this disclosure are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers or other computing devices. - Referring now to
FIG. 8 , illustrated is anexample methodology 800 for dynamic display of content consumption by geographic location in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. Atreference numeral 802, content consumed by a set of users is recognized (e.g., using the recognition component 106). The content can include, but is not limited to, songs, movies, television shows, internet videos, websites, video games, applications, online articles, electronic books (e-books), or online searches. Users can employ virtually any content enabled device to recognize consumed content and/or consume content, including but not limited to a smart phone, a cell phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet, a laptop, a desktop, a portable music player, a video game system, an electronic reader (e-reader), a television, and so forth, and the user can permit the device to transmit their consumption to therecognition component 106 for recognition and use in accordance with this disclosure. For example, in one embodiment, content consumed using a device can be recognized based on metadata associated with the consumed content obtained from the device (e.g., using the acquisition component 302). As an additional or alternative example, in one embodiment, content consumed using a separate device can be captured using the device (e.g., using the recognition app 204), and the consumed content can be identified based on a comparison of the consumed content, or a fingerprint of the consumed content, with known content (e.g., using the matching component 312). - At
reference numeral 804, a geographic location and a set of characteristics of the content consumption are identified (e.g., using the recognition component 106). The set of characteristics of the consumption (consumption characteristics) can include virtually any data related to users consuming the content, or to the consumption of the content, as permitted by the users. For example, the set of consumption characteristics can include a frequency of consumption of respective content by the set of users, devices used to consume content, applications used to consume content, times of the content consumption, demographic information associated with respective users consuming content, and so forth. - At
reference numeral 806, the consumed content is ranked as a function of a subset of the consumption characteristics (e.g., using theaggregation component 108 or ranking component 304). For example, when location data is available, respective consumed content can be ranked, by location, as a function of a consumption percentage. For instance, if a first song is consumed by 45% of the set of users in a first location (e.g., in theWest region 604A), and a second song is consumed by 11% of the set of users in the first location, then the first song can be ranked ahead of, or higher than, the second song for the first location based on the first and second songs' respective percentages of consumption (e.g., 45% and 10%) at the first location. Atreference numeral 808, a map displaying subsets of the consumed content, or data associated with the subsets of consumed content, is generated (e.g., using the display component 110) as function of respective rankings and geographic location. For example, a map can be generated displaying the most popular (e.g., highest ranked or highest consumption percentage) songs for a set of locations included on the map. The map can be generated in real-time, e.g., in response to receiving updated user preferences. - Referring now to
FIG. 9 , illustrated is anexample methodology 900 for dynamic display of content consumption by geographic location in accordance with various aspects described in this disclosure. Atreference numeral 902, a set of user preferences are received (e.g., using the preferences component 408) regarding the consumed content and/or consumption characteristics. For example, a user preference to rank content having a predetermined classification (e.g., country songs, horror movies, etc.) as a function of respective percentages of consumption by a set of users (e.g., a set of anonymized users) in a predetermined location (e.g., United States, Japan, etc.) can be received. As an additional example, a user preference defining a set of social networking friends (e.g., other users) for whom a user desires to display consumption as a function of frequency of consumption can be received. The user preferences can relate to virtually any characteristic of content consumption or content consumers permitted by users. - At
reference numeral 904, consumed content is filtered based on the set of user preferences (e.g., using the filter component 402). For example, consumed content not having a predetermined classification (e.g., music, country music, movies, novels, etc.) can be separated, filtered, or otherwise not included in a set of filtered consumed content (e.g., filtered content or a subset of consumed content). Atreference numeral 906, the set of filtered content is ranked based on a subset of consumption characteristics (e.g., using the ranking component 404). The subset of consumption characteristics employed in ranking the filtered content can be based in part on the set of user preferences. For instance, the user preferences can include ranking consumed content based on respective percentages of consumption for a set of locations (e.g., regions in a country, cities in a region, etc.). - At
reference numeral 908, a map displaying a subset of the filtered content as a function of the ranking is rendered based on the capabilities of a device (e.g., using the rendering component 504). For example, the device employed can be a smart phone or other mobile device, wherein the mobile device may have a screen that is smaller than a screen for a desktop computer, and the map can be rendered based on the capabilities or dimensions of the mobile device. - At
reference numeral 910, a granularity of display for the filtered content can be set or adjusted (e.g., using the zooming component 508). The granularity displayed can include a globe, a continent, a country, a region, a state, a city, a subset set of users, and so forth. For example, the map can be a map of the world displaying consumed content as a function of consumption percentage by continent, and the granularity displayed can be adjusted by zooming in at a country on the map. - One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that the various embodiments described in this disclosure can be implemented in connection with any computer or other client or server device, which can be deployed as part of a computer network or in a distributed computing environment, and can be connected to any kind of data store where media may be found. In this regard, the various embodiments described in this disclosure can be implemented in any computer system or environment having any number of memory or storage units, and any number of applications and processes occurring across any number of storage units. This includes, but is not limited to, an environment with server computers and client computers deployed in a network environment or a distributed computing environment, having remote or local storage.
- Distributed computing provides sharing of computer resources and services by communicative exchange among computing devices and systems.

Components ofcomputer 1110 may include, but are not limited to, aprocessing unit 1120, asystem memory 1130, and a system bus 1122 that couples various system components including the system memory to theprocessing unit 1120. -
Computer 1110 includes a variety of computer readable media and can be any available media that can be accessed bycomputer 1110. Thesystem memory 1130 may include computer storage media in the form of volatile and/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM) and/or random access memory (RAM). By way of example, and not limitation,memory 1130 may also include an operating system, application programs, other program modules, and program data. - A user can enter commands and information into the
computer 1110 throughinput devices 1140. A monitor or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus 1122 via an interface, such asoutput interface 1150. In addition to a monitor, computers can also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers and a printer, which may be connected throughoutput interface 1150. - The
computer 1110 may operate in a networked or distributed environment using logical connections to one or more other remote computers, such as remote computer 1170. The remote computer 1170 may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, or any other remote media consumption or transmission device, and may include any or all of the elements described above relative to thecomputer 1110. The logical connections depicted inFIG. 11 include anetwork 1172, such local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), but may also include other networks/buses. Such networking environments are commonplace in homes, offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet. - As mentioned above, while exemplary embodiments have been described in connection with various computing devices and network architectures, the underlying concepts may be applied to any network system and any computing device or system in which it is desirable to publish or consume content in a flexible way.
- The word “exemplary” is used in this disclosure to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. For the avoidance of doubt, this matter disclosed in this disclosure is not limited by such examples. In addition, any aspect or design described in this disclosure as “exemplary” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs, nor is it meant to preclude equivalent exemplary structures and techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms “includes,” “has,” “contains,” and other similar words are used in either the detailed description or the claims, for the avoidance of doubt, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term “comprising” as an open transition word without precluding any additional or other elements.
- Computing devices typically include a variety of media, which can include computer-readable storage media. Computer-readable storage media can be any available storage media that can be accessed by the computer, is typically of a non-transitory nature, and can include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable storage media can be implemented in connection with any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, program modules, structured data, or unstructured data. Computer-readable storage media can include, but are not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disk (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or other tangible and/or non-transitory media which can be used to store desired information. Computer-readable storage media can be accessed by one or more local or remote computing devices, e.g., via access requests, queries or other data retrieval protocols, for a variety of operations with respect to the information stored by the medium.
- As mentioned, the various techniques described in this disclosure may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a combination of both. As used in this disclosure, the terms “component,” “system” and the like are likewise intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on computer and the computer can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. Further, a “device” can come in the form of specially designed hardware; generalized hardware made specialized by the execution of software thereon that enables the hardware to perform specific function (e.g., coding and/or decoding); software stored on a computer readable medium; or a combination thereof.
- The aforementioned systems have been described with respect to interaction between several components. It can be appreciated that such systems and components can include those components or specified sub-components, some of the specified components or sub-components, and/or additional components, and according to various permutations and combinations of the foregoing. Sub-components can also be implemented as components communicatively coupled to other components rather than included within parent components (hierarchical). Additionally, it is to be noted that one or more components may be combined into a single component providing aggregate functionality or divided into several separate sub-components, and that any one or more middle layers, such as a management layer, may be provided to communicatively couple to such sub-components in order to provide integrated functionality. Any components described in this disclosure may also interact with one or more other components not specifically described in this disclosure but generally known by those of skill in the art.
- In view of the exemplary systems described above, methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the described subject matter will be better appreciated with reference to the flowcharts of the various figures. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described in this disclosure. Where non-sequential, or branched, flow is illustrated via flowchart, it can be appreciated that various other branches, flow paths, and orders of the blocks, may be implemented which achieve the same or a similar result. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methodologies described hereinafter.
- In addition to the various embodiments described in this disclosure, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments can be used or modifications and additions can be made to the described embodiment(s) for performing the same or equivalent function of the corresponding embodiment(s) without deviating there from. Still further, multiple processing chips or multiple devices can share the performance of one or more functions described in this disclosure, and similarly, storage can be affected across a plurality of devices. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited to any single embodiment, but rather can be construed in breadth, spirit and scope in accordance with the appended claims.
