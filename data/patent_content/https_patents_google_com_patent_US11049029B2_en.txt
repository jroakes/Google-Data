Definitions
- This disclosure relates to the field of content sharing platforms and, in particular, to identifying content appropriate for children algorithmically without human intervention.
- social networks allow users to connect to and share information with each other.
- Many social networks include a content sharing aspect that allows users to upload, view, and share content, such as video content, image content, audio content, text content, and so on (which may be collectively referred to as “media items” or “content items”).
- content items such as video content, image content, audio content, text content, and so on (which may be collectively referred to as “media items” or “content items”).
- viewable and shareable media items may include audio clips, movie clips, TV clips, and music videos, as well as amateur content such as video blogging, short original videos, pictures, photos, other multimedia content, etc.
- Users may use computing devices (such as smart phones, cellular phones, laptop computers, desktop computers, netbooks, tablet computers, network-connected televisions) to use, play, and/or consume media items (e.g., watch digital videos, and/or listen to digital music).
- a method includes identifying, by a processing device, entities corresponding to topics relevant to children, determining, by the processing device, a children's affinity score for each of the identified entities, and selecting, by the processing device, content based on the children's affinity score for the identified entities corresponding to the content.
- the entities may include at least one a person, place, or thing.
- identifying the entities in the method further includes selecting the entities from a knowledge graph comprising a knowledge base having structured information about a corpus of entities and relational connections between the corpus of entities, wherein the corpus of entities comprises the entities.
- identifying the entities in the method may further include accessing an external source of data relevant to content for children, extracting topics for children from the external source of data, reconciling the extracted topics with the corpus of entities determined from the knowledge graph, and extending the entities from the knowledge graph with reconciled entities from the extracted topics.
- the external source of data comprises a trusted website that publishes rating and reviews for children-safe and children-interesting content.
- determining the children's affinity score in the method further includes identifying content items annotated with the entities, identifying other content items related to the identified content items based on co-watch signals and co-occurrence signals, merging the identified other content items with the identified content items to generate a single set of content items, grouping the single set of content items by the entities annotated in the single set of content items to form an entity group for each entity, and for each entity having an entity group, calculating the children's affinity score for the entity based on at least one of annotation centrality, annotation relevance, average quality, popularity, or average relatedness weight of content items in the entity group.
- the method may include filtering the identified content items for at least one of language, quality, popularity, or content rating.
- selecting the content in the method may further include identifying a candidate set of content based on at least one of a category of content, upload state, or number of content items associated with content, for each candidate content: identifying entity annotations for each content item in the candidate content, determining an average rating and a view count for each content item in the candidate content, and aggregating the average rating and the view count from all content items of the candidate content weighted by the identified entity annotations to generate an aggregate score for the candidate content.
- selecting the content in the method may include normalizing the aggregated scores from all of the candidate content, and ranking the candidate content based on the normalized aggregated scores.
- the selected content includes channels of a content sharing platform.
- the selected content may include playlists of the content sharing platform.

- implementations of the disclosure are discussed in terms of content sharing platforms and promoting social network sharing of a content item on the content sharing platform, implementations may also be generally applied to any type of social network providing connections between users. Implementations of the disclosure are not limited to content sharing platforms that provide channel subscriptions to users.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether the content sharing platform 120 collects user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the content sharing platform 120 .
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a children's content system 140 in accordance with one implementation of the disclosure.
- the children's content system 140 may interact with a single social network, or may be utilized among multiple social networks (e.g., provided as a service of a content sharing platform that is utilized by other third party social networks).
- the children's content system 140 includes a children's entity seeding module 210 , a children's affinity score module 220 , a children's content curation module 230 , and a UI generation module 240 . More or less components may be included in the children's content system 140 without loss of generality.
- two of the modules may be combined into a single module, or one of the modules may be divided into two or more modules.
- one or more of the modules may reside on different computing devices (e.g., different server computers, on a single client device, or distributed among multiple client devices, etc.).
- one or more of the modules may reside on different content sharing platforms, third party social networks, and/or external servers.
- the children's content system 140 is communicatively coupled to the data store 106 .
- the children's content system 140 may be coupled to the data store 106 via a network (e.g., via network 105 as illustrated in FIG. 1 ).
- the children's content system 140 may be coupled directly to a server where the children's content system 140 resides (e.g., may be directly coupled to server 130 ).
- the data store 106 may be a memory (e.g., random access memory), a cache, a drive (e.g., a hard drive), a flash drive, a database system, or another type of component or device capable of storing data.
- the data store 106 may also include multiple storage components (e.g., multiple drives or multiple databases) that may also span multiple computing devices (e.g., multiple server computers).
- the data store 106 includes content item data 290 , knowledge graph (KG) data 291 , and children's affinity score data 292 .
- children's content system 140 enables the identification, curation, and presentation of content appropriate and relevant for children in implementations of the disclosure.
- Children's content may refer to one or more content items that is safe (e.g., not mature or explicit) and/or entertaining (e.g., relevant) for children.
- the children's entity seeding module 210 may identify entities that are potentially interesting or relevant to children.
- An entity may refer to a person, place, or thing (e.g., TV show, movie, song, book, article, animal, etc.).
- Data store 106 may maintain a knowledge graph (KG) that is a knowledge base having structured information about a corpus of semantic entities and relational connections between the corpus of semantic entities.
- KG knowledge graph
- Each semantic entity also referred to as “entity” has one or several types.
- Each content item maintained in content item data 290 of data store 106 may be annotated with the entity or entities associated with the content item.
- “Dora the Explorer” is a topic, TV program, film series, and award-winning work. If a content item of content item data 290 was a Dora the Explorer TV episode, this content item would be annotated with the Dora the Explorer entity that is stored in the KG data 291 .
- the KG data 291 may include a higher-level of abstraction of collections, and may group entities into collections, such as “children's TV programs” or “musicians.” Refer to the previous example, the “Dora the Explorer entity may be grouped into the children's TV programs collection (as well as other different collections) in KG data 291 .
- the children's entity seeding module 210 may utilize the entities of the KG data 291 to identify entities (and collections) that are interesting for children, and thereby utilize these identified entities to locate content and content items that may be interesting for children as well (e.g., the content items annotated with the identified entities). For example, some entity types and collections in the KG data 291 are relevant for children, such as the children's TV program collection or the movies for ages 5 to 7 collection. These entity types and collections provide an already-generated and curated list (in certain cases, age-bucketed), but restricted to a limited set of domains. Aside from these direct sources, the children's entity seeding module may also run queries over the KG data 291 to infer interesting entities. The distribution of the subjects of the books in a children's literature literary genre collection is such an example (e.g., top subjects are “Animal”, “Adventure”, and “Family”).
- the children's entity seeding module 210 may use the KG data 291 as well as other external data sources 250 to identify entities that are interesting to children.
- the external data sources 250 may include, but are not limited to, websites and applications that publish ratings and reviews for content (e.g., TV shows, movies, games, applications, websites, books, music, etc.) that is safe and/or interesting for children.
- the children's entity seeding module 210 may access the external data source 250 (e.g., via network 105 ) and extract topics from the external data source 250 .
- topics are extracted from an external data source 250 based on a format that the data is stored, maintained, and/or presented at the external data source 250 .
- the children's entity seeding module 210 may download each root category from the external data source 250 and then extract the links that point to the sub-categories in each root category. Information such as a content rating and age group associated with each link may also be extracted.
- the extracted topics from external data sources 250 may then be reconciled with corresponding entities maintained in the KG data 291 .
- an expanded set of entities from the KG data 291 may be identified as relevant and/or interesting to children.
- the children's entity seeding module 210 may rely on the corpus of content (e.g., content item data 290 ) of the content sharing platform to identify entities interesting to children.
- the children's entity seeding module 210 may first identify the set of content items associated with a particular content rating, such as a Y rating or TV-Y rating. Annotated entities are identified among the set of content items and used to populate a list of entities that are relevant and/or interesting to children.
- the quality (e.g., user rating) and popularity (e.g., number of views) of the content items are used to select annotated entities.
- the expanded set of entities identified as relevant and/or interesting to children is passed to children's affinity score module 220 to generate a children's affinity score for each identified entity.
- the children's affinity score module 220 may determine a children's affinity score for each entity in a variety of ways, depending on how the set of entities was generated.
- the children's affinity score module 220 may first identify all content items that have been annotated with these entities. Then, high-level filtering may be applied to remove, for example, certain language (e.g., non-English language content items) content items, content items with a mature or X rating, content items with a number of views below a threshold, and/or content items with a low quality (e.g., less than 3.0 out of 5).
- certain language e.g., non-English language content items
- content items with a mature or X rating e.g., a number of views below a threshold
- content items with a low quality e.g., less than 3.0 out of 5
- the children's affinity score module 220 may then merge the resulting set of content items with any content items that are related to the set of content items.
- Content items may be considered related to one another based on signals including, but not limited to, number of co-watches by users and number of co-occurrences (e.g., in playlists).
- the related content items are also filtered on a high-level to remove certain language, mature content, low popularity, and low quality content.
- the resulting single set of merged content items is then examined to identify entity annotations associated with the single set.
- the content items may then be grouped according the entity annotations.
- the content item may appear in multiple groups as a content item may have multiple different entity annotations corresponding to the content item.
- a children's affinity score for the entity may be calculated based on a function taking into account annotation scores for each content item in the group to the entity, an average quality of the content items in the group, average popularity of the content items in the group, and an average relatedness weight.
- the function aggregates these signals over the content items.
- the annotation score may be a number from zero to one indicating how central/relevant an annotated entity is for the content item, where a higher value denotes that the entity is more central/relevant to the content item.
- the quality may be a score (e.g., on a scale of 1 to 5) that a user rates the content item.
- the popularity may indicate a number of views of the content item.
- the average relatedness weight may indicate how related content items are (e.g., in terms of co-watches and co-occurrences) to each other within the group.
- content items with an annotation score falling below a threshold value may be filtered out of the group.
- the result of the function as applied to the entity group is a children's affinity score for the particular entity.
- the entities when entities that are interesting and relevant to children are identified directly from the corpus of content of the content sharing platform, the entities may be identified from annotations of a set of content items (e.g., TV-Y rated content items, etc.) in the corpus.
- Each content item may have an annotation score for a particular entity. This annotation score may be a number from zero to one that indicating how central/relevant an annotated entity is for the content item, where a higher value denotes that the entity is more central/relevant to the content item.
- the children's entity seeding module 210 may aggregate the annotation scores associated with the entity over the set of content items, where each annotation score may be weighted by a view count for the content item associated with the particular annotation score (e.g., annotation scores for more popular content items are weighted more heavily in the aggregate of annotation scores for a particular entity).
- the result of the aggregation of weighted annotation scores for each entity is a global children's affinity score (also referred to as a global popularity score) of the entity in terms of the set of content items. This global children's affinity score may be stored as the children's affinity score for the entity, for example in children's affinity score data 292 of data store 106 .
- a children's affinity score for each entity may also be collection specific. If the children's affinity score is to be calculated for each entity in a collection, the children's entity seeding module 210 may first identify the collections in the KG data 291 that the identified entities are members. The global children's affinity score for the entity may be multiplied (or some other function performed) with a collection membership score associated with the entity/collection pair. The collection score may denote the strength of the entities membership in the collection, with a higher score indicating a more central/relevant relationship to the collection. The resulting number may be considered the collection-based children's affinity score of the entity.
- the resulting entities identified as interesting to children are also used to assign a children's affinity score directly to content items (e.g., videos and other content sharing platform content) based on the annotations that the content items have for such entities.
- content items e.g., videos and other content sharing platform content
- the children's content curation module 230 may then utilize the calculated children's affinity score for entities in the KG data 291 to curate children's content for the content sharing platform.
- the following description discusses content curation in terms of identifying channels of the content sharing platform that are relevant and interesting for children. In other implementation, different types of content may also be identified including, but not limited to playlists and individual content items (e.g., videos).
- the children's content curation module 230 curates children's content for display on a home screen of a children's-specific application or web page of the content sharing platform. In other implementations, children's content curation module 230 may curate children's content for other purposes, such as for search results, recommendations, watch next/related content, and so on.
- the children's content curation module 230 may first identify a set of candidate channels.
- the set of candidate channels may be selected based on satisfying one or more predetermined qualifications.
- the qualifications may include, but are not limited to, one or more of categories, upload state, number of content items in the channel, review status, and/or content rating (e.g., Y or G) of the channel.
- the category qualification may include the channel being classified in one or more categories.
- the categories may be pre-determined categories displayed on a home screen of a children's content interface and may include categories such as shows, music, learning, explore, do-it-yourself, hobbies, science, experiments, dinosaurs, etc.
- the categories may be personalized based on specific interest of users.
- the upload state qualification may include selecting as candidates those channels that satisfy particular upload status constraints, such as the upload time of the most recent video being less than a predetermined threshold of time. For example, a channel may be selected as a candidate channel when it includes at least one content item that was uploaded to the channel less than one year ago. Similarly, the number of content items in the channel qualification may result in channels being selected as candidates when the channels include more than a predetermined threshold number of content items in the channel. This prevents channels that are not active or channels with a small number of content items from being selected as candidate channels.
- the review status qualification may include selecting those channels with a flag (or other marker) that is set to indicate a human or automated review of the channel has previously occurred to examine the content items in the channel.
- the examination of the content items in the channel may determine whether the material of the content item is appropriate for children and/or relevant to children. For example, content items related to taxes may be appropriate in terms of a content rating for children, but may not be relevant to children.
- the children's content curations module 230 may then identify the entities that are annotated for the content items in each candidate channel as well as the children's affinity score for each entity (calculated by children's affinity score module 220 as discussed above). For each content item in a candidate channel, an average children's affinity score for the content item and a view count for the content item is determined. In one implementation, the view count may be used as weighting factor for the children's affinity score, so that content items with a higher view count have the associated average children's affinity score weighted more than a content item with a lower view count. The resulting weighted children's affinity score is assigned to the content item.
- the weighted children's affinity scores for the content items in a channel are aggregated to generate a children's affinity score for the candidate channel.
- the children's affinity scores for the candidate channels are then normalized.
- the candidate channels are then ranked based on the resulting children's affinity scores for the candidate channels, with a channel having the highest score ranked first, and so on.
- the top N channels from the ranking may then be selected for display on a children's content interface (e.g., home screen of a children's application of the content sharing platform or in a second category within the home screen of the children's application).
- the selected channels may then be provided to the UI generation module 240 .
- the UI generation module 240 may associate formatting and other UI elements to generate a page or screen that displays the selected channels as content that is interesting and/or relevant to children.
- playlist may be generated and/or selected for display in the UI.
