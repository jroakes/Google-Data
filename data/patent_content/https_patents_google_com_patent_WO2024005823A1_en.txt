DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Overview
[0031] Generally, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for indexing non-fungible tokens. In particular, the systems and methods disclosed herein can identify data associated with non-fungible tokens in a blockchain (e.g., in the code of a blockchain). For example, a plurality of non-fungible tokens can be identified and indexed based on a plurality of techniques. One technique can include analyzing (e.g., crawling) a blockchain to identify data associated with a non-fungible token. The data can then be parsed to determine identifiable data that can be indexed. Another technique can include analyzing (e.g., crawling) a web platform (e.g., a non-fungible token marketplace) to identify non-fungible tokens for sale. Data related to the non-fungible tokens can then be obtained and indexed. In some implementations, multiple techniques can be utilized for generating a more encompassing database for search.
[0032] The systems and methods disclosed herein can include obtaining blockchain data from a blockchain computing system. The blockchain data can include one or more function
signatures. In some implementations, the blockchain data can include script data associated with a digital resource (e.g., a digital asset). A particular portion (e.g., a subset) of the blockchain data can be determined to include token data. The token data can be descriptive of a non-fungible token associated with a digital resource (e.g., a digital asset). Index data can be generated based on the token data. The index data can include information obtained from the blockchain data. In some implementations, the index data can be associated with the digital resource (e.g., a digital asset). The index data can then be stored in an index database. The index database can then be utilized for a variety of purposes (e.g., non-fungible token search, data aggregation and analysis, training data for a machine-learned model, and/or for generating statistical representations).
[0033] The systems and methods disclosed herein can be utilized for enabling a non- fungible token search via a search engine. For example, a search query can be received. A search engine can process the search query and can determine a plurality of search results associated with the search query. In some implementations, one or more search results can be associated with non-fungible tokens. A particular search result can be associated with the index data. The one or more non-fungible token search results can be provided for display in a search results interface (e.g., a search results page). The one or more non-fungible token search results can be provided for display in a separate panel. Alternatively and/or additionally, the one or more non-fungible token search results can be provided for display adjacent to general search results. The one or more non-fungible token search results can be provided with one or more indicators indicating the non-fungible token nature (e.g., provided with one or more labels, flags, and/or tags). In some implementations, the one or more non- fungible token search results can be provided with a generated preview of the digital resource based on the index data.
[0034] In some implementations, the systems and methods disclosed herein can be utilized for Web3 profiles, for Web3 transactions, and/or for Web3 identification.
[0035] The systems and methods can improve the search user interface and user experience by identifying and indexing relevant data that can be utilized for determining the non-fungible token is responsive to a search query. Additionally and/or alternatively, the index data can be leveraged to determine a ranking for the non-fungible token search result with relation to other search results. The systems and methods can be utilized to determine if a search result can be provided with a non-fungible token tag and/or can be given a ranking boost based on the association with an authenticated non-fungible token.
[0036] The systems and methods can obtain blockchain data (e.g., code from a blockchain) from a blockchain computing system (e.g., a decentralized computing system storing distributed data). The blockchain data can include one or more function signatures. In some implementations, the blockchain data can include script associated with a digital resource (e.g., a digital asset).

The index data can include the feature data.
[0043] In some implementations, generating the index data can include determining the digital resource associated with the non-fungible token and processing the non-fungible token with a machine-learned model (e.g., a classification model, a detection model, a feature extractor model, and/or a semantics model) to determine one or more classifications, features, and/or attributes associated with the digital resource (e.g., attributes associated with the digital asset).

In some implementations, the systems and methods can include obtaining both blockchain data and web page data. The obtained data can be obtained via an application programming interface. In some implementations, the obtained data may be intervalley updated. The updates can occur at set intervals and/or may be obtained at a frequency based on transaction trends, type of digital resource (e.g., type of digital asset), the particular blockchain, and/or based on cost.
[0057] The systems and methods can then determine a subset of the obtained data (e.g., the blockchain data and/or the web page data) is descriptive of a non-fungible token associated with a digital resource (e.g., a digital asset). The determination can be based on a search for a particular structure, particular terms, and/or particular actors.

In some implementations, strict compliance may not need to be followed. For example, data types may deviate from the spec of the standards. The functional nature and/or the spirit of the data may be determined to be associated with a non-functional token.
[0058] Index data can be generated based at least in part on the subset of obtained data (e.g., the blockchain data and/or the web page data).

Additionally and/or alternatively, whether the non-fungible token was lazy minted or not may be indexed. The index data can include whether the non-fungible token was auctioned.
[0060] The systems and methods can then store the index data in a search database. The search database can include a plurality of index datasets associated with a plurality of non- fungible tokens. In some implementations, the plurality of non-fungible tokens can be identified by processing data from a plurality of sources.

Alternatively and/or additionally the search query can include one or more images, audio data, latent encoding data, and/or multimodal data.
[0062] The search query can be processed to determine the search query is associated with the index data. The search query may be received and processed with a search engine.
The search engine can be configured to crawl a blockchain, web pages, and/or the index database, or search database.
[0063] In some implementations, determining the search query is associated with index data can include determining one or more search terms of the search query are descriptive of at least one of the digital resource (e.g., the digital asset), an author of the digital resource (e.g., the creator of the digital asset), or non-fungible token metadata.
[0064] A search result associated with the digital resource (e.g., the digital asset) can then be provided to the user computing system. The search result can include a preview of the digital resource (e.g., a preview of the digital asset). Alternatively and/or additionally, the search result can include an indicator indicating the search result is associated with a non- fungible token.
[0065] In some implementations, providing the search result associated with the digital resource (e.g., the digital asset) to the user computing system can include determining one or more web pages are associated with the search query, generating one or more general web results based on the one or more web pages, and providing a search results page to the user computing system. The search results page can include the search result and one or more general web results.
[0066] In some implementations, the index data generated based on blockchain data and the index data generated based on web page data can be reconciled. For example, in an instance in which the blockchain data and web data are in conflict, the systems and methods can process the data, determine which data is more trustworthy, determine whether to merge the data, and/or determine whether to delete one or both sets of data.
[0067] In some implementations, the index data may be intervalley updated. The updates can occur at set intervals and/or may be obtained at a frequency based on transaction trends, performance data, type of digital resource, the particular blockchain, time of minting (e.g., older non-fungible tokens may be updated less often due to larger computational cost associated with the crawl), and/or based on cost.
[0068] The index database can include an index item field associated with the digital resource type such that non-fungible tokens associated with augmented-reality rendering assets can be differentiated from non-fungible tokens associated with images. In some implementations, the index data can include how to launch, run, and/or view the payload (e.g., the digital asset).

As one example, the system and methods can provide systems and methods for indexing data associated with one or more non-fungible tokens. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein can generate index data based on identified token data, which can then be utilized for a plurality of different tasks (e.g., search, trend determination, and/or catalog generation).
[0071] Another technical benefit of the systems and methods of the present disclosure is the ability to leverage one or more machine-learned models to generate labels and descriptors for one or more digital resources. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein can process a digital resource with one or more machine-learned models to generate labels and descriptors for one or more digital resources, which can then be added to index data for the respective non-fungible token. The labels and descriptors can then be used for search (e.g., key word search) and/or for non-fungible token correlation to classify non-fungible token families and/or communities.
[0072] Another example of technical effect and benefit relates to improved computational efficiency and improvements in the functioning of a computing system. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein can leverage the generated index data and greatly reduce the computational power to navigate through a plurality of web pages to identify and purchase related non-fungible tokens. Additionally, the systems and methods disclosed herein can reduce the computational power utilized by a user when attempting to obtain data on a digital resource (e.g., digital asset) and then purchase the digital resource (e.g., digital asset).

In some implementations, the central device data layer can communicate with a number of other components of the computing device, such as, for example, one or more sensors, a context manager, a device state component, and/or additional components. In some implementations, the central device data layer can communicate with each device component using an API (e.g., a private API).
[0084] Additionally and/or alternatively, Figure 1A depicts an exemplary computing system 100 that can be used to implement token data indexing according to aspects of the present disclosure.

The user profile 140 can be descriptive of user information, which can include identification numbers and/or payment account information. For example, the user profile 140 can include data associated with a crypto wallet, which may be linked to a browser application via an application extension and/or embedding.
[0097] The user computing system 130 can further include a graphics processing unit. Graphics processing unit can be used by processor 132 to token data index. In some embodiments, the user computing system 130 performs any and all token data identification and indexing.
[0098] The user computing system 130 can include a network interface for communicating with a server 110 over a network 180. Network interface can include any components or configuration suitable for communication with server 110 over network 180, including, for example, one or more ports, transmitters, wireless cards, controllers, physical layer components, or other items for communication according to any currently known or future developed communications protocol or technology.
[0099] The network 180 can be any type of communications network, such as a local area network (e.g., intranet), wide area network (e.g., Internet), or some combination thereof. The network 180 can also include a direct connection between a client device 130 and the server 110. In general, communication between the server 110 and a client device 130 can be carried via network interface using any type of wired and/or wireless connection, using a variety of communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP), encodings or formats (e.g., HTML, XML), and/or protection schemes (e.g., VPN, secure HTTP, SSL).
[0100] In some implementations, the exemplary computing system 100 can include one or more creator computing systems 150. The one or more creator computing systems 150 can be utilized for generating images, videos, prose, poetry, audio, etc., which can then be provided for sale. The one or more creator computing systems 150 can include one or more processors 152, which can be utilized to execute one or more operations to implement the systems and methods disclosed herein. The one or more creator computing systems 150 can include one or more memory components 154, which can be utilized to store data 156 and one or more instructions 158. The data 156 can include data related to one or more applications, one or more media datasets, etc. The instructions 158 can include one or more operations for implementing the systems and methods disclosed herein.
[0101] The one or more creator computing systems 150 can store data associated with one or more digital resources 160 and/or one or more creator profiles 162. The one or more digital resources 160 can include text data, image data, video data, audio data, latent encoding data, domain data, or a variety of other data formats. The one or more creator profiles 162 can include information associated with one or more “creators” of the one or more digital resources 160. The one or more creator profiles 162 can include identification data, transaction data, and/or crypto wallet data.
[0102] Additionally and/or alternatively, the exemplary computing system 100 can include one or more blockchain computing systems 170. The one or more blockchain computing systems 170 can include a plurality of computing devices being utilized for decentralized data storage, such that a plurality of “blocks” can be distributed throughout a network of computing devices to provide a secure system for data storage, which can include one or more ledgers 172 and one or more tokens 174. In some implementations, each of the one or more tokens 174 can be associated with at least a portion of the one or more ledgers 172.
[0103] Blockchain can refer to a system configured to securely record information. The blockchain can include a decentralized system that can render changing information extremely difficult. The blockchain can include a digital ledger of transactions that can be duplicated and distributed across a network of computing systems. Each block in the chain can include a number of transactions. When a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction can be added to every computing device’s ledger. The blockchain can be utilized to track the exchange of currency and/or digital resources via the recording of transactions on the digital ledger, which can be propagated throughout the decentralized system. The currency exchanged and tracked via the blockchain computing system 170 can be referred to as cryptocurrency.
[0104] The tokens 174 can include one or more non-fungible tokens. The non-fungible tokens can be minted on a blockchain associated with the blockchain computing system 170. A non-fungible token (NFT) can be a certificate of authenticity of a digital resource (e.g., a certificate of authenticity of a digital asset). NFTs can be non-interchangeable thus making their worth depend on the price anyone may be willing to pay for the asset. NFTs can be minted on blockchains such that their scarcity and authenticity can be maintained. A digital resource can be defined as anything that is stored digitally and can be uniquely identifiable that organizations can use to realize value. Examples of digital resources can include a tweet, a social media comment, documents, audio, images, videos, logos, website domains, slide presentations, spreadsheets, CSS files and formats, executable code, and/or websites.
[0105] Figure IB depicts a block diagram of an example blockchain 50 that may be utilized by the blockchain computing system 170 of the exemplary computing system 100 of Figure 1 A. The example blockchain 50 can include a plurality of blocks that can be utilized to store data with one or more cryptographic features. The blockchain 50 can be stored on a decentralized computing system comprising a plurality of computing devices. The blockchain 50 can be a public blockchain (e.g., a blockchain that is open without access restrictions such
that anyone with an internet access can send transactions or validate transactions as part of the decentralized, distributed system), a private blockchain (e.g., a blockchain that provides access based on permissions set by network administrators), or a hybrid blockchain (e.g., a blockchain with a combination of blocks with no restrictions and blocks with restrictions). The blockchain 50 can include proof of work features that can include one or more cryptographic forms of proof. The proof of work can be provided upon a request to update the blockchain 50 (e.g., a request to update the ledgers based on a new transaction). The proof of work can convey that a certain device or group of devices have performed a certain amount of computation, which can then be validated by other parties. Once validated, the blockchain 50 can be updated, or may remain unchanged in response to a failure to validate. The proof of work feature can be utilized to mitigate the computational cost of every device in the system having to perform the same computational functions and checks for determining a request is valid for updating the blockchain 50.
[0106] Each block can include a hash, a previous hash associated with the hash of the previous block, and data. In some implementations, each block can include a nonce. A hash can be a hash value of a fixed length that can be a fingerprint for the particular block. The hash value can be generated based on a hash function and may be changed each time a change is made to the data of that particular block. The previous hash can include a hash value of the block immediately preceding the particular block. The previous hash can be utilized to ensure the downstream ground truth stays unchanged unless proper validation occurs. The data can include transaction data (e.g., a transaction ledger), a timestamp, a value associated with a cryptocurrency value, anon-fungible token (e.g., anon-fungible token including a script that references a digital resource, nonce data, and/or general blockchain data). Nonce (i.e., a number only used once) can be a number added to a block in a blockchain that can meet a difficulty level restriction when a block is rehashed. The nonce can be a number that blockchain miners are solving for, in order to receive an incentive (e.g., cryptocurrency).
[0107] The blockchain 50 can include one or more security protocols and/or features. The blockchain 50 can include a cryptographic system. For example, the blockchain 50 can validate the blockchain 50 is valid by ensuring the stored previous hash stored in the block matches the hash value of the previous block from the last block back to the first block (e.g., the genesis block). In some implementations, the blockchain 50 can include proof of work validation that can rely on verifying proof of computation before implementing a change to the stored data (e.g., the stored ledger). Proof of work validation can take seconds, minutes,
and/or hours based in part on the number of blocks in the blockchain 50. Additionally and/or alternatively, the blockchain 50 can be implemented on a distributed, decentralized computing system. In some implementations, each computing device in the distributed, decentralized computing system can store a portion of (e.g., a block of the plurality of blocks) or all of the blocks in the blockchain 50. Therefore, the system can verify data by ensuring the data is uniform across most, if not all, of the distributed system. Each node of the distributed system can be checked for tampering before adding new data.
[0108] The data can include data associated with a cryptocurrency value (e.g., a ledger associated with a specific cryptocurrency value), data associated with a digital resource (e.g., a non-fungible token minted on the blockchain 50 that can include a script associated with the digital asset), data associated with a smart contract (e.g., a smart contract that includes conditions that automatically initiates an action in response to a criteria being met), and/or timestamp data (e.g., timestamp data for block creation, minting, a transaction, etc.).
[0109] In particular, Figure IB depicts a first block 10, a second block 20, a third block 30, a fourth block 40, and an nth block 60. Although five blocks are depicted, any number of blocks can be utilized. The first block 10 can be a genesis block (e.g., a first overall block in the blockchain). The first block 10 can include a respective first hash 12 (e.g., a hash value associated with the first block 10). The first block 10 may include a first previous hash 14 (e.g., if the first block 10 has a block before it in the blockchain 50, then the hash of the previous block can be stored on the first block 10). Additionally and/or alternatively, the first block 10 can include data 16 and nonce 18.
[0110] The second block 20 can follow the first block 10. The second block 20 can include a respective second hash 22 (e.g., a hash value associated with the second block 20). The second block 20 may include a second previous hash 24 (e.g., the second previous hash 24 can be the same as, or reference, the first hash 12). Additionally and/or alternatively, the second block 20 can include data 26 and nonce 28.
[0111] The third block 30 can follow the second block 20. The third block 30 can include a respective third hash 32 (e.g., a hash value associated with the third block 30). The third block 30 may include a third previous hash 34 (e.g., the third previous hash 34 can be the same as, or reference, the second hash 22). Additionally and/or alternatively, the third block 30 can include data 36 and nonce 38.
[0112] Additionally and/or alternatively, the fourth block 40, the nth block 60, and other potential blocks can include a respective hash, a respective previous hash, and data. The first data 16, the second data 26, the third data 36, and the data of the other blocks can include
overlapping data, can differ, and/or be the same such that the data is duplicative for all blocks. In some implementations, each block can be associated with a different transaction (e.g., a different minting, a different sale, etc.). The first nonce 18, the second nonce 28, the third nonce 38, and the nonce’s of the other blocks can differ and may be solved during mining.
[0113] The data in each block can include ledger data, which can include a timestamp, asset and/or cryptocurrency exchanged, actors involved in transaction, and/or a variety of other information.
[0114] In some implementations, a plurality of different blockchains can be utilized for the systems and methods disclosed herein. The different blockchains can include different configurations. The different blockchains can include parallel chains, side chains, shared blocks, differing chains, varying permissions, varying purposes, varying number of blocks, and/or varying hash functions and/or varying hashing value lengths.
[0115] In some implementations, the systems and methods can include one or more machine-learned model computing systems 900. The one or more machine-learned models can be utilized for a variety of tasks for enabling token data identification and indexing. [0116] Figure 9A depicts a block diagram of an example computing system 900 that performs token data identification and indexing according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. The system 900 includes a user computing device 902, a server computing system 930, and a training computing system 950 that are communicatively coupled over a network 980.
[0117] The user computing device 902 can be any type of computing device, such as, for example, a personal computing device (e.g., laptop or desktop), a mobile computing device (e.g., smartphone or tablet), a gaming console or controller, a wearable computing device, an embedded computing device, or any other type of computing device.
[0118] The user computing device 902 includes one or more processors 912 and a memory 914. The one or more processors 912 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. The memory 914 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof. The memory 914 can store data 916 and instructions 918 which are executed by the processor 912 to cause the user computing device 902 to perform operations.
[0119] In some implementations, the user computing device 902 can store or include one or more token indexing models 920. For example, the token indexing models 920 can be or can otherwise include various machine-learned models such as neural networks (e.g., deep neural networks) or other types of machine-learned models, including non-linear models and/or linear models. Neural networks can include feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks (e.g., long short-term memory recurrent neural networks), convolutional neural networks or other forms of neural networks. Example token indexing models 920 are discussed with reference to Figure 3.
[0120] In some implementations, the one or more token indexing models 920 can be received from the server computing system 930 over network 980, stored in the user computing device memory 914, and then used or otherwise implemented by the one or more processors 912. In some implementations, the user computing device 902 can implement multiple parallel instances of a single token indexing model 920 (e.g., to perform parallel token data indexing across multiple instances of token data descriptive of a non-fungible token).
[0121] More particularly, the token indexing model can include one or more detection models, one or more segmentation models, one or more classification models, and/or one or more feature extractor models. The token indexing model can process blockchain data and/or web page data to generate index data descriptive of index information associated with one or more respective non-fungible tokens.
[0122] Additionally or alternatively, one or more token indexing models 940 can be included in or otherwise stored and implemented by the server computing system 930 that communicates with the user computing device 902 according to a client-server relationship. For example, the token indexing models 940 can be implemented by the server computing system 940 as a portion of a web service (e.g., a token indexing service). Thus, one or more models 920 can be stored and implemented at the user computing device 902 and/or one or more models 940 can be stored and implemented at the server computing system 930.
[0123] The user computing device 902 can also include one or more user input components 922 that receive user input. For example, the user input component 922 can be a touch-sensitive component (e.g., a touch-sensitive display screen or a touch pad) that is sensitive to the touch of a user input object (e.g., a finger or a stylus). The touch-sensitive component can serve to implement a virtual keyboard. Other example user input components include a microphone, a traditional keyboard, or other means by which a user can provide user input.
[0124] The server computing system 930 includes one or more processors 932 and a memory 934. The one or more processors 932 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. The memory 934 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof. The memory 934 can store data 936 and instructions 938 which are executed by the processor 932 to cause the server computing system 930 to perform operations.
[0125] In some implementations, the server computing system 930 includes or is otherwise implemented by one or more server computing devices. In instances in which the server computing system 930 includes plural server computing devices, such server computing devices can operate according to sequential computing architectures, parallel computing architectures, or some combination thereof.
[0126] As described above, the server computing system 930 can store or otherwise include one or more machine-learned token indexing models 940. For example, the models 940 can be or can otherwise include various machine-learned models. Example machine- learned models include neural networks or other multi-layer non-linear models. Example neural networks include feed forward neural networks, deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. Example models 940 are discussed with reference to Figure 3.
[0127] The user computing device 902 and/or the server computing system 930 can train the models 920 and/or 940 via interaction with the training computing system 950 that is communicatively coupled over the network 980. The training computing system 950 can be separate from the server computing system 930 or can be a portion of the server computing system 930.
[0128] The training computing system 950 includes one or more processors 952 and a memory 954. The one or more processors 952 can be any suitable processing device (e.g., a processor core, a microprocessor, an ASIC, a FPGA, a controller, a microcontroller, etc.) and can be one processor or a plurality of processors that are operatively connected. The memory 954 can include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, magnetic disks, etc., and combinations thereof. The memory 954 can store data 956 and instructions 958 which are executed by the processor 952 to cause the training computing system 950 to perform
operations. In some implementations, the training computing system 950 includes or is otherwise implemented by one or more server computing devices.
[0129] The training computing system 950 can include a model trainer 960 that trains the machine-learned models 920 and/or 940 stored at the user computing device 902 and/or the server computing system 930 using various training or learning techniques, such as, for example, backwards propagation of errors. For example, a loss function can be backpropagated through the model(s) to update one or more parameters of the model(s) (e.g., based on a gradient of the loss function). Various loss functions can be used such as mean squared error, likelihood loss, cross entropy loss, hinge loss, and/or various other loss functions. Gradient descent techniques can be used to iteratively update the parameters over a number of training iterations.
[0130] In some implementations, performing backwards propagation of errors can include performing truncated backpropagation through time. The model trainer 960 can perform a number of generalization techniques (e.g., weight decays, dropouts, etc.) to improve the generalization capability of the models being trained.
[0131] In particular, the model trainer 960 can train the token indexing models 920 and/or 940 based on a set of training data 962. The training data 962 can include, for example, training blockchain data, training web page data, ground truth labels, ground truth index information, and/or ground truth segmentation masks.
[0132] In some implementations, if the user has provided consent, the training examples can be provided by the user computing device 902. Thus, in such implementations, the model 920 provided to the user computing device 902 can be trained by the training computing system 950 on user-specific data received from the user computing device 902. In some instances, this process can be referred to as personalizing the model.
[0133] The model trainer 960 includes computer logic utilized to provide desired functionality. The model trainer 960 can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software controlling a general purpose processor. For example, in some implementations, the model trainer 960 includes program files stored on a storage device, loaded into a memory and executed by one or more processors. In other implementations, the model trainer 960 includes one or more sets of computer-executable instructions that are stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium such as RAM hard disk or optical or magnetic media. [0134] The network 980 can be any type of communications network, such as a local area network (e.g., intranet), wide area network (e.g., Internet), or some combination thereof and can include any number of wired or wireless links. In general, communication over the
network 980 can be carried via any type of wired and/or wireless connection, using a wide variety of communication protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, FTP), encodings or formats (e.g., HTML, XML), and/or protection schemes (e.g., VPN, secure HTTP, SSL).

In some implementations, the indexing system 200 is configured to receive blockchain data 202 descriptive of a blockchain that stores data associated with a plurality of non-fungible tokens and, as a result of receipt of the input data 202, provide output data 220 that is descriptive of a plurality of index datasets associated with the plurality of non-fungible tokens. Thus, in some implementations, the indexing system 200 can include one or more models and/or one or more functions for identifying token data and extracting relevant information for generating index data.
[0153] In particular, the example indexing system 200 can include obtaining blockchain data 202 associated with a blockchain. The blockchain data 202 can include code for the blockchain. Additionally and/or alternatively, the blockchain data 202 can include script data (e.g., data descriptive of script that can be deployed to interact with smart contract code of the blockchain data 202) associated with a plurality of non-fungible tokens.
[0154] The blockchain data 202 can be processed to identify first token data for a first non-fungible token 204, second token data for a second non-fungible token 206, third token data for a third non-fungible token 208, and nth token data for a nth non-fungible token 210. Identifying the token data sets can involve parsing the blockchain data and determining if each parsed segment is associated with one or more non-fungible token characteristics. Alternatively and/or additionally, identifying the token data can include crawling the blockchain data to search for particular characteristics, structure, and/or features associated with token data.
[0155] The first token data associated with the first non-fungible token 204 can be processed to generate first index data 212 associated with the first non-fungible token 204. The second token data associated with the second non-fungible token 206 can be processed to generate second index data 214 associated with the second non-fungible token 206. The third
token data associated with the third non-fungible token 208 can be processed to generate third index data 216 associated with the third non-fungible token 208. The nth token data associated with the nth non-fungible token 210 can be processed to generate nth index data 218associated with the nth non-fungible token 210.
[0156] The first index data 212, the second index data 214, the third index data 216, and the nth index data 218 can be stored in an index database 220, which can then be utilized for various tasks (e.g., non-fungible token search). The index datasets can include index information associated with a plurality of index item fields. The index datasets can include a title of the non-fungible token, a reference to the digital resource payload, descriptors, and/or a variety of other index items for annotating and/or characterizing aspects of the non-fungible token which may be searched.

Additionally and/or alternatively, web page data 326 associated with the same or related non-fungible token to the non-fungible token associated with the token data 302 can be utilized to determine one or more additional index items for one or more index item fields.
[0158] Additionally and/or alternatively, the token data 302 and/or the web page data 326 can be processed with one or more machine-learned models 324 to generate one or more outputs that can be utilized as index items for the index data 310. Alternatively and/or additionally, the input data for the one or more machine-learned models 324 can be obtained from other data sources. In some implementations, the index data 310 can include data descriptive of the blockchain 312 the non-fungible token is minted on.

[0179] Figure 7 depicts a flow chart diagram of an example method to perform according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Although Figure 7 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods of the present disclosure are not limited to the particularly illustrated order or arrangement. The various steps of the method 700 can be omitted, rearranged, combined, and/or adapted in various ways without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure.
[0180] At 702, a computing system can obtain web page data from a web page. The web page data can be descriptive of listing information for a non-fungible token. In some implementations, the web page data can include data associated with a digital resource (e.g., a digital asset).

In some implementations, the index database can be used to surface non-fungible token search results for a search engine. Additionally and/or alternatively, the index database can be utilized to determine statistics associated with non-fungible tokens. For example, trending non-fungible tokens of a certain
type and/or creator can be determined and then utilized for non-fungible token ranking in marketplaces, search result pages, and/or for informing users for informed purchasing. [0184] Figure 8 depicts a flow chart diagram of an example method to perform according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. Although Figure 8 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods of the present disclosure are not limited to the particularly illustrated order or arrangement. The various steps of the method 800 can be omitted, rearranged, combined, and/or adapted in various ways without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure.
[0185] At 802, a computing system can obtain blockchain data. For example, the computing system can include obtaining blockchain data (e.g., blockchain data obtained from a blockchain node associated with a blockchain computing system). Alternatively and/or additionally, the computing system can obtain web page data (e.g., marketplace data obtained via taking a snapshot of a web page associated with a non-fungible token marketplace).

Example Implementations and Uses
[0195] The systems and methods disclosed herein can be utilized for search to allow a user to make a deliberate decision to invest or not invest in a particular non-fungible token. [0196] In particular, the systems and methods can be utilized to make Web3 technology easily accessible to a significant chunk of our users (and not just early adopters or crypto enthusiasts who are well versed in Web3). The way Web3 may work can be a significant departure from a general users mental model. For example, the systems and methods may focus on simplifying the tech, jargon, applications, and/or setup.
[0197] The blockchain computing system can include a decentralized system; however, the systems and methods disclosed herein can be implemented in a decentralized system, a closed-off ecosystem, and/or a hybrid system including portions completed by a decentralized system and portions completed by a centralized system.
[0198] In some implementations, the systems and methods disclosed herein can be utilized for identity purposes. For example, the systems and methods disclosed herein can involve and/or interface with a crypto wallet of a user to store user identity data to be utilized across Web3. A user may sign into websites, share personal data, prove identity, and/or transfer crypto currency based in part on the identity data.
[0199] Wallet apps can be built-in to browser. In Web3, there may be a single mechanism to sign in while keeping your data for yourself.
[0200] The blockchain computing system can store data descriptive of a variety of information, which can include non-fungible token Content IDs and/or ownership information for the non-fungible tokens. Non-fungible tokens can introduce scarcity and authenticity to digital items.
[0201] The systems and methods disclosed herein can be implemented into a search engine to enhance image, video, and audio search. For example, the systems and methods implemented into a search engine can signal to users who owns an image or video on the web
and where the digital resource (e.g., the digital asset) comes from, can enforce copyright rules for the digital resource (e.g., copyright rules for the digital asset), can detect if the digital resource has been tampered with or has trust issues, and/or can enable the sale or transfer of digital content on the web (e.g., non-fungible token marketplaces for images, music, and/or another form of digital asset).
[0202] The systems and methods disclosed herein can include creator tokens. A Web3 model can enable creators to own their content and have a direct relationship with their followers/subscribers/fans, which can bypass today’s platforms. This can be very disruptive to video platforms, but may be an opportunity for search engines, which may not be on the top of the mind for creators. Creator tokens can be a way for fans to “invest” in their favorite creators while also enabling creators to create a community around their fans.
[0203] In some implementations, the systems and methods disclosed herein can be utilized to provide an oracle system (e.g., a system that can provide service provider system for smart contracts to check whether something is real or has happened).
[0204] The systems and methods disclosed herein can include general information retrieval. The systems and methods can enable search to index the important parts of blockchain and make them accessible and useful.
[0205] The systems and methods can include decentralized autonomous organization, which can be used to automate decision making. In some implementations, information about decentralized autonomous organization of search engines can be provided and may make the decision making more transparent.
[0206] In some implementations, the systems and methods can enable ownership of any digital asset on the web by empowering creators and publishers to claim ownership of their digital content and set the rules of its usage in a scalable and high speed fashion. Additionally and/or alternatively, the systems and methods can enable ownership of any digital asset on the web by empowering search users to understand the provenance and history of a digital asset while also being able to take action on the digital asset in a way that is permitted by the original creator (e.g., buy the non-fungible token and/or use the non-fungible token as a ticket).
[0207] In some implementations, the systems and methods can simultaneously create carrots for creators and publishers to publish non-fungible content on the web while also giving them tools to create this content and set rules of usage for the content.
[0208] For example, the carrots can be created to show who owns an image on the web or show items published by a creator/publisher, can block copies of an ‘owned’ digital asset
or at least transfer any revenue generated from it to the original owner, can enable a user to sell and monetize generated content, and can enable royalty fees.
[0209] Additionally and/or alternatively, the systems and methods can include tools for creators/publishers to create non-fungible content. For example, the systems and methods can give creators/publishers easy tools to publish non-fungible content and set rules for the content usage that can both be done by casual creators as well as sophisticated large scale players.
[0210] In some implementations, the systems and methods can include a smart contract blockchain that can be open, closed, and/or a hybrid of both.
[0211] The systems and methods can be implemented to enable a non-fungible token marketplace across various digital asset platforms (e.g., an image platform, a video hosting platform, and/or a music hosting platform) and/or across various service platforms (e.g., a search engine, a social media platform, and/or a blog platform). The creators and/or publishers can generate digital assets, mint the digital assets, sell the digital assets, and/or receive royalties for future sales of the digital assets.
[0212] The non-fungible tokens can be utilized to access private chat groups or blogs inside different platforms and communities, can be used to set up avatars that are verified as being owned by a particular user, can enable quick communication between creators and owners, and can provide transactional history that can be used for future releases and purchases by providing insightful suggestions.
