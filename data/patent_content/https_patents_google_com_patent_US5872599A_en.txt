- the present invention is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/399,084, Attorney Docket No. Rosenberg 2, entitled “Apparatus and Methods for Determining an Initial Huffman Coding Rate”; U.S. Pat. No. 5,696,563, Attorney Docket No. Rosenberg 4, entitled “Apparatus and Methods for Performing Huffman Coding”; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,747, Attorney Docket No. Hartung 10-1, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Vector Quantization Caching in a Real Time Video Coder", which are all commonly assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and which are filed concurrently herewith.
- the disclosures of these related Applications are incorporated herein by reference.
- the present invention relates generally to signal compression, and in particular to apparatus and methods for selectively reducing a Huffman Coding rate.
- Conventional communication systems including networks, include two or more interconnected nodes wherein each node functions as a junction point within the system.
- Information is transferred between nodes using electric, light, and/or radio waves, and typically involves transferring one or more codewords.
- Each codeword represents a symbol in a symbol set, such as an alphabet, and includes data for use by, and/or instructions for, a receiving node.
- Each codeword is defined by one or more binary digits, or bits.
- Communication systems have limited bandwidth. In other words, there exists an upper limit, or maximum number, of bits which may be transferred per unit time. Contrary to this limitation is the need of many communication systems to transfer large quantities of symbols. This is particularly true in video applications, such as videophone and direct television, where video symbols typically represent chrominance and/or luminance values for picture elements ("pixels"), motion information, instructions indicating the content of the chrominance, and luminance values or marker codes. Marker codes are sync codes.
- Huffman Coding is one popular approach which is commonly used for video, audio/speech and high-speed data compression.
- Huffman Codes use variable length symbols wherein each symbol's length depends upon the probability of occurrence of the one or more codewords defining it.
- Each of the codewords used to represent the symbol set has a length inversely proportional to its symbol's usage. Assuming this symbol set is used in the English language, "wear” is likely to be said more often than “bear”, more often than “dart”, and more often than “beet”.
- the coding may accordingly be ⁇ be, dar, w, beet ⁇ , where codeword length is equivalent to the number of letters.
- variable length codewords wherein common words such as ⁇ it, in, a, car, the, if, I, a, an ⁇ are shorter than words used less frequently, such as ⁇ approximately, university, automobile, individually, myself, particularly ⁇ .
- Source entropy is an optimal "loss-less" coding rate, in other words, the smallest average number of bits per symbol required to represent a particular symbol set or alphabet.
- Huffman Coding techniques have been found to reduce coding rates to nearly source entropy.
- the probability of all occurrences of the various symbols tends to change as the video image changes. This causes the current Huffman Codes to be an inefficient representation of the symbols. Worse, these changes typically occur at random.
- the Huffman Codes accordingly cease to reduce coding rates to source entropy and require recalculation. This is often computationally difficult as the codeword for any one symbol depends on the probability of occurrence of the symbols in the alphabet. For large alphabets therefore each codeword, of which there are typically many, requires substantial computation.
- One conventional solution periodically recalculates the Huffman Codes.
- Another solution determines the source entropy, and then estimates from that determination the coding rate for recalculating the Huffman Codes.
- Each approach is typically inaccurate, and in many situations demands substantially the same processing resource requirements needed to recalculate the Huffman Codes as when originally defined.
- the inability of conventional communication systems to generate, and regenerate, Huffman Codes to maintain substantially source entropy remains a dominant obstacle to producing high quality video, audio/speech and high-speed communication.
- Communication systems have limited bandwidth, i.e., a maximum rate at which bits may be transferred per a given time period.
- compression techniques and in particular Huffman Coding techniques, are incorporated into conventional signal compressing systems to increase information throughput, i.e., the number of codewords transferred given the available bandwidth.
- the present invention is directed to apparatus and methods for selectively reducing a coding rate in response to limited bandwidth in communication systems, including without limitation, processing system networks (including local and wide area networks), telephony systems (including videophone and cellular technologies), direct television systems, satellite systems, land-mobile radio systems, broadcast systems, data storage/retrieval systems, and the like, for example.

- direct television systems satellite systems, land-mobile radio systems, broadcast systems, data storage/retrieval systems, and the like, for example.
- An apparatus in accordance with the principles of the present invention generates an output signal representing a selectively reduced coding rate for use in compressing a digital signal.
- the digital signal includes a plurality of digital sets wherein ones of the digital sets are non-unique.
- the apparatus includes receiving and processing means.
- the receiving means operates to receive an electric signal representing a current coding rate.
- the processing means operates to generate the output signal.
- the processing means selectively discards, or removes from consideration, one or more of the digital sets, preferably while the current coding rate is beyond a threshold coding rate, determines a coding rate difference resulting from the selectively discarded digital sets and recalculates the current coding rate using the rate difference.
- the output signal is then generated.
- a method in accordance with the principles of the present invention concerns selectively reducing a current coding rate for use in compressing a digital signal.
- the digital signal includes a plurality of digital sets wherein ones of the digital sets are non-unique.
- a current coding rate and a threshold coding rate are preferably compared to determine whether the current coding rate satisfies a predetermined criteria, i.e., such as validity.
- a predetermined criteria i.e., such as validity
- a coding rate difference resulting from selectively discarding ones of the digital sets is determined, and the current coding rate is recalculated using the determined rate difference.
- This selective reduction process preferably repeats until the current coding rate is valid, at which time the output signal is generated.
- One embodiment for using and/or distributing the present invention is as software.
- the software embodiment includes a plurality of processing system instructions which are stored to a storage medium.
- Preferred storage mediums include without limitation magnetic, optical, or semiconductor chip, as well as suitably arranged combinations thereof.

- source entropy is a tight lower bound on minimum average codeword length.

A zero is assigned to each member of one group and a one is assigned to each member of the other group.

- FIG. 5d illustrates the generation of pointers for the conceptual diagram of FIG. 5c.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary flow diagram for processing a received input signal utilizing Huffman Coding techniques in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
- the received input signal is assumed to be a video signal although the principles of the present invention may be advantageously used in conjunction with any signal compression apparatus, system or methodology. It is further assumed that the video signal is received at a constant frame rate, that each frame has a fixed number of bits, and that the bits are divided into three sections, namely, motion, vector quantization and scaler quantization information.
- the process begins upon receipt of the input signal, processing block 601. If the input signal is an analog signal, it is preferably digitized, processing block 602. In the event that the signal is already in a digital format, this processing step is bypassed.
- the video signal is preferably segmented into blocks wherein each block preferably contains k ⁇ k pixels, processing block 603. Although alternate embodiments may use non-square blocks. In the illustrative embodiment k is equal to eight, and each video frame preferably includes 8,960 pixels which are divided into 140 blocks (14 blocks horizontally and 10 blocks vertically). In alternate embodiments, particularly non-video embodiments, this processing step may be bypassed.
- Motion estimation between consecutive video frames is preferably accomplished by comparing a current video frame with a previous reference video frame to determine one or more motion vectors corresponding to one or more blocks, processing block 604. This is preferably accomplished using forward motion estimation wherein each block of the current frame is searched for in the previous reference frame.
- the techniques for calculating motion vectors are known, and may range from full search motion estimators to narrower selective search motion estimators, such as a coarse-fine search, for example.
- selective search motion estimators are preferred due to reduced processing resource requirements. Assuming that a full search is done, it is preferable to use motion vectors in the range of -5 to 5 pixels at a resolution of 112 ⁇ 80, in increments of 1/3 pel, for a total of 31 possible motion vectors in two dimensions.
- Sub-pel motion estimation is accomplished by interpolating up to preferably 336 ⁇ 240 resolutions, and then searching in a range of -15 to 15 pels, in one pel increments.
- the motion estimator is preferably biased towards a zero motion vector. If the prediction error for a particular motion vector is below a certain threshold, then zero motion is assumed in order to ensure that no motion is detected in regions of constant texture and to reduce source entropy coding rate as the zero-motion vector is coded with run-length codes.
- a motion vector is preferably obtained for each block.
- this processing step may be bypassed.
- a symbol set is typically utilized. More particularly, an array, or other suitable data structure or convention storage device, is preferably used as a catalogue representative of each unique symbol (presently, each unique motion vector) and its rate of occurrence, processing block 605.
- An initial coding rate is calculated to determine the exact number of bits required to compress the symbols representing the motion vectors to be transmitted, processing block 606. This is preferably accomplished without generating the Huffman Code itself.
- the preferred processing steps for calculating an initial coding rate are more fully discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/399,084, Attorney Docket No. Rosenberg 2, which is commonly assigned to the assignee of the present invention and which is incorporated herein by reference.
- a variable representing the current coding rate is preferably set equal to the initial coding rate, processing block 607.
- a Huffman Code generated in accordance with the principles of the present invention processing block 610.
- the preferred processing steps for generating the Huffman Code representing the current symbol table are more fully discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,696,563, Attorney Docket No. Rosenberg 4, which is commonly assigned to the assignee of the present invention and which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the codewords are preferably retrieved from a code book, processing block 611.
- a representative bit stream is generated, which in the illustrated embodiment represents the reconstructed video frame, processing block 612.
- FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary flow diagram for selectively reducing a Huffman Coding rate for use in compressing a received digital signal.
- the digital signal includes a plurality of digital sets wherein ones of the digital sets are preferably non-unique.
- the exemplary process begins upon receipt of an electric signal representing the current coding rate, processing block 701.
- An array, or other suitable data structure or conventional storage device is preferably used to store each one of the plurality of digital sets once.
- Each digital set preferably represents a particular symbol, such as a motion vector in the illustrated embodiment, as previously discussed with reference to processing block 605 of FIG. 6.
- Each digital set preferably has an indictor associated therewith which represents the probability of occurrence, or frequency, of that symbol.
- Suitable conventional addressing and/or traversal techniques are preferably used to control and access the array.
- the current coding rate is compared with a threshold coding rate to determine whether the current coding rate satisfies a predetermined criteria, such as validity, processing block 702.
- a predetermined criteria such as validity, processing block 702.
- the threshold coding rate represents the maximum bandwidth. If the current coding rate does not satisfy the predetermined criteria, or is invalid, NO branch of decisional block 703, then ones of the digital sets are selectively discarded, processing block 704. Selectively discarded, as used herein, includes removing from consideration. In the illustrated embodiment, selected ones of the motion vectors are discarded to reduce the number of bits required to represent the remaining motion vectors. If the current motion vector coding rate is greater than the maximum rate (preferably a fixed code parameter, typically 15% of the total bits/video frame), the current coding rate is preferably reduced by discarding the motion vector(s) having the least prediction gain.
- Prediction gain, G PR may be defined as follows: ##EQU1## Where B K ,T is the current coding block in the current frame, B K ,T is the prediction of B K ,T using a zero motion vector, and B K ,T is the coding block predicted using the actual motion vector.
- the prediction gain therefore is the improvement obtained from using a motion vector as opposed to assuming a zero motion vector.
- the motion vector having the least prediction gain is the motion vector for that block which provides the least improvement as compared to doing nothing at all (i.e., using a zero motion vector).
- the motion vector which yields the smallest G PR is accordingly discarded.
- particular symbols or individual occurrences or groups of occurrences of one or more symbols may be discarded. Further, the criteria for discarding a particular symbol, occurrence or group of occurrences of one or more symbols may be based upon a least prediction gain, as in the illustrated embodiment, or alternatively, upon a relatively low probability of occurrence or a metric based upon rate distortion, to name two examples.
- Re-computing the current Huffman Coding rate each time a symbol or an occurrence of a symbol is discarded is processing resource intensive. Further, the Huffman Coding rate, statistically, does not change substantially between iterations. The change in coding rate resulting from discarding a particular symbol, or one or more occurrences of a symbol, i.e., the difference between a new coding rate and the current coding rate is calculated, processing block 705.
- H 1 represents the entropy of the motion vectors before discarding one occurrence
- H 2 represents the entropy after discarding that occurrence
- .increment.B can thus be expressed as the sum of four terms. Each one of the four terms is of the form AlogA.
- the difference estimation is subtracted from the current Huffman Coding rate which yields the new Huffman Coding rate, processing block 706. If the new current coding rate is still greater than the threshold coding rate, processing block 702 and decisional block 703, then the foregoing process steps are preferably repeated until the current coding rate is valid.
- R M , and N. in the illustrated embodiment are both integral and have a finite range from 0 to 140.
- a look-up table of AlogA is preferably maintained, such as in the form of an array having 140 elements, for example. Alternatively, any other suitable data structure or conventional memory storage device may be utilized. .increment.B may therefore be computed using four table look-ups and three additions.
- a preferred embodiment for using and/or distributing the present invention is software.
- the software embodiment may be implemented in any suitable programming language.
- a "C" programming language implementation for performing the aforementioned processing steps is attached herewith as an appendix.
