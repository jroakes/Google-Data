Abstract
Systems and methods for distributing optical lines over an optical mesh network are disclosed herein. For example, the disclosed method includes identifying a new line to be added to a mesh optical network and identifying a set of potential paths for the new line. For each optical link in each identified potential path, a cost of assigning the new line to a plurality of frequency slots of the potential path that includes the optical link is determined. The cost of allocating a given frequency slot on a given optical link is determined in part based on the length of the optical line that can span the given optical link using the frequency slot. An overall cost value is calculated to allocate available frequency slots on each identified potential path, and one of the identified potential paths and one or more available frequency slots are allocated to the new line.
Description
Cross Reference to Related Applications
This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application No.16/271,472 filed on 8.2.2019, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Background
In a communication network, information (such as data streams or data packets) may be sent from a source to a destination. The information may be sent as a data stream that carries information between the source and destination along the path. The source and destination may be nodes in a network. A node represents a device in communication with a network through which information may be communicated, originated, and/or terminated. The nodes may be, for example: a computing device such as a personal computer, telephone, or tablet computer; a server such as an email server, a data server, or a web server; a router; a switch; a reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM); and other networked devices. The data streams may be sent over paths in the network. Each path consists of one or more links (or edges). A link or edge refers to a connection between two adjacent nodes. Each link is associated with a capacity or bandwidth that represents the amount of data that the link can carry at any given time.
As more nodes, data flows, and links are added to the network, it becomes more and more complex to assign paths for different data flows. It is a difficult problem for a traffic engineering system to choose the appropriate amount of data to allocate to a given link and balance the bandwidth of the links in the network with the need to route each data stream in a fast and efficient manner.
Disclosure of Invention
According to one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method. The method includes identifying a new line to be added to a mesh optical network having a plurality of optical links. Each optical line includes a source node and a destination node between which optical signals carried on the optical line are not converted into electrical signals. The method also includes identifying a set of potential paths for the new line through the mesh optical network. For each optical link in each identified potential path, a respective cost for assigning the new line to the plurality of frequency slots of the potential path that includes the optical link is determined. The cost of allocating a given frequency slot on a given optical link is determined in part based on the length of the optical line that can span the given optical link using the frequency slot. The method further includes calculating a total cost value for allocating available frequency slots on each identified potential path of the new line based on the costs determined for the frequency slots of each optical link along the potential path. One or more of the identified potential paths and available frequency slots are selected for the new line based on the calculated total cost value and routing and spectrum allocation instructions according to the selected path and the selected one or more frequency slots are communicated to a plurality of nodes in the network to implement the new line.
In some implementations, selecting one or more available frequency slots for the new line includes selecting a plurality of adjacent frequency slots. In some implementations, selecting one of the potential paths and one or more frequency slots includes selecting the one or more frequency slots on the potential path having the lowest calculated total cost value.
In some implementations, the method includes assigning a higher cost to frequency slots available for longer optical lines and assigning a lower cost to frequency slots available only for shorter optical lines. In some implementations, the cost of allocating one frequency slot on a given optical link to a new line is different than the cost of allocating a different frequency slot on a given optical link to a new line based on the location of the frequency slot in the electromagnetic spectrum.
In some implementations, after selecting one of the identified potential paths and one or more available frequency slots for the new route based on the calculated total cost value, the method includes calculating an update cost for frequency slots on a plurality of optical links in the optical mesh network based on the selection. In some implementations, the update cost is calculated only for links included in the selected identified potential path.
In some implementations, identifying the set of potential paths further includes identifying a subset of paths having path lengths within a configured percentage of a minimum path length identified between the source node and the destination node, where the path lengths are measured in terms of a total fiber length along the respective paths.
According to another aspect, the present disclosure relates to a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform a method. The method includes identifying new lines to be added to a mesh optical network having a plurality of optical links, wherein each optical line includes a source node and a destination node between which optical signals carried over the optical line are not converted to electrical signals. The method also includes identifying a set of potential paths for the new line through the mesh optical network. For each optical link in each identified potential path, a respective cost for assigning the new line to the plurality of frequency slots of the potential path that includes the optical link is determined. The cost of allocating a given frequency slot on a given optical link is determined in part based on the length of the optical line that can span the given optical link using the frequency slot. The instructions further cause the one or more processors to calculate a total cost value for allocating available frequency slots on each identified potential path of the new line based on the costs determined for the frequency slots of each optical link along the potential path, and select one of the identified potential paths and one or more available frequency slots for the new line based on the calculated total cost value. Routing and spectrum allocation instructions based on the selected path and the selected one or more frequency slots are then communicated to a plurality of nodes in the network to implement the new line.
In some implementations, selecting one or more available frequency slots for the new line includes selecting a plurality of adjacent frequency slots. In some implementations, selecting one of the potential paths and one or more frequency slots includes selecting the one or more frequency slots on the potential path having the lowest calculated total cost value.
In some implementations, the one or more processors assign a higher cost to frequency slots available for longer optical lines and a lower cost to frequency slots available only for shorter optical lines. In some implementations, the cost of assigning one frequency slot on a given optical link to a new line is different than the cost of assigning a different frequency slot on a given optical link to a new line based on the location of the frequency slot in the electromagnetic spectrum.
In some implementations, the instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to, after selecting one of the identified potential paths and one or more available frequency slots for the new line based on the calculated total cost value, calculate an updated cost for the frequency slots on a plurality of optical links in the optical mesh network based on the selection. In some implementations, the update cost is calculated only for links included in the selected identified potential path.
According to another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a system. The system includes an optical mesh network including a plurality of nodes interconnected by optical links, a memory for storing a representation of the optical mesh network, and a processor. The processor is configured to identify a new line to be added to a mesh optical network having a plurality of optical links. Each optical line includes a source node and a destination node between which optical signals carried on the optical line are not converted into electrical signals. The processor is further configured to identify a set of potential paths for the new line through the mesh optical network based on the stored representation, and for each optical link of each identified potential path, determine a respective cost of assigning the new line to a plurality of frequency slots that include the potential path of the optical link. The cost of allocating a given frequency slot on a given optical link is determined in part based on the length of the optical line that can span the given optical link using the frequency slot. The processor is further configured to calculate a total cost value for allocating available frequency slots on each identified potential path on the new line based on the costs determined for the frequency slots of each optical link along the potential path. The processor is further configured to select one of the identified potential paths and one or more available frequency slots for a new line based on the calculated total cost value, and communicate routing and spectrum allocation instructions based on the selected path and the selected one or more frequency slots to a plurality of nodes in the network to implement the new line.
In some implementations, selecting one or more available frequency slots for the new line includes selecting a plurality of adjacent frequency slots. In some implementations, the processor is configured to assign a higher cost to frequency slots available for longer lines and a lower cost to frequency slots available only for shorter lines. In some implementations, the cost of allocating one frequency slot on a given optical link to a new line is different than the cost of allocating a different frequency slot on a given optical link to a new line based on the location of the frequency slot in the electromagnetic spectrum. In some implementations, the processor is configured to calculate, based on the selection, updated costs for frequency slots on a plurality of optical links in the optical mesh network after selecting one of the identified potential paths and one or more available frequency slots for the new route based on the calculated total cost value.

Detailed Description
The disclosed implementations are directed to a method and apparatus for routing and spectrum allocation in an optical mesh network. The method and apparatus may reduce congestion (or accumulation periods) of data/information communicated using existing paths between sources and destinations in a mesh optical network. The disclosed implementations may also reduce the likelihood of blocking data/information in future communication paths that may be implemented between a source and a destination in an optical mesh network.
The source and destination may be nodes in a network. A node represents a device in communication with a network through which information may be communicated, originated, and/or terminated. The nodes may be, for example: a computing device such as a personal computer, telephone, or tablet computer; an email server, such as a data server or a web server; a router; a switch; a reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM); and other networked devices.
The data streams may be sent over paths in the network. As used herein, a connection between two nodes is referred to as a link, or a "edge" and one or more connected links or edges form a network path connecting a source and a destination with respect to a graphical representation of the network. For purposes of the discussion herein, it is assumed that the transmission medium of the mesh network is a fiber optic cable, and the network is referred to as a mesh optical network. However, implementations are not limited in this respect.
In a mesh optical network, information (or data) is transmitted along a path connecting a source node and a destination node using signals modulated onto one or more carriers forming an optical channel or line. The source node and the destination node may be considered end nodes of a network path connecting the source node and the destination node to each other. At the source node and the destination node, optical signals are formed via electro-optical conversion and recovered via electro-optical conversion, respectively. Between the source node and the destination node, optical signals may be transmitted via an optical channel without any optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversion or regeneration. In some cases, an optical channel may travel through one or more intermediate nodes and edges or links connecting the intermediate nodes. The intermediate node does not perform OEO conversion or regeneration on the received optical channel, but merely serves to direct (and in some cases amplify) the received optical signal along the path onto an edge or link connected to a subsequent node (another intermediate node or destination node).
In some implementations, the optical channel occupies one or more integer numbers of consecutive or adjacent frequency slots of the spectrum. In some implementations, one or more frequency slots may be located in separate (i.e., non-adjacent) portions of the frequency spectrum. In some implementations, the width of each frequency slot of the frequency spectrum is approximately 3.125 GHz. The number of frequency slots assigned to an optical channel is therefore dependent on the bandwidth required by the optical channel.
Fig. 1 illustrates an example mesh optical network 100 in accordance with implementations disclosed herein. As illustrated, the mesh optical network 100 includes a first node 102, a second node 104, a third node 106, a fourth node 108, and a fifth node 110. In the following example, the first node 102 serves as a source node, and is referred to as the source node 102 in the following discussion. The fifth node 110 serves as a destination node and is referred to as the destination node 110 in the following discussion. The second node 104, the third node 106, and the fourth node 108 serve as intermediate nodes. In the example network 100, the first node 102, the second node 104, the third node 106, the fourth node 108, and the fifth node 110 may be or include a reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM). The first node 102 and the third node 106 are connected to each other via a first edge 201. The third node 106 and the fifth node 110 are connected to each other via a second edge 203. The third node 106 and the fourth node 108 are connected to each other via a third edge 205. The first node 102 and the fourth node 108 are connected to each other via a fourth edge 207. The fourth node 108 and the fifth node 110 are connected to each other via a fifth edge 209. The second node 104 and the fourth node 108 are connected to each other via a sixth edge 211. The first node 102 and the second node 104 are connected to each other via a seventh edge 213. The second node 104 and the fifth node 110 are connected to each other via an eighth edge 215. Each of first edge 201, second edge 203, third edge 205, fourth edge 207, fifth edge 209, sixth edge 211, seventh edge 213, and eighth edge 215 includes one or more fiber optic cables.
Some edges include one or more optical line amplifiers connected in series with each other and with nodes for regenerating optical signals traveling along the respective edge. For example, the second edge 203 comprises a first optical line amplifier 301 connected in series with a second optical line amplifier 303. Each of the first optical line amplifier 301 and the second optical line amplifier 303 is configured to regenerate or amplify an optical channel traveling along the second edge 203. Similarly, sixth edge 211 comprises a third optical line amplifier 305 connected in series with a fourth optical line amplifier 307, seventh edge 213 comprises a fifth optical line amplifier 309 connected in series with a sixth optical line amplifier 311 and eighth edge 215 comprises a seventh optical line amplifier 313. It should be noted that the implementation is not limited to the network configuration in figure 1 and that the number of edges, nodes and/or optical line amplifiers in the network 100 may be increased or decreased as desired.
In the example network 100, and as illustrated, a plurality of optical channels A, B and C are transmitted between the source node 102 and the destination node 110. The optical channels may be provided to the source node 102 using an input device (e.g., a multiplexing device) 302. Optical channels A, B and C may be output from destination node 110 using output device (e.g., demultiplexing device) 304. Optical channels A, B and C may be used to transmit information between source node 102 and destination node 110. For purposes of the discussion herein, "optical channel" or "optical line (optical circuit)" refers to an end-to-end (e.g., source node to destination node) optical signal that is modulated onto one or more optical carriers without any optical-to-electrical-optical (OEO) conversion between the source node and the destination node. In other words, any optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversion or regeneration (except for amplification) of the optical channels occurs only at the end nodes, which in this case may be the source node 102 and the destination node 110.
Fig. 1 also illustrates an example spectrum allocation 131 along a seventh edge 213. As illustrated, optical channels A, B and C spread across multiple frequency slots 133, and each optical channel A, B and C occupies a different number of frequency slots. As illustrated, optical channel B occupies 3 frequency slots, optical channel C occupies 6 frequency slots, and optical channel a occupies 9 frequency slots. However, implementations are not limited in this respect. In other implementations, two or more optical channels may occupy the same number of frequency slots. In an example, the width of each frequency slot 133 is approximately 3.125GHz, although widths of other frequencies (e.g., between approximately 3.0 and 5.0 GHz) may be used. The bit rate supportable by the same channel width may vary at different regions of the spectrum. Thus, the number of frequency slots assigned to a given optical channel will vary based on the bandwidth required for that channel and the location within the spectrum of the frequency slots assigned to that optical channel.
In fig. 1, the frequency gap 133 between adjacent optical channels a and C is not occupied by an optical channel and is therefore considered available to carry a new optical channel. Similarly, the frequency slot 133 after optical channel a and before optical channel B is available and can also be used to carry a new optical channel.
As used herein, an optical channel may carry data associated with one or more data flows traveling between a common source node and a destination node. Note that the source node and destination node need not be the original source and final destination of the flow in the channel; a source node and a destination node in this context refer only to the start and end points of the optical line, between which the optical signal is not converted back into electrical signals for routing or reception.
The network controller 151 controls the operation and configuration of the various components of the network 100. Network controller 151 may be communicatively coupled to components of network 100 and may include hardware-based logic or a combination of hardware-based logic and software-based logic to execute instructions. Network controller 151 may include logic that may interpret, execute, and/or otherwise process information contained, for example, in memory 153 communicatively coupled to network controller 151. This information may include nodes 102, 104, 106, 108, and 110 for implementing network 100; optical line amplifiers 301, 303, 305, 307, 309, 311, and 313; computer-executable instructions and/or data of the operations of input device 302 and output device 304 to facilitate implementing a method for sending data from source node 102 and destination node 110 via edges 201, 203, 205, 207, 209, 211, 213, and 215 in accordance with one or more implementations of the present disclosure. Network controller 151 may include a variety of homogeneous or heterogeneous hardware. The hardware may include, for example, one or more processors, microprocessors, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), application specific instruction set processors (ASIPs), Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), or some combination of other types of processing logic that may interpret, execute, manipulate, and/or otherwise process information. The processors may include a single core or multiple cores. In addition, the network controller 151 may include a system on chip (SoC) or a System In Package (SiP).
Fig. 2 illustrates a block diagram of an example controller 330 suitable for use as the network controller 151 shown in fig. 1. The controller 330 is configured to determine routes of data through the network and allocate spectrum to such routes on each edge connecting the network nodes. The controller 330 includes a memory 332, a processor 336, and a communication module 338 to transmit data, receive commands, and provide instructions. The memory 332 stores computer-executable instructions that, when executed, implement the functionality of the routing and spectrum allocation engine 342. In other implementations, routing and spectrum allocation engine 342 may be implemented in hardware in controller 330. In still other implementations, routing and spectrum allocation engine 342 may be implemented as a combination of hardware and software. The communication module 338, e.g., a network interface driver, may be configured to output the output of the routing and spectrum allocation engine 342 to the various nodes of the network managed by the controller 330 through a network interface card. The network interface card may be configured for electrical and/or optical communication.
The controller 330 may be coupled to one or more input devices 314 (e.g., a mouse, a keyboard, a touch screen display, etc.) and one or more output devices 316 (e.g., a display, speakers, etc.). Thus, a user may enter commands and queries to the controller 330 using the input device 314, and receive graphics and other information from the controller 330 via the output device 316. In some implementations, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) may be used to control the input device 314 and the output device 316, enabling a user to access the controller 330. In other implementations, the input device 314 and/or the output device 316 can be communicatively connected to the controller 330 through a network. In such implementations, the input device 314 and the output device 316 may be a receiver and a transmitter (or collectively, a transceiver) of a network interface card, respectively. The user may utilize the input device 314 and the output device 316 to set configuration parameters of the routing and spectrum allocation engine 342, such as the size of the spectrum frequency slots, weighting factors (discussed further below), and shortest path selection parameters. In other implementations, the configuration parameters may be entered by a user of a remote computing device in communication with controller 330 via a network connection, or set autonomously or semi-autonomously by a traffic engineering system located inside or outside of the controlled network.
The database 352 stores various information for access and processing by the routing and spectrum allocation engine 342. Such information includes, but is not limited to, routing information (e.g., source and destination nodes), network topology information (including level 1 connectivity information), traffic demand information, current spectrum allocations, and previously calculated costs associated with allocating additional lines or optical channels to each edge in the network.
The routing and spectrum allocation engine 342 includes a path identification module 364, a cost determination module 366, and a line allocation module 370. As used herein, a "module" refers to a cohesive body of software code (or computer-executable instructions) or an electronic logic block configured to perform a defined function. In other implementations, one or more of the modules described above may be combined into a larger module or divided into multiple smaller, more discrete modules that collectively perform the described functionality. Briefly summarized, the path identification module 364 is configured to identify an appropriate path through the network for the new optical line. The cost determination module 366 is configured to determine a cost of assigning a new optical line to the path identified by the path identification module 364. The line allocation module 370 is configured to allocate a particular frequency slot across a particular identified path for the new line based on the cost determined by the cost determination module 366. These modules operate together to perform the method discussed below with respect to fig. 3. The functionality of each module will be further described with respect to the various steps of the method shown in fig. 3.
Fig. 3 is a flow diagram of an example method 400 of performing routing and spectrum allocation. The method 400 may be performed, for example, by the controller 330 shown in fig. 2 or other suitably configured computing device. Methods consistent with the present disclosure may include at least some, but not all, of the steps illustrated in method 400 performed in a different sequence. Further, methods consistent with the present disclosure may include at least two or more steps shown in method 400 that overlap in time or are performed substantially simultaneously. Similarly, at least some of the steps illustrated in method 400 may be performed in parallel by different processors after separate computing threads. For example, each individual computing thread may execute in parallel, or even in different execution environments, e.g., different virtual machines or containerization environments.
In broad overview, the method 400 includes identifying one or more new lines to allocate to an optical network (stage 402), identifying potential paths for the new lines (stage 404), calculating costs of allocating the new lines to the potential paths (stage 406), and allocating the new lines to respective paths at respective portions of the electromagnetic spectrum based on the calculated costs (stage 408). Method 400 optionally includes updating new line cost allocation cost data based on the allocation of the new line to the network (stage 410). Each of the foregoing stages will be described further below. Example executions of method 400 are then discussed with respect to fig. 4A-4C.
As indicated above, method 400 includes identifying one or more new lines for distribution within an optical network. For example, a network controller, such as controller 330 shown in fig. 2 or controller 151 shown in fig. 1, may receive notification that a network between a source node and a destination node is about to carry a new flow, that no lines have been pre-allocated between the source node and the destination node, or that previously unallocated lines have insufficient available capacity to carry. Similarly, the controller may receive notification that a previously assigned optical channel or line is experiencing an inappropriate level of congestion (e.g., due to an increase in bandwidth demand of a previously allocated flow or failure of one or more nodes or links spanned by the line), and has determined that such a flow cannot be assigned to any other previously allocated channel. The controller may receive notifications or determine whether individual new lines need to be added, small batches of new lines (e.g., on the order of tens to thousands of lines), or a large batch of thousands to more than a million lines, for example, after a significant change in network topology or a significant change in network usage. The identity of the line to be added includes the identity of the source and destination nodes of the line, but does not include any information about any intermediate nodes. As indicated previously, as used herein, the terms "source node" and "destination node" do not necessarily correspond to the actual original source computing device and final destination computing device, but merely refer to the beginning and end of an uninterrupted light path through the network (i.e., a path lacking any OEO conversions).
After identifying a new line to allocate (stage 402), potential paths for the new line are identified (stage 404). In some implementations, the potential paths can be identified by the path identification module 364 of the controller 330 shown in fig. 2. In various implementations, path identification may be performed for each new route in one or two stages (stage 402). In one implementation, the first stage includes identifying a set of K shortest paths between a source node and a destination node for a given new line, where K is a positive integer. The K shortest paths between two end nodes may be determined based on the distance traveled by the light in each path connecting a pair of nodes in the network (e.g., the total fiber length). In contrast to most shortest path determinations in packet switched networking, the shortest path need not be a path that spans the fewest number of intermediate nodes (although it is usually) provided that the optical signals of the line do not need to be processed at each intermediate node. The method instead determines the shortest path between a pair of nodes based on the length of fiber traveled between the nodes. In some cases, paths with more intermediate nodes may actually be shorter than paths with fewer intermediate nodes. In some implementations, a set of K shortest paths is determined using the Yen algorithm.
In determining the set of K shortest paths, in some implementations, the controller only considers the presence of layer 1 connections between nodes. That is, in such implementations, the shortest path determination ignores the current allocation or available bandwidth on such layer 1 connections, while such information is considered in the cost calculation and path selection stages discussed further below. Additionally, in some implementations, the K shortest path determinations employ a fixed layer 1 topology (i.e., a case where no new layer 1 link may be added). In some implementations, the k shortest path determinations include edges and/or nodes that have already been planned but not yet constructed.
In an optional second phase, a set of K shortest paths is selected down to a set of N shortest paths, where N is a positive integer less than K. Downward selection is achieved by first selecting the absolute shortest path identified in the set of K shortest paths, and then selecting all other paths in the set of K paths within some threshold length variation from the lengths of the identified shortest paths. For example, the set of N paths may include all paths within 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% (or any percentage therebetween, and percentages below 5% and above 20%) of the length. The percentage threshold and the value of K may be parameters configured by a traffic engineering system or system administrator, for example, using input device 314 of controller 330. In some implementations, the downward selection phase may be omitted, and the complete set of K shortest paths may be evaluated in subsequent phases of method 400.
Method 400 further includes calculating a cost of assigning the new route to the potential path (stage 406). This stage (stage 406) may be computed (stage 404) before or after a set of potential paths for the new line has been identified. The pre-computed cost across all potential paths may result in increased and potentially unnecessary processing, but may result in faster path selection after the potential paths are identified. On the other hand, waiting for the identification of potential paths before calculating the allocation cost may require less processing, but may result in path allocation delays. In some implementations, the cost calculation stage (stage 406) can be performed by the cost determination module 366 of the routing and spectrum allocation engine 342.
In general, the cost calculation process assigns a higher cost to paths that include edges or links with available frequency slots that have available frequency slots that can be used in more and longer paths than paths with edges of frequency slots that are only available to fewer, shorter paths. That is, frequency slots that can be used in more paths, longer paths, or more longer paths are considered to have greater flexibility and thus greater utility, and paths that use such frequency slots are considered to be of higher cost to preserve their possible use for other paths. The cost of a frequency slot along an edge based on the length of the optical line for which the frequency slot can be used (in terms of the number of nodes crossed) is referred to herein as the neighbor cost. That is, the frequency slots available for longer lines have a higher adjacent cost of frequency slots available only for shorter lines. For example, a frequency slot on an edge that can be used in an optical line that includes eight adjacent or consecutive edges or links may be assigned an adjacent cost higher than the frequency slot that can only be used for an optical line that includes four adjacent consecutive edges or links.
The allocation cost calculation phase (phase 406) includes two phases. First, the cost of each frequency slot for assigning each edge (or all edges if the cost is pre-computed before identifying the path) of each potential path is determined. Next, the total cost for each potential path (route and spectrum allocation) is calculated based on the calculated edge costs. The total cost calculation may take into account other cost factors, such as costs associated with inherent spectral efficiency or inefficiency, as well as costs associated with a particular link (e.g., noise due to geographical factors or amplification in a longer link) or a particular portion of the spectrum (e.g., costs of using reserved frequency slots).
As indicated above, the cost is first calculated to assign each frequency slot along each edge under consideration. In a post-path-identification cost computation implementation of stage 406, edges are considered if they are part of the potential path identified for the new route. In the pre-path identification implementation of stage 406, all edges are considered. The result of the computation of an edge is a one-dimensional array of per-frequency-slot costs along that edge.
The frequency slot cost of the array is determined based on the routing and spectrum allocation of previously assigned paths in the network. Frequency slots on an edge that have been assigned to other paths are assigned an infinite cost along that edge because they are not reallocated to another line. For each available frequency slot for a given edge, the total cost of the frequency slot including that edge in the new line is based on the sum of the lengths of the existing paths (in terms of the number of nodes crossed), but the edge is not currently crossed in that frequency slot. In an implementation where all frequency slots of all edges are weighted equally, the cost is simply the sum of these lengths. In implementations where different frequency slots or different edges are assigned different weights, the value of each hop within each frequency slot along each path may be assigned a different value in the summation. For example, higher weights may be assigned to frequency slots passing through certain geographic environments (e.g., mountains, sea floors, or other hard-to-access terrain) or edges of networks carrying high priority, sensitive or critical information. These "artificial" high costs will reduce the communication via these edges, thereby reducing the utilization of the portion of the network that includes these edges. By reducing network utilization, reduced traffic travels in these portions of the network and increases the availability of these edges for communicating information.
An example of this edge cost calculation is shown in fig. 4A-4C. Fig. 4A illustrates an example mesh optical network 700 for which an edge cost array is to be calculated. The mesh optical network 700 includes a first node 702 ("node a 702"), a second node 704 ("node B704"), a third node 706 ("node C706"), a fourth node 708 ("node D708"), and a fifth node 710 ("node E710") interconnected with each other. A first edge 801 ("edge AB 801") connects node a 702 to node B704. A second edge 803 ("edge AC 803") connects node a 702 to node C706. A third edge 805 ("edge BC 805") connects node B704 to node C706. A fourth edge 807 ("edge CD 807") connects node C706 to node D708. A fifth edge 809 ("edge AD 809") connects node a 702 to node D708. A sixth edge 811 ("edge BD 811") connects node B704 to node D708. A seventh edge 813 ("edge BE 813") connects node B704 to node E710. An eighth edge 815 ("edge DE 815") connects node D708 to node E710. The mesh optical network 700 includes 4 different optical channels or lines. A first line 902 spans a path connecting node a 702 to node E710 via node B704, node C706, and node D708. With respect to the first line 902, node A702 and node E710 may be referred to as end nodes of the path comprising nodes 702, 704, 706, 708, 710. Nodes B, C and D are only used to passively forward the optical signal along this path without any OEO conversion. A second line 904 also spans the path connecting node a 702 to node B704. The third line 906 spans a path connecting node a 702 to node D708 via node C706. A fourth line 908 spans a path connecting node B704 to node C706. The number of nodes, edges and lines shown are for illustration purposes only. A practical network may have tens, hundreds or thousands of nodes and tens of thousands to millions (or more) of edges and wires.
For purposes of illustration, it is assumed that the spectrum available in the network is divided into four frequency slots or "slices". In a practical implementation, the spectrum may be divided into tens or more slices depending on the frequency slot or slice size.
Fig. 4B illustrates a first step in calculating an edge cost array for the optical network 700. As shown in fig. 4B, each existing line is evaluated to determine the cost contribution to each frequency slot. For each line, fig. 4B shows each node and each edge that the line crosses. Fig. 4B shows the availability of each frequency slot and the corresponding cost array for each edge of each line. For example, for a first line 902, fig. 4B shows node a 702, node B704, node C706, node D708, and node E710 connected by edge AB 801, edge BC 805, edge CD 807, and edge DE 815. Spectral availability graphs 1001, 1003, 1005 and 1007 are shown for each of the respective edges. In each spectrum availability graph, white boxes represent available slots, while black boxes represent unavailable slots. Thus, in the cost arrays 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007, the corresponding cost values are expressed such that if a frequency slot is not currently allocated, the value assigned to each frequency slot is "1", andif frequency slots have already been allocated, each frequency slot is assigned a value of "b", representing- ∞. In a more complex example, where the weights of certain frequency slots or edges are different from the weights of other frequency slots or edges (as described above), the values of the previously unallocated frequency slots entered into cost arrays 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 may be varied by, for example, adding a weighting factor w assigned to each frequency slot of each edge to the value "1" such that the value in each position of each cost array equals 1+ wjOr 1 wjWhere j represents a given edge, frequency slot pair. Finally, the total path cost array 3001 for path 902 is shown, which adds the individual edge cost arrays 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007, rounding negative values to zero. A similar process is used to calculate the total path cost arrays 3101, 3201, and 3301 for the second to fourth lines 904, 906, and 908.
Using the total path cost arrays 3001, 3101, 3201, and 3301, a final edge cost array for each edge is calculated, as shown in fig. 4C. The final edge cost for a given edge is calculated by setting the cost of any allocated frequency slots to ∞ (fig. 4C shows such frequency slots in black) and setting the total cost of each unallocated slot to the cost-wise sum of the frequency slots of all existing circuits that span the edge. Consider, for example, edge AB 801. As shown in fig. 4A, the edge AB is spanned over a first line 902 and a second line 904. As shown in fig. 4B, the total path cost array of the first line 902 is [0, 4, 0, 0], and the total path cost array of the second line 904 is [1, 1, 0, 0 ]. Fig. 4B further illustrates that frequency slots 3 and 4 were previously occupied. Thus, as shown in FIG. 4C, the final edge cost array 822 of the edge AB 801 is equal to [1, 5, ∞. Similarly, the first line 902 and the third line 906 cross the edge CD 807. As shown in fig. 4B, the respective total path cost arrays 3001 and 3201 for these lines are [0, 4, 0, 0] and [0, 2, 0, 0], respectively, while frequency slots 1 and 3 are not available. Thus, the final edge cost array 824 for the edge CD 807 is [ ∞, 6, ∞, 0 ].
After the final edge cost array is computed for all relevant edges, the end-to-end cost is computed for the path identified for the new route. End-to-end path costs for each frequency slot in the spectrum along the respective path are calculated. In some implementations, the cost is determined by adding final edge cost arrays of the edges that make up the respective paths. For example, consider that a new line is to be added between node A702 and node D708. Assume at stage 804 that controller 330 identifies two paths as potential paths between node a 702 and node D708:
route 1: node a → node B → node C → node D; and
route 2: node A → node B → node D.
The total path cost of path 1 is [1, 5, ∞ ] + [1, 5, ∞, 1] + [ - ∞, 6, - ∞, 0] [ ∞, 16, - ∞, - ∞ ]. The total path cost of path 2 is [1, 5, - ∞ ] + [0, 0, 0, 0] - [1, 5, - ∞, - ∞ ].
After end-to-end costs of possible paths of the new line are calculated (stage 406), the new line is allocated on the respective frequency slot along the respective path based on the calculated costs (stage 408). The lines may be allocated by the line allocation module 370 of the routing and spectrum allocation engine 342 of the controller 330 shown in fig. 2. In the simplest scenario, where a single line is allocated and carries a sufficiently small amount of data to require only one frequency slot, this stage involves selecting a path and frequency slot for the line with the lowest end-to-end cost. For example, for the line connecting node a 702 to node D708 discussed above, the line would be assigned frequency slot 1 via path 2 because its end-to-end cost is 1, while the end-to-end cost of using frequency slot 2 on path 2 is 5, and the end-to-end cost of using frequency slot 2 on path 1 is 16.
The line allocation stage 408 may be more complex when the line requires allocation of multiple frequency slots. Preferably, although not necessarily, in this case, the frequency slots are allocated in a contiguous manner such that the sum of the costs across the contiguous frequency slots is minimized. In some implementations, if all of the allocated frequency slots correspond to a single optical carrier, the allocated frequency slots are allocated consecutively. For example, if a line as discussed above requires the allocation of two frequency slots, then that line will be allocated to frequency slots 1 and 2 of path 2. In still other implementations, where the bandwidth of different frequency slots may vary, it should be noted that the selection of some paths may require allocation of a different number of frequency slots than the selection of different paths, depending on frequency slot availability. To select a path in this case, the total cost across each respective number of frequency slots is taken into account.
The line assignment phase 408 may also become complex if multiple lines have been identified for simultaneous assignment. If the number of lines to be allocated is small (e.g., less than 100), then several allocation options exist. In one example, the process is performed for one line at a time in the order of line length. Since any line may be assigned paths of varying lengths, a suitable line length metric that may be used to rank the line assignment process may be the minimum, average, median or maximum path length in the set of possible paths identified for each line at stage 404. After a given route is assigned, the costs associated with each edge are updated before subsequent routes are assigned (stage 410).
In another implementation, an optimization process may be utilized to find a minimum (or lower) total cost allocation for all lines to be allocated. If the number of lines to be allocated is small enough (taking into account the available computational resources), the optimization process may include an exhaustive search, attempting to allocate channels in each possible order. If a large number of lines are to be allocated at a time, a more complex optimization procedure, for example using linear programming, can be used to obtain improved line allocation results.
After assigning a line to a given path and frequency slot, the line assignment module 370 causes the controller to communicate an instruction to the source node of the new line to send data associated with the new line on the selected frequency via an output port coupled to the next node in the path selected for the new line. Routing and spectrum allocation engine 342 may also optionally update costs associated with allocating the new line to edges affected by the allocation of the new line to expedite future line allocations (stage 410).
As discussed above, the above process involves calculating the cost of all edges in the network before allocating a new line on the network. However, as suggested above, in other implementations, instead of pre-calculating edge costs for all edges in the entire network before placing the new line, the costs of only all affected edges associated with the new line are calculated when the new line is added. In this ad hoc cost calculation method, there may be no need to update the costs of all edges after adding a new line. In contrast, in some implementations of the ad hoc computing method, only the cost of edges that include new lines is updated. Similarly, when a line is removed, only edges included in the removed line are adjusted. In some implementations of the ad hoc computing method, the cost is not continuously dynamically updated.
