- FIG. 10 is a method, according to an example embodiment.
- Example methods and systems are described herein. Any example embodiment or feature described herein is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or features.
- the example embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. It will be readily understood that certain aspects of the disclosed systems and methods can be arranged and combined in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are contemplated herein.
- Example embodiments may help to provide or otherwise relate to a data network that includes a plurality of balloons; for example, a mesh network formed by high-altitude balloons deployed in the stratosphere. Since winds in the stratosphere may affect the locations of the balloons in a differential manner, each balloon in an example network may be configured to change its horizontal position by adjusting its vertical position (i.e., altitude). For instance, by adjusting its altitude, a balloon may be able find winds that will carry it horizontally (e.g., latitudinally and/or longitudinally) to a desired horizontal location. Note, however, that example embodiments may be implemented in other scenarios that do not relate to a balloon network.
- the balloons may communicate with one another using free-space optical communications.
- the balloons may be configured for optical communications using lasers and/or ultra-bright LEDs (which are also referred to as “high-power” or “high-output” LEDs).
- the balloons may communicate with ground-based station(s) using radio-frequency (RF) communications.
- RF radio-frequency
- such high-altitude balloons may include an envelope and a payload, and along with various other components.
- the balloons used in the balloon network may be quite large, and may contain on the order of 80 cubic meters of lift gas.
- the balloon envelope or ballonet within the balloon envelope may be filled with a lift gas, such as helium or hydrogen.
- a lift gas such as helium or hydrogen.
- under windy conditions it is beneficial to quickly inflate the balloon envelope to reduce the flagging or vibrating of the balloon envelope from the wind that may cause damage to the balloon envelope.
- it is desirable to quickly fill the balloon envelopes for launch Other examples are also possible.
- the balloons may be quickly inflated at a high flow rate of 16 cubic meters of lift gas per minute, so that the balloon envelope can be inflated in approximately five minutes.
- the high flow rate of lift gas into the balloon envelope may cause damage to the envelope material because of “flagging” or rapid vibration of the envelope caused by the inflow of lift gas into and against the balloon envelope, as if experiencing high winds.
- the flagging of the balloon envelope material may fracture the balloon envelope film (such as LDPE or other envelope materials) at a molecular level increasing the creation of pinholes (i.e. leaks).
- a diffuser may be used to help prevent the flagging of the balloon envelope.
- Metal “probe” flow rate diffusers may take the form of a hollow metal tube (i.e. aluminum) with holes bored out to provide a flow path for the gas.
- a rapid flow rate of lift gas is produced by high pressure compressed gas cylinders of lift gas. The lift gas travels straight to the rounded end of the hollow metal tube and bounces back before exiting through the bored holes. This interruption of flow slows particles of the lift gas to protect the balloon envelope film from flagging as the envelope is inflated.
- metal diffusers have microscopic “burrs” left behind during the machining process that can compromise the balloon envelope film as it abrades the balloon envelope film, thereby increasing the number of pinholes and scratches (i.e. leaks) in the balloon envelope film.
- metal fill systems are also constructed of rigid components that, when positioned within the soft balloon envelope film, can cause damage to the balloon envelope, especially during windy fill conditions.
- fill systems at such a high flow rate become iced over due to the thermal properties of the lift gas and introduce frigid temperatures to the balloon envelope film. Temperature and moisture impact the performance of the balloon envelope film used for the balloon envelope making the balloon envelope more susceptible to pinholes or other damage (i.e.
- metal diffusers i.e. aluminum
- metal diffusers are heavy relative to the balloon envelope film and they require manual support supplied by additional personnel, or other rigging, during the inflation process. Due to the unpredictable nature of the inflation site, supporting the heavy metal diffuser may cause a safety risk for either the balloon envelope or the personnel involved in the inflation process.
- a fabric diffuser is provided.
- a high pressure hose may have one end attached to a tank of lift gas, such as helium or hydrogen, and the other end of the high pressure hose may be attached or reduced to a low pressure hose that is lighter and more flexible than the high pressure hose.
- a quick cutoff for gas fill may be located at the junction of the high and low pressure hoses.
- An end of the low pressure hose may be attached to a fill port positioned in the balloon envelope.
- the fill port can be located on a side of the balloon envelope, whereas in others it may be positioned on the top of the balloon envelope.
- the lighter, more flexible low pressure hose reduces the strain on the balloon envelope during the inflation process, and is easier for personnel to handle during the inflation process.
- an adapter may be provided that may be attached to an end of the low pressure hose. Clamps and silicone gasketing may be used to provide a gas tight seal between the end of the low pressure hose and the adapter. Quick releases and other couplings/fittings may be used as well to secure the adapter to the hose.
- the adapter may be a hollow, cylindrical member with a hollow threaded cap positioned over the cylindrical member. The threaded cap may be screwed onto the fill port where an O-ring within the cap may provide a gas tight seal.
- the cylindrical member of the adapter may extend through the fill port. A fill port may have an inner diameter of 21 ⁇ 2 inches. Therefore the inner diameter of the cylindrical member of the adapter may be on the order of 2 inches.
- the fabric diffuser may have a first section that is constructed of a non-porous, non-rigid fabric that extends through the adapter and is folded over onto a rear end of the adapter which may be positioned within the end of the low pressure hose and clamped into position with a zip tie or ratcheting strap.
- the first section of non-porous fabric may extend from the front end of the adapter (and into the balloon envelope) 3 or 4 inches.
- the first section of non-porous fabric may be comprised of ripstop nylon coated with silicone.
- the first section of non-porous material helps to direct the force of incoming lift gas inwards towards the center of the balloon envelope during inflation.
- the use of ripstop nylon also provides some structure to the diffuser without any rigid components.
- the fabric diffuser may have a second section that is attached to the end of the first section.
- the second section may be constructed of a porous material through which the incoming lift gas passes through.
- the porous material disrupts and slows the flow of gas into the balloon envelope.
- the second section of porous material may be comprised of a mesh material, such as mosquito netting.
- the first section of non-porous material may have a cylindrical shape that extends from the front end of the adapter, with a diameter or around 2 inches.
- the second section of porous material may extend from the first section and may also have a cylindrical shape with the same diameter as the first section, which allows the fabric diffuser to be more easily inserted and removed from the balloon envelope.
- the second section of porous material may also have other shapes.
- the second section may have a bulbous, or spherical shape.
- the second section tapers into a sphere having a diameter of around 12 inches in an uninflated state, and forms a “light bulb” shape during inflation.
- the second section of porous material may be formed by stitching together a first section of mesh with a second section of mesh. Each section could have several layers of mesh material.
- the non-rigid first and second sections of the diffuser do not cause damage to balloon envelope during the inflation as a rigid diffuser might.
- the fabric diffuser can be built into the envelope and launched with the envelope. Alternately, the fabric diffuser could be removed after the envelope has been filled.
- the porous fabric end may also have additional features to direct the flow of lift gas into the balloon envelope during inflation.
- the number of layers of mesh could be changed so that additional layers of mesh are provided in the second section of porous material near the first section of non-porous material to continue directing more lift gas towards the end of the second section of the fabric diffuser.
- the fabric diffuser may advantageously comprise non-rigid first and second sections that do not damage the balloon envelope during the inflation process, as a diffuser having rigid components could. Furthermore, the mesh material of the porous second section is not attached to and does not contact the balloon envelope during the end of the inflation process as the flow is directed towards the center of the balloon envelope, thereby helping to reduce or eliminate damage to the balloon envelope caused by flow of lift gas against the balloon envelope or by strain caused from attachment of the diffuser to the balloon envelope.
- a high-altitude-balloon network may be homogenous. That is, the balloons in a high-altitude-balloon network could be substantially similar to each other in one or more ways. More specifically, in a homogenous high-altitude-balloon network, each balloon is configured to communicate with one or more other balloons via free-space optical links. Further, some or all of the balloons in such a network, may additionally be configured to communicate with ground-based and/or satellite-based station(s) using RF and/or optical communications. Thus, in some embodiments, the balloons may be homogenous in so far as each balloon is configured for free-space optical communication with other balloons, but heterogeneous with regard to RF communications with ground-based stations.
- a high-altitude-balloon network may be heterogeneous, and thus may include two or more different types of balloons.
- some balloons in a heterogeneous network may be configured as super-nodes, while other balloons may be configured as sub-nodes.
- some balloons in a heterogeneous network may be configured to function as both a super-node and a sub-node.
- Such balloons may function as either a super-node or a sub-node at a particular time, or, alternatively, act as both simultaneously depending on the context.
- an example balloon could aggregate search requests of a first type to transmit to a ground-based station.
- the example balloon could also send search requests of a second type to another balloon, which could act as a super-node in that context.
- some balloons which may be super-nodes in an example embodiment, can be configured to communicate via optical links with ground-based stations and/or satellites.
- the super-node balloons may be configured to communicate with nearby super-node balloons via free-space optical links.
- the sub-node balloons may not be configured for free-space optical communication, and may instead be configured for some other type of communication, such as RF communications.
- a super-node may be further configured to communicate with sub-nodes using RF communications.
- the sub-nodes may relay communications between the super-nodes and one or more ground-based stations using RF communications.
- the super-nodes may collectively function as backhaul for the balloon network, while the sub-nodes function to relay communications from the super-nodes to ground-based stations.
- FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram illustrating a balloon network 100 , according to an example embodiment.
- balloon network 100 includes balloons 102 A to 102 F, which are configured to communicate with one another via free-space optical links 104 .
- Balloons 102 A to 102 F could additionally or alternatively be configured to communicate with one another via RF links 114 .
- Balloons 102 A to 102 F may collectively function as a mesh network for packet-data communications.
- at least some of balloons 102 A and 102 B may be configured for RF communications with ground-based stations 106 and 112 via respective RF links 108 .
- some balloons, such as balloon 102 F could be configured to communicate via optical link 110 with ground-based station 112 .
- balloons 102 A to 102 F are high-altitude balloons, which are deployed in the stratosphere.
- the stratosphere includes altitudes between approximately 10 kilometers (km) and 50 km altitude above the surface.
- the stratosphere starts at an altitude of approximately 8 km.
- high-altitude balloons may be generally configured to operate in an altitude range within the stratosphere that has relatively low wind speed (e.g., between 5 and 20 miles per hour (mph)).
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may generally be configured to operate at altitudes between 18 km and 25 km (although other altitudes are possible). This altitude range may be advantageous for several reasons.
- this layer of the stratosphere generally has relatively low wind speeds (e.g., winds between 5 and 20 mph) and relatively little turbulence.
- winds between 18 km and 25 km may vary with latitude and by season, the variations can be modeled in a reasonably accurate manner.
- altitudes above 18 km are typically above the maximum flight level designated for commercial air traffic. Therefore, interference with commercial flights is not a concern when balloons are deployed between 18 km and 25 km.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may be configured to transmit an optical signal via an optical link 104 .
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may use one or more high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to transmit an optical signal.
- LEDs high-power light-emitting diodes
- some or all of balloons 102 A to 102 F may include laser systems for free-space optical communications over optical links 104 . Other types of free-space optical communication are possible.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may include one or more optical receivers. Additional details of example balloons are discussed in greater detail below, with reference to FIG. 3 .
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may utilize one or more of various different RF air-interface protocols for communication with ground-based stations 106 and 112 via respective RF links 108 .
- some or all of balloons 102 A to 102 F may be configured to communicate with ground-based stations 106 and 112 using protocols described in IEEE 802.11 (including any of the IEEE 802.11 revisions), various cellular protocols such as GSM, CDMA, UMTS, EV-DO, WiMAX, and/or LTE, and/or one or more propriety protocols developed for balloon-ground RF communication, among other possibilities.
- an example network may also include downlink balloons, which could provide a high-capacity air-ground link.
- balloon 102 F is configured as a downlink balloon.
- a downlink balloon 102 F may be operable for optical communication with other balloons via optical links 104 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may also be configured for free-space optical communication with a ground-based station 112 via an optical link 110 .
- Optical link 110 may therefore serve as a high-capacity link (as compared to an RF link 108 ) between the balloon network 100 and the ground-based station 112 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may additionally be operable for RF communication with ground-based stations 106 .
- a downlink balloon 102 F may only use an optical link for balloon-to-ground communications.
- an example balloon network can also include multiple downlink balloons.
- a balloon network can also be implemented without any downlink balloons.
- a downlink balloon may be equipped with a specialized, high-bandwidth RF communication system for balloon-to-ground communications, instead of, or in addition to, a free-space optical communication system.
- the high-bandwidth RF communication system may take the form of an ultra-wideband system, which may provide an RF link with substantially the same capacity as one of the optical links 104 .
- Other forms are also possible.
- Ground-based stations such as ground-based stations 106 and/or 112
- a ground-based station may include components such as transceivers, transmitters, and/or receivers for communication via RF links and/or optical links with a balloon network.
- a ground-based station may use various air-interface protocols in order to communicate with a balloon 102 A to 102 F over an RF link 108 .
- ground-based stations 106 and 112 may be configured as an access point via which various devices can connect to balloon network 100 .
- Ground-based stations 106 and 112 may have other configurations and/or serve other purposes without departing from the scope of the invention.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F could be configured to establish a communication link with space-based satellites in addition to, or as an alternative to, a ground-based communication link.
- a balloon may communicate with a satellite via an optical link.
- other types of satellite communications are possible.
- ground-based stations such as ground-based stations 106 and 112
- Such ground-based stations 106 and 112 may thus serve as an interface between the balloon network and the Internet, a cellular service provider's network, and/or other types of networks. Variations on this configuration and other configurations of ground-based stations 106 and 112 are also possible.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may collectively function as a mesh network. More specifically, since balloons 102 A to 102 F may communicate with one another using free-space optical links, the balloons may collectively function as a free-space optical mesh network.
- each balloon 102 A to 102 F may function as a node of the mesh network, which is operable to receive data directed to it and to route data to other balloons.
- data may be routed from a source balloon to a destination balloon by determining an appropriate sequence of optical links between the source balloon and the destination balloon.
- These optical links may be collectively referred to as a “lightpath” for the connection between the source and destination balloons.
- each of the optical links may be referred to as a “hop” on the lightpath.
- balloons 102 A to 102 F may employ various routing techniques and self-healing algorithms.
- a balloon network 100 may employ adaptive or dynamic routing, where a lightpath between a source and destination balloon is determined and set-up when the connection is needed, and released at a later time. Further, when adaptive routing is used, the lightpath may be determined dynamically depending upon the current state, past state, and/or predicted state of the balloon network.
- an example balloon network 100 may apply a mesh protocol to update the state of the network as the topology of the network changes.
- balloon network 100 may employ and/or adapt various techniques that are employed in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Other examples are possible as well.
- MANETs mobile ad hoc networks
- a balloon network 100 may be configured as a transparent mesh network. More specifically, in a transparent balloon network, the balloons may include components for physical switching that is entirely optical, without any electrical components involved in the physical routing of optical signals. Thus, in a transparent configuration with optical switching, signals travel through a multi-hop lightpath that is entirely optical.
- the balloon network 100 may implement a free-space optical mesh network that is opaque.
- some or all balloons 102 A to 102 F may implement optical-electrical-optical (OEO) switching.
- some or all balloons may include optical cross-connects (OXCs) for OEO conversion of optical signals.
- OEO optical-electrical-optical
- Other opaque configurations are also possible.
- network configurations are possible that include routing paths with both transparent and opaque sections.
- balloons in an example balloon network 100 may implement wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which may help to increase link capacity.
- WDM wavelength division multiplexing
- physical lightpaths through the balloon network may be subject to the “wavelength continuity constraint.” More specifically, because the switching in a transparent network is entirely optical, it may be necessary to assign the same wavelength for all optical links on a given lightpath.
- An opaque configuration may avoid the wavelength continuity constraint.
- balloons in an opaque balloon network may include the OEO switching systems operable for wavelength conversion.
- balloons can convert the wavelength of an optical signal at each hop along a lightpath.
- optical wavelength conversion could take place at only selected hops along the lightpath.
- various routing algorithms may be employed in an opaque configuration. For example, to determine a primary lightpath and/or one or more diverse backup lightpaths for a given connection, example balloons may apply or consider shortest-path routing techniques such as Dijkstra's algorithm and k-shortest path, and/or edge and node-diverse or disjoint routing such as Suurballe's algorithm, among others. Additionally or alternatively, techniques for maintaining a particular quality of service (QoS) may be employed when determining a lightpath. Other techniques are also possible.
- QoS quality of service
- a balloon network 100 may implement station-keeping functions to help provide a desired network topology. For example, station-keeping may involve each balloon 102 A to 102 F maintaining and/or moving into a certain position relative to one or more other balloons in the network (and possibly in a certain position relative to the ground). As part of this process, each balloon 102 A to 102 F may implement station-keeping functions to determine its desired positioning within the desired topology, and if necessary, to determine how to move to the desired position.
- the desired topology may vary depending upon the particular implementation.
- balloons may implement station-keeping to provide a substantially uniform topology.
- a given balloon 102 A to 102 F may implement station-keeping functions to position itself at substantially the same distance (or within a certain range of distances) from adjacent balloons in the balloon network 100 .
- a balloon network 100 may have a non-uniform topology.
- example embodiments may involve topologies where balloons are distributed more or less densely in certain areas, for various reasons.
- balloons may be clustered more densely over urban areas.
- the distribution of balloons may be denser over land than over large bodies of water.
- Many other examples of non-uniform topologies are possible.
- the topology of an example balloon network may be adaptable.
- station-keeping functionality of example balloons may allow the balloons to adjust their respective positioning in accordance with a change in the desired topology of the network. For example, one or more balloons could move to new positions to increase or decrease the density of balloons in a given area. Other examples are possible.
- a balloon network 100 may employ an energy function to determine if and/or how balloons should move to provide a desired topology.
- the state of a given balloon and the states of some or all nearby balloons may be input to an energy function.
- the energy function may apply the current states of the given balloon and the nearby balloons to a desired network state (e.g., a state corresponding to the desired topology).
- a vector indicating a desired movement of the given balloon may then be determined by determining the gradient of the energy function.
- the given balloon may then determine appropriate actions to take in order to effectuate the desired movement. For example, a balloon may determine an altitude adjustment or adjustments such that winds will move the balloon in the desired manner.

- the navigation system may use altitudinal wind data to determine altitudinal adjustments that result in the wind carrying the balloon in a desired direction and/or to a desired location.
- the altitude-control system may then make adjustments to the density of the balloon chamber in order to effectuate the determined altitudinal adjustments and cause the balloon to move laterally to the desired direction and/or to the desired location.
- the altitudinal adjustments may be computed by a ground-based or satellite-based control system and communicated to the high-altitude balloon.
- specific balloons in a heterogeneous balloon network may be configured to compute altitudinal adjustments for other balloons and transmit the adjustment commands to those other balloons.
- the balloon 200 also includes a cut-down system 208 .
- the cut-down system 208 may be activated to separate the payload 206 from the rest of balloon 200 .
- the cut-down system 208 could include at least a connector, such as a balloon cord, connecting the payload 206 to the envelope 202 and a means for severing the connector (e.g., a shearing mechanism or an explosive bolt).
- the balloon cord which may be nylon, is wrapped with a nichrome wire. A current could be passed through the nichrome wire to heat it and melt the cord, cutting the payload 206 away from the envelope 202 .
- the cut-down functionality may be utilized anytime the payload needs to be accessed on the ground, such as when it is time to remove balloon 200 from a balloon network, when maintenance is due on systems within payload 206 , and/or when power supply 226 needs to be recharged or replaced.
- a balloon may not include a cut-down system.
- the navigation system may be operable to navigate the balloon to a landing location, in the event the balloon needs to be removed from the network and/or accessed on the ground.
