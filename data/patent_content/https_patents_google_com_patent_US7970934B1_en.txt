Definitions
- This specification relates to detecting events of interest in a context of network traffic.
- a web browser is a software application that enables a user to display and interact with text, images, and other information located on a web page or other resource, typically one stored in a web server accessed over the Internet or a local area network.
- Popular web browsers available for personal computers include Microsoft® Internet Explorer, Mozilla® Firefox®, Opera, Netscape Navigator®, and Apple SafariTM.
- a conventional web browser may use a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to exchange information with a server.
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- a web browser may access resources stored in a web server, which can store or create resources such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files and JPEG images.
- a web server may operate by accepting HTTP requests over a network, and providing an HTTP response to the requester (e.g., the web browser).
- the HTTP response typically consists of an HTML document, but can also be a raw text file, an image, or other type of document.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a computer-implemented method that includes generating a network traffic model comprising forecasted time series data representative of a frequency of actions related to a network traffic entity, and identifying that an event of interest has occurred based on a comparison of actual time series data related to the network traffic entity with the forecasted time series data.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- the forecasted time series data includes a set of forecasted values, each forecasted value being representative of a forecasted frequency of actions related to the network traffic entity during a time interval of a forecasted time segment that spans a plurality of time intervals.
- Generating the network traffic model includes estimating a confidence interval for the network traffic model, the confidence interval being defined by an upper confidence limit and a lower confidence limit.
- Generating the network traffic model includes identifying a pattern by comparing sets of historic time series data, each set of historic time series data being associated with a distinct historic time segment spanning a plurality of time intervals, and determining the forecasted time series data s based on the identified pattern
- Generating the network traffic model includes expressing historic time series data as a best fit curve. Determining a noise baseline level for the network traffic model by comparing the historic time series data over a time segment with forecasted time series data over the same time segment.
- the actual time series data includes a set of actual values, each actual value being representative of an actual frequency of actions related to the network traffic entity during a time interval of an actual time segment.
- Identifying that an event of interest has occurred includes for each time interval within the actual time segment, comparing the actual value with the forecasted value corresponding to the time interval to determine whether the actual value exceeds a confidence interval of the forecasted value, and if so, designating the actual value as representative of an occurrence of an event of interest. Assigning a score to the event of interest. Assigning a score to the event of interest includes assigning a score based on a temporal displacement of the time interval associated with the actual value that exceeds the confidence interval of the forecasted value with a current time. Assigning a score to the event of interest includes assigning a score based on an amount by which the actual value exceeds the confidence interval of the forecasted value.
- Assigning a score to the event of interest includes assigning a score based on the amount of the actual value.
- Obtaining the historic time series data includes collecting historic values, each historic value being representative of an actual frequency of actions during a time interval of the historic time segment.
- Generating a report including information representative of the event of interest.
- the information includes one or more of geographic information, a timestamp, a cookie hash, and a network traffic entity identifier.
- the network traffic entity includes one of a query term, an electronic media file, and a uniform resource locator.
- Generating the report includes excluding from the report information representative of an event if spam contributed to identifying an event of interest.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages.
- Building a network traffic model to predict behavior for each entity allows events of interest to be detected from a theoretically infinite number of entities.
- analysis of multiple network traffic models can occur in parallel.
- the time series data obtained is robust and corresponds to any granularity of time segments spanning a plurality of time intervals. Consequently, noise and problems can be accounted for when building a network traffic model.
- the network traffic models can be built for different time scales, avoiding the need to obtain a critical mass of data before it can be analyzed.
- Detailed information about an entity e.g., geographic information
- Network traffic models can be produced independently of their analyses. Analysis can then be performed multiple times during a given time segment (e.g., throughout a day), instead of once per time segment (e.g., one at the end of a day). Network traffic models over a time segment spanning a plurality of time intervals can detect seemingly less significant events of interest that otherwise appear as noise.
- FIG. 1 shows a network including a network traffic analyzer system.
- FIG. 2 shows a screenshot of a search engine user interface.
- FIG. 3 shows a flowchart for a process for detecting an event of interest.
- FIG. 4 shows a graph representing a comparison of actual time series data against a network traffic model.
- a user 100 interacts with a search engine through a user interface 200 that is presented by a web browser 102 on a client device 104 .
- the client device 104 can be one of any kind of mobile and tethered computing devices, for example, personal computers, workstations, mobile computers, laptop computers, electronic games, media players (e.g., an iPod® mobile digital device), and mobile phones.
- the exemplary search engine user interface 200 of FIG. 2 contains user interface elements, such as a text box 202 in which a search query can be specified, and a button 204 which can be selected to submit the search query.
- the user's web browser 102 first performs a domain name system (DNS) lookup to map www.google.com to a particular Internet Protocol (IP) address.
- DNS domain name system
- IP Internet Protocol
- the web browser 102 then sends a Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) request to the computing device corresponding to the IP address, in this case, a web server 106 through a network 108 .
- HTTP Hypertext Transport Protocol
- the network 108 may be an IP-enabled network, and may include a local area network (LAN), and/or a wide area network (WAN), which may, or may not, include the Internet.
- the network 108 may be wired, wireless, or a combination of the two.
- the web server 106 coordinates the query execution and formats the results into a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) response to the user's web browser 102 .
- HTML Hypertext Markup Language
- the results are generally presented in a web browser 102 window as an ordered list of document titles. Each document title is a selectable link that is associated with a specific uniform resource locator (URL).
- URL uniform resource locator
- the web server 106 In addition to the query execution, the web server 106 also initiates a number of tasks upon receiving the search query, such as sending the search query to a network traffic analyzer system 110 .
- the network traffic analyzer system 110 includes a module (“logging module” 112 ) that implements a process for logging the network traffic at the web server 106 .
- this process logs information (e.g., geographic location by city and/or country of the client device 104 , IP address of the client device 104 , and hash of a cookie) related to each user 100 that interacts with the search engine, what interactions each user 100 has with the search engine (e.g., which search result document title a user 100 clicks on, and the number of instances in which the user 100 clicks on that document title), a timestamp for each interaction, and a network traffic entity identifier (e.g., a normalized query string) for each interaction.
- This process results in raw data that is representative of the logging of events that occur on the search results pages.
- the raw data may be stored in a data store 114 accessible by the network traffic analyzer system 110 in a manner that enables network traffic to be extracted for any given time segment
- the network traffic analyzer system 110 also includes a module (“analysis module” 118 of FIG. 1 ) that implements a process 300 for detecting an event of interest based on an analysis of the network traffic at a search engine where the traffic is related to a particular entity.
- An event may be of interest if it does not conform to (e.g., exceeds) expectations.
- the process 300 is also applicable to other types of network traffic entities, such as URLs and multimedia files (e.g., image, audio or video files).
- the process 300 may be implemented to detect that an event of interest has occurred based on an analysis of network traffic that is related to a specific URL (e.g., number of instances in which users click on a document title presented in users' respective web browsers) or a specific multimedia file (e.g., number of instances in which users select to view, listen to, or otherwise interact with a multimedia file presented in users' respective web browsers 102 ).
- a specific URL e.g., number of instances in which users click on a document title presented in users' respective web browsers
- a specific multimedia file e.g., number of instances in which users select to view, listen to, or otherwise interact with a multimedia file presented in users' respective web browsers 102 .
- Other examples of network traffic entities include electronic mail content and online chat content.
- the analysis module 118 obtains ( 302 ) historic time series data related to the network traffic entity, in this case, the ‘Britney Spears’ search query.
- the historic time series data includes a set of historic values. Each historic value is representative of a frequency of actions related to the network traffic entity during a particular time interval of a historic time segment.
- the analysis module 118 extracts raw data related to the ‘Britney Spears’ search query from the data store 114 , and determines a count of all occurrences of the ‘Britney Spears’ search query during each time interval (e.g., on an hourly basis) of the time segment (i.e., the twenty-four hour time period). This count (referred to in this description as the “hourly query count”) is then merged with the hourly query counts of the previous four weeks to generate historic time series data related to the ‘Britney Spears’ search query for a historic time segment of four weeks.
- the raw data includes noise that can make patterns (if any exist) difficult to identify.
- the noise can be random error, or in some cases, spam (artificially inflated network traffic, e.g., from an automated system making a large number of requests for entities).
- search queries for ‘gmail’ or any other electronic mail service are generally expected to have little “noise” from hour to hour or week to week, as public interest in electronic mail services seldom exhibits sudden increases in interest.
- search queries for ‘Britney Spears’ may fluctuate widely as news of the pop idol's personal life or career makes television or the tabloids.
- a query count for a ‘New England Patriots’ search query may be expected to be higher on Sundays and Mondays during football season.
- a query count for a ‘New York Times’ search query may be expected to be higher in the client-local morning hours as compared to the afternoon or evening hours.
- the analysis module 118 determines ( 304 ) baseline levels for noise and filters out noise (including spam) from the raw data to obtain the historic time series data. This process of filtering out the noise (including spam) may involve applying a set of local rules (e.g., removal of raw data associated with log entries that do not include cookies) and/or a set of global rules (e.g., count a search query once in those instances where multiple search queries are associated with a single cookie).
- a set of local rules e.g., removal of raw data associated with log entries that do not include cookies
- a set of global rules e.g., count a search query once in those instances where multiple search queries are associated with a single cookie.
- the analysis module 118 uses the historic time series data to generate ( 306 ) a network traffic model for the ‘Britney Spears’ search query.
- This network traffic model can be derived using a traditional time series analysis, which generally: (a) identifies the nature (e.g., a pattern) of a phenomenon represented by the sequence of observations, and (b) forecasts or predicts future behavior.
- time series data can be described in terms of two basic classes of components: trend and seasonality. Trends represent a general systematic linear or nonlinear component that changes over time and does not repeat or at least does not repeat within the time range captured by the data (e.g., a plateau followed by a period of exponential growth).
- Seasonalities may have a similar nature (e.g., a plateau followed by a period of exponential growth), however, it repeats itself in systematic intervals over an extended period of time.
- Trend and seasonality may coexist in real-life data. For example, search queries for ‘gmail’ may rapidly grow over time segments of years but still follow consistent seasonal patterns (e.g., as much as 25% of network traffic each year is in December, whereas only 4% is in August).
- the analysis module 118 generates ( 306 ) the network traffic model by identifying patterns (e.g., trend and seasonality) in the historic time series data and predicting future behavior.
- the predicted future behavior i.e., forecasted values based on the identified pattern, is associated with a forecasted time segment.
- the time intervals of the forecasted time segment correspond to the time intervals of the historic time segments. That is, the values of the time intervals of the forecasting time segment are forecasted (i.e., predicted) from values of corresponding time intervals of the historic time segment.
- the analysis module 118 estimates a confidence interval for each time interval of the forecasted time segment based on the values of the corresponding time intervals of the historic time segment.
- the confidence interval is defined by an upper confidence limit and a lower confidence limit, and represents an expected range of fluctuation in value.
- the historic time series data with a best fit curve.
- the best fit curve can be a linear function; however, if there is a nonlinear component to the historic time series data, the data can be expressed with, for example, a logarithmic, exponential, or polynomial function.
- the analysis module 118 obtains ( 308 ) actual time series data, which includes a set of actual network traffic values associated with time intervals spanning an actual time segment to be analyzed against the network traffic model. Generally, the time intervals of the time segment desired to be analyzed correspond to the time intervals of the network traffic model. For each time interval, the analysis module 118 compares ( 310 ) the actual value with the forecasted value. In one example, at the end of each sixty minute time period, the analysis module 118 extracts raw data related to the ‘Britney Spears’ search query from the data store 114 , and determines a count of all occurrences of the ‘Britney Spears’ search query during that time interval.
- This count (i.e., the actual value) is then compared with the predicted count (i.e., the forecasted value) for the ‘Britney Spears’ search query for that same time interval.
- the predicted count i.e., the forecasted value
- this serves as an indicator that an event of interest (e.g., an earthquake, news about a particular celebrity) may have occurred during that time interval.
- an illustrative graph 400 represents a comparison of actual time series data against a network traffic model.
- the graph 400 depicts approximately four weeks of actual and forecasted values for the ‘Britney Spears’ search query spanning Jun. 1, 2006 through Jun. 28, 2006.
- the forecasted values representative of the network traffic model are denoted by a dashed line 402 , and the confidence intervals are shown in the shaded portions 404 .
- the actual values obtained over the four weeks are denoted by the solid line 406 .
- the actual values at various time intervals exceeded the confidence interval 404 by varying amounts as denoted by portions 406 a of the solid line 406 .
- a subsequent analysis of the events of Jun. 27, 2006 would reveal that the pop idol's announcement that she is expecting her second child contributed to a large spike in ‘Britney Spears’ search queries by users interested in learning more about the announcement.
- the analysis module 118 determines ( 312 ) scores for the actual values representative of an occurrence of an event of interest. In cases where the analysis module 118 handles multiple series of data of the ‘Britney Spears’ search query, or multiple series of data representing ‘Britney Spears’ and ‘earthquake’ search queries, there may be multiple occurrences of events of interest. Scoring can then be useful to identify ( 314 ) the occurrences of events of interest that meet a threshold score. The scores can also be used to quantitatively rank the occurrences of events of interest. In such cases, the occurrences of events of interest are sorted, and for example, the top 1,000 occurrences can be identified ( 314 ).
- the analysis module 118 assigns ( 312 ) scores based on scoring factors. For example, a scoring factor considers the temporal displacement of the time interval associated with the actual value that exceeds the confidence interval of the forecasted value with a current time. That is, scores are assigned corresponding to the recency of an occurrence of an event of interest. Therefore, an occurrence of an event of interest one hour prior to a current time can be assigned a quantitatively more significant score (e.g., a higher score) than an occurrence of an event of interest one week prior to the current time.
- the current time can be any arbitrarily fixed time, but generally represents the time at which the process 300 compares ( 310 ) actual data against the network traffic model.
- Other implementations include assigning ( 312 ) scores based on an amount of the actual value, i.e., volume.
- the process 300 can also assign ( 312 ) a score based on an amount by which the actual value exceeds the confidence interval of the forecasted value.
- scoring can be useful to identify ( 314 ) the occurrences of events of interest that meet a threshold score.
- the scores can also be used to quantitatively rank the occurrences of events of interest.
- the analysis module 118 After identifying ( 314 ) occurrences of events of interest (whether through assigning ( 312 ) scores or not), the analysis module 118 generates ( 316 ) a report of occurrences of events of interest. Specifically, the process 300 can use the scoring factors together or independently to generate ( 316 ) reports for an intended use. That is, the relative weights of the scoring factors vary by the intended use of the report. For example, if the process 300 generates ( 316 ) a report to list all the major events of interest over the past week, the temporal displacement, i.e., the recency factor, would weigh more favorably the data within the past week.
- the process 300 can also generate ( 316 ) a report to show current, but relatively unknown and obscure, events of interest.
- the scoring factors would generally favor the data from the past few hours and with smaller volume.
- the weighting of the scoring factors allows for traffic related to a particular entity to result as an event of interest on both reports, but with different scores.
- the report may or may not include additional information representative of the occurrences of the events of interest.
- This information may be obtained, e.g., from the logging module 112 , along with the actual time series data and includes geographic information, timestamps, hashes of cookies, and network traffic entity identifiers.
- the additional information enriches a report of the occurrences of events of interest, without revealing any personally identifiable information.
