- the physical memory circuits may be any type of memory circuits.
- each physical memory circuit is a separate memory chip.
- each may be a DDR2 DRAM.
- the memory circuits may be symmetrical, meaning each has the same capacity, type, speed, etc., while in other embodiments they may be asymmetrical. For ease of illustration only, three such memory circuits are shown, but actual embodiments may use any plural number of memory circuits.
- the memory chips may optionally be coupled to a memory module (not shown), such as a DIMM.
- the system device may be any type of system capable of requesting and/or initiating a process that results in an access of the memory circuits.
- the system may include a memory controller (not shown) through which it accesses the memory circuits.
- the interface circuit may include any circuit or logic capable of directly or indirectly communicating with the memory circuits, such as a buffer chip, advanced memory buffer (AMB) chip, etc.
- the interface circuit interfaces a plurality of signals 108 between the system device and the memory circuits. Such signals may include, for example, data signals, address signals, control signals, clock signals, and so forth. In some embodiments, all of the signals communicated between the system device and the memory circuits are communicated via the interface circuit. In other embodiments, some other signals 110 are communicated directly between the system device (or some component thereof, such as a memory controller, an AMB, or a register) and the memory circuits, without passing through the interface circuit. In some such embodiments, the majority of signals are communicated via the interface circuit, such that L>M.
- the interface circuit presents to the system device an interface to emulated memory devices which differ in some aspect from the physical memory circuits which are actually present.
- the interface circuit may tell the system device that the number of emulated memory circuits is different than the actual number of physical memory circuits.
- the terms “emulating”, “emulated”, “emulation”, and the like will be used in this disclosure to signify emulation, simulation, disguising, transforming, converting, and the like, which results in at least one characteristic of the memory circuits appearing to the system device to be different than the actual, physical characteristic.
- the emulated characteristic may be electrical in nature, physical in nature, logical in nature (e.g.
- An example of an emulated electrical characteristic might be a signal, or a voltage level.
- An example of an emulated physical characteristic might be a number of pins or wires, a number of signals, or a memory capacity.
- An example of an emulated protocol characteristic might be a timing, or a specific protocol such as DDR3.
- an emulated signal such signal may be a control signal such as an address signal, a data signal, or a control signal associated with an activate operation, precharge operation, write operation, mode register read operation, refresh operation, etc.
- the interface circuit may emulate the number of signals, type of signals, duration of signal assertion, and so forth. It may combine multiple signals to emulate another signal.
- the interface circuit may present to the system device an emulated interface to e.g. DDR3 memory, while the physical memory chips are, in fact, DDR2 memory.
- the interface circuit may emulate an interface to one version of a protocol such as DDR2 with 5-5-5 latency timing, while the physical memory chips are built to another version of the protocol such as DDR2 with 3-3-3 latency timing.
- the interface circuit may emulate an interface to a memory having a first capacity that is different than the actual combined capacity of the physical memory chips.
- An emulated timing may relate to latency of e.g. a column address strobe (CAS) latency, a row address to column address latency (tRCD), a row precharge latency (tRP), an activate to precharge latency (tRAS), and so forth.
- CAS latency is related to the timing of accessing a column of data.
- tRCD is the latency required between the row address strobe (RAS) and CAS.
- tRP is the latency required to terminate an open row and open access to the next row.
- tRAS is the latency required to access a certain row of data between an activate operation and a precharge operation.
- the interface circuit may be operable to receive a signal from the system device and communicate the signal to one or more of the memory circuits after a delay (which may be hidden from the system device). Such delay may be fixed, or in some embodiments it may be variable. If variable, the delay may depend on e.g. a function of the current signal or a previous signal, a combination of signals, or the like. The delay may include a cumulative delay associated with any one or more of the signals. The delay may result in a time shift of the signal forward or backward in time with respect to other signals. Different delays may be applied to different signals.
- the interface circuit may similarly be operable to receive a signal from a memory circuit and communicate the signal to the system device after a delay.
- the interface circuit may take the form of, or incorporate, or be incorporated into, a register, an AMB, a buffer, or the like, and may comply with Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) standards, and may have forwarding, storing, and/or buffering capabilities.
- JEDEC Joint Electron Device Engineering Council
- the interface circuit may perform operations without the system device's knowledge.
- One particularly useful such operation is a power-saving operation.
- the interface circuit may identify one or more of the memory circuits which are not currently being accessed by the system device, and perform the power saving operation on those. In one such embodiment, the identification may involve determining whether any page (or other portion) of memory is being accessed.
- the power saving operation may be a power down operation, such as a precharge power down operation.
- the interface circuit may include one or more devices which together perform the emulation and related operations.
- the interface circuit may be coupled or packaged with the memory devices, or with the system device or a component thereof, or separately.
- the memory circuits and the interface circuit are coupled to a DIMM.
- FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of a system 200 including a system device (e.g. host system 204 , etc.) which communicates address, control, clock, and data signals with a memory subsystem 201 via an interface.
- a system device e.g. host system 204 , etc.
- FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of a system 200 including a system device (e.g. host system 204 , etc.) which communicates address, control, clock, and data signals with a memory subsystem 201 via an interface.
- a system device e.g. host system 204 , etc.
- the memory subsystem includes a buffer chip 202 which presents the host system with emulated interface to emulated memory, and a plurality of physical memory circuits which, in the example shown, are DRAM chips 206 A-D.
- the DRAM chips are stacked, and the buffer chip is placed electrically between them and the host system.
- a stack may refer to any collection of memory circuits (e.g. DRAM circuits, flash memory circuits, or combinations of memory circuit technologies, etc.).
- the buffer chip buffers communicates signals between the host system and the DRAM chips, and presents to the host system an emulated interface to present the memory as though it were a smaller number of larger capacity DRAM chips, although in actuality there is a larger number of smaller capacity DRAM chips in the memory subsystem. For example, there may be eight 512 Mb physical DRAM chips, but the buffer chip buffers and emulates them to appear as a single 4 Gb DRAM chip, or as two 2 Gb DRAM chips. Although the drawing shows four DRAM chips, this is for ease of illustration only; the invention is, of course, not limited to using four DRAM chips.
- the buffer chip is coupled to send address, control, and clock signals 208 to the DRAM chips via a single, shared address, control, and clock bus, but each DRAM chip has its own, dedicated data path for sending and receiving data signals 210 to/from the buffer chip.
- the reference number 1 will be used to denote the interface between the host system and the buffer chip
- the reference number 2 will be used to denote the address, control, and clock interface between the buffer chip and the physical memory circuits
- the reference number 3 will be used to denote the data interface between the buffer chip and the physical memory circuits, regardless of the specifics of how any of those interfaces is implemented in the various embodiments and configurations described below.
- FIG. 2 there is a single address, control, and clock interface channel 2 and four data interface channels 3 ; this implementation may thus be said to have a “1A4D” configuration (wherein “1A” means one address, control, and clock channel in interface 2 , and “4D” means four data channels in interface 3 ).
- the DRAM chips are physically arranged on a single side of the buffer chip.
- the buffer chip may, optionally, be a part of the stack of DRAM chips, and may optionally be the bottommost chip in the stack. Or, it may be separate from the stack.
- FIG. 3 illustrates another embodiment of a system 301 in which the buffer chip 303 is interfaced to a host system 304 and is coupled to the DRAM chips 307 A- 307 D somewhat differently than in the system of FIG. 2 .
- Each shared bus has two or more DRAM chips coupled to it. As shown, the sharing need not necessarily be the same in the data busses as it is in the address, control, and clock busses.
- This embodiment has a “2A2D” configuration.
- FIG. 4 illustrates another embodiment of a system 411 in which the buffer chip 413 is interfaced to a host system 404 and is coupled to the DRAM chips 417 A- 417 D somewhat differently than in the system of FIG. 2 or 3 .
- Each shared bus has two or more DRAM chips coupled to it.
- This implementation has a “1A2D” configuration.
- FIG. 5 illustrates another embodiment of a system 521 in which the buffer chip 523 is interfaced to a host system 504 and is coupled to the DRAM chips 527 A- 527 D somewhat differently than in the system of FIGS. 2 through 4 .
- This implementation has a “1A1D” configuration.
- FIG. 6 illustrates another embodiment of a system 631 in which the buffer chip 633 is interfaced to a host system 604 and is coupled to the DRAM chips 637 A- 637 D somewhat differently than in the system of FIGS. 2 through 5 .
- Each shared bus has two or more DRAM chips coupled to it. Further, in the example shown, the DRAM chips are physically arranged on both sides of the buffer chip. There may be, for example, sixteen DRAM chips, with the eight DRAM chips on each side of the buffer chip arranged in two stacks of four chips each. This implementation has a “2A4D” configuration.
- FIGS. 2 through 6 are not intended to be an exhaustive listing of all possible permutations of data paths, busses, and buffer chip configurations, and are only illustrative of some ways in which the host system device can be in electrical contact only with the load of the buffer chip and thereby be isolated from whatever physical memory circuits, data paths, busses, etc. exist on the (logical) other side of the buffer chip.
- FIG. 7 illustrates one embodiment of a method 700 for storing at least a portion of information received in association with a first operation, for use in performing a second operation.
- a method may be practiced in a variety of systems, such as, but not limited to, those of FIGS. 1-6 .
- the method may be performed by the interface circuit of FIG. 1 or the buffer chip of FIG. 2 .
- first information is received ( 702 ) in association with a first operation to be performed on at least one of the memory circuits (DRAM chips).
- the first information may be received prior to, simultaneously with, or subsequent to the instigation of the first operation.
- the first operation may be, for example, a row operation, in which case the first information may include e.g. address values received by the buffer chip via the address bus from the host system. At least a portion of the first information is then stored ( 704 ).
- the buffer chip also receives ( 706 ) second information associated with a second operation. For convenience, this receipt is shown as being after the storing of the first information, but it could also happen prior to or simultaneously with the storing.
- the second operation may be, for example, a column operation.
- the buffer chip performs ( 708 ) the second operation, utilizing the stored portion of the first information, and the second information.
- the buffer chip may receive from the host system's memory controller more address bits than are required to address any given one of the DRAM chips.
- the extra address bits may be decoded by the buffer chip to individually select the DRAM chips, utilizing separate chip select signals (not shown) to each of the DRAM chips in the stack.
- a stack of four x4 1 Gb DRAM chips behind the buffer chip may appear to the host system as a single x4 4 Gb DRAM circuit, in which case the memory controller may provide sixteen row address bits and three bank address bits during a row operation (e.g. an activate operation), and provide eleven column address bits and three bank address bits during a column operation (e.g. a read or write operation).
- the individual DRAM chips in the stack may require only fourteen row address bits and three bank address bits for a row operation, and eleven column address bits and three bank address bits during a column operation.
- the buffer chip may receive two address bits more than are needed by any of the DRAM chips.
- the buffer chip stores ( 704 ) these two extra bits during the row operation (in addition to using them to select the correct one of the DRAM chips), then uses them later, during the column operation, to select the correct one of the DRAM chips.
- mapping between a system address (from the host system to the buffer chip) and a device address (from the buffer chip to a DRAM chip) may be performed in various manners.
- lower order system row address and bank address bits may be mapped directly to the device row address and bank address bits, with the most significant system row address bits (and, optionally, the most significant bank address bits) being stored for use in the subsequent column operation.
- what is stored is the decoded version of those bits; in other words, the extra bits may be stored either prior to or after decoding.
- the stored bits may be stored, for example, in an internal lookup table (not shown) in the buffer chip, for one or more clock cycles.
- the buffer chip may have four 512 Mb DRAM chips with which it emulates a single 2 Gb DRAM chip.
- the system will present fifteen row address bits, from which the buffer chip may use the fourteen low order bits (or, optionally, some other set of fourteen bits) to directly address the DRAM chips.
- the system will present three bank address bits, from which the buffer chip may use the two low order bits (or, optionally, some other set of two bits) to directly address the DRAM chips.
- the most significant bank address bit (or other unused bit) and the most significant row address bit (or other unused bit) are used to generate the four DRAM chip select signals, and are stored for later reuse.
- the stored bits are again used to generate the four DRAM chip select signals.
- the unused bank address is not stored during the row operation, as it will be re-presented during the subsequent column operation.
- addresses may be mapped between four 1 Gb DRAM circuits to emulate a single 4 Gb DRAM circuit.
- Sixteen row address bits and three bank address bits come from the host system, of which the low order fourteen address bits and all three bank address bits are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits.
- the two most significant row address bits are decoded to generate four chip select signals, and are stored using the bank address bits as the index.
- the stored row address bits are again used to generate the four chip select signals.
- a particular mapping technique may be chosen, to ensure that there are no unnecessary combinational logic circuits in the critical timing path between the address input pins and address output pins of the buffer chip.
- Corresponding combinational logic circuits may instead be used to generate the individual chip select signals. This may allow the capacitive loading on the address outputs of the buffer chip to be much higher than the loading on the individual chip select signal outputs of the buffer chip.
- the address mapping may be performed by the buffer chip using some of the bank address signals from the host system to generate the chip select signals.
- the buffer chip may store the higher order row address bits during a row operation, using the bank address as the index, and then use the stored address bits as part of the DRAM circuit bank address during a column operation.
- four 512 Mb DRAM chips may be used in emulating a single 2 Gb DRAM.
- Fifteen row address bits come from the host system, of which the low order fourteen are mapped directly to the DRAM chips.
- Three bank address bits come from the host system, of which the least significant bit is used as a DRAM circuit bank address bit for the DRAM chips.
- the most significant row address bit may be used as an additional DRAM circuit bank address bit.
- the two most significant bank address bits are decoded to generate the four chip select signals.
- the most significant row address bit may be stored during the row operation, and reused during the column operation with the least significant bank address bit, to form the DRAM circuit bank address.
- the column address from the host system memory controller may be mapped directly as the column address to the DRAM chips in the stack, since each of the DRAM chips may have the same page size, regardless any differences in the capacities of the (asymmetrical) DRAM chips.
- address bit A[ 10 ] may be used by the memory controller to enable or disable auto-precharge during a column operation, in which case the buffer chip may forward that bit to the DRAM circuits without any modification during a column operation.
- the simulated DRAM circuit may be desirable to determine whether the simulated DRAM circuit behaves according to a desired DRAM standard or other design specification. Behavior of many DRAM circuits is specified by the JEDEC standards, and it may be desirable to exactly emulate a particular JEDEC standard DRAM.
- the JEDEC standard defines control signals that a DRAM circuit must accept and the behavior of the DRAM circuit as a result of such control signals.
- the JEDEC specification for DDR2 DRAM is known as JESD79-2B. If it is desired to determine whether a standard is met, the following algorithm may be used. Using a set of software verification tools, it checks for formal verification of logic, that protocol behavior of the simulated DRAM circuit is the same as the desired standard or other design specification.
- Suitable verification tools include: Magellan, supplied by Synopsys, Inc. of 700 E. Middlefield Rd., Mt. View, Calif. 94043; Incisive, supplied by Cadence Design Systems, Inc., of 2655 Sealy Ave., San Jose, Calif. 95134; tools supplied by Jasper Design Automation, Inc. of 100 View St. #100, Mt. View, Calif. 94041; Verix, supplied by Real Intent, Inc., of 505 N. Mathilda Ave. #210, Sunnyvale, Calif. 94085; 0-In, supplied by Mentor Graphics Corp. of 8005 SW Boeckman Rd., Wilsonville, Oreg. 97070; and others.
- an assertion may be written that no two DRAM control signals are allowed to be issued to an address, control, and clock bus at the same time.
- the verification process allows a designer to prove that the emulated DRAM circuit exactly meets the required standard etc. If, for example, an address mapping that uses a common bus for data and a common bus for address, results in a control and clock bus that does not meet a required specification, alternative designs for buffer chips with other bus arrangements or alternative designs for the sideband signal interconnect between two or more buffer chips may be used and tested for compliance.
- Such sideband signals convey the power management signals, for example.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a high capacity DIMM 800 using a plurality of buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 802 and a register device 804 , according to one embodiment of this invention.
- the register performs the addressing and control of the buffered stacks.
- the DIMM may be an FB-DIMM, in which case the register is an AMB.
- the emulation is performed at the DIMM level.
- FIG. 9 is a timing diagram illustrating a timing design 900 of a buffer chip which makes a buffered stack of DRAM chips mimic a larger DRAM circuit having longer CAS latency, in accordance with another embodiment of this invention.
- Any delay through a buffer chip may be made transparent to the host system's memory controller, by using such a method. Such a delay may be a result of the buffer chip being located electrically between the memory bus of the host system and the stacked DRAM circuits, since some or all of the signals that connect the memory bus to the DRAM circuits pass through the buffer chip. A finite amount of time may be needed for these signals to traverse through the buffer chip.
- the buffer chip may cause a one-half clock cycle delay between the buffer chip receiving address and control signals from the host system memory controller (or, optionally, from a register chip or an AMB), and the address and control signals being valid at the inputs of the stacked DRAM circuits.
- Data signals may also have a one-half clock cycle delay in either direction to/from the host system. Other amounts of delay are, of course, possible, and the half-clock cycle example is for illustration only.
- the cumulative delay through the buffer chip is the sum of a delay of the address and control signals and a delay of the data signals.
- FIG. 9 illustrates an example where the buffer chip is using DRAM chips having a native CAS latency of i clocks, and the buffer chip delay is j clocks, thus the buffer chip emulates a DRAM having a CAS latency of i+j clocks.
- the DRAM chips have a native CAS latency 906 of four clocks (from t 1 to t 5 ), and the total latency through the buffer chip is two clocks (one clock delay 902 from t 0 to t 1 for address and control signals, plus one clock delay 904 from t 5 to t 6 for data signals), and the buffer chip emulates a DRAM having a six clock CAS latency 908 .
- the reference numbers 1 , 2 , and/or 3 at the left margin indicate which of the interfaces correspond to the signals or values illustrated on the associated waveforms.
- the “Clock” signal shown as a square wave on the uppermost waveform is indicated as belonging to the interface 1 between the host system and the buffer chip; the “Control Input to Buffer” signal is also part of the interface 1 ; the “Control Input to DRAM” waveform is part of the interface 2 from the buffer chip to the physical memory circuits; the “Data Output from DRAM” waveform is part of the interface 3 from the physical memory circuits to the buffer chip; and the “Data Output from Buffer” shown in the lowermost waveform is part of the interface 1 from the buffer chip to the host system.
- FIG. 10 is a timing diagram illustrating a timing design 1000 of write data timing expected by a DRAM circuit in a buffered stack.
- Emulation of a larger capacity DRAM circuit having higher CAS latency may, in some implementations, create a problem with the timing of write operations.
- the DDR2 SDRAM protocol may specify that the write CAS latency 1002 is one less than the read CAS latency. Therefore, since die buffered stack appears as a DDR2 SDRAM with a read CAS latency of six clocks, the memory controller may use a buffered stack write CAS latency of five clocks 1004 when scheduling a write operation to the memory.
- the memory controller issues the write operation at t 0 .
- the write operation is issued to the DRAM chips at t 1 .
- the buffer chip may alleviate by delaying write operations.
- the waveform “Write Data Expected by DRAM” is not shown as belonging to interface 1 , interface 2 , or interface 3 , for the simple reason that there is no such signal present in any of those interfaces. That waveform represents only what is expected by the DRAM, not what is actually provided to the DRAM.
- FIG. 11 is a timing illustrating a timing design 1100 showing how the buffer chip does this.
- the memory controller issues the write operation at t 0 .
- the write operation appeared at the DRAM circuits one clock later at t 1 , due to the inherent delay through the buffer chip.
- FIG. 12 is a timing diagram illustrating operation of an FB-DIMM's AMB, which may be designed to send write data earlier to buffered stacks instead of delaying the write address and operation (as in FIG. 11 ). Specifically, it may use an early write CAS latency 1202 to compensate the timing of the buffer chip write operation. If the buffer chip has a cumulative (address and data) inherent delay of two clocks, the AMB may send the write data to the buffered stack two clocks early. This may not be possible in the case of registered DIMMs, in which the memory controller sends the write data directly to the buffered stacks (rather than via the AMB). In another embodiment, the memory controller itself could be designed to send write data early, to compensate for the j clocks of cumulative inherent delay caused by the buffer chip.
- the memory controller issues the write operation at t 0 .
- the write operation arrives at the DRAM at t 1 .
- FIG. 13 is a timing diagram 1300 illustrating bus conflicts which can be caused by delayed write operations.
- the delaying of write addresses and write operations may be performed by a buffer chip, a register, an AMB, etc. in a manner that is completely transparent to the memory controller of the host system. And, because the memory controller is unaware of this delay, it may schedule subsequent operations such as activate or precharge operations, which may collide with the delayed writes on the address bus to the DRAM chips in the stack.
- the memory controller issues a write operation 1302 at time t 0 .
- the buffer chip or AMB delays the write operation, such that it appears on the bus to the DRAM chips at time t 3 .
- the memory controller issued an activate operation (control signal) 1304 which, after a one-clock inherent delay through the buffer chip, appears on the bus to the DRAM chips at time t 3 , colliding with the delayed write.
- FIGS. 14 and 15 are a timing diagram 1400 and a timing diagram 1500 illustrating methods of avoiding such collisions. If the cumulative latency through the buffer chip is two clock cycles, and the native read CAS latency of the DRAM chips is four clock cycles, then in order to hide the delay of the address and control signals and the data signals through the buffer chip, the buffer chip presents the host system with an interface to an emulated memory having a read CAS latency of six clock cycles. And if the tRCD and tRP of the DRAM chips are four clock cycles each, the buffer chip tells the host system that they are six clock cycles each in order to allow the buffer chip to delay the activate and precharge operations to avoid collisions in a manner that is transparent to the host system.
- a buffered stack that uses 4-4-4 DRAM chips may appear to the host system as one larger DRAM that uses 6-6-6 timing.
- the memory controller may schedule a column operation to a bank six clock cycles (at time t 6 ) after an activate (row) operation (at time t 0 ) to the same bank.
- the DRAM chips in the stack actually have a tRCD of four clock cycles. This gives the buffer chip time to delay the activate operation by up to two clock cycles, avoiding any conflicts on the address bus between the buffer chip and the DRAM chips, while ensuring correct read and write timing on the channel between the memory controller and the buffered stack.
- the buffer chip may issue the activate operation to the DRAM chips one, two, or three clock cycles after it receives the activate operation from the memory controller, register, or AMB.
- the actual delay selected may depend on the presence or absence of other DRAM operations that may conflict with the activate operation, and may optionally change from one activate operation to another. In other words, the delay may be dynamic.
- a one-clock delay ( 1402 A, 1502 A) may be accomplished simply by the inherent delay through the buffer chip.
- a two-clock delay ( 1402 B, 1502 B) may be accomplished by adding one clock of additional delay to the one-clock inherent delay
- a three-clock delay 1402 C, 1502 C
- a read, write, or activate operation issued by the memory controller at time t 6 will, after a one-clock inherent delay through the buffer chip, be issued to the DRAM chips at time t 7 .
- a preceding activate or precharge operation issued by the memory controller at time t 0 will, depending upon the delay, be issued to the DRAM chips at time t 1 , t 2 , or t 3 , each of which is at least the tRCD or tRP of four clocks earlier than the t 7 issuance of the read, write, or activate operation.
- the memory controller may schedule a subsequent activate (row) operation to a bank a minimum of six clock cycles after issuing a precharge operation to that bank.
- the buffer chip may have the ability to delay issuing the precharge operation to the DRAM chips by up to two clock cycles, in order to avoid any conflicts on the address bus, or in order to satisfy the tRAS requirements of the DRAM chips.
- the precharge operation to the same bank may be delayed by the buffer chip to satisfy the tRAS requirements of the DRAM.
- the buffer chip may issue the precharge operation to the DRAM chips one, two, or three clock cycles after it is received. The delay selected may depend on the presence or absence of address bus conflicts or tRAS violations, and may change from one precharge operation to another.
- FIG. 16 illustrates a buffered stack 1600 according to one embodiment of this invention.
- the buffered stack includes four 512 Mb DDR2 DRAM circuits (chips) 1602 which a buffer chip 1604 maps to a single 2 Gb DDR2 DRAM.
- the multiple DRAM chips appear to the memory controller as though they were a single, larger DRAM, the combined power dissipation of the actual DRAM chips may be much higher than the power dissipation of a monolithic DRAM of the same capacity. In other words, the physical DRAM may consume significantly more power than would be consumed by the emulated DRAM.
- a DIMM containing multiple buffered stacks may dissipate much more power than a standard DIMM of the same actual capacity using monolithic DRAM circuits.
- This increased power dissipation may limit the widespread adoption of DIMMs that use buffered stacks.
- the DRAM circuits may be opportunistically placed in low power states or modes.
- the DRAM circuits may be placed in a precharge power down mode using the clock enable (CKE) pin of the DRAM circuits.
- CKE clock enable
- a single rank registered DIMM may contain a plurality of buffered stacks, each including four x4 512 Mb DDR2 SDRAM chips and appear (to the memory controller via emulation by the buffer chip) as a single x4 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM.
- the JEDEC standard indicates that a 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM may generally have eight banks, shown in FIG. 16 as Bank 0 to Bank 7 . Therefore, the buffer chip may map each 512Mb DRAM chip in the stack to two banks of the equivalent 2 Gb DRAM, as shown; the first DRAM chip 1602 A is treated as containing banks 0 and 1 , 1602 B is treated as containing banks 2 and 4 , and so forth.
- the memory controller may open and close pages in the DRAM banks based on memory requests it receives from the rest of the host system. In some embodiments, no more than one page may be able to be open in a bank at any given time. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 16 , each DRAM chip may therefore have up to two pages open at a time. When a DRAM chip has no open pages, the power management scheme may place it in the precharge power down mode.
- the clock enable inputs of the DRAM chips may be controlled by the buffer chip, or by another chip (not shown) on the R-DIMM, or by an AMB (not shown) in the case of an FB-DIMM, or by the memory controller, to implement the power management technique.
- the power management technique may be particularly effective if it implements a closed page policy.
- Another optional power management technique may include mapping a plurality of DRAM circuits to a single bank of the larger capacity emulated DRAM.
- a buffered stack (not shown) of sixteen x4 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM chips may be used in emulating a single x4 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM.
- the 4 Gb DRAM is specified by JEDEC as having eight banks of 512 Mbs each, so two of the 256 Mb DRAM chips may be mapped by the buffer chip to emulate each bank (whereas in FIG. 16 one DRAM was used to emulate two banks).
- the memory controller since only one page can be open in a bank at any given time, only one of the two DRAM chips emulating that bank can be in the active state at any given time. If the memory controller opens a page in one of the two DRAM chips, the other may be placed in the precharge power down mode. Thus, if a number p of DRAM chips are used to emulate one bank, at least p ⁇ 1 of them may be in a power down mode at any given time; in other words, at least p ⁇ 1 of the p chips are always in power down mode, although the particular powered down chips will tend to change over time, as the memory controller opens and closes various pages of memory.
- the power saving operation may comprise operating in precharge power down mode except when refresh is required.
- FIG. 17 is a flow chart 1700 illustrating one embodiment of a method of refreshing a plurality of memory circuits.
- a refresh control signal is received ( 1702 ) e.g. from a memory controller which intends to refresh an emulated memory circuit.
- a plurality of refresh control signals are sent ( 1704 ) e.g. by a buffer chip to a plurality of physical memory circuits at different times.
- These refresh control signals may optionally include the received refresh control signal or an instantiation or copy thereof. They may also, or instead, include refresh control signals that are different in at least one aspect (format, content, etc.) from the received signal.
- At least one first refresh control signal may be sent to a first subset of the physical memory circuits at a first time, and at least one second refresh control signal may be sent to a second subset of the physical memory circuits at a second time.
- Each refresh signal may be sent to one physical memory circuit, or to a plurality of physical memory circuits, depending upon the particular implementation.
- the refresh control signals may be sent to the physical memory circuits after a delay in accordance with a particular timing.
- the timing in which they are sent to the physical memory circuits may be selected to minimize an electrical current drawn by the memory, or to minimize a power consumption of the memory. This may be accomplished by staggering a plurality of refresh control signals.
- the timing may be selected to comply with e.g. a tRFC parameter associated with the memory circuits.
- physical DRAM circuits may receive periodic refresh operations to maintain integrity of data stored therein.
- a memory controller may initiate refresh operations by issuing refresh control signals to the DRAM circuits with sufficient frequency to prevent any loss of data in the DRAM circuits. After a refresh control signal is issued, a minimum time tRFC may be required to elapse before another control signal may be issued to that DRAM circuit.
- the tRFC parameter value may increase as the size of the DRAM circuit increases.
- the buffer chip When the buffer chip receives a refresh control signal from the memory controller, it may refresh the smaller DRAM circuits within the span of time specified by the tRFC of the emulated DRAM circuit. Since the tRFC of the larger, emulated DRAM is longer than the tRFC of the smaller, physical DRAM circuits, it may not be necessary to issue any or all of the refresh control signals to the physical DRAM circuits simultaneously. Refresh control signals may be issued separately to individual DRAM circuits or to groups of DRAM circuits, provided that the tRFC requirements of all physical DRAMs has been met by the time the emulated DRAM's tRFC has elapsed. In use, the refreshes may be spaced in time to minimize the peak current draw of the combination buffer chip and DRAM circuit set during a refresh operation.
- FIG. 18 illustrates one embodiment of an interface circuit such as may be utilized in any of the above-described memory systems, for interfacing between a system and memory circuits.
- the interface circuit may be included in the buffer chip, for example.
- the interface circuit includes a system address signal interface for sending/receiving address signals to/from the host system, a system control signal interface for sending/receiving control signals to/from the host system, a system clock signal interface for sending/receiving clock signals to/from the host system, and a system data signal interface for sending/receiving data signals to/from the host system.

- the host system includes a set of memory attribute expectations, or built-in parameters of the physical memory with which it has been designed to work (or with which it has been told, e.g. by the buffer circuit, it is working). Accordingly, the host system includes a set of memory interaction attributes, or built-in parameters according to which the host system has been designed to operate in its interactions with the memory. These memory interaction attributes and expectations will typically, but not necessarily, be embodied in the host system's memory controller.
- the physical memory itself has a set of physical attributes.
- These expectations and attributes may include, by way of example only, memory timing, memory capacity, memory latency, memory functionality, memory type, memory protocol, memory power consumption, memory current requirements, and so forth.
- the interface circuit includes memory physical attribute storage for storing values or parameters of various physical attributes of the physical memory circuits.
- the interface circuit further includes system emulated attribute storage. These storage systems may be read/write capable stores, or they may simply be a set of hard-wired logic or values, or they may simply be inherent in the operation of the interface circuit.
- the interface circuit includes emulation logic which operates according to the stored memory physical attributes and the stored system emulation attributes, to present to the system an interface to an emulated memory which differs in at least one attribute from the actual physical memory.
- the emulation logic may, in various embodiments, alter a timing, value, latency, etc. of any of the address, control, clock, and/or data signals it sends to or receives from the system and/or the physical memory. Some such signals may pass through unaltered, while others may be altered.

Additionally, the physical DRAM circuit may be brought out of precharge power down mode before the earliest time a subsequent activate command may arrive at the inputs of the physical DRAM circuit. Thus, the power down entry and power down exit latency may be hidden from the memory controller.
- the interface circuit may make the stack of physical DRAM circuits appear to the memory controller as at least one larger capacity virtual DRAM circuit with tRP(virtual) and tRCD(virtual) that are larger than that of the physical DRAM circuits in the stack [e.g. larger than tRP(physical) and tRCD(physical) respectively, where tRCD(physical) is the tRCD of the physical DRAM circuits].

- the additional typical one clock cycle delay through a JEDEC register helps to hide the power down entry latency if tRRD(MIN) by itself is not sufficiently long to hide the power down entry latency.
- a row activate time power management scheme require 1 to be larger than or equal to x (where x is the power down exit latency) so that when the memory controller issues an activate command to a bank of the virtual DRAM circuit, and if the corresponding physical DRAM circuit is in precharge power down mode, the interface circuit can hide the power down exit latency of the physical DRAM circuit behind the row activate time tRCD of the virtual DRAM circuit.
- the interface circuit when the interface circuit receives an activate command that is directed to a DRAM circuit that is in precharge power down mode, it will delay the activate command by at least x clock cycles while simultaneously bringing the DRAM circuit out of power down mode.

- the interface circuit may optionally bring DRAM W and DRAM X out of power down mode such that when DRAM Y and DRAM Z have finished their refresh operations, all four DRAM circuits are in the precharge standby state and ready to receive the next command from the memory controller.
- the memory controller may place DRAM W, DRAM X, DRAM Y, and DRAM Z into precharge power down mode after the respective refresh operations if the power down exit latency of the DRAM circuits may be hidden behind the command operation period of the activate command of the virtual 2 Gb DRAM circuit.
- FIG. 24 shows a memory system 2400 comprising FB-DIMM modules using DRAM circuits with AMB chips, in accordance with another embodiment.
- the memory system 2400 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 19-23 .
- the memory system 2400 may be implemented in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- the memory circuit power management scheme may be associated with an FB-DIMM memory system that uses DDR2 SDRAM circuits.
- DDR3 SDRAM may provide similar control inputs and modes for power management and the example described in this section can be used with other types of buffering schemes and other memory circuit technologies. Therefore, the description of the specific example should not be construed as limiting in any manner.
- a memory controller 2402 may place commands and write data into frames and send the frames to interface circuits (e.g. AMB chip 2404 , etc.). Further, in the FB-DIMM memory system 2400 , there may be one AMB chip 2404 on each of a plurality of DIMMs 2406 A-C. For the memory controller 2402 to address and control DRAM circuits, it may issue commands that are placed into frames.
- the command frames or command and data frames may then be sent by the memory controller 2402 to the nearest AMB chip 2404 through a dedicated outbound path, which may be denoted as a southbound lane.
- the AMB chip 2404 closest to the memory controller 2402 may then relay the frames to the next AMB chip 2404 via its own southbound lane. In this manner, the frames may be relayed to each AMB chip 2404 in the FB-DIMM memory channel.
- each AMB chip 2404 may partially decode the frames to determine if a given frame contains commands targeted to the DRAM circuits on that the associated DIMM 2406 A-C. If a frame contains a read command addressed to a set of DRAM circuits on a given DIMM 2406 A-C, the AMB chip 2404 on the associated DIMM 2406 A-C accesses DRAM circuits 2408 to retrieve the requested data. The data may be placed into frames and returned to the memory controller 2402 through a similar frame relay process on the northbound lanes as that described for the southbound lanes.
- variable-latency scheduling Two classes of scheduling algorithms may be utilized for AMB chips 2404 to return data frames to die memory controller 2402 , including variable-latency scheduling and fixed-latency scheduling.
- variable latency scheduling after a read command is issued to the DRAM circuits 2408 , the DRAM circuits 2408 return data to the AMB chip 2404 .
- the AMB chip 2404 then constructs a data frame, and as soon as it can, places the data frame onto the northbound lanes to return the data to the memory controller 2402 .
- the variable latency scheduling algorithm may ensure the shortest latency for any given request in the FB-DIMM channel.
- DRAM circuits 2408 located on the DIMM e.g. the DIMM 2406 A, etc.
- DRAM circuits 2408 located on the DIMM e.g. the DIMM 2406 C, etc.
- the memory controller 2402 may be sophisticated, such that command frames may be scheduled appropriately to ensure that data return frames do not collide on the northbound lanes.
- variable latency scheduling may be easily performed since there may be limited situations where data frames may collide on the northbound lanes.
- variable latency scheduling may be far more difficult if the memory controller 2402 has to be designed to account for situations where the FB-DIMM channel can be configured with one DIMM, eight DIMMs, or any other number of DIMMs. Consequently, the fixed latency scheduling algorithm may be utilized in an FB-DIMM memory system 2400 to simplify memory controller design.
- every DIMM 2406 A-C is configured to provide equal access latency from the perspective of the memory controller 2402 .
- the access latency of every DIMM 2406 A-C may be equalized to the access latency of the slowest-responding DIMM (e.g. the DIMM 2406 C, etc.).
- the AMB chips 2404 that are not the slowest responding AMB chip 2404 e.g. the AMB chip 2404 of the DIMM 2406 C, etc.
- AMB chips 2404 may then hold the data for a number of cycles before this data is returned to the memory controller 2402 via the northbound lanes.
- the data return delay may be different for each AMB chip 2404 in the FB-DIMM channel.
- the data return delay value may depend on the distance of the DIMM 2406 A-C from the memory controller 2402 as well as the access latency of the DRAM circuits 2408 (e.g. the respective delay values may be computed for each AMB chip 2404 in a given FB-DIMM channel, and programmed into the appropriate AMB chip 2404 .
- the AMB chips 2404 may use the programmed delay values to perform differing classes of memory circuit power management algorithms.
- the large delay value ensures that the AMB chip 2404 can place DRAM circuits 2408 into power down modes and move them to active modes as needed.
- the AMB chip 2404 can place DRAM circuits 2408 into power down modes selectively after certain commands, as long as these commands provide the required command operation periods to hide the minimum power down entry latency. For example, the AMB chip 2404 can choose to place the DRAM circuits 2408 into a power down mode after a refresh command, and the DRAM circuits 2408 can be kept in the power down mode until a command is issued by the memory controller 2402 to access the specific set of DRAM circuits 2408 . Finally, in cases where the programmed data delay is smaller than x, the AMB chip 2404 may choose to implement power management algorithms to a selected subset of DRAM circuits 2408 .
- CKE power management there are various optional characteristics and benefits available when using CKE power management in FB-DIMMs.
- the schemes described are not limited to be used by themselves. For example, it is possible to use a trigger that is more complex than a single command in order to initiate power management.
- power management schemes may be initiated by the detection of combinations of commands, or patterns of commands, or by the detection of an absence of commands for a certain period of time, or by any other mechanism.
- Power management schemes may also use multiple triggers including forming a class of power management schemes using multiple commands or multiple combinations of commands. Power management schemes may also be used in combination. Thus, for example, a row precharge time based power management scheme may be used in combination with a row activate time command based power management scheme.
- An interface circuit may optionally be a part of the stack of DRAM circuits. Of course, however, the interface circuit may also be separate from the stack of DRAM circuits. In addition, the interface circuit may be physically located anywhere in the stack of DRAM circuits, where such interface circuit electrically sits between the electronic system and the stack of DRAM circuits.
- the interface circuit may be split into several chips that in combination perform the power management functions described.
- the register chip may optionally perform the signaling to the DRAM circuits.
- the register chip may further be connected electrically to a number of interface circuits that sit electrically between the register chip and a stack of DRAM circuits.
- the interface circuits in the stacks of DRAM circuits may then perform the required delay if it is needed.
- a plurality of register chips and buffer chips may sit electrically between the stacks of DRAM circuits and the system, where both the register chips and the buffer chips perform the signaling to the DRAM circuits as well as delaying the address, control, and data signals to the DRAM circuits.
- each stack may be a single memory circuit.
- the power management schemes described for the DRAM circuits may also be extended to the interface circuits.
- the interface circuits have information that a signal, bus, or other connection will not be used for a period of time. During this period of time, the interface circuits may perform power management on themselves, on other interface circuits, or cooperatively. Such power management may, for example, use an intelligent signaling mechanism (e.g. encoded signals, sideband signals, etc.) between interface circuits (e.g. register chips, buffer chips, AMB chips, etc.).
- an intelligent signaling mechanism e.g. encoded signals, sideband signals, etc.
- the simulated DRAM circuit including any power management scheme or CAS latency simulation or any other simulation behaves according to a desired DRAM standard or other design specification.
- a behavior of many DRAM circuits is specified by the JEDEC standards and it may be desirable, in some embodiments, to exactly simulate a particular JEDEC standard DRAM.
- the JEDEC standard may define control signals that a DRAM circuit must accept and the behavior of the DRAM circuit as a result of such control signals.
- the JEDEC specification for a DDR2 SDRAM may include JESD79-2B (and any associated revisions).
- an algorithm may be used. Such algorithm may check, using a set of software verification tools for formal verification of logic, that protocol behavior of the simulated DRAM circuit is the same as a desired standard or other design specification. This formal verification may be feasible because the DRAM protocol described in a DRAM standard may, in various embodiments, be limited to a few protocol commands (e.g. approximately 15 protocol commands in the case of the JEDEC DDR2 specification, for example).
- Examples of the aforementioned software verification tools include MAGELLAN supplied by SYNOPSYS, or other software verification tools, such as INCISIVE supplied by CADENCE, verification tools supplied by JASPER, VERIX supplied by REAL INTENT, 0-IN supplied by MENTOR CORPORATION, etc. These software verification tools may use written assertions that correspond to the rules established by the DRAM protocol and specification.
- the written assertions may be further included in code that forms the logic description for the interface circuit.
- a proof may be constructed that determines whether the desired design requirements are met. In this way, one may test various embodiments for compliance with a standard, multiple standards, or other design specification.
- assertions may be written that there are no conflicts on the address bus, command bus or between any clock, control, enable, reset or other signals necessary to operate or associated with the interface circuits and/or DRAM circuits.
- the aforementioned algorithm may allow a designer to prove that the simulated DRAM circuit exactly meets the required standard or other design specification. If, for example, an address mapping that uses a common bus for data and a common bus for address results in a control and clock bus that does not meet a required specification, alternative designs for the interface circuit with other bus arrangements or alternative designs for the interconnect between the components of the interface circuit may be used and tested for compliance with the desired standard or other design specification.

- DRAM e.g. DDR2 SDRAM
- the JEDEC standards and specifications describe how DRAM (e.g. DDR2 SDRAM) circuits are composed and perform operations in response to commands.
- a 512 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuit that meets JEDEC specifications may be composed of four portions (e.g.
- a 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit that is compliant with JEDEC specifications may be composed of eight banks (each of which has 256 Mb of capacity).
- a portion (e.g. bank, etc.) of the DRAM circuit is said to be in the active state after an activate command is issued to that portion.
- a portion (e.g. bank, etc.) of the DRAM circuit is said to be in the precharge state after a precharge command is issued to that portion.
- the entire DRAM circuit is said to be in the active state.
- a relative time period spent by the entire DRAM circuit in precharge state with respect to the time period spent by the entire DRAM circuit in active state during normal operation may be defined as the precharge-to-active ratio.
- DRAM circuits may also support a plurality of power management modes. Some of these modes may represent power saving modes. As an example, DDR2 SDRAMs may support four power saving modes. In particular, two active power down modes, precharge power down mode, and self-refresh mode may be supported, in one embodiment.
- a DRAM circuit may enter an active power down mode if the DRAM circuit is in the active state when it receives a power down command.
- a DRAM circuit may enter the precharge power down mode if the DRAM circuit is in the precharge state when it receives a power down command.
- a higher precharge-to-active ratio may increase the likelihood that a DRAM circuit may enter the precharge power down mode rather than an active power down mode when the DRAM circuit is the target of a power saving operation.
- the precharge power down mode and the self refresh mode may provide greater power savings than the active power down modes.
- the system may be operable to perform a power management operation on at least one of the memory circuits, and optionally on the interface circuit, based on the state of the at least one memory circuit.
- a power management operation may include, among others, a power saving operation.
- the term power saving operation may refer to any operation that results in at least some power savings.
- the power saving operation may include applying a power saving command to one or more memory circuits, and optionally to the interface circuit, based on at least one state of one or more memory circuits.
- Such power saving command may include, for example, initiating a power down operation applied to one or more memory circuits, and optionally to the interface circuit.
- Such state may depend on identification of the current, past or predictable future status of one or more memory circuits, a predetermined combination of commands to the one or more memory circuits, a predetermined pattern of commands to the one or more memory circuits, a predetermined absence of commands to the one or more memory circuits, any command(s) to the one or more memory circuits, and/or any command(s) to one or more memory circuits other than the one or more memory circuits.
- Such commands may have occurred in the past, might be occurring in the present, or may be predicted to occur in the future. Future commands may be predicted since the system (e.g. memory controller, etc.) may be aware of future accesses to the memory circuits in advance of the execution of the commands by the memory circuits.
- such current, past, or predictable future status may refer to any property of the memory circuit that may be monitored, stored, and/or predicted.
- the system may identify at least one of a plurality of memory circuits that may not be accessed for some period of time. Such status identification may involve determining whether a portion(s) (e.g. bank(s), etc.) is being accessed in at least one of the plurality of memory circuits.
- a portion(s) e.g. bank(s), etc.
- any other technique may be used that results in the identification of at least one of the memory circuits (or portion(s) thereof) that is not being accessed (e.g. ii a non-accessed state, etc.).
- other such states may be detected or identified and used for power management.
- a power saving operation may be initiated in association with the memory circuit (or portion(s) thereof) that is in the non-accessed state.

- the system may, in yet another embodiment, be operable to map the physical memory circuits to appear as at least one virtual memory circuit with at least one aspect that is different from that of the physical memory circuits, resulting in a first behavior of the virtual memory circuits that is different from a second behavior of the physical memory circuits.
- the interface circuit may be operable to aid or participate in the mapping of the physical memory circuits such that they appear as at least one virtual memory circuit.
- the physical memory circuits may be mapped to appear as at least one virtual memory circuit with at least one aspect that is different from that of the physical memory circuits, resulting in a first behavior of the at least one virtual memory circuits that is different from a second behavior of one or more of the physical memory circuits.
- Such behavior may, in one embodiment, include power behavior (e.g. a power consumption, current consumption, current waveform, any other aspect of power management or behavior, etc.).
- power behavior simulation may effect or result in a reduction or other modification of average power consumption, reduction or other modification of peak power consumption or other measure of power consumption, reduction or other modification of peak current consumption or other measure of current consumption, and/or modification of other power behavior (e.g. parameters, metrics, etc.).
- the at least one aspect that is altered by the simulation may be the precharge-to-active ratio of the physical memory circuits.
- the alteration of such a ratio may be fixed (e.g. constant, etc.) or may be variable (e.g. dynamic, etc.).
- a fixed alteration of this ratio may be accomplished by a simulation that results in physical memory circuits appearing to have fewer portions (e.g. banks, etc.) that may be capable of performing operations in parallel.
- a physical 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit with eight physical banks may be mapped to a virtual 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit with two virtual banks, by coalescing or combining four physical banks into one virtual bank.
- Such a simulation may increase the precharge-to-active ratio of the virtual memory circuit since the virtual memory circuit now has fewer portions (e.g. banks, etc.) that may be in use (e.g. in an active state, etc.) at any given time.
- a physical 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit with eight physical banks may have a probability, g, that all eight physical banks are in the precharge state at any given time.
- the virtual DDR2 SDRAM circuit may have a probability, h, that both the virtual banks are in the precharge state at any given time. Under normal operating conditions of the system, h may be greater than g.
- a power saving operation directed at the aforementioned virtual 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit may have a higher likelihood of placing the DDR2 SDRAM circuit in a precharge power down mode as compared to a similar power saving operation directed at the aforementioned physical 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit.
- a virtual memory circuit with fewer portions (e.g. banks, etc.) than a physical memory circuit with equivalent capacity may not be compatible with certain industry standards (e.g. JEDEC standards).
- JEDEC standards e.g. JEDEC standards
- the JEDEC Standard No. JESD 21-C for DDR2 SDRAM specifies a 1 Gb DRAM circuit with eight banks.
- a 1 Gb virtual DRAM circuit with two virtual banks may not be compliant with the JEDEC standard.
- a plurality of physical memory circuits, each having a first number of physical portions e.g.
- each physical memory circuit that is part of the at least one virtual memory circuit has a second number of portions (e.g. banks, etc.) that may be capable of performing operations in parallel, wherein the second number of portions is different from the first number of portions.
- four physical 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuits (each with eight physical banks) may be mapped to a single virtual 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit with eight virtual banks, wherein the eight physical banks in each physical 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit have been coalesced or combined into two virtual banks.
- four physical 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuits may be mapped to two virtual 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuits, each with eight virtual banks, wherein the eight physical banks in each physical 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit have been coalesced or combined into four virtual banks.
- the interface circuit may be operable to aid the system in the mapping of the physical memory circuits.
- FIG. 31 shows an example of four physical 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuits 3102 A-D that are mapped by the system 3106 , and optionally with the aid or participation of interface circuit 3104 , to appear as a virtual 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit 3108 .
- Each physical DRAM circuit 3102 A-D containing eight physical banks 3120 has been mapped to two virtual banks 3130 of the virtual 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit 3108 .
- the simulation or mapping results in the memory circuits having fewer portions (e.g. banks etc.) that may be capable of performing operations in parallel.
- this simulation may be done by mapping (e.g. coalescing or combining) a first number of physical portion(s) (e.g. banks, etc.) into a second number of virtual portion(s). If the second number is less than the first number, a memory circuit may have fewer portions that may be in use at any given time. Thus, there may be a higher likelihood that a power saving operation targeted at such a memory circuit may result in that particular memory circuit consuming less power.
- a variable change in the precharge-to-active ratio may be accomplished by a simulation that results in the at least one virtual memory circuit having at least one latency that is different from that of the physical memory circuits.
- a physical 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit with eight banks may be mapped by the system, and optionally the interface circuit, to appear as a virtual 1 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit with eight virtual banks having at least one latency that is different from that of the physical DRAM circuits.
- the latency may include one or more timing parameters such as tFAW, tRRD, tRP, tRCD, tRFC(MIN), etc.
- tFAW is the 4-Bank activate period
- tRRD is the ACTIVE bank a to ACTIVE bank b command timing parameter
- tRP is the PRECHARGE command period
- tRCD is the ACTIVE-to-READ or WRITE delay
- tRFC(min) is the minimum value of the REFRESH to ACTIVE or REFRESH to REFRESH command interval.
- these and other DRAM timing parameters are defined in the JEDEC specifications (for example JESD 21-C for DDR2 SDRAM and updates, corrections and errata available at the JEDEC website) as well as the DRAM manufacturer datasheets (for example the MICRON datasheet for 1 Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM, example part number MT47H256M4, labeled PDF: 09005aef821ae8bf/Source: 09005aef821aed36, 1 GbDDR2TOC.fm-Rev. K 9/06 EN, and available at the MICRON website).
- JEDEC specifications for example JESD 21-C for DDR2 SDRAM and updates, corrections and errata available at the JEDEC website
- DRAM manufacturer datasheets for example the MICRON datasheet for 1 Gb: x4, x8, x16 DDR2 SDRAM, example part number MT47H256M4, labeled PDF: 09005aef82
- the virtual DRAM circuit may be simulated to have a tRP(virtual) that is greater than the tRP(physical) of the physical DRAM circuit. Such a simulation may thus increase the minimum latency between a precharge command and a subsequent activate command to a portion (e.g. bank, etc.) of the virtual DRAM circuit.
- the virtual DRAM circuit may be simulated to have a tRRD(virtual) that is greater than the tRRD(physical) of the physical DRAM circuit.
- Such a simulation may thus increase the minimum latency between successive activate commands to various portions (e.g. banks, etc.) of the virtual DRAM circuit.
- Such simulations may increase the precharge-to-active ratio of the memory circuit.
- the system may optionally change the values of one or more latencies of the at least one virtual memory circuit in response to present, past, or future commands to the memory circuits, the temperature of the memory circuits, etc. That is, the at least one aspect of the virtual memory circuit may be changed dynamically.
- Some memory buses may allow the use of 1T or 2T address timing (also known as 1T or 2T address clocking).
- 1T or 2T address timing also known as 1T or 2T address clocking.
- the MICRON technical note TN-47-01, DDR2 DESIGN GUIDE FOR TWO-DIMM SYSTEMS (available at the MICRON website) explains the meaning and use of 1T and 2T address timing as follows: “Further, the address bus can be clocked using 1T or 2T clocking. With 1T, a new command can be issued on every clock cycle. 2T timing will hold the address and command bus valid for two clock cycles. This reduces the efficiency of the bus to one command per two clocks, but it doubles the amount of setup and hold time. The data bus remains the same for all of the variations in the address bus.”
- the system may change the precharge-to-active ratio of the virtual memory circuit by changing from 1T address timing to 2T address timing when sending addresses and control signals to the interface circuit and/or the memory circuits. Since 2T address timing affects the latency between successive commands to the memory circuits, the precharge-to-active ratio of a memory circuit may be changed. Strictly as an option, the system may dynamically change between 1T and 2T address timing.
- the system may communicate a first number of power management signals to the interface circuit to control the power behavior.
- the interface circuit may communicate a second number of power management signals to at least a portion of the memory circuits.
- the second number of power management signals may be the same of different from the first number of power management signals.
- the second number of power management signals may be utilized to perform power management of the portion(s) of the virtual or physical memory circuits in a manner that is independent from each other and/or independent from the first number of power management signals received from the system (which may or may not also be utilized in a manner that is independent from each other).
- the system may provide power management signals directly to the memory circuits.
- such power management signal(s) may refer to any control signal (e.g. one or more address signals; one or more data signals; a combination of one or more control signals; a sequence of one or more control signals; a signal associated with an activate (or active) operation, precharge operation, write operation, read operation, a mode register write operation, a mode register read operation, a refresh operation, or other encoded or direct operation, command or control signal, etc.).
- the operation associated with a command may consist of the command itself and optionally, one or more necessary signals and/or behavior.
- the power management signals received from the system may be individual signals supplied to a DIMM.
- the power management signals may include, for example, CKE and CS signals.
- power management signals may also be used in conjunction and/or combination with each other, and optionally, with other signals and commands that are encoded using other signals (e.g. RAS, CAS, WE, address etc.) for example.
- the JEDEC standards may describe how commands directed to memory circuits are to be encoded.
- the power management signals may take several forms. In some of these forms, the power management signals may be encoded, located, placed, or multiplexed in various existing fields (e.g. data field, address field, etc.), signals (e.g. CKE signal, CS signal, etc.), and/or busses.
- a signal may be a single wire; that is a single electrical point-to-point connection.
- the signal is un-encoded and not bussed, multiplexed, or encoded.
- a command directed to a memory circuit may be encoded, for example, in an address signal, by setting a predefined number of bits in a predefined location (or field) on the address bus to a specific combination that uniquely identifies that command.
- the command is said to be encoded on the address bus and located or placed in a certain position, location, or field.
- multiple bits of information may be placed on multiple wires that form a bus.
- a signal that requires the transfer of two or more bits of information may be time-multiplexed onto a single wire.
- the time-multiplexed sequence of 10 (a one followed by a zero) may be made equivalent to two individual signals: a one and a zero.
- Such examples of time-multiplexing are another form of encoding.
- Such various well-known methods of signaling, encoding (or lack thereof), bussing, and multiplexing, etc. may be used in isolation or combination.
- the power management signals from the system may occupy currently unused connection pins on a DIMM (unused pins may be specified by the JEDEC standards).
- the power management signals may use existing CKE and CS pins on a DIMM, according to the JEDEC standard, along with additional CKE and CS pins to enable, for example, power management of DIMM capacities that may not yet be currently defined by the JEDEC standards.
- the power management signals from the system may be encoded in the CKE and CS signals.
- the CKE signal may be a bus, and the power management signals may be encoded on that bus.
- a 3-bit wide bus comprising three signals on three separate wires: CKE[ 0 ], CKE[ 1 ], and CKE[ 2 ], may be decoded by the interface circuit to produce eight separate CKE signals that comprise the power management signals for the memory circuits.
- the power management signals from the system may be encoded in unused portions of existing fields.
- certain commands may have portions of the fields set to X (also known as don't care).
- X also known as don't care
- the setting of such bit(s) to either a one or to a zero does not affect the command.
- the effectively unused bit position in this field may thus be used to carry a power management signal.
- the power management signal may thus be encoded and located or placed in a field in a bus, for example.
- the power management schemes described for the DRAM circuits may also be extended to the interface circuits.
- the system may have or may infer information that a signal, bus, or other connection will not be used for a period of time. During this period of time, the system may perform power management on the interface circuit or part(s) thereof.
- Such power management may, for example, use an intelligent signaling mechanism (e.g. encoded signals, sideband signals, etc.) between the system and interface circuits (e.g. register chips, buffer chips, AMB chips, etc.), and/or between interface circuits. These signals may be used to power manage (e.g.
- the interface circuits e.g. input receiver circuits, internal logic circuits, clock generation circuits, output driver circuits, termination circuits, etc.
- a plurality of memory circuits may be mapped using simulation to appear as at least one virtual memory circuit, wherein a first number of portions (e.g. banks, etc.) in each physical memory circuit may be coalesced or combined into a second number of virtual portions (e.g. banks, etc.), and the at least one virtual memory circuit may have at least one latency that is different from the corresponding latency of the physical memory circuits.
- the first and second number of portions may include any one or more portions.

- the buffer chip 3302 may be located in the middle of the stack of DRAM circuits 3306 A-D.
- the buffer chip 3302 may be located at the top of the stack of DRAM circuits 3306 A-D (e.g. the top-most device in the stack).
- the buffer chip 3302 may be located anywhere between the two extremities of the stack of DRAM circuits 3306 A-D.
- the electrical connections between the buffer chip 3302 and the stack of DRAM circuits 3306 A-D may be configured in any desired manner.

- the method 3380 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- first information is received in association with a first operation to be performed on at least one of a plurality of memory circuits (e.g. see the memory circuits 3204 A, 3204 B, 3204 N of FIG. 32 , etc.).

Similar to the first information, the second information may or may not be received coincidently with the second operation, and may include address information. Such second operation, however, may, in one embodiment, include a column operation.
- the second operation may be performed utilizing the stored portion of the first information in addition to the second information. See operation 3388 . More illustrative information will now be set forth regarding various optional features with which the foregoing method 3380 may or may not be implemented, per the desires of the user. Specifically, an example will be set for illustrating the manner in which the method 3380 may be employed for accommodating a buffer chip that is simulating at least one aspect of a plurality of memory circuits.
- the present example of the method 3380 of FIG. 33F will be set forth in the context of the various components (e.g. buffer chip 3302 , etc.) shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 33A-33E .
- the buffer chip 3302 may receive more address bits from the memory controller than are required by the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack. These extra address bits may be decoded by the buffer chip 3302 to individually select the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack, utilizing separate chip select signals to each of the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack.
- a stack of four x4 1 Gb DRAM circuits 3306 A-D behind a buffer chip 3302 may appear as a single x4 4 Gb DRAM circuit to the memory controller.
- the memory controller may provide sixteen row address bits and three bank address bits during a row (e.g. activate) operation, and provide eleven column address bits and three bank address bits during a column (e.g. read or write) operation.
- the individual DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack may require only fourteen row address bits and three bank address bits for a row operation, and eleven column address bits and three bank address bits during a column operation.
- the buffer chip 3302 may receive two address bits more than are needed by each DRAM circuit 3306 A-D in the stack.
- the buffer chip 3302 may therefore use the two extra address bits from the memory controller to select one of the four DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack.
- the buffer chip 3302 may receive the same number of address bits from the memory controller during a column operation as are needed by each DRAM circuit 3306 A-D in the stack.
- the buffer chip 3302 may be designed to store the two extra address bits provided during a row operation and use the two stored address bits to select the correct DRAM circuit 3306 A-D during the column operation.
- the mapping between a system address (e.g. address from the memory controller, including the chip select signal(s)) and a device address (e.g. the address, including the chip select signals, presented to the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack) may be performed by the buffer chip 3302 in various manners.
- a lower order system row address and bank address bits may be mapped directly to the device row address and bank address inputs.
- the most significant row address bit(s) and, optionally, the most significant bank address bit(s) may be decoded to generate the chip select signals for the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack during a row operation.
- the address bits used to generate the chip select signals during the row operation may also be stored in an internal lookup table by the buffer chip 3302 for one or more clock cycles.
- the system column address and bank address bits may be mapped directly to the device column address and bank address inputs, while the stored address bits may be decoded to generate the chip select signals.
- addresses may be mapped between four 512 Mb DRAM circuits 3306 A-D that simulate a single 2 Gb DRAM circuits utilizing the buffer chip 3302 .
- There may be 15 row address bits from the system 3304 , such that row address bits 0 through 13 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D.
- There may also be 3 bank address bits from the system 3304 , such that bank address bits 0 through 1 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D.
- the bank address bit 2 and the row address bit 14 may be decoded to generate the 4 chip select signals for each of the four DRAM circuits 3306 A-D.
- Row address bit 14 may be stored during the row operation using the bank address as the index.
- the stored row address bit 14 may again be used with bank address bit 2 to form the four DRAM chip select signals.
- addresses may be mapped between four 1 Gb DRAM circuits 3306 A-D that simulate a single 4 Gb DRAM circuits utilizing the buffer chip 3302 .
- There may be 16 row address bits from the system 3304 , such that row address bits 0 through 14 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D.
- There may also be 3 bank address bits from the system 3304 , such that bank address bits 0 through 3 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D.
- row address bits 14 and 15 may be decoded to generate the 4 chip select signals for each of the four DRAM circuits 3306 A-D. Row address bits 14 and 15 may also be stored during the row operation using the bank address as the index. During the column operation, the stored row address bits 14 and 15 may again be used to form the four DRAM chip select signals.
- this mapping technique may optionally be used to ensure that there are no unnecessary combinational logic circuits in the critical timing path between the address input pins and address output pins of the buffer chip 3302 .
- Such combinational logic circuits may instead be used to generate the individual chip select signals. This may therefore allow the capacitive loading on the address outputs of the buffer chip 3302 to be much higher than the loading on the individual chip select signal outputs of the buffer chip 3302 .
- the address mapping may be performed by the buffer chip 3302 using some of the bank address signals from the memory controller to generate the individual chip select signals.
- the buffer chip 3302 may store the higher order row address bits during a row operation using the bank address as the index, and then may use the stored address bits as part of the DRAM circuit bank address during a column operation.
- This address mapping technique may require an optional lookup table to be positioned in the critical timing path between the address inputs from the memory controller and the address outputs, to the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack.
- addresses may be mapped between four 512 Mb DRAM circuits 3306 A-D that simulate a single 2 Gb DRAM utilizing the buffer chip 3302 .
- There may be 15 row address bits from the system 3304 , where row address bits 0 through 13 are mapped directly to the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D.
- There may also be 3 bank address bits from the system 3304 , such that bank address bit 0 is used as a DRAM circuit bank address bit for the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D.
- row address bit 14 may be used as an additional DRAM circuit bank address bit.
- the bank address bits 1 and 2 from the system may be decoded to generate the 4 chip select signals for each of the four DRAM circuits 3306 A-D
- row address bit 14 may be stored during the row operation.
- the stored row address bit 14 may again be used along with the bank address bit 0 from the system to form the DRAM circuit bank address.
- the column address from the memory controller may be mapped directly as the column address to the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack. Specifically, this direct mapping may be performed since each of the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack, even if of the same width but different capacities (e.g. from 512 Mb to 4 Gb), may have the same page sizes.
- address A[ 10 ] may be used by the memory controller to enable or disable auto-precharge during a column operation. Therefore, the buffer chip 3302 may forward A[ 10 ] from the memory controller to the DRAM circuits 3306 A-D in the stack without any modifications during a column operation.
- the simulated DRAM circuit may be desirable to determine whether the simulated DRAM circuit behaves according to a desired DRAM standard or other design specification.
- a behavior of many DRAM circuits is specified by the JEDEC standards and it may be desirable, in some embodiments, to exactly simulate a particular JEDEC standard DRAM.
- the JEDEC standard defines control signals that a DRAM circuit must accept and the behavior of the DRAM circuit as a result of such control signals.
- the JEDEC specification for a DDR2 DRAM is known as JESD79-2B.
- the following algorithm may be used. Such algorithm checks, using a set of software verification tools for formal verification of logic, that protocol behavior of the simulated DRAM circuit is the same as a desired standard or other design specification. This formal verification is quite feasible because the DRAM protocol described in a DRAM standard is typically limited to a few control signals (e.g. approximately 15 control signals in the case of the JEDEC DDR2 specification, for example).
- Examples of the aforementioned software verification tools include MAGELLAN supplied by SYNOPSYS, or other software verification tools, such as INCISIVE supplied by CADENCE, verification tools supplied by JASPER, VERIX supplied by REAL INTENT, 0-IN supplied by MENTOR CORPORATION, and others. These software verification tools use written assertions that correspond to the rules established by the DRAM protocol and specification. These written assertions are further included in the code that forms the logic description for the buffer chip. By writing assertions that correspond to the desired behavior of the simulated DRAM circuit, a proof may be constructed that determines whether the desired design requirements are met. In this way, one may test various embodiments for compliance with a standard, multiple standards, or other design specification.
- an assertion may be written that no two DRAM control signals are allowed to be issued to an address, control and clock bus at the same time.
- the aforementioned algorithm may allow a designer to prove that the simulated DRAM circuit exactly meets the required standard or other design specification. If, for example, an address mapping that uses a common bus for data and a common bus for address results in a control and clock bus that does not meet a required specification, alternative designs for buffer chips with other bus arrangements or alternative designs for the interconnect between the buffer chips may be used and tested for compliance with the desired standard or other design specification.
- FIG. 34 shows a high capacity DIMM 3400 using buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 3402 , in accordance with still yet another embodiment.
- the high capacity DIMM 3400 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 32 and/or 33 A-F. Of course, however, the high capacity DIMM 3400 may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- a high capacity DIMM 3400 may be created utilizing buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 3402 .
- a DIMM 3400 may utilize a plurality of buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 3402 instead of individual DRAM circuits, thus increasing the capacity of the DIMM.
- the DIMM 3400 may include a register 3404 for address and operation control of each of the buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 3402 . It should be noted that any desired number of buffered stacks of DRAM circuits 3402 may be utilized in conjunction with the DIMM 3400 . Therefore, the configuration of the DIMM 3400 , as shown, should not be construed as limiting in any way.
- the register 3404 may be substituted with an AMB (not shown), in the context of an FB-DIMM.
- FIG. 35 shows a timing design 3500 of a buffer chip that makes a buffered stack of DRAM circuits mimic longer CAS latency DRAM to a memory controller, in accordance with another embodiment.
- the design of the buffer chip may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 32-34 .
- die design of the buffer chip may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- any delay through a buffer chip may be made transparent to a memory controller of a host system (e.g. see the host system 3304 of FIGS. 33A-E , etc.) utilizing the buffer chip.
- the buffer chip may buffer a stack of DRAM circuits such that the buffered stack of DRAM circuits appears as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with higher CAS latency.
- Such delay may be a result of the buffer chip being located electrically between the memory bus of the host system and the stacked DRAM circuits, since most or all of the signals that connect the memory bus to the DRAM circuits pass through the buffer chip. A finite amount of time may therefore be needed for these signals to traverse through the buffer chip.
- industry standard protocols for memory e.g. (DDR SDRAM), DDR2 SDRAM, etc.
- DDR SDRAM register chips and advanced memory buffers
- Industry standard protocols for memory e.g. (DDR SDRAM), DDR2 SDRAM, etc.
- Such industry standard protocols define the properties of a register chip and AMB but not the properties of the buffer chip 3302 , etc. Thus, the signal delay through the buffer chip may violate the specifications of industry standard protocols.
- the buffer chip may provide a one-half clock cycle delay between the buffer chip receiving address and control signals from the memory controller (or optionally from a register chip, an AMB, etc.) and the address and control signals being valid at the inputs of the stacked DRAM circuits.
- the data signals may also have a one-half clock cycle delay in traversing the buffer chip, either from the memory controller to the DRAM circuits or from the DRAM circuits to the memory controller.
- the one-half clock cycle delay set forth above is set forth for illustrative purposes only and thus should not be construed as limiting in any manner whatsoever.
- a one clock cycle delay, a multiple clock cycle delay (or fraction thereof), and/or any other delay amount is incorporated, for that matter.
- the aforementioned delay may be coordinated among multiple signals such that different signals are subject to time-shifting with different relative directions/magnitudes, in an organized fashion.
- the cumulative delay through the buffer chip (e.g. the sum of a first delay 3502 of the address and control signals through the buffer chip and a second delay 3504 of the data signals through the buffer chip) is j clock cycles.
- the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear to the memory controller as one or more larger DRAM circuits with a CAS latency 3508 of i+j clocks, where i is the native CAS latency of the DRAM circuits.
- the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear to the memory controller as one or more larger DRAM circuits with a CAS latency of 5 (i.e. 4+1).
- the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear as one or more larger DRAM circuits with a CAS latency of 6 (i.e. 4+2).
- FIG. 36 shows the write data timing 3600 expected by a DRAM circuit in a buffered stack, in accordance with yet another embodiment.
- the write data timing 3600 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 32-35 . Of course, however, the write data timing 3600 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- Designing a buffer chip (e.g. see the buffer chip 3302 of FIGS. 33A-E , etc.) so that a buffered stack appears as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with higher CAS latency may, in some embodiments, create a problem with the timing of write operations.
- the DDR2 SDRAM protocol may specify that the write CAS latency is one less than the read CAS latency. Therefore, since the buffered stack appears as a DDR2 SDRAM with a read CAS latency of 6, the memory controller may use a write CAS latency of 5 (see 3602 ) when scheduling a write operation to the buffered stack.
- the DRAM circuits may require a write CAS latency of 3 (see 3604 ).
- the write data from the memory controller may arrive at the buffer chip later than when the DRAM circuits require the data.
- the buffer chip may delay such write operations to alleviate any of such timing problems. Such delay in write operations will be described in more detail with respect to FIG. 37 below.
- FIG. 37 shows write operations 3700 delayed by a buffer chip, in accordance with still yet another embodiment.
- the write operations 3700 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 32-36 .
- the write operations 3700 may be used in any desired environment.
- the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- a buffer chip may provide an additional delay, over and beyond the delay of the address and control signals through the buffer chip, between receiving the write operation and address from the memory controller (and/or optionally from a register and/or AMB, etc.), and sending it to the DRAM circuits in the stack.
- the additional delay may be equal to j clocks, where j is the cumulative delay of the address and control signals through the buffer chip and the delay of the data signals through the buffer chip.
- the write address and operation may be delayed by a register chip on a DIMM, by an AMB, or by the memory controller.
- FIG. 38 shows early write data 3800 from an AMB, in accordance with another embodiment.
- the early write data 3800 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 32-36 .
- the early write data 3800 may be used in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- an AMB on an FB-DIMM may be designed to send write data earlier to buffered stacks instead of delaying the write address and operation, as described in reference to FIG. 37 .
- an early write latency 3802 may be utilized to send the write data to the buffered stack.
- correct timing of the write operation at the inputs of the DRAM circuits in the stack may be ensured.
- a buffer chip (e.g. see the buffer chip 3302 of FIGS. 33A-E , etc.) may have a cumulative latency of 2, in which case, the AMB may send the write data 2 clock cycles earlier to the buffered stack. It should be noted that this scheme may not be possible in the case of registered DIMMs since the memory controller sends the write data directly to the buffered stacks. As an option, a memory controller may be designed to send write data earlier so that write operations have the correct timing at the input of the DRAM circuits in the stack without requiring the buffer chip to delay the write address and operation.
- FIG. 39 shows address bus conflicts 3900 caused by delayed write operations, in accordance with yet another embodiment.
- the delaying of the write addresses and operations may be performed by a buffer chip, or optionally a register, AMB, etc., in a manner that is completely transparent to the memory controller of a host system.
- the memory controller since the memory controller is unaware of this delay, it may schedule subsequent operations, such as for example activate or precharge operations, which may collide with the delayed writes on the address bus from the buffer chip to the DRAM circuits in the stack.
- an activate operation 3902 may interfere with a write operation 3904 that has been delayed.
- a delay of activate operations may be employed, as will be described in further detail with respect to FIG. 40 .
- FIGS. 40A-B show variable delays 4000 and 4050 of operations through a buffer chip, in accordance with another embodiment.
- the variable delays 4000 and 4050 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 32-39 .
- the variable delays 4000 and 4050 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- a buffer chip may delay the precharge/activate operations 4052 A-C/ 4002 A-C.
- the buffer chip may make the buffered stack appear as one or more larger capacity DRAM circuits that have longer tRCD (RAS to CAS delay) and tRP (i.e. precharge time) parameters.
- the buffered stack may appear as one or more larger capacity DRAM circuits with a read CAS latency of 6 clock cycles to the memory controller.
- the buffered stack may appear as one or more larger capacity DRAM circuits with tRCD of 6 clock cycles and tRP of 6 clock cycles in order to allow a buffer chip (e.g., see the butter chip 3302 of FIGS.
- the memory controller may schedule a column operation to a bank 6 clock cycles after an activate (e.g. row) operation to the same bank.
- the DRAM circuits in the stack may actually have a tRCD of 4 clock cycles.
- the buffer chip may have the ability to delay the activate operation by up to 2 clock cycles in order to avoid any conflicts on the address bus between the buffer chip and the DRAM circuits in the stack while still ensuring correct read and write timing on the channel between the memory controller and the buffered stack.
- the buffer chip may issue the activate operation to the DRAM circuits one, two, or three clock cycles after it receives the activate operation from the memory controller, register, or AMB.
- the actual delay of the activate operation through the buffer chip may depend on the presence or absence of other DRAM operations that may conflict with the activate operation, and may optionally change from one activate operation to another.
- the buffered stack may appear to the memory controller as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit with a tRP of 6 clock cycles, the memory controller may schedule a subsequent activate (e.g. row) operation to a bank a minimum of 6 clock cycles after issuing a precharge operation to that bank.
- the buffer chip may have the ability to delay issuing the precharge operation to the DRAM circuits in the stack by up to 2 clock cycles in order to avoid any conflicts on the address bus between the buffer chip and the DRAM circuits in the stack.
- the buffer chip may still delay issuing a precharge operation in order to satisfy the tRAS requirement of the DRAM circuits.
- the precharge operation to the same bank may be delayed by the buffer chip to satisfy the tRAS requirement of the DRAM circuits.
- the buffer chip may issue the precharge operation to the DRAM circuits one, two, or three clock cycles after it receives the precharge operation from the memory controller, register, or AMB.
- the actual delay of the precharge operation through the buffer chip may depend on the presence or absence of address bus conflicts or tRAS violations, and may change from one precharge operation to another.
- FIG. 41 shows a buffered stack 4100 of four 512 Mb DRAM circuits mapped to a single 2 Gb DRAM circuit, in accordance with yet another embodiment.
- the buffered stack 4100 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of FIGS. 32-40 . Of course, however, the buffered stack 4100 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- the multiple DRAM circuits 4102 A-D buffered in the stack by the buffer chip 4104 may appear as at least one larger capacity DRAM circuit to the memory controller.
- the combined power dissipation of such DRAM circuits 4102 A-D may be much higher than the power dissipation of a monolithic DRAM of the same capacity.
- the buffered stack may consist of four 512 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits that appear to the memory controller as a single 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit.
- the power dissipation of all four DRAM circuits 4102 A-D in the stack may be much higher than the power dissipation of a monolithic 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM.
- a DIMM containing multiple buffered stacks may dissipate much more power than a standard DIMM built using monolithic DRAM circuits. This increased power dissipation may limit the widespread adoption of DIMMs that use buffered stacks.
- the DRAM circuits 4102 A-D may be opportunistically placed in a precharge power down mode using the clock enable (CKE) pin of the DRAM circuits 4102 A-D.
- CKE clock enable
- a single rank registered DIMM R-DIMM
- a 2 Gb DDR2 SDRAM may generally have eight banks as specified by JEDEC. Therefore, the buffer chip 4104 may map each 512 Mb DRAM circuit in the stack to two banks of the equivalent 2 Gb DRAM, as shown.
- the memory controller of the host system may open and close pages in the banks of the DRAM circuits 4102 A-D based on the memory requests it receives from the rest of the system.
- no more than one page may be able to be open in a bank at any given time.
- a DRAM circuit 4102 A-D since each DRAM circuit 4102 A-D in the stack is mapped to two banks of the equivalent larger DRAM, at any given time a DRAM circuit 4102 A-D may have two open pages, one open page, or no open pages.
- the power management scheme may place that DRAM circuit 4102 A-D in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input.
- the CKE inputs of the DRAM circuits 4102 A-D in a stack may be controlled by the buffer chip 4104 , by a chip on an R-DIMM, by an AMB on a FB-DIMM, or by the memory controller in order to implement the power management scheme described hereinabove.
- this power management scheme may be particularly efficient when the memory controller implements a closed page policy.
- Another optional power management scheme may include mapping a plurality of DRAM circuits to a single bank of the larger capacity DRAM seen by the memory controller. For example, a buffered stack of sixteen x4 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits may appear to the memory controller as a single x4 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit. Since a 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit is specified by JEDEC to have eight banks, each bank of the 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit may be 512 Mb. Thus, two of the 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits may be mapped by the buffer chip 4104 to a single bank of the equivalent 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit seen by the memory controller.
- bank 0 of the 4 Gb DDR2 SDRAM circuit may be mapped by the buffer chip to two 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits (e.g. DRAM A and DRAM B) in the stack.
- DRAM A and DRAM B 256 Mb DDR2 SDRAM circuits
- DRAM B may be placed in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input.
- DRAM A may be placed in the precharge power down mode by de-asserting its CKE input.
- This technique may ensure that if p DRAM circuits are mapped to a bank of the larger capacity DRAM circuit seen by the memory controller, then p ⁇ 1 of the p DRAM circuits may continuously (e.g. always, etc.) be subjected to a power saving operation.
- the power saving operation may, for example, comprise operating in precharge power down mode except when refresh is required.
- power-savings may also occur in other embodiments without such continuity.
- FIG. 42 illustrates a method 4200 for refreshing a plurality of memory circuits, in accordance with still yet another embodiment.
- the method 4200 may be implemented in the context of the architecture and environment of any one or more of FIGS. 32-41 .
- the method 4200 may be carried out by the interface circuit 3202 of FIG. 32 .
- the method 4200 may be carried out in any desired environment. It should also be noted that the aforementioned definitions may apply during the present description.
- a refresh control signal is received in operation 4202 .
- such refresh control signal may, for example, be received from a memory controller, where such memory controller intends to refresh a simulated memory circuit(s).
- a plurality of refresh control signals are sent to a plurality of the memory circuits (e.g. see the memory circuits 3204 A, 3204 B, 3204 N of FIG. 32 , etc.), at different times. See operation 4204 .
- Such refresh control signals may or may not each include the refresh control signal of operation 4202 or an instantiation/copy thereof.
- the refresh control signals may each include refresh control signals that are different in at least one aspect (e.g. format, content, etc.).
- At least one first refresh control signal may be sent to a first subset (e.g. of one or more) of the memory circuits at a first time and at least one second refresh control signal may be sent to a second subset (e.g. of one or more) of the memory circuits at a second time.
- a single refresh control signal may be sent to a plurality of the memory circuits (e.g. a group of memory circuits, etc.).
- a plurality of the refresh control signals may be sent to a plurality of the memory circuits.
- refresh control signals may be sent individually or to groups of memory circuits, as desired.
- the refresh control signals may be sent after a delay in accordance with a particular timing.
- the timing in which the refresh control signals are sent to the memory circuits may be selected to minimize a current draw. This may be accomplished in various embodiments by staggering a plurality of refresh control signals.
- the timing in which the refresh control signals are sent to the memory circuits may be selected to comply with a tRFC parameter associated with each of the memory circuits.
- DRAM circuits of any desired size may receive periodic refresh operations to maintain the integrity of data therein.
- a memory controller may initiate refresh operations by issuing refresh control signals to the DRAM circuits with sufficient frequency to prevent any loss of data in the DRAM circuits.
- a refresh control signal is issued to a DRAM circuit, a minimum time (e.g. denoted by tRFC) may be required to elapse before another control signal may be issued to that DRAM circuit.
- the tRFC parameter may therefore increase as the size of the DRAM circuit increases.
- the buffer chip When the buffer chip receives a refresh control signal from the memory controller, it may refresh the smaller DRAM circuits within the span of time specified by the tRFC associated with the emulated DRAM circuit. Since the tRFC of the emulated DRAM circuits is larger than that of the smaller DRAM circuits, it may not be necessary to issue refresh control signals to all of the smaller DRAM circuits simultaneously. Refresh control signals may be issued separately to individual DRAM circuits or may be issued to groups of DRAM circuits, provided that the tRFC requirement of the smaller DRAM circuits is satisfied by the time the tRFC of the emulated DRAM circuits has elapsed. In use, the refreshes may be spaced to minimize the peak current draw of the combination buffer chip and DRAM circuit set during a refresh operation.
