- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system for providing content to a user device.
- FIG. 3 is a diagram of an example process for providing content to a user device.
- FIGS. 4A and 4B are flowcharts of an example processes for providing content to a user device.
- FIG. 5 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- a browser setting may be configured to block third party cookies. That is, a browser may be configured to not allow a cookie from a party other than an originating publisher in association with a request for an internet resource. For example, when a publisher page is rendered in the browser, the publisher page can be viewed as a first party and a cookie associated with the first party may be allowed to be stored on the requesting device.
- a content serving system that provides additional content for inclusion on a publisher resource (such as an advertisement for presentation in a slot on a publisher page) may be viewed as a third party.
- third party cookies can be blocked, such as by designating a preference in association with a conventional browser.
- An innovative method and device are disclosed that enables third party content providers, such as the content serving system, to recognize user devices and deliver customized content on publisher resources (e.g., pages) using cookies that are first party cookies with respect to the content serving system.
- the methods and devices can be used in association with browsers that have been configured to block third party cookies.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed.
- a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content to a user device.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 , publishers 109 (including a first publisher 109 a and a second publisher 109 b ), a content management system 110 , and a search system 113 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , content sponsors 108 , and publishers 109 .
- the content management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the content sponsors 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content sponsors are possible.
- a content sponsor 108 can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns.
- the account management user interfaces can be made available to the content sponsor 108 , for example, either through an online interface provided by the content management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally or remotely in association with a content sponsor's client device.
- a content sponsor 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters which define a content campaign.
- the content campaign can be created and activated for the content sponsor 108 according to the parameters specified by the content sponsor 108 .
- Campaign parameters can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria.
- Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and one or more selection terms.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, applications, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, videos, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).
- Resources can be provided by the publishers 109 , for example.
- a content sponsor 108 can act as a content publisher and can be associated with a website 104 , and with one or more resources 105 (e.g., web pages, applications, other resources).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, tablet computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), televisions, set top boxes, personal digital assistants and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the web browser can interact with various types of web applications, such as a game, a map application, or an e-mail application, to name a few examples.
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- User devices 106 can also submit search queries to the search system 113 over the network 102 .
- the search system 113 can, for example, access an indexed cache 114 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query.
- the search system 113 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result is data generated by the search system 113 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query, and can include a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page.
- a search result or a resource 105 can be sent responsive to a request received from a user device 106 .
- the search result or resource 105 can be sent with a request for the web browser of the user device 106 to set a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookie.
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- a cookie can represent, for example, a particular user device 106 and/or a particular web browser.
- the search system 113 can include a server that replies to a search query by sending a search result in an HTTP response.
- Such an HTTP response can include instructions (e.g., a set cookie instruction) requesting the browser to store a cookie for the site hosted by the server.
- each cookie can include content which specifies an initialization time that indicates a time at which the cookie was initially set on the particular user device 106 . If the browser supports cookies and cookies are enabled, subsequent page requests to the same server can include the cookie for that server. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, the use of cookies can allow an external service, such as the search system 113 , the content management system 110 , or other system, to track particular actions and status of a user over multiple sessions.
- the cookie can store a variety of data, and in some implementations, a unique or semi-unique identifier. In some implementations, the identifier can be anonymized so that the privacy of users is protected.
- semi-unique identifiers are associated with users, but actual identifying information of the users is not stored in a cookie. Additionally, in some implementations any identified user interactions can be generalized rather than associated with a particular user. Encryption and obfuscation techniques can also be used to protect the privacy of users.
- the data representing the resource 105 or the search results can also include data specifying a portion of the resource 105 or search results or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented.
- a portion of the resource 105 or search results or a portion of a user display e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page
- other content e.g., advertisements
- These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots or impressions.
- An example slot is an advertisement slot.
- Content for inclusion in a slot can be provided by a third party that is not associated with an underlying requested resource.
- the content management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with the resource 105 or search results.
- the request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots or impressions that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to the resource 105 or search results for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- keywords associated with a requested resource 105 or a search query for which search results are requested can also be provided to the content management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to the resource 105 or search query.
- An identifier e.g., cookie associated with the user device 106 can be received with the request for content.
- the content management system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request.
- One or more selected content items 114 can be provided to the user device 106 in association with providing an associated resource 105 or search results.
- the provided content item(s) can be presented on the user device 106 , in one or more respective slots.
- the content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction.
- content sponsors 108 can provide bids specifying amounts that the content sponsors 108 are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items.
- an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated to content sponsors 108 according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item.
- the slot can be allocated to the content sponsor 108 that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure).
- the slots can be allocated to a set of bidders that provided the highest bids or have the highest auction scores.
- a browser executing on a user device 106 may be configured to block third party cookies.
- a third party can be distinguished, for example, from a first party.
- the publisher 109 e.g., a domain associated with the publisher 109
- the resource 105 can include one or more content slots and each of the content slots can be configured to include instructions which request content for a respective content slot from the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can be considered as a third party in this example.
- a method is proposed, which is described in detail below, that enables the content management system 110 to deliver customized content to be included in the content slot(s) included in the resource 105 associated with the publisher 109 , using cookies that are first party cookies with respect to the content management system 110 .
- the method which involves encrypted publisher cookies, can be used with browsers that have been configured to block third party cookies.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system 200 for providing content to a user device 202 .
- a “NewsX.com” publisher page 204 associated with a publisher 206 is rendered in a browser running on the user device 202 .
- the publisher page 204 includes in this example one or more content slots, such as including a content slot 208 .
- the content slot 208 can include or be associated with a script which, when executed, causes the browser to send a request to a content server 210 for content to present in the content slot 208 .
- the script can, when executed, cause the browser to identify and include an encrypted publisher cookie with the request for content that is sent to the content management system 110 (e.g., for identifying content for inclusion in the content slot 208 ).
- the publisher 206 can, when providing the publisher page 204 , drop a publisher cookie 212 associated with the publisher 206 into a cookie space 214 of the browser.
- the publisher cookie 212 can include an identifier that is unique to the browser and can be associated with a domain associated with the publisher 206 .
- the publisher cookie 212 can include content which specifies an initialization time that indicates a time at which the publisher cookie 212 was initially set on the user device 202 . Subsequent page requests from the user device 202 to the publisher 206 can include the publisher cookie 212 .
- the publisher cookie 212 can allow the publisher 206 to track particular actions and status of a user over multiple sessions.
- the publisher cookie 212 can store a variety of data, such as past session data.
- the publisher 206 can generate an encrypted publisher cookie that is based on the publisher cookie 212 .
- the encrypted publisher cookie that is based on the publisher cookie 212 can be generated, for example, using a SHA512 hash function with the publisher cookie 212 as an input parameter. Other hash function or encryption techniques can be used.
- the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 can be included in the request sent by the browser to the content server 210 for content to be included in the content slot 208 .
- the content server 210 can receive the request for content for the content slot 208 from the browser running on the user device 202 .
- the content server 210 selects a content item for the content slot 208 , such as based at least in part on the content of the publisher page 204 .
- the content server 210 provides the selected content item to the browser, for presentation in the content slot 208 , as illustrated by a content item 216 (e.g., “content item A”).
- the content server 210 can configure the content item 216 to be associated with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 .
- the content item 216 can be configured to include a script which is executed in response to a user interaction with (e.g., selection of) the content item 216 and which requests the browser to execute a navigation request to navigate to a website associated with the content server 210 (e.g., the website can have a same domain as a domain associated with the content server 210 ).
- the navigation request which can be, e.g., a URL, can include the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 .
- the content server 210 can receive the navigation request from the browser, the navigation request including an indication of the user interaction with the content item 216 and the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 .
- the content server 210 can create a content server cookie (e.g., a cookie with a same domain as a domain of the content server 210 ) that will be treated as a first party cookie by the browser (since the browser issued the navigation request).
- the content server cookie can be included in a response sent to the browser that is responsive to the navigation request sent by the browser to the content server 210 .
- the response can include an instruction to the browser to drop the content server cookie as a content server cookie 218 in the cookie space 214 of the browser.
- the browser can accept and perform the drop cookie instruction, even when the browser has blocked third party cookies, because the content server cookie 218 is a first party cookie (e.g., the browser is associated with the domain of the content server 210 due to the navigation request sent by the browser to the content server 210 ).
- the response sent by the content server 210 to the browser can include a redirect request to cause the browser to load, for example, a landing page associated with the content item 216 .
- the content server 210 in response to receiving the navigation request from the browser, can link the generated content server cookie with the received encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 .
- an entry 220 of a data structure 222 stored in a repository 224 can be made to include both the content server cookie (e.g., “cookie2”) and the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 (e.g., “epc-cookie1”).
- the entry 220 can include other information, such as an indication of the type of interaction that occurred with the content item 216 , an identifier for the content item 216 , a date and time at which the interaction occurred, location information indicating the location of the user device 202 at the time of the interaction, and other information.
- the other information can be used, for example, for selecting content in response to subsequent requests for content that are associated with the content server cookie.
- the user of the user device 202 may navigate to a publisher page 226 associated with a publisher 228 , causing the publisher page 226 to be presented in the browser.
- the publisher page 226 includes a content slot 230 .
- the content slot 230 can include a script which, when executed, causes the browser to send a request to the content server 210 for content to present in the content slot 230 .
- the script can, when executed, cause the browser to include an encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher 228 with the request for content for the content slot 230 .
- the publisher 228 can, when providing the publisher page 226 , drop a publisher cookie 232 associated with the publisher 228 into the cookie space 214 of the browser.
- the publisher 228 or a script associated with the publisher page 226 or the content slot 230 , can generate an encrypted publisher cookie that is based on the publisher cookie 232 .
- the encrypted publisher cookie that is based on the publisher cookie 232 can be generated similar to the encrypted publisher cookie discussed above.
- the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 can be included in the request sent by the browser to the content server 210 for content for the content slot 230 .
- the content server cookie 218 is automatically included by the browser in the request sent by the browser to the content server 210 for content for the content slot 230 .
- the content server cookie 212 includes information related to user interactions with the content item 216 or other content items provided by the content server 210 and/or information related to content items provided to the user device 202 by the content server 210 .
- the content server 210 can receive the request for content for the content slot 230 from the browser running on the user device 202 .
- the content server 210 can extract the content server cookie 218 and the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 from the request.
- the content server 210 can identify the entry 220 as being associated with the request (e.g., by querying the data structure 222 for entries that include the content server cookie 218 ).
- the content server 210 can evaluate the entry 220 and can select content for the content slot 230 based at least in part on the evaluating of the entry 220 . Evaluating the entry is discussed in greater detail below.
- Evaluating the entry 220 can include identifying data in one or more fields of the respective entry and using the identified data to assist in the selection of content to deliver in response to the received request.
- the content server 220 can identify the interaction indication and the identifier of the content item 216 in the entry 220 .
- the content server 210 can, for example, locate keywords or topics associated with the content item 216 and can select a content item for the content slot 230 based at least in part on the located keywords or topics associated with the content item 216 .
- the content server 210 can select a content item for the content slot 230 based on keywords or topics associated with the content item 216 because the user's prior interaction with the content item 216 may mean that the user may be interested in other content items which have similar keywords or topics as the content item 216 .
- the content server 210 provides the selected content item to the browser, for presentation in the content slot 230 , as illustrated by a content item 233 (e.g., “content item B”) responsive to the received request.
- the content server 210 can configure the content item 233 to be associated with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 , e.g., as described above for the content item 216 .
- the content item 233 can be configured to include a script which is executed in response to a user interaction with (e.g., selection of) the content item 233 and which requests the browser to execute a navigation request to navigate to a website associated with the content server 210 (e.g., the website can have a same domain as a domain associated with the content server 210 ).
- the navigation request which can be, e.g., a URL, can include the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 .
- the content server 210 can link the content server cookie 218 with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 .
- a mapping entry 234 can be added to the data structure 222 which includes the content server cookie 218 (e.g., “cookie2”) and the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 (e.g., “epc-cookie3”).
- the content server 210 can also link the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 .
- the two encrypted publisher cookies can be indirectly and/or directly linked in the data structure 222 , for example.
- the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 can be indirectly linked to the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 based on both the entries 220 and 234 including the content server cookie 218 . Accordingly, a search of the data structure 222 can locate all such entries that are “indirectly” linked. As another example, the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 can be directly linked to the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 by creating a single entry for inclusion (e.g., an entry 236 ) in the data structure 222 which includes the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 , the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 , and the content server cookie 218 .

Abstract
Description
- This specification relates to information presentation.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources. For example, video and/or audio files, as well as web pages for particular subjects or particular news articles, are accessible over the Internet. Access to these resources presents opportunities for other content (e.g., advertisements) to be provided with the resources. For example, a web page can include slots in which content can be presented. These slots can be defined in the web page or defined for presentation with a web page, for example, along with search results.
- Slots can be allocated to content sponsors through a reservation system or an auction. For example, content sponsors can provide bids specifying amounts that the sponsors are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content. In turn, a reservation can be made or an auction can be performed, and the slots can be allocated to sponsors according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of the sponsored content to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the sponsored content.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in methods that include a method for providing content to a user device. A method includes: receiving, from a browser in association with rendering a first publisher page, a first content request for filling a slot on the first publisher page, the request including an encrypted publisher cookie; providing content responsive to the received request including a content item and a parameter that is associated with the encrypted publisher cookie; upon receipt of an indication that a user interacted with the content item, creating a content serving system cookie that is unique to the browser and providing the content serving system cookie responsive to the receipt of the indication of the interaction with the content item; linking the received encrypted publisher cookie with the content serving system cookie, including storing an association between the encrypted publisher cookie and the content serving system cookie in a data structure; receiving from the browser a second, different request for content in association with rendering a second, different publisher page, the second, different request including an encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second different publisher page and the previously provided content serving system cookie; after receiving the second different request, linking the received encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second, different publisher page with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page in the data structure; and using the linkings to determine content to deliver to the browser.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in computer program products. A computer program product is tangibly embodied in a computer-readable storage device and comprises instructions. The instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: receive, from a browser in association with rendering a first publisher page, a first content request for filling a slot on the first publisher page, the request including an encrypted publisher cookie; provide content responsive to the received request including a content item and a parameter that is associated with the encrypted publisher cookie; upon receipt of an indication that a user interacted with the content item, create a content serving system cookie that is unique to the browser and providing the content serving system cookie responsive to the receipt of the indication of the interaction with the content item; link the received encrypted publisher cookie with the content serving system cookie, including storing an association between the encrypted publisher cookie and the content serving system cookie in a data structure; receive from the browser a second, different request for content in association with rendering a second, different publisher page, the second, different request including an encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second different publisher page and the previously provided content serving system cookie; after receiving the second different request, link the received encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second, different publisher page with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page in the data structure; and use the linkings to determine content to deliver to the browser.
- In general, another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in systems. A system includes one or more processors and one or more memory elements including instructions. The instructions, when executed, cause the one or more processors to: receive, from a browser in association with rendering a first publisher page, a first content request for filling a slot on the first publisher page, the request including an encrypted publisher cookie; provide content responsive to the received request including a content item and a parameter that is associated with the encrypted publisher cookie; upon receipt of an indication that a user interacted with the content item, create a content serving system cookie that is unique to the browser and providing the content serving system cookie responsive to the receipt of the indication of the interaction with the content item; link the received encrypted publisher cookie with the content serving system cookie, including storing an association between the encrypted publisher cookie and the content serving system cookie in a data structure; receive from the browser a second, different request for content in association with rendering a second, different publisher page, the second, different request including an encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second different publisher page and the previously provided content serving system cookie; after receiving the second different request, link the received encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second, different publisher page with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page in the data structure; and use the linkings to determine content to deliver to the browser.
- These and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features. The received encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page can be one way encrypted such that an underlying publisher cookie of the first publisher page is not discoverable from the received encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page. Creating the content serving system cookie can include creating a first party cookie associated with the content serving system. Providing the content serving system cookie can include delivering an advertisement that is configured to direct the browser back to the content serving system prior to continuing on to a landing page associated with the advertisement. Upon interaction by the user associated with the browser with the advertisement, the content serving system cookie can be provided to the browser. An encrypted publisher cookie associated with a third, different publisher page can be linked with the encrypted publisher cookies of the first and second, different publisher pages. The linked encrypted publisher cookies can be associated with different domains. The linkings can further include linking historical interaction data associated with user interactions with a respective publisher page with a respective encrypted publisher cookie of the respective publisher page.
- Using the linkings can include receiving a subsequent request for content in association with rendering one publisher page that is linked to another publisher page. The content serving system cookie and the encrypted publisher cookie of the linked publisher page can be received. Other information identifying other linked pages can be retrieved based on the linkings. The other information can include user interaction data associated with a respective linked publisher page. Using the linkings can include evaluating the interaction data, selecting content from inventory responsive to the subsequent request, and providing the selected content responsive to the subsequent request.
- Particular implementations may realize none, one or more of the following advantages. Customized content can be provided to a user device when a browser of the user device is configured to block third party cookies. A publisher can opt-in or opt-out of providing encrypted publisher cookies for use in content selection for content to be presented on publisher pages. A publisher cookie can be one-way encrypted so that the underlying cookie is not discoverable from the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher page.
- The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- A browser setting may be configured to block third party cookies. That is, a browser may be configured to not allow a cookie from a party other than an originating publisher in association with a request for an internet resource. For example, when a publisher page is rendered in the browser, the publisher page can be viewed as a first party and a cookie associated with the first party may be allowed to be stored on the requesting device. A content serving system that provides additional content for inclusion on a publisher resource (such as an advertisement for presentation in a slot on a publisher page) may be viewed as a third party. Traditionally, third party cookies can be blocked, such as by designating a preference in association with a conventional browser. An innovative method and device are disclosed that enables third party content providers, such as the content serving system, to recognize user devices and deliver customized content on publisher resources (e.g., pages) using cookies that are first party cookies with respect to the content serving system. The methods and devices can be used in association with browsers that have been configured to block third party cookies.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, demographics, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from a content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information about the user is collected and used by a content server.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 for providing content to a user device. Theexample environment 100 includes anetwork 102, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof. Thenetwork 102 connectswebsites 104,user devices 106,content sponsors 108, publishers 109 (including a first publisher 109 a and a second publisher 109 b), acontent management system 110, and asearch system 113. Theexample environment 100 may include many thousands ofwebsites 104,user devices 106,content sponsors 108, andpublishers 109. Thecontent management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content. Thecontent sponsors 108 can be, for example, advertisers. Other types of content sponsors are possible. - A
content sponsor 108 can create a content campaign associated with one or more content items using tools provided by thecontent management system 110. For example, thecontent management system 110 can provide one or more account management user interfaces for creating and managing content campaigns. The account management user interfaces can be made available to thecontent sponsor 108, for example, either through an online interface provided by thecontent management system 110 or as an account management software application installed and executed locally or remotely in association with a content sponsor's client device. - A
content sponsor 108 can, using the account management user interfaces, provide campaign parameters which define a content campaign. The content campaign can be created and activated for thecontent sponsor 108 according to the parameters specified by thecontent sponsor 108. Campaign parameters can include, for example, a campaign name, a preferred content network for placing content, a budget for the campaign, start and end dates for the campaign, a schedule for content placements, content (e.g., creatives), bids, and selection criteria. Selection criteria can include, for example, a language, one or more geographical locations or websites, and one or more selection terms. - A
website 104 includes one ormore resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers. Anexample website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts. Eachwebsite 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns thewebsite 104. - A
resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over thenetwork 102. Aresource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with theresource 105.Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, applications, and news feed sources, to name only a few. Theresources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, videos, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). Resources can be provided by thepublishers 109, for example. As another example, acontent sponsor 108 can act as a content publisher and can be associated with awebsite 104, and with one or more resources 105 (e.g., web pages, applications, other resources). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 105 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, tablet computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), televisions, set top boxes, personal digital assistants and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The web browser can interact with various types of web applications, such as a game, a map application, or an e-mail application, to name a few examples. - A
user device 106 can requestresources 105 from awebsite 104. In turn, data representing theresource 105 can be provided to theuser device 106 for presentation by theuser device 106.User devices 106 can also submit search queries to thesearch system 113 over thenetwork 102. In response to a search query, thesearch system 113 can, for example, access anindexed cache 114 to identifyresources 105 that are relevant to the search query. Thesearch system 113 identifies theresources 105 in the form of search results and returns the search results to theuser devices 106 in search results pages. A search result is data generated by thesearch system 113 that identifies aresource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query, and can include a link to theresource 105. An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page. - A search result or a
resource 105 can be sent responsive to a request received from auser device 106. The search result orresource 105 can be sent with a request for the web browser of theuser device 106 to set a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookie. A cookie can represent, for example, aparticular user device 106 and/or a particular web browser. For example, thesearch system 113 can include a server that replies to a search query by sending a search result in an HTTP response. Such an HTTP response can include instructions (e.g., a set cookie instruction) requesting the browser to store a cookie for the site hosted by the server. - In some implementations, each cookie can include content which specifies an initialization time that indicates a time at which the cookie was initially set on the
particular user device 106. If the browser supports cookies and cookies are enabled, subsequent page requests to the same server can include the cookie for that server. Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, the use of cookies can allow an external service, such as thesearch system 113, thecontent management system 110, or other system, to track particular actions and status of a user over multiple sessions. The cookie can store a variety of data, and in some implementations, a unique or semi-unique identifier. In some implementations, the identifier can be anonymized so that the privacy of users is protected. For example, in some implementations, semi-unique identifiers are associated with users, but actual identifying information of the users is not stored in a cookie. Additionally, in some implementations any identified user interactions can be generalized rather than associated with a particular user. Encryption and obfuscation techniques can also be used to protect the privacy of users. - The data representing the
resource 105 or the search results can also include data specifying a portion of theresource 105 or search results or a portion of a user display (e.g., a presentation location of a pop-up window or in a slot of a web page) in which other content (e.g., advertisements) can be presented. These specified portions of the resource or user display are referred to as slots or impressions. An example slot is an advertisement slot. Content for inclusion in a slot can be provided by a third party that is not associated with an underlying requested resource. - When a
resource 105 or search results are requested by auser device 106, thecontent management system 110 may receive a request for content to be provided with theresource 105 or search results. The request for content can include characteristics of one or more slots or impressions that are defined for the requestedresource 105 or search results. For example, a reference (e.g., URL) to theresource 105 or search results for which the slot is defined, a size of the slot, and/or media types that are available for presentation in the slot can be provided to thecontent management system 110. Similarly, keywords associated with a requestedresource 105 or a search query for which search results are requested can also be provided to thecontent management system 110 to facilitate identification of content that is relevant to theresource 105 or search query. An identifier (e.g., cookie) associated with theuser device 106 can be received with the request for content. - Based, for example, on data included in the request for content, the
content management system 110 can select content items that are eligible to be provided in response to the request. One or moreselected content items 114 can be provided to theuser device 106 in association with providing an associatedresource 105 or search results. The provided content item(s) can be presented on theuser device 106, in one or more respective slots. - In some implementations, the
content management system 110 can select content items based at least in part on results of an auction. For example, content sponsors 108 can provide bids specifying amounts that the content sponsors 108 are respectively willing to pay for presentation of their content items. In turn, an auction can be performed and the slots can be allocated tocontent sponsors 108 according, among other things, to their bids and/or the relevance of a content item to content presented on a page hosting the slot or a request that is received for the content item. For example, when a slot is being allocated in an auction, the slot can be allocated to thecontent sponsor 108 that provided the highest bid or a highest auction score (e.g., a score that is computed as a function of a bid and/or a quality measure). When multiple slots are allocated in a single auction, the slots can be allocated to a set of bidders that provided the highest bids or have the highest auction scores. - A browser executing on a
user device 106 may be configured to block third party cookies. A third party can be distinguished, for example, from a first party. When aresource 105 associated with apublisher 109 is rendered in the browser on theuser device 106, the publisher 109 (e.g., a domain associated with the publisher 109) can be considered as the first party. As mentioned above, theresource 105 can include one or more content slots and each of the content slots can be configured to include instructions which request content for a respective content slot from thecontent management system 110. Thecontent management system 110 can be considered as a third party in this example. - A method is proposed, which is described in detail below, that enables the
content management system 110 to deliver customized content to be included in the content slot(s) included in theresource 105 associated with thepublisher 109, using cookies that are first party cookies with respect to thecontent management system 110. The method, which involves encrypted publisher cookies, can be used with browsers that have been configured to block third party cookies. -
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system 200 for providing content to auser device 202. A “NewsX.com”publisher page 204 associated with apublisher 206 is rendered in a browser running on theuser device 202. Thepublisher page 204 includes in this example one or more content slots, such as including acontent slot 208. Thecontent slot 208 can include or be associated with a script which, when executed, causes the browser to send a request to acontent server 210 for content to present in thecontent slot 208. The script can, when executed, cause the browser to identify and include an encrypted publisher cookie with the request for content that is sent to the content management system 110 (e.g., for identifying content for inclusion in the content slot 208). - For example, the
publisher 206 can, when providing thepublisher page 204, drop apublisher cookie 212 associated with thepublisher 206 into acookie space 214 of the browser. Thepublisher cookie 212 can include an identifier that is unique to the browser and can be associated with a domain associated with thepublisher 206. Thepublisher cookie 212 can include content which specifies an initialization time that indicates a time at which thepublisher cookie 212 was initially set on theuser device 202. Subsequent page requests from theuser device 202 to thepublisher 206 can include thepublisher cookie 212. Thepublisher cookie 212 can allow thepublisher 206 to track particular actions and status of a user over multiple sessions. Thepublisher cookie 212 can store a variety of data, such as past session data. - The
publisher 206, or a script associated with thepublisher page 204 or thecontent slot 208, can generate an encrypted publisher cookie that is based on thepublisher cookie 212. The encrypted publisher cookie that is based on thepublisher cookie 212 can be generated, for example, using a SHA512 hash function with thepublisher cookie 212 as an input parameter. Other hash function or encryption techniques can be used. The encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 212 can be included in the request sent by the browser to thecontent server 210 for content to be included in thecontent slot 208. - The
content server 210 can receive the request for content for thecontent slot 208 from the browser running on theuser device 202. Thecontent server 210 selects a content item for thecontent slot 208, such as based at least in part on the content of thepublisher page 204. Thecontent server 210 provides the selected content item to the browser, for presentation in thecontent slot 208, as illustrated by a content item 216 (e.g., “content item A”). Thecontent server 210 can configure thecontent item 216 to be associated with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 212. - For example, the
content item 216 can be configured to include a script which is executed in response to a user interaction with (e.g., selection of) thecontent item 216 and which requests the browser to execute a navigation request to navigate to a website associated with the content server 210 (e.g., the website can have a same domain as a domain associated with the content server 210). The navigation request, which can be, e.g., a URL, can include the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 212. In response to user interaction with thecontent item 216, thecontent server 210 can receive the navigation request from the browser, the navigation request including an indication of the user interaction with thecontent item 216 and the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 212. - In response to receiving the navigation request from the browser, the
content server 210 can create a content server cookie (e.g., a cookie with a same domain as a domain of the content server 210) that will be treated as a first party cookie by the browser (since the browser issued the navigation request). The content server cookie can be included in a response sent to the browser that is responsive to the navigation request sent by the browser to thecontent server 210. The response can include an instruction to the browser to drop the content server cookie as acontent server cookie 218 in thecookie space 214 of the browser. The browser can accept and perform the drop cookie instruction, even when the browser has blocked third party cookies, because thecontent server cookie 218 is a first party cookie (e.g., the browser is associated with the domain of thecontent server 210 due to the navigation request sent by the browser to the content server 210). The response sent by thecontent server 210 to the browser can include a redirect request to cause the browser to load, for example, a landing page associated with thecontent item 216. - In some implementations, in response to receiving the navigation request from the browser, the
content server 210 can link the generated content server cookie with the received encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 212. For example, an entry 220 of adata structure 222 stored in arepository 224 can be made to include both the content server cookie (e.g., “cookie2”) and the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 212 (e.g., “epc-cookie1”). The entry 220 can include other information, such as an indication of the type of interaction that occurred with thecontent item 216, an identifier for thecontent item 216, a date and time at which the interaction occurred, location information indicating the location of theuser device 202 at the time of the interaction, and other information. The other information can be used, for example, for selecting content in response to subsequent requests for content that are associated with the content server cookie. - At a time subsequent to the displaying of the landing page associated with the
content item 216 in the browser, the user of theuser device 202 may navigate to apublisher page 226 associated with apublisher 228, causing thepublisher page 226 to be presented in the browser. Thepublisher page 226 includes acontent slot 230. Thecontent slot 230 can include a script which, when executed, causes the browser to send a request to thecontent server 210 for content to present in thecontent slot 230. The script can, when executed, cause the browser to include an encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher 228 with the request for content for thecontent slot 230. - For example, the
publisher 228 can, when providing thepublisher page 226, drop apublisher cookie 232 associated with thepublisher 228 into thecookie space 214 of the browser. Thepublisher 228, or a script associated with thepublisher page 226 or thecontent slot 230, can generate an encrypted publisher cookie that is based on thepublisher cookie 232. The encrypted publisher cookie that is based on thepublisher cookie 232 can be generated similar to the encrypted publisher cookie discussed above. The encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 232 can be included in the request sent by the browser to thecontent server 210 for content for thecontent slot 230. - Because the
content server cookie 218 was previously dropped into thecookie space 214 of the browser, thecontent server cookie 218 is automatically included by the browser in the request sent by the browser to thecontent server 210 for content for thecontent slot 230. In some implementations, thecontent server cookie 212 includes information related to user interactions with thecontent item 216 or other content items provided by thecontent server 210 and/or information related to content items provided to theuser device 202 by thecontent server 210. - The
content server 210 can receive the request for content for thecontent slot 230 from the browser running on theuser device 202. Thecontent server 210 can extract thecontent server cookie 218 and the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 232 from the request. Thecontent server 210 can identify the entry 220 as being associated with the request (e.g., by querying thedata structure 222 for entries that include the content server cookie 218). Thecontent server 210 can evaluate the entry 220 and can select content for thecontent slot 230 based at least in part on the evaluating of the entry 220. Evaluating the entry is discussed in greater detail below. - Evaluating the entry 220 can include identifying data in one or more fields of the respective entry and using the identified data to assist in the selection of content to deliver in response to the received request. For example, the content server 220 can identify the interaction indication and the identifier of the
content item 216 in the entry 220. Thecontent server 210 can, for example, locate keywords or topics associated with thecontent item 216 and can select a content item for thecontent slot 230 based at least in part on the located keywords or topics associated with thecontent item 216. Thecontent server 210 can select a content item for thecontent slot 230 based on keywords or topics associated with thecontent item 216 because the user's prior interaction with thecontent item 216 may mean that the user may be interested in other content items which have similar keywords or topics as thecontent item 216. Thecontent server 210 provides the selected content item to the browser, for presentation in thecontent slot 230, as illustrated by a content item 233 (e.g., “content item B”) responsive to the received request. Thecontent server 210 can configure thecontent item 233 to be associated with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 232, e.g., as described above for thecontent item 216. - For example, the
content item 233 can be configured to include a script which is executed in response to a user interaction with (e.g., selection of) thecontent item 233 and which requests the browser to execute a navigation request to navigate to a website associated with the content server 210 (e.g., the website can have a same domain as a domain associated with the content server 210). The navigation request, which can be, e.g., a URL, can include the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 232. - The
content server 210 can link thecontent server cookie 218 with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 232. For example, amapping entry 234 can be added to thedata structure 222 which includes the content server cookie 218 (e.g., “cookie2”) and the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 (e.g., “epc-cookie3”). Thecontent server 210 can also link the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 232 with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 212. The two encrypted publisher cookies can be indirectly and/or directly linked in thedata structure 222, for example. For instance, the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 232 can be indirectly linked to the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 212 based on both theentries 220 and 234 including thecontent server cookie 218. Accordingly, a search of thedata structure 222 can locate all such entries that are “indirectly” linked. As another example, the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 232 can be directly linked to the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 212 by creating a single entry for inclusion (e.g., an entry 236) in thedata structure 222 which includes the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 232, the encrypted publisher cookie associated with thepublisher cookie 212, and thecontent server cookie 218. - The user of the
user device 202 can interact with thecontent item 233, and in response to the interaction, processing can be performed (e.g., by the browser and the content server 210) that is similar to the processing occurring in response to the interaction with thecontent item 216. For example, anentry 238 can be stored in thedata structure 222. Theentry 238 includes the content server cookie (e.g., “cookie2”) and the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the publisher cookie 232 (e.g., “epc-cookie3”). Theentry 238 can include other information, such as an indication of the type of interaction that occurred with thecontent item 233, an identifier for thecontent item 233, a date and time at which the interaction occurred, location information indicating the location of theuser device 202 at the time of the interaction, and other information. - Information in the entries 220 and 238 (and possibly other entries) can be used to select content in response to subsequent requests for content from the
user device 202 which include the content server cookie. For example, the information in theentries 220 and 238 can be used to select acontent item 240 for acontent slot 242 included in apublisher page 244 provided by a publisher 246. As another example, the information in theentries 220 and 238 can be used to select acontent item 248 for acontent slot 250 included in a second presentation on theuser device 202 of the “NewsX.com” publisher page (e.g., publisher page 252) provided by thepublisher 206. -
FIG. 3 is a diagram of anexample process 300 for providing content to a user device. A browser 302 (e.g., web browser) sends arequest 304 to afirst publisher 306 for a publisher page associated with thefirst publisher 306. Thefirst publisher 306 generates a publisher cookie (308). Thefirst publisher 306 provides, in response to therequest 304, the first publisher page, the publisher cookie, and a script to generate or retrieve an encrypted publisher cookie (EPC) associated with the publisher cookie (310). The script can be associated with a content slot included in the first publisher page. The content slot can be configured (e.g., by execution of a script that places a call to the content serving system 312) to present content provided by thecontent serving system 312. - The script, for example, can be configured to generate the EPC based on the provided publisher cookie. As another example, the
first publisher 306 can generate the EPC based on the publisher cookie and can provide the EPC along with (or instead of) the publisher cookie (e.g., at 310), and the script can be configured to retrieve the provided EPC. As yet another example, thefirst publisher 306 can provide the publisher cookie and the EPC (or, in some implementations, just the EPC) in association with browser cookies that are to be dropped into a cookie space associated with thebrowser 302. - The
browser 302 renders the received first publisher page (314). As part of rendering the first publisher page, thebrowser 302 executes the script provided by thefirst publisher 306. The script generates or retrieves the EPC and sends arequest 316 to thecontent serving system 312 for content for the content slot. Therequest 316 includes the EPC. Thecontent serving system 312 selects a content item (e.g., a first content item) in response to the request 316 (318) and provides the first content item and a parameter associated with the EPC (e.g., script code) to the browser 302 (320). For example, the first content item can include instructions which can be executed on thebrowser 302 in response to user interaction with the first content item. The instructions can be configured to send an interaction indication that includes the EPC (or, in some implementations, an encrypted version of the EPC) to thecontent serving system 312. - The
browser 302 renders the received first content item in the content slot included in the first publisher page (322). Subsequent to the rendering of the first content item, thebrowser 302 receives an indication of and processes an interaction with (e.g., selection of) the first content item (324). For example, the user of the browser can select the first content item. Thebrowser 302 sends aninteraction indication 326 of the interaction to thecontent serving system 312. Theindication 326 includes the EPC. For example, the first content item can be configured to retrieve (or regenerate) the EPC and include the EPC in theindication 326, in response to an interaction with the first content item. - In response to receiving the
interaction indication 326, thecontent serving system 312 generates a content serving system cookie (CSSC) (328). The CSSC can be associated with the domain of thecontent serving system 312. Thecontent serving system 312 generates and sends aresponse 330 to thebrowser 302, theresponse 330 including the CSSC and a drop cookie instruction to drop the CSSC into a cookie space associated with thebrowser 302. In response to receiving theresponse 330, thebrowser 302 can store the CSSC in the cookie space associated with thebrowser 302. Thecontent serving system 312 stores an association between the EPC, the CSSC, and theinteraction indication 326 in a content serving system repository 332 (334). In some implementations, thecontent serving system 312 stores the association between the EPC, the CSSC, and theinteraction indication 326 before generating and sending theresponse 330. - As part of processing the interaction with the first content item, the
browser 302 sends arequest 336 to acontent sponsor 338 for a landing page associated with the first content item. Thecontent sponsor 338 provides the landing page 340 (or a redirect for the landing page 340) in response to therequest 336. Thebrowser 302 renders the received landing page (342). - At a time after the landing page is rendered, the
browser 302 requests a second publisher page from a second publisher 344 (346) (e.g., in response to a user entering a URL of the second publisher page into thebrowser 302 or selecting a link associated with the second publisher page). Thesecond publisher 344 generates a publisher cookie associated with the second publisher (348). Thesecond publisher 344 provides the second publisher page, the publisher cookie, and a script to generate or retrieve an encrypted publisher cookie (EPC2) associated with the publisher cookie associated with the second publisher (350). The script can be associated with a content slot included in the second publisher page. The content slot can be for presenting content provided by acontent serving system 312. - The script, for example, can be configured to generate the EPC2 based on the provided publisher cookie associated with the second publisher. As another example, the
second publisher 344 can generate the EPC2 based on the publisher cookie associated with the second publisher and can provide the EPC2 along with (or instead of) the publisher cookie (e.g., at 350), and the script can be configured to retrieve the provided EPC2. As yet another example, thesecond publisher 344 can provide the publisher cookie and the EPC2 (or, in some implementations, just the EPC2) as browser cookies that are to be dropped into a cookie space associated with thebrowser 302. - The
browser 302 renders the second publisher page (352). As part of rendering the second publisher page, thebrowser 302 executes the script provided by thesecond publisher 344. The script generates or retrieves the EPC2 and sends arequest 354 to thecontent serving system 312 for content for the content slot included in the second publisher page. Therequest 354 includes the EPC2 and the previously stored CSSC (e.g., the CSSC can be automatically included in therequest 354 due to therequest 354 being associated with the domain of the content serving system 312). - In response to receiving the
request 354 that includes the CSSC and the EPC2, thecontent serving system 312 can link the CSSC, the EPC2 associated with thesecond publisher 344, and the EPC associated with the first publisher 306 (356). For example, the content serving system can identify the CSSC included in therequest 354 and can use the CSSC to locate, in the contentserving system repository 332, the previously stored association between the EPC and the CSSC. Thecontent serving system 312 can link the EPC2 included in therequest 354 to the EPC (e.g., since both are linked to the CSSC). In some implementations, thecontent serving system 312 stores an association between the EPC, the CSSC, and the EPC2 in the contentserving system repository 332. - The
content serving system 312 can, in response to therequest 354 for content for the slot included in thesecond publisher page 350, evaluate, for example, stored interaction data associated with one or more of the EPC, the EPC2, and the CSSC (358). For example, thecontent serving system 312 can select a second content item based, at least in part, on interaction data previously stored in association with the EPC associated with the first publisher (360). Thecontent serving system 312 can provide the selected second content item (and in some implementations, a parameter associated with the EPC), to thebrowser 302, for presentation in the content slot included in the second publisher page (362). - Similar to the processing of the interaction with the first content item on the first publisher page, the
content serving system 312 can store interaction information associated with an interaction with the second content item in response to receiving an indication of an interaction with the second content item. Thecontent serving system 312 can select content for future content requests based on the interaction with the second content item, the interaction with the first content item, and/or on other data associated with the CSSC. -
FIG. 4A is a flowchart of an example process 400 for providing content to a user device. The process 400 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 , thecontent server 210 described above with respect toFIG. 2 , or thecontent serving system 312 described above with respect toFIG. 3 . - A first content request for filling a slot on a first publisher page is received from a browser in association with rendering the first publisher page (402). The first content request includes an encrypted publisher cookie. The received encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page can be one way encrypted such that an underlying publisher cookie of the first publisher page is not discoverable from the received encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page. The received encrypted publisher cookie can be encrypted, for example, using the SHA512 hash function.
- Content is provided responsive to the received request including a content item and a parameter that is associated with the encrypted publisher cookie (404). For example, the parameter can include instructions which can be executed on the browser in response to user interaction with the content item. The instructions can be configured to send an interaction indication that includes the encrypted publisher cookie (or, in some implementations, an encrypted version of the encrypted publisher cookie) to the content serving system.
- An indication that a user interacted with the content item is received (406), wherein the indication is associated with the encrypted publisher cookie. Responsive to the receipt of the indication of the interaction with the content item, a content serving system cookie that is unique to the browser is created (408). For example, a cookie that is a first party cookie associated with (e.g., with respect to) the content serving system can be created. For example, the content serving system cookie can have a same domain as a domain of the content serving system. The content serving system cookie is provided to the browser (410).
- Also responsive to the receipt of the interaction indication, the received encrypted publisher cookie is linked with the content serving system cookie (412), including the storing of an association between the encrypted publisher cookie and the content serving system cookie in a data structure. Information associated with the interaction indication can be stored in association with the encrypted publisher cookie and the content serving system cookie. For example, context information associated with the interaction (e.g., time, location) can be stored. As another example, an identifier of the content item can be stored.
- A second, different request for content is received from the browser in association with rendering a second, different publisher page (414). The second, different request includes an encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second, different publisher page and the previously provided content serving system cookie. The encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second, different publisher page can be associated with a different domain than the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page. The encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second publisher page can be one way encrypted such that an underlying publisher cookie of the second publisher page is not discoverable from the received encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second publisher page.
- After receiving the second different request, the received encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second, different publisher page is linked with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page in the data structure (416). For example, a determination can be made that both the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second, different publisher page and the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page are both associated with the content serving system cookie. The linking of the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the second, different publisher page with the encrypted publisher cookie associated with the first publisher page can include linking historical interaction data associated with user interaction data for a respective publisher page with a respective encrypted publisher cookie of the respective publisher page.
- The linkings are used to determine content to deliver to the browser (418). For example, the linkings can be used to select content for the second, different request for content and/or for subsequent requests for content that include the content serving system cookie.
- As another example and in more detail,
FIG. 4B is a flowchart of an example process 450 for providing content to a user device. The process 400 can be performed, for example, by thecontent management system 110 described above with respect toFIG. 1 , thecontent server 210 described above with respect toFIG. 2 , or thecontent serving system 312 described above with respect toFIG. 3 . The process 450 can be a continuation of the process 400 described above with respect toFIG. 4A . - A request for content is received in association with rendering a publisher page that is linked to one or more other different publisher pages through a commonly shared content serving system identifier, including the receiving of a content serving system cookie and an encrypted publisher cookie of the linked publisher page (452). For example, the request for content can be for a content slot included in the first publisher page, the second, different publisher page, or a third, also different publisher page. The request for content can be received, for example, from a browser.
- One or more linked other publishers can be identified, using the received content serving system cookie (453). Information is retrieved based on the identified one or more other linked publishers, wherein the other information includes user interaction data associated with one or more respective linked publisher pages (454).
- The interaction data associated with each of the respective linked publisher page(s) is evaluated (456). For example, for each respective linked publisher page, one or more of a time of day, time of year, location, or keywords associated with the content item with which the interaction occurred can be identified.
- Content is selected from inventory responsive to the request (458). For example, one or more content items can be selected based at least in part on information identified during evaluation of the interaction data associated with each of the respective linked publisher pages.
- The selected content is provided responsive to the request (460). For example, the selected one or more content items can be provided to the browser.
