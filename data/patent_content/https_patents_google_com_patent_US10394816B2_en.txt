Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for determining terms within product search queries that designate product lines, and more specifically with pairing the detected product lines with product brands.
- methods and systems can determine product lines from product search queries.
- a product query of search terms may be received from a user.
- the product query may be classified to identify a product category.
- a brand may be identified for the product query.
- the brand may be selected from a list of known brands for the product category.
- One or more unknown product line terms may be identified within the product query.
- a metric may be computed to indicate how well the unknown product line terms correspond to an actual product line within the brand.
- the metric may be compared to a specified threshold.
- the unknown product line terms may be designated as a new product line of the brand if the metric favorably compares to the specified threshold.
- a product search may be performed using the product query.
- Product search results may be returned according to the product search.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting an online product search system in accordance with one or more example embodiments presented herein.
- FIG. 2 is a user interface diagram depicting a browser interface for product queries and search results in accordance with one or more example embodiments presented herein.
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for determining product lines from user queries in accordance with one or more example embodiments presented herein.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram depicting a computing machine and a module in accordance with one or more example embodiments presented herein.
- Product search queries may be received from users via a network such as the Internet.
- Product lines associated with product brands may be determined from analyzing the received product search queries.
- a search query may be automatically mapped to a product category.
- a list of known brands within the product category may be used to identify terms within the product query specifying the product brand.
- a list of known category attributes may be used to identify terms within the product query specifying attributes of the product being searched. Examples of attributes may include a number of megapixels for digital cameras, an amount of RAM memory for laptop computers, or a number of cylinders for a motor vehicle.
- a product query may take the form “[B] [PL] [A].”
- one or more terms [B] may indicate a brand that is a known brand within a list of known product brands, and one or more terms [A] may indicate attributes that are known attributes of the category.
- One or more unknown terms [PL] may then be identified as a potential new product line.
- Such an identification may be strengthened where [PL] is in a form associated with product lines.
- the identification may also be strengthened where [PL] is found with brand [B] frequently over time within various product queries 120 .
- the identification may be further strengthened where the terms [PL] are infrequently, or never, found with brands other than the brand [B] throughout many product queries over time.
- a metric may be computed for how well the potential new product line terms fit an actual likely product line associated with the brand.
- the metric may consider the number of unique product queries containing the terms [PL] having the correct structure and/or category along with the extent to which [B] dominates among every query that has a brand preceding [PL].
- the computed metric can then be compared to a pairing threshold. When the computed metric is greater than the pairing threshold, the terms [PL] may be determined as a new product line for the brand [B].
- a product line brand pairing ([PL]-[B] pairing) may be formed.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting an online product search system 100 in accordance with one or more example embodiments presented herein.
- a user 110 can issue a product query 120 from a user system 115 to a query classifier 160 via a network 130 .
- the query classifier 160 can map the query to a product category to be provided to a product line resolution module 150 .
- the product line resolution module 150 can identify product lines associated with brands for product categories determined by the query classifier 160 .
- the product line resolution module 150 may leverage a category attribute dictionary 170 and a product brand dictionary 180 to improve the resolution of product lines and establish pairings between brands and product lines.
- the product query 120 and the determined brands and product lines may then be provided to a product search engine 190 .
- the product search engine 190 may then provide search results 195 to the user 110 at the user system 115 via the network 130 .
- the query classifier 160 may be used to map the product query 120 to a product category.
- the product line resolution module 150 can leverage that product category information along with information from the category attribute dictionary 170 and the product brand dictionary 180 to identify terms within the product query 120 that relate to product lines.
- the product lines identified by the product line resolution module 150 for a category may be fed back into the category attribute dictionary 170 as attributes for that category.
- Each identified product line may also be related to a particular brand listed in the product brand dictionary 180 .
- the product brand dictionary 180 can provide a list of known brands within various product categories. The known brands may be leveraged to determine and resolve terms associated with product lines within each brand. For example, a product query 120 of the form “[B] [PL]” may include one or more terms [B] indicating a brand that is a known brand within the product brand dictionary 180 . The one or more terms [PL] may then be identified as a potential new product line. Such an identification may be strengthened where [PL] is in a form associated with product lines. The identification may also be strengthened where [PL] is found with brand [B] frequently over time within various product queries 120 . The identification may be further strengthened where the terms [PL] are infrequently, or never, found with brands other than the brand [B] throughout many product queries 120 over time.
- Various conditions may be specified for determining when [PL] is in a form associated with product lines. For example, it may have been observed that product line terms generally start with a letter. Also, it may have been observed that product lines generally contain few or no numbers. In these examples, such specified forms of product lines can help to differentiate product line terms from model numbers or serial numbers. According to certain other examples, the form of potential product lines may be related to a category or a brand. For example, one brand may generally have single word product lines while a second brand may use two word product lines where the first word relates to performance and the second word is a three-digit number. Whatever patterns or forms have been learned or specified for product lines may be used to improve the likelihood that unknown terms within a product query 120 can be identified as product line terms or not.
- the category attribute dictionary 170 can provide a dictionary of attributes associated with various product categories and brands. Terms from the category attribute dictionary 170 may be applied to resolving product line terms within the product query 120 .
- a product query 120 may have the form “[B] [PL] [A]” where [B] is one or more terms indicating a known brand within the product brand dictionary 180 , and [A] is one or more terms indicating attributes that are known within the category attribute dictionary 170 as being associated with the relevant category and/or brand.
- [PL] is consistently found within product queries 120 along with [B]
- a product query 120 may have the form “[B] [PL] [C]” where [B] is a known brand within the product brand dictionary 180 and [C] is a category term consistent with the category associated with the product query 120 by the query classifier 160 .
- [B] is a known brand within the product brand dictionary 180
- [C] is a category term consistent with the category associated with the product query 120 by the query classifier 160 .
- consistent isolation and matching of terms [PL] can imply an identification of [PL] as a product line associated with the brand [B] and or the relevant product category.
- the product search engine 190 can use the product query 120 along with an identified pairing between a product line and a brand within the product query 120 to identify search results 195 .
- the product search engine 190 may comprise various search index techniques.
- the product search engine 190 may also leverage product or shopping search techniques.
- the search results 195 may be presented to the user 110 at a user system 115 within a web browser or other application software. According to one or more example embodiments, example search results 195 are presented in further detail with respect to FIG. 2 .
- the user system 115 one or more systems associated with the query classifier 160 , the product line resolution module 150 , the product search engine 190 , or any other computing machines associated with this technology may be any type of computing machine such as, but not limited to, those discussed in more detail with respect to FIG. 4 .
- any modules associated with any of these computing machines or any other modules (scripts, web content, software, firmware, or hardware) associated with the technology presented herein may by any of the modules discussed in more detail with respect to FIG. 4 .
- the computing machines discussed herein may communicate with one another as well as other computer machines or communication systems over one or more networks such as network 130 .
- the network 130 may include any type of data or communications network, including any of the network technology discussed with respect to FIG. 4 .
- FIG. 2 is a user interface diagram depicting a browser interface for product queries 120 and search results 195 in accordance with one or more example embodiments presented herein.
- the user interface 210 can provide an input mechanism for the user 110 to enter a product query 120 .
- the user interface 210 can provide a list of search results 195 from the online product search system 100 .
- a set of attribute selectors 220 may be included within the user interface 210 to allow the user 110 to narrow or redirect the search results 195 onto products with specific product attributes potentially including brands and/or product lines.
- the user interface 210 may be rendered as content to be presented to a browser or other software application. Such a browser or software application may be configured to execute upon the user system 115 . As such, the user interface 210 may be presented to, and/or interacted upon by, the user 110 at a user system 115 .
- the attribute selectors 220 may be included within the user interface 210 to allow the user 110 to narrow or redirect the search results 195 onto products with specific product attributes.
- the attributes may include brands and/or product lines.
- the attributes may be populated within the attribute selectors 220 according to the determined brand or product line for the product query 120 .
- the fictional product query 120 is for “Samson firedrive 1 tb sata.”
- the query classifier 160 may identify the category of hard drives from the example product query 120 .
- the product line resolution module 150 may identify “Samson” as a hard drive brand from the product brand dictionary 180 .
- the product line resolution module 150 may identify “1 TB” and “SATA” as attributes for the category (hard drives) from the category attribute dictionary 170 . If “FireDrive” were not already know as a product line of Samson hard drives, the product line resolution module 150 may identify “firedrive” as an unknown product line term of the example product query 120 .
- the unknown product line term “firedrive” from the example product query 120 may then be used as evidence that “FireDrive” is a product line, perhaps newly introduced.
- This new product line identification may be strengthened if “FireDrive” were in the form of a product line name or even a product line name common to the brand Samson as discussed above.
- the new product line identification may be further strengthened if “FireDrive” were found repeatedly with the brand “Samson” (and perhaps very infrequently with other brands) in product queries 120 for hard drives. These indicators can also provide support for the pairing of the new product line “FireDrive” with the brand “Samson.”
- FIG. 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 300 for determining product lines from user queries in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.
- the online product search system 100 can receive a product query 120 from a user 110 associated with a user system 115 .
- the product query 120 can include terms associated with one or more products being searched by the user 110 .
- a query classifier 160 may be used to map the product query 120 to a product category.
- the set of search terms making up the product query 120 may be mapped to a category that covers the set of terms.
- a product line resolution module 150 can identify unknown product line terms within product queries of known brands. For example, from a product query 120 having the form “[B] [PL] [A]” where [B] has been identified as a known brand within the product brand dictionary 180 and [A] has been identified as one or more known attributes within the category attribute dictionary 170 , the product line resolution module 150 may identify [PL] as one or more unknown product line terms.
- the product line resolution module 150 can evaluate the unknown product line terms against typical product line templates.
- the one or more terms [PL] as identified in block 330 may be evaluated to be of the form of a product line.
- the form may be of a product line in general, a product line within the category, a product line associated with the brand [B], or a product line associated with the one or more product attributes [A].
- the form may be specified as a template, a rule, a pattern, or in any other useful fashion.
- An example of a rule or pattern may be that product line terms generally start with a letter and contain few or no numbers.
- the product line resolution module 150 can identify unknown product line terms as a candidate product line for the known brand. If the one or more terms [PL] as identified in block 330 appear frequently next to brand [B], and also in isolation (without the brand [B]), but rarely (if ever) adjacent to any other brand, then the terms [PL] may be identified as a product line candidate for the brand [B].
- the product line resolution module 150 can compute a metric for brand to product line pairing.
- the metric may be a function of the number of unique product queries 120 that have the one or more terms [PL] supported in forms such as “[B] [PL],” “[B] [PL] [A],” “[PL] [A],” or so forth.
- the metric may be a function of how frequently such product queries 120 are identified as the appropriate category for example to correspond to [B] and/or [A].
- the metric may be a function of the total volume of such product queries 120 since popular queries may be issued multiple times.
- the metric may be a function of the extent to which [B] dominates among every query that has a brand preceding [PL].
- the metric may be normalized to be a function of the fraction of product queries 120 in which [PL] appears in the above forms out of all occurrences of [PL]. Various combinations of these and other functions may also be used.
- the product line resolution module 150 can compare the computed metric to a pairing threshold.
- the terms [PL] may be determined as a new product line for the brand [B].
- a product line brand pairing ([PL]-[B] pairing) may be formed.
- the new product like terms [PL] may also be added to the category attribute dictionary 170 .
- the threshold can be established to provide a desired accuracy. A higher threshold will provide a greater certainty that the terms [PL] may be determined as a new product line for the brand [B], compared to a lower threshold.
- the product search engine 190 can process the product query 120 to identify search results 195 .
- the search engine 190 may also leverage the identified product line or product line brand pairing to refine the search results 195 .
- the online product search system 100 can return search results 195 to the user 110 at a user system 115 via the network 130 .
- the search results 195 may be presented to the user 110 at a user system 115 within a web browser or other application software.
