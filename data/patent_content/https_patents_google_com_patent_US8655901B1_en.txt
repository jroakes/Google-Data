Definitions
- This instant specification relates to search systems.
- Internet search engines aim to identify resources (e.g., web pages, images, text documents, multimedia context) that are relevant to a user's needs and to present information about the resources in a manner that is most useful to the user.
- Internet search engines return a set of search results in response to a user submitted query.
- Some queries e.g., queries with a geographic component
- queries with a geographic component are split into components in order to be correctly interpreted.
- manually generated query patterns are used to match queries and to split the matched queries for interpretation.
- This specification describes technologies relating to search systems.
- one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving a query pattern, the query pattern identifying a particular rule to interpret a particular type of query, the query pattern being in a first language; identifying a collection of queries in the first language matching the query pattern; annotating each query of the collection of queries with one or more labels; translating the collection of annotated queries in the first language into a translated collection of queries in a second language; aligning the translated collection of queries including identifying a most common term in the translated collection of queries and determining the corresponding positions of the annotations relative to the translated query terms; and extracting a translated query pattern from the aligned translated collection of queries.
- Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.
- Identifying a collection of queries in the first language matching the query pattern includes applying a pattern splitter to match the pattern to particular queries.
- Candidate queries are tokenized into a query vector for matching to the query pattern.
- the method further includes using the translated query pattern to interpret received queries in the second language matching the translated query pattern.
- Using the translated query pattern includes applying the translated query pattern to a received query in order to identify one or more query splits into query components and using the resulting query components to search a respective index for each query component.
- the method further includes using the translated query pattern to search for results responsive to a received query in the second language and presenting search results.
- Identifying a collection of queries includes identifying queries from a query log that match the query pattern. Annotating each query includes labeling portions of the query according to the query pattern. Extracting a translated query pattern further comprises cross validating the translated query pattern with a query log with respect to a specified occurrence threshold.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example search system.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example search process.
- FIG. 3 is an screenshot of an example map search result for a query.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process for identifying translated query patterns.
- FIG. 1 shows an example search system 100 for providing search results relevant to submitted queries as can be implemented in an internet, an intranet, or another client and server environment.
- the search system 100 is an example of an information retrieval system in which the systems, components, and techniques described below can be implemented.
- a user 102 can interact with the search system 100 through a client device 104 .
- the client 104 can be a computer coupled to the search system 100 through a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet.
- the search system 100 and the client device 104 can be one machine.
- a user can install a desktop search application on the client device 104 .
- the client device 104 will generally include a random access memory (RAM) 106 and a processor 108 .
- RAM random access memory
- a user 102 can submit a query 110 to a search engine 130 within a search system 100 .
- the query 110 is transmitted through a network to the search system 100 .
- the search system 100 can be implemented as, for example, computer programs running on one or more computers in one or more locations that are coupled to each other through a network.
- the search system 100 includes one or more index databases 122 and a search engine 130 .
- the search system 100 responds to the query 110 by generating search results 128 , which are transmitted through the network to the client device 104 in a form that can be presented to the user 102 (e.g., as a search results web page to be displayed in a web browser running on the client device 104 ).
- the search engine 130 identifies resources that match the query 110 .
- the search engine 130 will generally include an indexing engine 120 that indexes resources (e.g., web pages, images, or news articles on the Internet) found in one or more corpora (e.g., collections or repositories of content) in the one or more index databases 122 that store the index information and a ranking engine 152 (or other software) to rank the resources that match the query 110 .
- the indexing and ranking of the resources can be performed using conventional techniques.
- the one or more index databases 122 store different types of resources that can be searched separately using part or all of the query 110 .
- an index database of the index databases 122 can store index information associated with geographic resources, local resources, or other types of specifically indexed resources.
- the search engine 130 can submit the query or a query component to particular indices depending the interpretation of the query, e.g., using a query pattern as described below.
- the search engine 130 can transmit the search results 128 through the network to the client device 104 for presentation to the user 102 .
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example search process 200 .
- the search process 200 will be described with respect to a system (e.g., a system including one or more computing devices) that performs the search process 200 .
- the system receives 202 an input query.
- the query can be received from a user through a user interface associated with a search system (e.g., the search system 100 ).
- the query is received in a user interface associated with a particular set of resources.
- the query can be received in a user interface of a mapping application that identifies geographic locations and other information associated with geographic locations based on user input.
- an input query “San Francisco” to a search interface can result in a map of San Francisco being displayed.
- a query of “city hall San Francisco” can result in information associated with San Francisco's city hall being displayed relative to a map of San Francisco or to a relevant portion of San Francisco.
- the information can include, for example, the address of city hall, phone number for city hall, a position locator of city hall on the displayed map, images, reviews, links to web pages, and other responsive information.
- multiple results can be displayed relative to a displayed map, e.g., the query “restaurants near opera san francisco” can provide multiple mapped results for particular restaurants within a specified proximity of the opera house in San Francisco.
- the system matches 204 a query pattern to the received query.
- a query pattern provides one or more predefined rules for matching a received query and interpreting the matched query.
- a number of query patterns are defined manually.
- query patterns are manually generated by testing various ways of splitting different types of queries and scoring candidate query patterns based on the results. A particular score, or confidence, can be required to select a query pattern from the candidate query patterns.
- a query pattern can include, for example, a language identifier (e.g., French), a country or domain (e.g., France), stopwords, a connector, a confidence value, and a query splits filter strategy.
- Stopwords e.g., “a” and “the” are words that do not provide information that assists in identifying search results (e.g., does not influence the results).
- the stopwords can be removed according to the pattern so that the stopwords are ignored in the input query when matching the query to a query pattern.
- additional stopwords can be used, for example, “map of” and “location of,” which have no influence on the search results since all results are maps or locations. Therefore, these terms can also be discarded from received queries.
- the query pattern can be associated with a particular confidence value.
- the confidence indicates a likelihood that a given query that matches a query pattern is correctly associated with that pattern. For example, different terms used in patterns can have multiple meanings, some of which may not apply to the pattern. As a result, the confidence for that particular pattern can be lower.
- a query pattern of the form ⁇ what ⁇ near ⁇ where ⁇ (e.g., “pizza near New York”) can have a higher confidence than a query pattern in the form ⁇ what ⁇ in ⁇ where ⁇ (e.g., “pizza in New York”) because there are fewer false positive matches with the query pattern ⁇ what ⁇ near ⁇ where ⁇ .
- ⁇ what ⁇ is a placeholder for one or more query terms identifying a thing while “ ⁇ where ⁇ ” is a placeholder for one or more query terms identifying a location.
- Protocol buffer is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible way of serializing structured data.
- query pattern form ⁇ what ⁇ near ⁇ where ⁇ can be described in protobuffer form as follows:
- the example query pattern is for a connector between terms in a query. As shown in the protobuffer form, the language is English and the term of the connector is “near”.
- the split_type indicates the action for splitting the query with respect to the connector term. Query splitting is described in greater detail below.
- the “location_first: false” indicates that when the connector term “near” occurs at the beginning of a query, this pattern does not apply.
- this query pattern describes a query joined by the term “near” where “near” cannot be the first term in the query.
- the query pattern satisfies queries of the form ⁇ what ⁇ near ⁇ where ⁇ .
- the pattern is matched to queries that satisfy that format, e.g., “pizza near times square” and “burgers near 4th & king streets.”
- the pattern can be split at the connector into corresponding ⁇ what ⁇ and ⁇ where ⁇ query components.
- a prefix type query pattern has the form stopwords+ ⁇ QUERY ⁇ .
- ⁇ QUERY ⁇ represents any valid query without the initial stopwords.
- the stopwords are removed.
- the remaining ⁇ QUERY ⁇ can be further matched to one or more other query patterns and split again, as described in greater detail below. Examples of queries in this form include “map of ⁇ QUERY ⁇ ,” “location of ⁇ QUERY ⁇ ,” and “where is ⁇ QUERY ⁇ .”
- a suffix type query pattern has the form: ⁇ QUERY ⁇ +stopwords. Similar to the prefix type query pattern, when the suffix type query pattern is identified for a received input, the stopwords are removed. The remaining ⁇ QUERY ⁇ can be further matched to one or more other query patterns and split again. Examples of queries in this form include “ ⁇ QUERY ⁇ street map,” and “ ⁇ QUERY ⁇ map.”
- a prefix suffix type query pattern has the form: stopwords+ ⁇ QUERY ⁇ +stopwords. Again, stopwords are removed, leaving the remaining query portion for additional processing.
- An example query in this form is “map of texas cities.”
- a prefix connector type query pattern has the form: ⁇ BUSINESS ⁇ +connector+ ⁇ LOCATION ⁇ OR stopwords+ ⁇ LOCATION ⁇ +connector+ ⁇ BUSINESS ⁇ .
- the stopwords are removed and the query split according to the connector, e.g., into a ⁇ BUSINESS ⁇ component (the “ ⁇ what ⁇ ” query component) and a ⁇ LOCATION ⁇ component (the “ ⁇ where ⁇ ” query component).
- An example query in this form is “map of ⁇ BUSINESS ⁇ near ⁇ LOCATION ⁇ .”
- the system tokenizes the received query.
- Each token can correspond to a query term or phrase in the query.
- the query can then be represented by a vector of tokens. This vector can then be matched against the query patterns. Tokenizing each query allows all queries, even those in different languages, to be matched to one or more query patterns. For example, the query “pizza near new york” is tokenized into the vector ⁇ pizza> ⁇ near> ⁇ new york> which matches the query pattern form ⁇ what ⁇ ⁇ connector ⁇ ⁇ where ⁇ for the connector “near”.
- the system splits 206 the query into query components according to the matching query pattern for multiple corpora searching.
- a query can be split more than once depending on the matched query patterns.
- the connector pattern described above identifies a split at the connector.
- the pattern is split into query components corresponding to ⁇ what ⁇ and ⁇ where ⁇ .
- Each of these portions can be separately searched, for example, according to specialized indexes (e.g., a geocoding index).
- indexes e.g., a geocoding index
- the query “map of restaurants near times square” can be first split according to the prefix type query pattern to remove the “map of” stopwords.
- the remaining query portion “restaurants near times square” matches a connector type query pattern and can be split into query components “restaurants” and “times square” for searching.
- splitting_exact Different ways of splitting the query can be defined by the matching query pattern. For example, the “split_exact” query split type described above in the example query pattern only allows splits generated by the pattern. Any other query splits will be bypassed. Other query split types include “all,” “local,” and “geocode”. The “all” type of query split allows any types of splits in the query.
- the “local” type of query split only allows a nonempty ⁇ what ⁇ split.
- the ⁇ where ⁇ can be empty. This means that the query can be split in any manner as long as the split includes a nonempty ⁇ what ⁇ component (e.g., local splits).
- the query “phone number of ⁇ QUERY ⁇ ” can be split so that there is only a ⁇ where ⁇ portion, i.e., the ⁇ QUERY ⁇ .
- the query “phone number of city hall” does not include a ⁇ where ⁇ portion (e.g., the location can be implicit in the current map or user location information).
- the query “phone number of city hall in san Francisco” can be reduced by the patterns to “city hall in san Francisco” where the results of the query search must include a phone number.
- a “local” split indicates a search of a local index where results (e.g., businesses) are associated with information such as a phone number of the business. If the ⁇ where ⁇ query component is nonempty, the local results can be restricted by the location identified in the ⁇ where ⁇ query component.
- the “geocode” type of query split only allows an empty ⁇ what ⁇ split.
- the query can simply identify a location, e.g., by name or address.
- a location e.g., by name or address.
- a geocode index can be searched for the precise location corresponding to the input query component (e.g., so that the location can be displayed on a map). This index can also identify what is located at or nearby that address, e.g., San Francisco City Hall, without a specific ⁇ what ⁇ query component.
- the system searches 208 the corresponding indices for the respective query components of the split query.
- the query can be split more than once based on the applicable query patterns.
- Each portion of the query can be used to search an index for a particular corpus. For example, a query split into a ⁇ what ⁇ and a ⁇ where ⁇ according to a query pattern can be searched according to indices for two different corpora, e.g., a geocoding index for the ⁇ what ⁇ and a local search index for the ⁇ where ⁇ of the query.
- the system presents 210 one or more search results responsive to the input query.
- the system combines results from the split query components submitted as separate searches in a specified order to identify search results responsive to the query.
- the result can include ranked, e.g., based on how well results match the query and only a specified number of top ranked results presented.
- the search order first searches the ⁇ where ⁇ component followed by the ⁇ what ⁇ component as restricted by the ⁇ where ⁇ component. For example, given the query “pizza near times square” the system searched for both results responsive to “pizza” and the location of “times square”. The query portion “times square” is searched first to identify the geolocation (e.g., in a geocode index) to retrieve geographic information associated with “times square.” The query portion “pizza” is then searched with the geo-restriction near “times square”.
- Search results responsive to pizza e.g., pizza restaurants, having addresses corresponding to a specified distance from “times square” can be presented as search results.
- Presentation of the search results can include displaying the location of each respective pizza restaurant on a map of Manhattan where the displayed pizza restaurants are located near times square.
- FIG. 3 is an screenshot 300 of an example map search result for a query.
- screenshot 300 shows the search result for the map query “city hall san francisco”.
- the search query e.g., entered into search field 302
- information responsive to the query is displayed including associated with city hall and links to resources responsive to the query.
- a query pattern in a given language may no longer provide accurate results when the query is received in another language.
- the structure of one language may not match the given query pattern translated into another language.
- FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an example process 400 for identifying translated query patterns.
- the search process 400 will be described with respect to a system (e.g., a system including one or more computing devices) that performs the process 400 .
- the system receives 402 a query pattern in a first language.
- a query pattern can be selected or received from a collection of English language query patterns.
- the English language query pattern can be the “near” connector pattern that satisfies queries having the form ⁇ what ⁇ near ⁇ where ⁇ .
- the system identifies 404 a collection of queries in the first language matching the query pattern.
- a query log of queries can be used to identify queries matching the query pattern. Matching the queries to the query pattern can be performed using the vectors of tokens as described above. For example, the query pattern can be applied to each of a specific number of tokenized queries from the query log to identify matches to the query pattern.
- the collection of queries are top queries in the query log matching the query pattern, for example, top 1000 matching queries based on frequency of the queries in the query log.
- One or more additional criteria can be used in selecting the matching queries from the query log. For example, a length restriction on the queries can be applied.
- the length restriction can require a minimum threshold query length, e.g., four terms.
- the length restriction can be used to ensure sufficient query context to correctly translate the query.
- Empirical data can be used to identify a minimum query length that results in a maximum translation error rate.
- Example queries matching the above shown query pattern are:
- the system annotates 406 each query in the collection of queries.
- the queries are annotated with particular labels that identify parts of the query.
- the labels are specified in accordance with the query pattern components, e.g., ⁇ prefix ⁇ ⁇ suffix ⁇ ⁇ query ⁇ and ⁇ connector ⁇ .
- the annotations are taken from the query pattern and matched to the corresponding query terms.
- the query “pizza near times square” can be annotated with the labels ⁇ what ⁇ ⁇ connector ⁇ ⁇ where ⁇ from the matching query pattern.
- the query “where is Pizza City” can be annotated with the labels ⁇ prefix ⁇ ⁇ query ⁇ .
- the system translates 408 the collection of queries in the first language into a translated collection of queries in a second language. For example, statistical machine translation techniques can be used to translate the queries.
- the queries are submitted to a translation system that returns the translated queries.
- the system translates the queries. Additionally, the label terms in the annotations can also be translated from the first language to the second language.
- Statistical machine translation translate a sequence of input words in a source language to a sequence of translated words in a target language.
- Statistical machine translation depends on statistical models that are based on prior probabilities and statistical correlations between the occurrences of words in training corpora.
- Conventional applications of statistical machine translation assume that both the source and target languages are distinct natural languages (e.g., French, English, German, or Arabic). For example, a collection of English language queries corresponding to a particular English language query pattern can be translated into a collection of Chinese language queries.
- the system aligns 410 the translated collection of queries.
- the translated collection of queries are aligned with respect to the annotations, which have been retained for the translated queries.
- the most common term in the translated collection of queries is identified.
- the most common term is likely to be the pattern term (e.g., a trigger term that is common to queries of the patter, for example, the specific connecter term in a connector query pattern).
- the most common term is likely the translation for “near” since it occurs in each query in the collection of queries.
- the relative positions of the annotations can be determined such as ⁇ where ⁇ and ⁇ what ⁇ based on a matching between the translated term on the translated labels.
- the corresponding translated text for portions of the query pattern can be identified, for example, what translated text corresponds to the “what” portion of the original English language query and what translated text corresponds to the “where” portion of the original English language query.
- the system extracts 412 a translated query pattern from the aligned translated collection of queries. Based on the term alignment of each query, the system can determine the form that the majority of the queries agree on (e.g., some specified threshold amount of queries in the collection of translated queries). Continuing with the example, the majority of the translated queries can be found to match the common pattern of:
- a threshold is used because there can be queries that match the query pattern but result in an erroneous aligned translation. However, these can be discounted or ignored as long as the threshold number of queries match the pattern.
- the annotated English query “day cares ⁇ what ⁇ near ⁇ connector ⁇ 111 riverroad, Houston, Tex. ⁇ where ⁇ ” matches the query pattern.
- the Simplified Chinese translation of this query is ⁇ what ⁇ ⁇ connector ⁇ 111 riverroad, ⁇ where ⁇ , which does not match the pattern form.
- the system can cross-validate the translated query pattern with a query log of the second language to ensure that queries matching the pattern occur with a threshold frequency. For example, the appearance of the pattern where * is one or more terms, in the query logs can be checked to determine whether the pattern occurs with enough frequency to validate the pattern.
- the extracted pattern can be written in protobuffer form as:
- the system uses 414 the translated query pattern to interpret received queries in the second language matching the translated query pattern.
- the system can use the translated query pattern in a similar manner as the query pattern in the first language.
- the matching query can be split into components according to the matching query pattern and used to search one or more indexes associated with the split components. The process can be repeated to generate a corresponding group of query patterns in the second language for use in interpreting a broad range of input queries in the second language.
- Some additional example protobuffer format query patterns are provided below in several languages for the “near” connector. Each of these query patterns can be automatically generated given a base query pattern (e.g., given the English language query pattern, corresponding patterns can be identified for Spanish, French, and German, among other languages).
- Embodiments of the subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
