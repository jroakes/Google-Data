- a user 101 may send a user query 124 to the search engine 102.
- the user query 124 may be, for example, a query about a music track, a music album, or a music artist.
- the search engine 102 may obtain one or more documents 130 (D1 , Dn) that satisfy the user query 124.
- the raw music database 104 may use track data module 1 16 and communicate track-related documents 130, which satisfy the user query 124 (e.g., if the query is about a specific song title, the returned documents 130 may be information on songs with the same title but taken from various albums and/or music artists).
- the search engine 102 receives the documents 130, a popularity score may be calculated for each of the documents, and the popularity score may be used to calculate the final ranking scores 126, 128 for the documents and output a ranked search results list to the user 101 .
- the search engine 102, the raw music database 104 and the query independent scores module 1 10 are illustrated as separate blocks, the present disclosure may not be limited in this regard. More specifically, the raw music database 104 and the query independent scores module 1 10 may be part of, and implemented within, the search engine 102.
- the sparse information retrieval system 100 is implemented as music-related information retrieval system (e.g., the search engine 102 is a music search engine), other types of information retrieval systems may also be implemented in similar fashion.
- the database 104 may be books- (or printed media-) related database (or any other type of media-related database).
- the search engine 102 may then use a popularity engine 106 to calculate popularity scores and rank various categories of documents available from the raw database 104, in response to a user search query 124.
- the information retrieval system 100 (including the search engine 102 may be implemented) in one or more network devices.
- FIG. 1 B is a block diagram of an example implementation of a query independent scores module, in accordance with an example embodiment of the disclosure.
- the query independent scores module 1 10 may comprise suitable circuitry, logic and/or code and may be used to communicate one or more query independent scores for a given document, which may be used by the search engine ranker 108 to generate the final ranking scores 126, 128 of documents D1 , Dn. More specifically, the query independent scores module 1 10 may comprise a user query location module 202, an album release data module 204, a sell count module 206, and a play count module 208.
- Each of the modules 202-208 may comprise suitable circuitry, logic and/or code and may be operable to provide user query location information, album release data information, sell count information, or play count information, respectively, to the search engine ranker 108 for purposes of increasing the total ranking score of a given document. For example, if the user query 124 is about a specific music track by a given artist, the raw music database may locate and return back to the search engine 102 two tracks with the desired title and by the desired artist (e.g., the artist may have released the same song in 2 different languages, for two different geographic markets).
- the popularity scores returned by the popularity engine 106 may be the same for both tracks (the same album and the same artist may result in the same total popularity score after the album and artist popularity scores are compounded for each track).
- the user query location module 202 may be used to communicate the geographic location of the user query 124 (e.g., the location may be obtained based on the IP address of the user 101 sending the search query 124). If the geographic location is the same as one of the two geographic markets intended by the two versions of the song, then the track recorded in the same language as the language of the geographic location the user query 124 was received from may be given an additional score and, therefore, ranked higher in the final ranking score list 126, 128.
- query independent score module 1 10 Even though only four query independent scores 202-208 are listed with regard to the query independent score module 1 10, the present disclosure is not limiting in this regard, and other query independent scores may also be utilized by the search engine 102 in generating the final ranking scores 126, 128.
