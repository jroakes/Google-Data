- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an example computer system that can be utilized to implement the systems and methods described herein.
- FIG. 1 is an example environment 100 in which a content source bundling system can be used.
- a content source bundle is a collection of identifiers of content sources such as uniform resource locators (URLs) or references to web properties, e.g., websites, on the Internet.
- the content source bundle may further include references to magazines, newspapers, video games, and other non-online sources.
- a content source bundle can, for example, be user generated, and be designed to represent the websites and other content sources that users with a particular interest, or of a particular demographic, are likely to frequent.
- Content source bundles may be created by users who themselves have the particular interest, or are of the particular demographic.
- these content source bundles can be used by entities to place targeted content on the web properties and non-online content sources, such as magazines and newspapers, identified by or associated with the bundles.
- the content source bundles can be used by advertisers in targeted advertising campaigns to place advertisements in webpages and other content sources identified by or associated with the content source bundles.
- other types of content instead of advertisements can be targeted.
- the targeted content may further include streaming audio/video content, and Really Simple Syndication (RSS) provided content, for example.
- RSS Really Simple Syndication
- a sports videogame enthusiast may visit a variety of sports videogame websites and read sports videogame related periodicals. These websites may include blogs focused on sports videogames, sports videogame themed message boards, and sports videogame focused videogame review websites.
- the websites and periodicals may further include non-sports videogame websites and periodicals that may nonetheless be frequently viewed by sports videogame enthusiasts. For example, sports videogame enthusiasts may visit certain fantasy football websites or sports magazines
- An advertiser promoting a sports videogame may wish to conduct a targeted advertising campaign for the sports videogame.
- Typical methods for conducting a targeted advertising campaign include targeting the advertisements to webpages based on a determined context of the webpage.
- the context of a webpage may be determined, for example, by referring to a known or previously determined context of the webpage, or by analyzing the content of the webpage for keywords.
- the keywords can be used to determine the likely topic or context of the webpage and to select and display content appropriate targeted content (e.g., advertisements) on the webpage.
- the targeted advertisement for the sports videogame might be displayed on websites containing keywords such as “sports” and “videogames.”
- Such automated targeting may be over inclusive in that the advertisements may be displayed to users having a low interest in the displayed advertisements despite the presence of the particular keywords on the webpage.
- a role playing game website might receive targeted advertisements related to the sports videogame, but the interest in the sports videogames of the demographic that frequents the role-playing game website may be relatively low, as members of that demographic may be primarily interested in role-playing videogames.
- the advertisers may contract with content source bundle authors to use content source bundles to identify the websites and other content sources that are relevant to a particular interest or demographic. For example, a sports video game enthusiast may be able to readily identify certain websites and magazines that are frequented by other users sharing the same interests. Continuing the example described above, the sports videogame enthusiast is likely to be a very good source for the websites and periodicals that typical sports videogame enthusiasts frequent. The sports videogame enthusiast may take the list of websites that he or she typically visits (from a browser's “favorites” list or bookmarked files, for example) and generate a content source bundle that includes data that identifies those websites.
- the enthusiast may also include a list of magazines, newspapers, and television programs that the enthusiasts reads or watches.
- the sports videogame content source bundle may be presented to advertisers at a content source bundle interface through which advertisers can browse and search for content source bundles that target a desired user group or demographic to use for a targeted advertising campaign. The advertisers may select content source bundles of interest for use in such campaigns.
- a content source bundling system that facilitates the creation and use of content source bundles is shown in example environment 100 of FIG. 1 .
- the content source bundling system 130 is described with reference to bundling content sources to facilitate the serving of advertisements, the serving of other content items from other content item providers can also be facilitated by content source bundles, e.g., financial news stories, photographs, free games or utilities, etc.

- the advertisements may include a variety of advertisement formats and types such as text advertisements, graphic advertisements, audio advertisements and video advertisements, for example.
- the advertisement server 120 may further collect and store statistics about the stored advertisements.
- the collected statistics may describe the performance of the advertisements displayed on the websites or other content sources from the publisher servers 110 a - c and/or client devices 102 a - c .
- the collected statistics may include, for example, click-through rate (number of times an advertisement is selected/number of times it is displayed), impression rate (number of times advertisements are shown on a webpage/time), and conversion rate (number of times a click-through of an advertisement results in a goal being achieved (e.g., a purchase)).
- the environment 100 further includes a content source bundler 130 .
- the content source bundler 130 stores content source bundles (e.g., content source bundles 132 a and 132 b ) in a data store.
- the content source bundles may include URLs corresponding to websites associated with the content source bundle as well as descriptions and keywords describing the target user group or demographic of the content source bundle.
- the content source bundles may also include references to non-website content sources such as newspapers, television programs, and magazines, for example.
- Other implementations and data structures can also be used, e.g., the content source bundles can be a hash index to reduce file size and/or can include encrypted data.
- the content source bundler 130 facilitates the creation of content source bundles by authors.
- the authors may create the content source bundles using client devices, such as client devices 102 a and 102 b.
- an author may use client device 102 a to connect to the content source bundler 130 to generate a content source bundle 132 a .
- the content source bundle 132 a may be created at the content source bundler 130 by a user of the client device 102 a using a user interface similar to the user interface 300 illustrated in FIG. 3 , for example.
- an author may use client device 102 b to create a content source bundle 132 b .
- the content source bundle 132 b may be generated at the client device 102 b using a toolbar integrated into an Internet browser, for example.
- the content source bundle author visits a website that they would like to include in a content source bundle, they may activate a button on the toolbar resulting in the content source being added to one or more specified content source bundles (e.g., content source bundle 132 b ).
- the generated content source bundle 132 b may then be uploaded and stored at the content source bundler 130 .
- the authors may specify one or more of the websites or other content sources from the publisher servers 110 a - c to include in a generated content source bundle 132 .

- the content source bundler 130 may further allow advertisers 108 a and 108 b to select one or more stored content source bundles 132 to associate with a targeted advertising campaign.
- the advertisers 108 a and 108 b may browse and select available content source bundles from the content source bundler 130 using a user interface similar to the user interface 500 shown in FIG. 5 , for example.
- the advertisers 108 a and 108 b may select one or more content source bundles 132 to use for a targeted advertising campaign using the description or keywords provided by the content source bundle authors or other information gathered from the content source bundles.
- an advertiser 108 may connect to the content source bundler 130 to find a content source bundle 132 to use for a targeted advertising campaign for a high-end cooking tool.
- the advertiser may search for a relevant bundle by specifying keywords such as “food” or “cooking”.
- the advertiser may use the bundle to assist in specifying the advertisements from the advertisement server 120 to use in the targeted advertising campaign (e.g., displayed on the content source s referenced in the selected content source bundle).
- a client device such as client device 102 c
- the publisher server 110 can receive the request and retrieve a webpage from the website identified by the request for processing.
- one or more scripts corresponding to portions of the webpage reserved for targeted advertisements may be encountered.
- the publisher server 110 may make a request for one or more targeted advertisements, or other targeted content, from the advertisement server 120 .
- the advertisement server 120 can determine if the webpage being processed by the publisher server 110 is referenced in a content source bundle 132 associated with a targeted advertising campaign by communicating with the content source bundler 130 . If the website is associated with a content source bundle 132 and a targeted advertising campaign, then one or more advertisements associated with the campaign are sent by the advertisement server 120 to the publisher server 110 .
- the publisher server 110 may receive the advertisements, combine the advertisements with the requested webpage, and send the combined webpage and advertisements to the requesting client device 102 c.
- the content source bundler 130 may further provide performance bundle metrics describing the performance of the content source bundles 132 with respect to associated targeted advertising campaigns. Examples of such metrics include click-through rate, impression rate, and conversion rate. Other metrics can also be used. For example, where the content sources are non-Internet sources, the metrics may include biographical data about the readers or viewers of the content sources and the circulation size of the content source. The collected metrics may be presented to advertisers when browsing available content source bundles to help the advertisers select content source bundles to use with a targeted advertising campaign, for example.
- the content source bundler 130 may provide other information about the content source bundles 132 including pageview forecasting, contextual analysis information related to the theme of the content source bundle, and category or content display formatting information, for example. In addition, the content source bundler 130 may display the particular websites or content sources making up the content source bundles 132 to allow the advertisers to customize the bundles by adding or removing particular websites and content sources.
- the content source bundler 130 may further facilitate payment for the content source bundle by an advertiser (or a third party intermediary) to the author of the content source bundle 132 .
- the payment may be based on the performance of the targeted advertisements displayed on the content sources associated with the content source bundle 132 (e.g., the performance metrics).
- the payment provided by the advertiser to the author may be based on a variety of performance metrics, including, but not limited to, pay-per-impression, pay-per-click, and pay-per-conversion.
- the content source bundle author may be paid based on a percentage of the fees that the advertiser pays to the owners of the content sources referenced in content source bundle. For example, if during some period of time the advertiser pays $50,000 to the owners of the content sources in the bundle for advertisements displayed during the targeted advertising campaign, then the content source bundle author may receive some percentage of the $50,000 as payment for use of the bundle.
- the content source bundle author may be paid a flat fee per targeted advertising campaign that uses the author's bundle. For example, if the fee for using a bundle for a targeted advertising campaign is $500, and the content source bundle was used in 10 targeted advertising campaigns, then the content source bundle author would receive $5000.
- the publisher servers 110 a - c , the advertisement server 120 , and the content source bundler 130 may be implemented on single computer systems, or as a distributed computer system comprising multiple computers (e.g., a server farm).
- the advertisement server 120 , and the content source bundler 130 may be implemented as components of the same computer or as components of a distributed computer system.
- An example computer system implementation is illustrated in FIG. 6 , for example.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process flow 200 for generating a content source bundle.
- the process 200 can, for example, be implemented in the content source bundler 130 of FIG. 1 and in one or more client devices 102 of FIG. 1 .
- Content sources for a bundle are selected ( 202 ).
- a client device 102 can receive user inputs from an author to select a website that is displayed on a client device for inclusion into a content source bundle.
- the author may select websites or other content sources related to a particular subject or interest that the author is an expert or enthusiast of. For example, an author who is an automotive enthusiast may select websites that they visit regularly and periodicals that they read regularly to create a content source bundle that may be used to target other automotive enthusiasts. Because the author is an automotive enthusiast, the author may know and regularly view a set of websites and other content sources that are frequented by other automobile enthusiasts.
- the content source bundles may then be used for a targeted advertising campaign for automobiles.
- the author may select a variety of website types for the content source bundle. These may include blogs, commercial websites, message boards, etc.
- the author may also select a variety of other content sources such as newspapers, television shows, and magazines, for example.
- the author may select websites and content sources only directed to a particular subject or interest, or the author may include websites and content sources that are likely to be viewed by a person interested the particular subject or topic, but that may not be directed to the particular subject or interest.
- the author may be a regular visitor to the website of a certain rock band, and may know that many of the fans of the band are also automotive enthusiasts. Because some viewers of the rock band website are also automotive enthusiasts, the author may include the rock band website in the content source bundle.
- the author may select the websites and other content sources by entering the URLs and other indicators of content sources into a user interface such as the user interface 300 shown in FIG. 3 , for example.
- URLs may be uploaded from a favorites or bookmarks file associated with the author.

- the submitted bundle may optionally be initially ranked ( 208 ).
- the content source bundle may be ranked by the content source bundler 130 .
- many of the individual content source s referenced in the content source bundle may have performance data associated with them that describes the performance of advertisements previously displayed on the content sources.
- the performance data may be stored at the advertisement 120 , for example.
- the data where available, may be used to create an initial rating or ranking of the bundle that can be used to help an advertiser determine if they want to use the bundle for their targeted advertising campaign.
- the data may be retrieved from the advertisement server 120 by the content source bundler 130 and used to create the initial content source bundle ranking.
- the author of the content source bundle may have generated content source bundles that were used for previous or ongoing targeted advertising campaigns.
- the relative success of the author's previous content source bundles in those advertising campaigns may be used to assign an initial ranking to the new content source bundle.
- Ranking the content source bundle based on the author's previous content source bundles may be done exclusively, or in addition to, ranking the content source bundle based on the performance of past advertisements.
- Ranking the content source bundle based on the past performance of an author's bundles may be performed by the content source bundler 130 using performance data associated with the author stored at the content source bundler 130 , for example.
- the generated content source bundle is presented for advertiser selection ( 210 ).
- the content source bundle may be presented to an advertiser 108 a by the content source bundler 130 through a user interface similar to the user interface 500 illustrated in FIG. 5 , for example.
- an advertiser may wish to target advertisements to car enthusiasts. Accordingly, the advertiser may access an application or website to search for available content source bundles to use for the targeted advertising campaign.
- the advertiser may search available bundles by keyword or description. Continuing the example described above, the advertiser may search for bundles containing the keywords “automobile” or “car”. Matching content source bundles may then be presented to the advertiser. In some implementations, the advertisers may search for bundles by providing a URL of a website. Keywords associated with the website may then be used to locate relevant bundles. In other implementations, the advertiser may upload or present an advertisement to be used in a targeted advertising campaign. Keywords or context information may be identified from the advertisements and used to search for relevant bundles.
- the content source bundles are presented to the advertisers along with various data associated with the content source bundles.
- the data presented may include a rating or ranking of the content source bundle author based on the performance of other content source bundles created by the author.
- the data may additionally include statistics about the performance of the content source bundle such as click-through rate, total number of conversions, total number of impressions, etc.
- initial statistics may be presented based on the performance of advertisements on the individual websites or other content sources that make up the bundle or based on past performance of content source bundles created by the author, for example.
- the ranking data may also include a relevancy ranking relating to the advertiser's target criteria based on, for example, keywords associated with bundles, the content sources identified by the bundle, and the similarity of the bundle to other bundles used in for campaigns having the same target criteria.
