Definitions
- Text mining involves the processing of text data to make the text data suitable for one or more applications such as, for example, text classification, text clustering, information retrieval, and/or key phrase detection. Text mining attempts to represent unstructured text data in a structured format that can be processed meaningfully for one or more text mining applications.
- Bag-of-Words One text representation is called the “Bag-of-Words” model or the “Vector Space” model.
- Bag-of-Words all unique words in a document are given a weight that is based on three factors: (a) the number of times the word occurred in the various fields of the document, (b) the importance of the field(s) in which the word occurred in the document, and/or (c) the document frequency of the word in the corpus (e.g., the number or fraction of documents in the corpus that contain the word at least once).
- a word in a document will receive a higher relative weight in the Bag-of-Words model if it occurs more often, in more important fields in the document (document centric weight component) and rarely in the corpus (corpus centric weight component).
- Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) is an example of such a representation that combines the document centric weight component with the corpus centric weight component for each unique word in the document.

- the content database 315 may include a plurality of word groupings of one or more tags for media (e.g., videos, images, sounds), all the unique tags may form the vocabulary of words, and the plurality of word groupings may form the corpus.
- the content database 315 may include a plurality of documents each having a plurality of words, the unique words may form the vocabulary of words, and the plurality of documents may form the corpus.
- Each of the documents may include all or portions of one or more documents such as, for example, HTML documents, PDF documents, DOC documents, query documents, keyword documents, and/or media tag documents.

Also, for example, in some implementations the vocabulary of key words may be derived from one or more preexisting listings of words. For example, a preexisting listing of words that includes a plurality of words from a language that have optionally been modified utilizing canonicalization rules may be utilized.

- the number of word groupings in a corpus in which both words in the word pair co-occur is determined.
- the co-occurrence relationship determination engine 310 may identify the number of word groupings in a corpus in which both words in the word pair co-occur.
- the word groupings of the corpus may include any grouping of words for which it may be desirable to perform text mining to rank words in the grouping of words.
- one or more of the word groupings of the corpus may include: a plurality of tags for media such as, for example images, videos, and/or sounds; a multi-word query such as, for example, a search engine query; adwords such as, for example, a set of keywords associated with an advertisement; a plurality of words from a field in a document such as, for example, a set of keywords in a title, URL, and/or anchor; a plurality of words of a document such as, for example, all or a set of words in an entire document; and/or a plurality of keywords such as, for example, a set of explicitly annotated keywords in a document such as, for example, named entities in a news story, MeSH terms in Medline data, and/or keywords in a scientific publication.
- a multi-word query such as, for example, a search engine query

- an un-weighted count of the number of word groupings in the corpus in which both words in the word pair co-occurs is determined.
- a count of the number of word groupings in the corpus in which “bird” and “feather” both occur will be determined. This is done for each of the identified word pairs in the corpus.
- a weighted count of the number of word groupings in the corpus in which both words in the word pair co-occurs is determined.
- the weighted count still determines the number of word groupings in which the word pair occurs, but in doing so also takes into account an independence presumption based weight of one or both words in the word pair in each of the word groupings in which the word pair occurs.
- the independence presumption based weighted count of a word pair in a word grouping may take into account one or more independence based presumptions such as property weighting (e.g., how often the word occurs in the word grouping, how early the word occurs in the word grouping, and/or decorations applied to the word in the word grouping (bold, italics, font, etc.), field weighting (e.g., does the word occur in an important field such as the title), and/or corpus weighting (e.g., is the word a rare word in the corpus) of one or both words in the word pair.
- property weighting e.g., how often the word occurs in the word grouping, how early the word occurs in the word grouping, and/or decorations applied to the word in the word grouping (bold, italics, font, etc.
- field weighting e.g., does the word occur in an important field such as the title
- corpus weighting e.g., is the word a rare
- a count of the number of word groupings in the corpus in which “bird” and “feather” both occur will be determined that takes into account the independence presumption based weight of “bird” and “feather” in each of the word groupings.
- a weighted count of the number of word groupings in the corpus in which both words in the word pair co-occur is determined using the following equation:
- w l n is based on the independence presumption based weighted count of a word in a word grouping that may take into account one or more independence based presumptions such as property weighting, field weighting, and/or corpus weighting of the word.
- at least some the independence presumption based weights for the words may be provided.
- the weights may be provided in combination with the vocabulary of words (e.g., a term frequency weight may be provided with each of the words of the vocabulary of words, a term frequency—inverse document frequency weight may be provided with each of the words of the vocabulary of words, and/or other assigned or determined weight may be provided with each of the words of the vocabulary of words).
- the independence presumption based weights may additionally or alternatively be determined via analysis of the vocabulary of words in the corpus (e.g., by the co-occurrence relationship determination engine 310 ).
- a default weight e.g. 1, 1 may be assigned to such words.
- g (w n (v ⁇ ),w n (v ⁇ )) may be the arithmetic mean of the two weights
- g (w n (v ⁇ ),w n (v ⁇ )) may be the geometric mean of the two weights ( ⁇ square root over (w ⁇ w ⁇ ) ⁇ ).
- other calculations of the two weights may be utilized such as, for example, other asymmetric monotonic functions of the two weights.
- weighted count it may be desirable to utilize a weighted count. Also, for example, in some implementations where independence presumption based weighting is provided in combination with the vocabulary of words, it may be desirable to utilize a weighted count.
- a co-occurrence count matrix may optionally be formed in step 115 that identifies the number (either weighted or un-weighted) of word groupings in the corpus in which each of the identified word pairs co-occurs.
- the co-occurrence relationship determination engine 310 may form the co-occurrence count matrix in step 115 .
- the co-occurrence count matrix may be size M by M, where M is the number of unique words from the identified word pairs from the vocabulary of words. In some implementations pruning of certain word pairs from the count of the number of word groupings in the corpus in which both words in the word pair co-occurs may occur.
- the threshold number may be a set number (e.g., 30).
- the threshold number may be statistically determined (e.g., statistical outliers or a set deviation from a statistical mean or medium).
- an existing co-occurrence count matrix may optionally be modified. For example, as a corpus of groupings of words grows and adds new groupings of words, it may be desirable to update the co-occurrence count matrix with the new groupings of words.
- to update the co-occurrence count matrix for each of a plurality of identified word pairs in the new grouping of words the number of word groupings in the new grouping in which both words in the word pair co-occurs is determined (e.g., as described, for example, with respect to step 110 ) to create a new grouping co-occurrence count matrix of the new grouping of words.
- the new grouping co-occurrence count matrix may then be added to the already existing co-occurrence count matrix to thereby update the co-occurrence count matrix.
- New groupings of words may be added to the co-occurrence count matrix on one or more of a variety of bases. For example, in some implementations new groupings of words may be added every hour, every day, every week, as soon as a new groupings of words is received, as soon as 1,000 new groupings of words are received, etc.
- the co-occurrence count matrix may be updated to reflect the removal of such groupings of words.
- the number of word groupings in a corpus in which both words in the word pair co-occurs is determined (e.g., as described, for example, with respect to step 110 to create a new grouping co-occurrence count matrix of the removed grouping of words.
- the new grouping co-occurrence count matrix may then be subtracted from the already existing co-occurrence count matrix to thereby update the co-occurrence count matrix.
- Groupings of words may be removed from the co-occurrence count matrix on one or more of a variety of bases. For example, in some implementations groupings of words may be removed when the content with which they are associated is deleted, may be removed on a first-in-first-out basis in which the corpus is set to maintain a fixed amount of the most recent word groupings, and/or may be removed after being a part of the corpus utilized for more than a certain time period (e.g., more than a day, more than a week, more than two years).
- a certain time period e.g., more than a day, more than a week, more than two years.
- the marginal counts for each word from the word pairs are determined, a total count for the words from the word pairs are determined, and probabilities are determined.
- the co-occurrence relationship determination engine 310 may manipulate the co-occurrence count matrix optionally created in step 115 to determine marginal counts for each word, determine a total count for the words, and determine probabilities.
- a marginal count for a word may be determined by summing the number (either weighted or un-weighted) of word groupings determined in step 110 in which the word was part of a word pair in a word grouping. For example, if the word “bird” occurred only with the word “sky” in 5 word groupings in a corpus, occurred with the word “feather” in 10 word groupings in the corpus, and appeared with the word “nest” in 7 word groupings in the corpus (and did not co-occur with any other words), then the marginal count for the unweighted count of the word “bird” would be 22 (5+10+7).
- the marginal counts may be determined by summing each row in the co-occurrence count matrix.
- co-occurrence marginal counts may be determined using the following equation:
- ⁇ ⁇ ( v ⁇ ) ⁇ v ⁇ ⁇ V ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ v ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( v ⁇ , v ⁇ )
- Totals for all of the words may be determined by summing the number (either weighted or un-weighted) of all the various word groupings determined in step 110 in which an identified word pair was present. In some implementations the totals may be determined by summing all of the numerical elements in the co-occurrence count matrix. In some implementations the totals may be determined using the following equation:
- the determined marginal counts and totals may be utilized to normalize the co-occurrence count values to probabilities.
- a co-occurrence probability may be determined for each word pair by dividing the co-occurrence count for that word pair by the determined total co-occurrence counts for all word pairs. For example, in some implementations the co-occurrence probability for a word pair may be determined using the following equation:
- a marginal probability for each word may be determined by dividing the determined marginal count for that word by the determined total co-occurrence counts for all words. For example, in some implementations the marginal probability for a word may be determined using the following equation:
- smoothed versions of the counts for each word from the word pairs and/or total counts for the word pairs may be utilized.
- one or more smoothing mechanisms may be utilized to convert raw counts into probabilities such as, for example, Good-Turing smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing, and/or Witten-Bell smoothing.
- the co-occurrence relationship determination engine 310 may determine how much more likely than random it is for each word pair to co-occur in a word grouping. In some implementations it is determined for all of the word pairs how much more likely than random it is for each word pair to co-occur in a word grouping. For example, the co-occurrence probability of a word pair determined in step 120 may be compared to the marginal probabilities of the words of the word pair.
- the co-occurrence probability of a word pair compared to the marginal probabilities of the words of the word pair is relatively high, then it is likely that those words actually have a correlation and are not co-occurring just by random chance. If the co-occurrence probability of a word pair compared to the marginal probabilities of the words of the word pair is relatively low, then it is likely that many of the co-occurrences of those words is likely due to “incidental chance.” For example, two fairly common words such as “food” and “cars” may have a relatively high co-occurrence probability in a corpus due to the popularity of both of the terms. However, it is unlikely that the two words actually have a strong correlation to one another.
- the comparison of the co-occurrence probability to the marginal probabilities of the words of the word pair may be utilized to determine a co-occurrence consistency for each of the word pairs. For example, a calculation based on the ratio of the co-occurrence probability to the marginal probabilities of the words of the word pair may be the co-occurrence consistency for each of the word pairs. In some implementations the co-occurrence consistency for each of the word pairs may be determined using the following cosine equation:
- ⁇ ⁇ ( v ⁇ , v ⁇ ) P ⁇ ( v ⁇ , v ⁇ ) P ⁇ ( v ⁇ ) ⁇ P ⁇ ( v ⁇ )
- the co-occurrence consistency for each of the word pairs may be determined using the following pointwise mutual information equation:
- ⁇ ⁇ ( v ⁇ , v ⁇ ) log ⁇ ( P ⁇ ( v ⁇ , v ⁇ ) P ⁇ ( v ⁇ ) ⁇ P ⁇ ( v ⁇ ) )
- the co-occurrence consistency for each of the word pairs may be determined using the following Jaccard coefficient equation:
- ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ( v ⁇ , v ⁇ ) P ⁇ ( v ⁇ , v ⁇ ) P ⁇ ( v ⁇ ) + P ⁇ ( v ⁇ ) - P ⁇ ( v ⁇ , v ⁇ )
- a co-occurrence consistency matrix may optionally be formed in step 135 that identifies the co-occurrence consistency of the word pairs.
- the co-occurrence relationship determination engine 310 may form the co-occurrence consistency matrix in step 135 .
- the co-occurrence count matrix may be size M by M.
- the co-occurrence consistency matrix created in step 135 may optionally omit certain word pairs (either completely omit the word pairs or omit co-occurrence consistency data for certain word pairs) to omit those word pairs that are determined to have little correlation to one another.
- a co-occurrence consistency matrix is created, at least data associated those word pairs that have less than a threshold co-occurrence consistency value may be removed from the co-occurrence consistency matrix.
- the threshold co-occurrence consistency value may be a set number. For instance, when a cosine function is utilized to determine the co-occurrence consistency any co-occurrence consistency values below 0.1 may be removed from the co-occurrence consistency matrix.
- the threshold number may be empirically determined.
- FIG. 2 a flow chart illustrating steps of an implementation of ranking words in a word grouping as a function of which other words are present in the word grouping is illustrated.
- Other implementations may perform the steps in a different order, omit certain steps, and/or perform different and/or additional steps than those illustrated in FIG. 2 .

- a plurality of tags for an image may be provided and all of the tags may form the word grouping.
- a plurality of words in a document may be provided and one or more of the words of the document may form the word grouping. For instance, all the words of the document may form the word grouping, only identified keywords of the document may form the word grouping, only certain randomly selected words from the document may form the word grouping, or all the canonicalized words of the document may form the word grouping.

- co-occurrence consistencies are identified for all possible word pairs of the word grouping identified in step 200 .
- the co-occurrence consistencies may be identified from the co-occurrence consistency matrix created in step 125 of FIG. 1 .
- the co-occurrence consistency matrix may be stored in content database 315 and consulted to obtain co-occurrence consistencies for each of the word pairs of the identified word grouping.
- a co-occurrence consistency matrix for the identified word grouping may be created based on the co-occurrence consistency matrix created in step 125 of FIG. 1 .
- At step 210 at least one of an independence based document centric weight and an independence based corpus centric weight are identified.
- the contextual weighting engine 320 may identify the independence based document centric weight and/or the independence based corpus centric weight.

- at least some of the independence presumption based weights for the words may be provided.
- the weights may be provided in combination with the word grouping (e.g., a term frequency—inverse document frequency weight may be provided with each of the words of the word grouping).
- the word grouping may be previously weighted words from a web page.
- the independence based weights may additionally or alternatively be determined via analysis of the vocabulary of words in the corpus and/or consultation of a database.
- a default independence weight may be assigned to such words.
- a link analysis of the word grouping is performed utilizing at least one of the identified independence based document centric weights and independence based corpus centric component weights as a weighting factor and utilizing the identified co-occurrence consistencies as a weighting factor.
- the contextual weighting engine 320 may perform the link analysis.
- the link analysis may be performed via a random walk on the L by L matrix (where L is the number of words in the word grouping) that may be extracted from a corpus co-occurrence consistency matrix (e.g., extracted from the co-occurrence consistency matrix created in step 135 ).
- the prior probability of the random walk may be made proportional to the independence based weights of the words of the word grouping.
- the probability of picking one of the words from all of the words in the word grouping may be made proportional to the independence based weight of that word relative to the sum of all independence based weights in the word grouping.
- the prior of the random walk may be represented by the following equation:
- f ⁇ may optionally be omitted.
- Other implementations may utilize other monotonic functions.
- I ⁇ ⁇ D ⁇ ⁇ F ⁇ ( v m ) log ⁇ ( N + 1 N ⁇ ( v m ) + 1 ) ; and/or a term frequency—inverse document frequency of a word utilized in an independence based weight may be determined using, for example, the following equation:
- the transition probability from one word of the word grouping to another word of the word grouping may be made proportional to the co-occurrence consistency between the two words.
- the probability of transitioning from one of the words to another of the words in the word grouping may be made proportional to the co-occurrence consistency between those words. Accordingly, from a word, the probability of transitioning to a word with high co-occurrence consistency will be greater than the probability of transitioning to a word with low co-occurrence consistency.
- the transition probability of the random walk may be represented by the following equation:
- ⁇ (x i ,x j ) is the co-occurrence consistency and where f ⁇ , is a monotonic function.
- f ⁇ may optionally be omitted.
- Other implementations may utilize other monotonic functions.
- the link analysis may be represented by the following iterative equation, with t being the iteration number:
- x j ) ⁇ may be selected to set the relative weighting between the independence based weighting of the word (P 0 (x i )) and the dependence/co-occurrence based weighting of the word (P(x j ) P(x i
- ⁇ may be selected based on one or more characteristics of the word grouping.

- the link analysis may optionally be performed in real time application such as, for example, analysis of a submitted query (e.g., to determine contextual weighting of the words of the query).
- the link analysis algorithm may be an algorithm such as a PageRank algorithm. For example, the link analysis algorithm may assign a numerical weighting to each word of a word grouping based on the links between that word and other words of the word grouping.
- the initial probability of a given word may be based on the independence based weighting of the word and the transition probability from that word to another word of the word grouping may be based on the co-occurrence consistency between the two words.
- link analysis algorithms may additionally or alternatively be utilized while factoring in both an independence based weighting factor and a co-occurrence probability weighting factor to obtain link analysis results for a word grouping.

Abstract
Description
function of the two weights; where va is a first word of a word pair and vβ is a second word of the word pair; where N is the number of word groupings in the corpus; xn is the nth word grouping; where xl n is the lth word in the nth word grouping; and where wl n is the weight of the lth word in the nth word grouping.
In some implementations g (wn(vα),wn(vβ)) may be the geometric mean of the two weights (√{square root over (wαwβ)}). In other implementations other calculations of the two weights may be utilized such as, for example, other asymmetric monotonic functions of the two weights.
Φ=[Ø(v α ,v β)]:∀(v α ,v β)εV×V
where w is the independence based weight and where fλ is a monotonic function. In some implementations fλ may optionally be omitted. In some implementations fλ may be an increasing monotonic function such as, for example, fλ(z)=e(λ×z) or fλ(z)=zλ. Other implementations may utilize other monotonic functions.
and/or a term frequency—inverse document frequency of a word utilized in an independence based weight may be determined using, for example, the following equation:
wherein wl n is the weight of the lth word in the nth document and may be based on, for example, in which fields the word occurs, how often the word occurs in those fields, how early the word occurs in those fields, and/or decorations applied to the word. wl n may optionally be omitted in some implementations.
θ may be selected to set the relative weighting between the independence based weighting of the word (P0(xi)) and the dependence/co-occurrence based weighting of the word (P(xj) P(xi|xj)). θ may be selected based on one or more characteristics of the word grouping. For example, in text mining applications where the rarity of a word is highly important, it may be desirable to provide the independence based weighting of the word (P0(xi), which may take into account inverse document frequency) with greater weight (e.g., a smaller θ). Also, for example, in text mining applications where it is desirable to downgrade the frequency of a word in a document, it may be desirable to provide the dependence based weighting of the word (P(xj) P(xi|xj)) with greater weight (e.g., a larger θ).
