- user interest in the section of the media item can relate to collective content consumer affinity for the section.
- user interest can be based in part on the ability of a user to replay and/or rewind a segment of media content.
- monitoring component 110 monitors content consumer interest in segments of media content based at least in part on content consumer traffic associated with respective segments of the media content.
- monitoring component 110 can determine user interest in a media item based on user interaction (e.g., fast forwarding to certain segments, time spent viewing certain sections, references to certain segments . . . ) with the media item. Any suitable type of information that can facilitate gleaning, determining, or inferring content consumer interest in respective media content segments can be utilized by the monitoring component 110 or rank component 120 .

- extrinsic information can include but is not limited to, world wide web (web) postings associated with segments of media content, clippings of segments of media content, or web links associated with the segments of the media content, user queries associated with the media content.
- extrinsic information can be employed by monitoring component 110 or rank component 120 to determine or infer content consumer interest in segments of the media content 170 . For example, multiple views of a particular segment of media content accompanied by postings of links to the particular segment of the media content and multiple search queries for the particular segment of the media content can be employed as a measure of content consumer interest in the particular segment of the media content.
- monitoring component 110 can monitor characteristics of the respective segments of the media content.
- a characteristic of the segment of the media content can include tags embedded in the media content.
- a tag can include metadata that identifies a data point or a segment of the media content.
- the tag can identify a data point or segment of media content as having a distinguishing characteristic (e.g., person, object, location, audio, scene, and event).
- the tags for example, can be user generated, computer generated or social network generated. In an aspect of user generated tags, tags can refer to information gathered from user interaction with the media content.
- the user interaction can be any number of traceable acts such as bookmarks, user queries, content published by user, user comments on content, user creation of content (e.g., uploading a video to a video distribution site), user created value-add content to existing content.

- monitoring component 110 monitors traffic and can predict quantity of future traffic associated with respective segments of media content.
- monitoring component 110 may monitor time-varying characteristics relating to “advertising traffic” for a particular segment of content.
- monitoring component 110 can monitor one or a combination of the following factors: (1) the extent to and rate at which advertisements are presented or updated by a given segment of media content over time; (2) the quality of the advertisers (e.g., a segment of content whose advertisements refer/link to documents known to analysis component 606 over time to have relatively high traffic and trust may be given relatively more weight than those segment of media content whose advertisements refer to low traffic/untrustworthy documents, such as a adult content site); and (3) the extent to which the segment of content generate user traffic to the advertisement which they relate (e.g., their click-through rate).
- monitoring component 110 predicts quantities of future traffic associated with respective segments of media content based on any one or more of the above advertising traffic characteristics as well as factors such as total number of monthly views, total number of unique monthly users, total number of impressions where one advertisement view is one impression (e.g. if a segment of content contains four advertisements there will be four impressions per segment of content view), number of fraudulent clicks, click-through rate (e.g. number of clicks on an advertisement divided by number of impressions), display time of advertisement, and other such factors.
- the monitoring component 110 or rank component 120 can identify segments of media where characteristics of the media segments drive content consumer traffic thereto. For example, advanced digital effects relating to a popular movie can be identified as a characteristic that is driving content consumer interest to the respective media segment.
- rank component 120 can be employed to rank respective segments of the media content 170 based at least in part on content consumer interest.
- the rank component 120 can be configured to rank a segment of media content based at least in part on user interest in that segment. In an aspect, ranking based at least in part on user interest can apply a priority scheme relating to recommended respective content segments of a media item. For example, for a media item, the rank component 120 can rank a user's interest in one segment as higher than another. In another aspect, the rank component 120 can rank content consumer interest in a segment of media content against one or more segments of media content from the same or different media items. For example, the rank component 120 can rank a first set of media content segment frames of a first media item higher or lower than a second set of content segment frames of a second media item. In yet another aspect, rankings can be multi-tiered.
- a segment of media content can be ranked against other segments as well as against segments of another media item based at least in part on viewing traffic.
- the rank component 120 can rank media segments based at least in part on a set of users, a subset of users, user preference, user historical preferences, user feedback, number of views, number of references, etc. Respective advertisements can be placed and/or priced in accordance with the rankings.
- system 100 further comprises a classifying component 130 .
- Classifying component 130 can be employed to classify respective segments of the media content 170 and/or advertisements to be placed or priced based at least in part on content consumer interest.
- the classifying component 130 can be configured to classify a segment of media content and/or advertisements to be placed or priced based at least in part on user interest in that segment.
- classification based at least in part on user interest can apply a categorization scheme relating to respective content segments of a media item. For example, for a media item, the classifying component 130 can classify a user's interest in one segment and/or advertisement within a category different from a user's interest in another segment (e.g.
- the classifying component 130 can classify content consumer interest in a segment of media content and/or advertisement against one or more segments of media content and/or advertisements from the same or different media items. For example, the classifying component 130 can classify a first set of media content segment frames of a first media item within a different category than a second set of content segment frames of a second media item.
- classifying component 130 can classify media content and/or advertisements to be placed or priced into genres or categories. Classifying component 130 may use the predetermined label categories to associate a genre with media content. For example, classifying component 130 may extract a title, words from the title, or other meta-data words associated with media content (e.g., videos, audio). The extracted words or identifiers may be associated with categories or genres in the predetermined label categories. Further, classifying component 130 can retrieve the associated segment of content from the predetermined label categories using extracted identifiers. In an example, any movie title or segment of content tagged with the words “Christmas,” “Thanksgiving,” and “Easter” are classified into a movie category labeled “holiday movies.”
- classifying component 130 can classify media content and/or advertisements to be placed or priced based on external information such as users social network labels (e.g. predetermined classifications labels). For example, classifying component 130 can use text analysis to determine classification labels to associate with user nodes in a generated social graph. The subject of the analysis can include media content and/or advertisements associated with user profiles, comments posted by a user (e.g. comments on a youtube video posted to user facebook account), descriptions of groups to which a user belongs, etc.
- predetermined classification labels for media content and/or advertisements can be based on keywords, which can be submitted by advertisers and/or users.
- the keywords can include the term “furniture.” This can be used as a predetermined classification label, which classifying component 130 associates with media content and/or advertisements to be placed or priced that include the term “furniture.” Additionally, classifying component 130 can classify media content and/or advertisements with associations to a label. For instance, classifying component 130 can classify under the label “furniture” advertisements that include words associated with “furniture,” such as chair, table, or home decorating.
- Classifying component 130 in connection with rank component 120 can also rank classified segments of media content and/or advertisements to be placed or priced based at least in part on content user interest. For instance, classifying component 130 can classify a group of segments of media content and rank component 120 can rank a segments of media content within the category based at least in part on user interest in that segment. In an aspect, classifying component 130 can classify, based at least in part on rankings from rank component 120 , categorized segments of media content and/or advertisements based at least in part on user interest and can apply a priority scheme relating to recommended respective content segments of a media item.
- the classifying component 130 can classify and the rank component 120 can rank a user's interest in one segment of content within a category as higher than another segment of content within the same category.
- the classifying component 130 can classify and the rank component 120 can rank content consumer interest in a categorized segment of media content and/or advertisements against one or more categorized segments of media content and/or advertisements from the same or different media items.
- the classification component can classify a first set of media content frames and the rank component 120 can rank a first set of categorized media content segment frames of a first media item higher or lower than a second set of categorized content segment frames of a second media item.
- advertising component 140 can match, place, and/or price respective advertisements to ranked segments of media content. Advertising is often conventionally presented to a general audience that may include many disinterested viewers and fail to include many interested viewers.
- System 100 identifies and ranks content of user interest and popular segments of media content that can be used to present advertisements likely to have impact on particular content consumers, relevant to user interest, and/or likely to capture content consumer attention.
- the advertising component 140 can determine good matches between respective advertisements, media segments, target audience, geography, user demographics, purchasing history, etc. in order to optimize advertising efficacy in connection with provisioning of content.
- the advertising component 140 can facilitate pricing of advertising impressions. For example, a content provider can charge a premium for display or clicking of an advertisement matched to a highly ranked segment as compared to a lowered ranked segment.
- Advertising component 140 can match, place and/or price advertisements based at least in part on classifying component 130 .
- classifying component 130 can classify segments of content according to various characters, and the advertising component 140 can match advertisements to the classified content based on similarity and/or relevance of the advertised products or services to the classification.
- advertising component 140 can match, place and/or price based at least in part on rank component 120 .
- rank component 120 ranks segments of content according to various factors (e.g. number of views) and advertising component 140 can match, place and/or price advertisements to the ranked content based on similarity and/or relevance of the advertised products or services to the classification.
- Advertising component 140 can access and/or utilize a variety of advertising information including information about how the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.), content to be associated with the advertisement (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, etc.), form of advertisements such as graphical advertisements, so-called banner advertisements, text only advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, etc.
- information about how the advertisements are to be rendered e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.
- content to be associated with the advertisement e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, etc.
- form of advertisements such as graphical advertisements, so-called banner advertisements, text only advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, etc.
- advertising component 140 can effect inventorying of advertisements, storing advertisement information, utilizing historical (e.g. statistical) information regarding advertisements, access and utilize advertisement targeting information (e.g. geo-targeting”), perform cost determination operations, allow advertisers to interface with the component, and contain billing operations.
- advertising component 140 can match, place, and/or price respective advertisements to ranked segments of media content in connection with the rank component 120 and/or classified segments of media content in connection with classifying component 130 .
- Advertising component 140 can match, place, and/or price advertised products and/or services based on similarity to content of media segments considering classification of segments of content (based at least in part on classifying component 130 ).
- Advertising component 140 can match advertised products or services based on similarity to content of media segments considering classification of segments of content (based at least in part on rank component 120 ). Advertising component 140 can match, place, and/or price advertised products and/or services based on similarity to content of media segments considering classification (based at least in part on classifying component 130 ) and rank of segments of content (based at least in part on rank component 120 ).
- advertising component 140 can match, place and/or price advertisements where the advertisements include information (e.g., embedded information) concerning accounts, campaigns, targeting, etc.
- An account refers to information for a given advertiser (e.g., a unique email address, a password, billing information, etc.).
- a campaign refers to one or more groups of one or more advertisements, and may include a start date, an end date, budget information, geo-targeting information, syndication information, etc.
- a car manufacturer may have one advertising campaign for its automotive line, and a separate advertising campaign for its motorcycle line.
- the manufacturer's campaign for its automotive line may have one or more advertisement groups, each containing one or more advertisements.
- Each advertisement group may include a set of keywords, and a maximum cost bid (cost per click-though, cost per conversion, etc.). Alternatively, or in addition, each advertisement group may include an average cost bid (e.g., average cost per click-through, average cost per conversion, etc.). Therefore, a single maximum cost bid and/or a single average cost bid may be associated with one or more keywords. Further, each advertisement group may have one or more advertisements or “creatives” (That is, advertisement content that is ultimately rendered to an end user.).
- system 200 facilitates pricing advertisement slots for advertisements to be matched to media segments.
- System 200 employs pricing component 210 that prices advertisement slots associated with respectively ranked media segments based at least in part on the ranking.
- the pricing component 210 can price advertising slots matched to highly ranked segments of content at greater prices than advertising slots matched to low ranked segments of content.
- pricing component 210 can price advertising slots based on any one or more price parameters described herein.
- a candidate advertisement can be placed in one or more advertising slots. Advertisers can bid to place their candidate advertisement in an advertising slot matched to a segment of content.
- An auction component 710 (described herein) can coordinate bidding among advertisers for placements of their advertisements in the one or more available advertising slots. In an aspect, advertisers may bid on one or more price parameters. A price parameter is a factor on which the price of an advertisement slot can be based (as a function of price component 210 ). In another aspect, advertisers do not bid on an advertisement slot nor a price parameter, but instead advertisers pay a pre-set price as priced by pricing component 210 .
- a price parameter examples include, but are not limited to, a cost-per-impression, a maximum cost-per-click, a cost-per-conversion, and a cost per action.
- advertisers can bid on one or more price parameters related to a particular advertising slot.
- a cost-per click bid is a price for an advertisement slot based on the aggregate number of clicks (i.e. by users) received by an advertisement matched to a segment of content. For example, assume that at a given point in time, advertisement slot Z has the following costs-per-click bids from advertisers, respectively: $5.00 per click, $1.50 per click, $1.00 per click, $0.90 per click, and $0.25 per click. The advertiser who bid $5.00 per click is awarded the advertisement slot Z for placement of their candidate advertisement.
- Other price parameters may be used with the embodiments described herein.
- a price parameter can be based on a price per impression, which is a price for the number of counts an advertisement loads (also known as an impression) onto a user's screen (i.e. pop-up advertisements).
- a cost per action is a price parameter based on specified actions linked to an advertisement (i.e. a purchase of an advertised good, submission of an advertised application, subscription to an advertised service, etc.).
- Another price parameter is a cost-per conversion which is a price based on any number of “conversions” or value related to acquiring a customer (e.g. value of a customer lead, revenue from a sale, value of exposure to a demographic of users, an estimate of percentage of users who an advertisement or keyword make a purchase, etc.)
- pricing component 210 can price an advertisement slot based on normalizing advertisement bids for a specific advertising slot based on different price parameters, This normalization can allow advertisers that want to pay for an advertising slot using different price parameters to compete by bidding on a common basis (the bid values can be normalized to a common basis, such as dollars).
- pricing component 210 based in part on auction component 710 can award an advertising slot to an advertiser who bids on a cost-per-click basis over an advertiser who bids on the same advertising slot on a cost-per-conversion basis.
- conversion rate information may be particularly attractive to advertisers, for it provides a direct way for advertisers to compare their advertising cost to the benefits they obtain from that advertisement. For example, suppose an advertiser (Advertiser W) is able to estimate that approximately 15% of users who see an advertisement for a set of keywords ultimately make a purchase from Advertiser W. And suppose further that Advertiser W can estimate that on average each such purchase resulted in revenue of $50 to Advertiser W. Advertiser W can then determine that the value to it of each advertisement is $7.50 (0.15 multiplied by $50). Advertiser W can use that information to decide how much it is willing to pay for those advertisements, which would presumably be some amount less than $7.50.
- Advertiser X is able to estimate that for the same set of keywords, approximately 30% of user who see its advertisement make a purchase from Advertiser X for an average price of $50.
- the value of the advertisement to Advertiser X is $15 (0.30 multiplied by $50). Therefore, Advertiser X ought to be willing to pay more for its advertisement than Advertiser W would be (e.g., up to $15 rather than up to $7.50).
- An advertiser may not want to provide system 200 with the conversion information specified above (e.g., revenue generated per number of views). The advertiser may, instead, simply specify the price they are willing to pay for each conversion.
- Advertiser X may specify a maximum (or average, or other) price per conversion of $15, while Advertiser W may specify a price per conversion of $7.50.
- System 200 based in part on rank component 120 can then use that information in determining how to rank the advertisements (e.g., Advertiser X's advertisement first, then that of Advertiser W) and how much to charge for those advertisements (i.e. if pricing component 210 is basing price on a pre-set amount or minimum start bid).
- the identity of a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, it may be the case that a conversion occurs when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. Alternatively, a conversion may be defined as a user being shown an advertisement, and making a purchase of the advertiser's web page within seven days. Many other definitions of what constitutes a conversion are possible. Pricing component 210 may price advertisements by numerous other techniques.
- the pricing component 210 adjusts pricing of the advertisement slots based at least in part on advertiser demand.
- pricing component 210 can determine demand based on any one or more factors such as number of clicks, number of shares, amount of traffic, content consumer loyalty (e.g. to long running shows or consumer won't illegally download), the nature of the content (e.g. drama, comedy) and its affect on content consumer experience (e.g. emotional response), consumption of segments of content (e.g. clips) vs. consumption of content in entirety (e.g. episodes), nature of content, user recommendations of content, subject matter of previously watched content, number of views, barriers to viewing content (e.g. difficult account registration or poor video quality), the demand for both dynamic experiences (e.g. demand for functionality to enhance active experience such as ability to compile and share playlists that can be cued up to a player) vs. inactive experiences.
- content consumer loyalty e.g. to long running shows or consumer won't illegally download
- content consumer loyalty e.g. to long running shows
- pricing component 210 can employ predicting component 506 to predict traffic flow associated with future streaming of media segments and set pricing for the advertising slots based at least in part on the predicted traffic flow.
- pricing component 210 predicts traffic flow based on a number of factors such as total number of monthly views, total number of unique monthly users, total number of impressions where one advertisement view is one impression (e.g. if a segment of content contains four advertisements there will be four impressions per segment of content view), number of fraudulent clicks, click-through rate (e.g. number of clicks on an advertisement divided by number of impressions), display time of advertisement, and other such factors.
- pricing component 210 can price advertisement slots based on any one or more pricing models such as cost per action (e.g. advertiser is charged each time consumer purchases a product or service), cost per acquisition, cost per lead, cost per purchase, cost per click (advertiser is charged per each click on its advertisement), cost per mille (e.g. advertiser is charged per thousand impressions), flat rate (e.g. advertiser pays fixed price to display advertisement for a period of time), hybrid models, combination of multiple models.

- System 300 includes a matching component 308 employed by advertising component 140 .
- the advertising component 140 employs the matching component 308 to facilitate matching an advertisement to a media segment based at least in part on similarity between content of the media segment and a product or service associated with the advertisement.
- Content may include the content itself (e.g., video, audio), a category corresponding to the content (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), or attributes of the content (geo-location, age of the content, etc.).
- a category corresponding to the content e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- part or content type e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- attributes of the content e.g., age of the content, etc.
- Matching component 308 matches advertisements to the content of media segments by scoring similarity of the content of the media segment to a product or service advertised.
- a subject matter of the content that is relevant to the advertised product or service can receive a higher score than a subject matter less relevant to the product or service advertised.
- matching component 308 can designate a higher score to a segment of content relating to tourism in Italy with an advertisement for a special price on a flight to Italy, rather than a score for a segment of content relating to an action sequence in South Africa.
- matching component 308 can match advertisements to the content of media segments by scoring an advertisement (in lieu of or in addition to scoring a segment of content).
- matching component 308 can match advertisements to segments of content based on similarity of the content type (e.g., animated advertisement, 3-D advertisement, comedy advertisement, audio-focused advertisement, etc.). For instance, a children's cartoon video may be more similar (higher score segment of content) to an animated advertisement over a cooking segment video (lower score segment of content).
- an attribute of the media content or advertised product and/or service may be used to score an advertisement or segment of content higher than another advertisement or segment of content (e.g., geo-location of user consuming the media content). For example, a content consumer downloading a video from Oakland, Calif. would likely take greater interest in an advertisement for tickets to an Oakland-based sport team (e.g. higher score advertisement) rather than an advertisement for tickets to a Cincinnati-based sports team (e.g. lower score advertisement).
- matching component 308 matches respective advertisements to the ranked segments of media.
- matching component 308 can be configured to match an advertisement to a media segment based at least in part on similarity between context of the media segment and a product or service associated with the advertisement.
- context refers to the surrounding suggestion or expression that a segment of media or advertisement conveys (appeal, tone, perception, meaning, sensation, emotion, etc.).
- matching component 308 matches based on a score of the similarity between the context of the media segment and the product or service advertised.
- matching component 308 may score the similarity between media content and advertisement based on a level of match between a list of keywords associated with a user or segment of media content consumed, and keywords associated with the advertisement.
- Matching component 308 may account for contextual factors including, but are not limited to, genre of content, relevance to user interest, target audience, user demographics, navigation history of user, geography, social interests, and perspectives of a user.
- matching component 308 may match a segment of content to an advertisement based on a score for similarity of context based at least in part on user interactions associated with keywords, such as through a “tagging” process by which a submitter of media content (i.e. video) or a content consumer assign tags to the program.
- Matching component 308 based at least in part on advertising component 140 can match advertisements with segments of media content using such tags or keywords. For instance, matching component 308 may match a music video segment tagged by user wherein the artist wears designer sunglasses to an advertisement for a discount at a designer sunglass store.
- user may identify keywords as inputs for searching, commenting, and labeling segments of media content and the keywords can correlate to advertisements likely to capture the attention of user.
- matching component 308 matches an advertisement to a media segment based at least in part on demographics of users that deem the media segment popular.
- Demographics of users refers to statistical characteristics of a set of users consuming a segment of media. The statistical characteristics can include, but are not limited to user age, gender, race, employment status, marital status, geo-location information, sexual disposition, and so on.
- matching component 308 can match an advertisement to a media section consumed by a large set of common users, (e.g. a popular segment) belonging to one or more particular demographic characteristics. For example, when multiple users between the age of 18 and 25 repeatedly view a skateboarding video segment, matching component 308 may match an advertisement catering to adolescent men such as a skateboarding video game. Additionally, matching component 308 can match the advertisement to other same or similar segment of media content wherein users belonging to a particular demographic repeatedly consume content segments
- system 400 facilitates launching an advertisement.
- System 400 includes launching component 406 wherein an object within the media segment can be clicked to launch the advertisement. For example if the user then selects an object, such as a retrieved advertising link (e.g., by clicking on an advertising link), a document corresponding to the advertisement may be retrieved and presented to the user.
- an object such as a retrieved advertising link (e.g., by clicking on an advertising link)
- a document corresponding to the advertisement may be retrieved and presented to the user.
- a document may include, for example, an e-mail, a web site, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, a web advertisement, etc.
- a common document is a web page. Web pages often include textual information and may include embedded information (such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript, etc.).
- a “link,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any reference to/from a document from/to another document or another part of the same document. Accordingly, launch component 406 launches a document (e.g. advertisement) when user selects an object (e.g. clicks on an icon) within media content and launches the advertisement for user consumption.
- a document e.g. advertisement
- system 500 employs predicting component 506 that predicts when future demand for a segment of media content will level off or decline.
- Predicting component 506 may predict future demand by applying any one or more algorithms to predict or anticipate the future demand for a segment of media content.
- predicting component 506 can predict future demand by considering numerous factors regarding future demand for a segment of media content by one or more users such as trafficking logistics, media programming logistics, content ratings, historical number of viewers, seasonal correlations to number of views, timing correlations to number of views, newness or staleness of media content, individual characteristics of content consumers, availability of segment of content and other such factors relating to demand.
- system 600 facilitates analysis of the number of views of an advertising impression and/or segment of media content.
- System 600 includes analysis component 606 that analyzes number of views of an advertising impression.
- system 600 may provide advertising links, to users when they consume segments of content. A user may select (or click) the advertising link, which can cause the user to navigate to a web page belonging to the advertiser associated with the advertising link. This selection of an advertising link by a user is commonly referred to as a “click.”
- System 600 employs analysis component 606 to analyze the number of impressions and clicks for a segment of media content and/or an advertisement. For example, analysis component 606 may analyze the number of clicks that an advertising link receives during a given period of time. If the user then selects one of the retrieved advertising links (e.g., by clicking on an advertising link), an advertisement click request may be generated. Analysis component 606 can analyze the number of views of an advertisement and/or segment of media content by aggregating the number of clicks and tracking the number of impressions for purposes of calculating prices to charge for respective advertisements, compiling statistics, gathering data for advertisers and other such purposes. The analysis component 606 may also analyze whether an advertising link that was previously retrieved by an advertisement query request was selected by a specific user. Furthermore, analysis component 606 can analyze browser information, client information, and/or user information may be collected with both the advertisement query request and the advertisement click request.
- analysis component 606 analyzes traffic patterns for the media segments and/or advertisement based at least in part on at least one of: user demographics, user preferences, user relevance, content genre, target user, or pre-defined criteria. Information relating to traffic associated with a segment of media content over time may be used to generate (or alter) the score associated with the segment of media. For example, analysis component 606 may monitor the time-varying characteristics of traffic to, or other “use” of, a segment of content by one or more users. A large reduction in traffic may indicate that a segment of media content may be stale (e.g., no longer be updated or may be superseded by another segment of media content).
- analysis component 606 may identify repeating traffic patterns or perhaps a change in traffic patterns over time. It may be discovered that there are periods when a segment of content is more or less popular (i.e., has more or less traffic), such as during the summer months, on weekends, or during some other seasonal time period.
- analysis component 606 can employ rank component 120 to rank advertisements segments based in part on a score to account for traffic patterns and/or other information analyzed from analysis component 606 .
- analysis component 606 analyzes traffic patterns for the media segments based at least in part on at least one of user demographics, user preferences, user relevance, content genre, target user, or pre-defined criteria. For example, an advertiser may produce a commercial that is targeted to a particular user group or to reach a particular group of viewers. For example, the advertiser may assign a set of fixed attribute values, such as household income and age, to a commercial that demographically define a group of viewers. Also, an advertiser may select a program or group of programs during which a promotion is to air. For example, a pharmaceutical company may set a commercials profile so that its drug advertisement airs only during news programming, while an advertiser of a convertible car may target its commercial to advertisement slots within music programs or programs associated with a younger demographic.
- analysis component 606 can analyze an advertisement and/or segment of content to consider any number of factors, including but not limited to, audience relating to a segment of content, user age, user gender, user locations, different characteristics of content, user contexts, user interests, and perspectives of a user.
- Examples of other factors that may be employed in analyzing a segment of media content can include the type of video article, time period (e.g., time of day, or day of the week), user location (e.g., to match (by employing matching component 308 ) video articles broadcast in close proximity to the user), selection of the video article by previous users (e.g., users querying for the same or similar terms), and whether the video article is available for playback (e.g., video articles available for playback have greater user interest).
- the analysis component 606 can also analyze traffic patterns based on user preferences (e.g., media format, media quality, rendering device capabilities, media encoding, video or audio resolution . . . ).
- User preferences can be basic information about characteristics, attributes or categorization of content that respective users prefer to consume.
- User preference may include format of content, type of content interface preferred, display resolution, video quality, audio quality, bit rate, number of frames per second, aspect ratio, scaling formats, audio output options, display options, and other preferential information.
- user preference can factor determined user viewing intent by filtering content according to user preference. For example, a user of video content may prefer to view only videos in high definition (HD) format; thus analysis component 606 can analyze and filter out media segments that are not in HD format, or alternatively up-weight ranking of HD formatted content over non-HD formatted media.
- HD high definition

- advertisements can be placed within advertisement slots according to a computer-implemented auction.
- auction component 710 can set and receive bids for advertising slots based on a Vickrey-style auction in which each advertiser pays the bid of the next highest advertisement.
- Other auction processes can also be used, e.g., setting an advertiser bid equal to the estimated number of viewer impressions multiplied by the price an advertiser has offered to pay for each impression, etc.
- Auction component 710 can set and receive bids for advertising slots by making use of one or more different bidding types.
- the bidding types can be cost per airing, a cost per impression, a cost per full viewing of the advertisement, a cost per partial viewing of the advertisement, etc.
- Other types of costs per action bids can also be used, such as a cost per network airing (e.g., $5.00 per 1000 impressions on a first network, $6.00 per 1000 impressions on a second network), cost per action scaled by the time of day, etc.
- An auction process can, for example, support advertisements with different or even multiple (hybrid) bidding types.
- Auction component 710 can set and receive bids for advertising slots so advertisers may provide their advertisements based on preferred factors (duration of time for advertisement slot, etc.).
- auction component 710 can set and receive bids for advertising slots based on a sliding scale. For instance an advertiser can bid on an advertising slot based on price per impression by a percentage of targeted. Thus advertiser can bid on an advertisement slot at a price per impression to a demographic of users within the age of 18 to 25 wherein the percentage of total impressions received from the 18 to 25 age demographic is set at a different bid price than impressions not received from such age demographic.
- the bids can be based on various thresholds (e.g. impressions from 25% of viewers age 18 to 25 cost at X bid price, impressions from 50% of viewers age 28 to 25 cost Y bid price) and the thresholds can fluctuate over the course of the advertisement campaign.
- the advertising provider can thereafter provide a status to the advertisement system 700 regarding when the advertisement aired.
- the provider can also, for example, provide anonymous impression data related to viewing devices.
- viewing devices include set top boxes, digital video recorders and tuners, and other television processing devices that facilitate the viewing of the television signal on a television device.
- logs related to viewing device 164 activity e.g., set top box logs, can be anonymous to remove personal information related to viewing activities and provided to the advertisement system 700 .
- An auction model can create pricing efficiencies for both buyers and sellers of advertising. Advertisers can benefit from efficiencies by paying only for delivered impressions, or delivered actions, or other types of measurable events. Advertisers can also benefit form receiving the information the advertisers need to continually enhance the effectiveness of the advertiser's advertisements.
- auction component 710 sets and receives bids for advertising slots by making use of one or more auctions to allow advertisers seeking different thresholds of exposure (1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and/or 1,000,000 views/impressions) to participate in respective auctions that match their thresholds.
- auction component 710 can set and receive bids in one auction for advertising slots to place advertisements for a period of time lasting 100,000 views and a different auction to set and receive bids for advertising slots that accommodate advertisements for a period lasting 10,000 views.
- a client device/component/software notifies users of the types of information that are stored in respective applications logs and transmitted to a server, and provides the user the opportunity to opt-out of having such information collected and/or shared with the server.

Description
- This disclosure relates to advertising associated with subsets of media content based at least in part on rank and user interest.
- Media consumers often consume content at a variable point in media content other than at a beginning point or end point. Advertising is often embedded at the beginning data point of media content or at the end data point of media content. As the media consumer jumps around at variable data points of particular media content, the consumer may skip over advertisements and fail to view, consume, and form impressions in connection with those advertisements.
- The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosure nor delineate any scope particular embodiments of the disclosure, or any scope of the claims.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this innovation. It may be evident, however, that the innovation can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the innovation.
- By way of introduction, the subject matter disclosed in this disclosure relates to associating advertisements with segments of media content that respectively are of greater interest to content consumers than other sections of the media content. To facilitate effective advertising, embodiments described in this disclosure provide for monitoring content, viewing traffic associated with respective content as well as content consumer interest in specific sections of content. By identifying, ranking, and classifying sections of content that are of particular interest to content consumers, such sections can be matched to advertisements, auctioned to advertisers, and priced based on advertiser demand as well as predicted traffic flow.
- For example, if a segment 1:15:01 to 1:32:00 of a two-hour video was very popular to viewers, and an advertiser knew that the segment received a significant quantity of traffic from viewers between the ages of 21 and 30, the advertiser could match an advertisement at a data point within that segment to cater to the viewer age demographic. In accordance with embodiments described in this disclosure, such highly ranked (or popular) segment of the video can be priced and auctioned to purchasers of advertisement slots. Such feature can enhance efficacy of advertising (e.g. advertisement matches content of media segment), optimize pricing of advertisements (e.g. price based on demand), and enhance content consumer experience (e.g. user views an advertisement of interest).
- Referring now to the drawings, with reference initially to
FIG. 1 ,system 100 is shown that facilitates matching advertisements to segments of media content based on ranking of one or more segments of the media content and user interest. Aspects of the systems, apparatuses or processes explained in this disclosure can constitute machine-executable component embodied within machine(s), e.g., embodied in one or more computer readable mediums (or media) associated with one or more machines. Such component, when executed by the one or more machines, e.g., computer(s), computing device(s), virtual machine(s), etc. can cause the machine(s) to perform the operations described.System 100 can include memory 102 for storing computer executable components and instructions. A processor 104 can facilitate operation of the computer executable components and instructions by thesystem 100. - In an embodiment,
system 100 employs amonitoring component 110, arank component 120, a classifyingcomponent 130, and anadvertising component 140. In an aspect, themonitoring component 110 monitors content consumer interests in respective segments of media content 170 (e.g., videos, audio, . . . ).Rank component 120 ranks respective segments of themedia content 170 based at least in part on user interest, classifyingcomponent 130 classifies respective segments of the media content based at least in part on user interest, andadvertising component 140 matches respective advertisements to the ranked segments of the media content. -
Media content 170 can include media data associated with one or more data sources (not shown) that can be accessed by a system such as system 100 (and additional systems described in this disclosure) or a client device (not shown). For example, a data source can include a data store storing media content and affiliated with a content provider that interacts with thesystem 100. In another aspect, a data source can include a data store that stores media content remote from a content provider or asystem 100. In an aspect,media content 170 can include media data as media items. For example, themedia content 170 can include one or more media items (e.g., video and/or audio including but not limited to movies, television, streaming television, video games, or music tracks). - A client device can include any suitable client device associated with a user and configured to interact with or receive media content (e.g. segments of media content matched to advertisements). For example, a client device can include a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a smart-phone, a tablet personal computer (PC), or a PDA. As used in this disclosure, the terms “content consumer” or “user” refer to a person, entity, system, or combination thereof that employ system 100 (or additional systems described in this disclosure). In an aspect, a client device or system 100 (or additional systems described in this disclosure) can be configured to access the
media content 170 via a network such as for example the Internet, intranet, or cellular service. - Further,
media content 170 can include media data distributed by another system or device (not shown) that interacts with thesystem 100. For example,system 100 could receivemedia content 170 from a system that monitors user interest in sections of media content; ranks respective sections of the media content based at least in part on the user interest; caches respective sections of the media content based at least in part on the ranking; and transmits a subset of the cached media content sections.Media content 170 can include any such monitored, ranked, and/or cached sections of the media content of a content distribution system. - According to an embodiment,
monitoring component 110 monitors interaction with themedia content 170 to identify content consumer interest in respective segments thereof. As used in this description, a segment of media content refers to a section of media content of a media item that is a subset of the media item. For example, a media item can include two hours of video and a segment of the media item can be referenced for example by time 1:30:01 to 1:41:00. In another aspect, a segment of the media item can be referenced by a set of media frames. For example, a media item can include M frames (M is an integer). According to this example, a segment of media content of the media item could include for example frames 1-57, or frames 7008-8001. - Further, as used in this disclosure, content consumer interest in media content refers to one or more users' affinity for a segment of media content. For example, users may have an affinity for a segment of media content based on appearance of a famous actor in the segment. In another example, users may have an affinity for a segment of media content based on occurrence of a climactic event at the particular segment of the media content. In an aspect, when a large set of users have common affinity for a segment of media content as compared to other segments, popularity of the segment can be deemed greater that the other segments of the media content. For example, when multiple users repeatedly have an interest in a same or similar segment of media content, user interest in the section of the media item can relate to collective content consumer affinity for the section. Furthermore, in an aspect user interest can be based in part on the ability of a user to replay and/or rewind a segment of media content.
- In an embodiment,
monitoring component 110 monitors content consumer interest in segments of media content based at least in part on content consumer traffic associated with respective segments of the media content. In an aspect,monitoring component 110 can determine user interest in a media item based on user interaction (e.g., fast forwarding to certain segments, time spent viewing certain sections, references to certain segments . . . ) with the media item. Any suitable type of information that can facilitate gleaning, determining, or inferring content consumer interest in respective media content segments can be utilized by themonitoring component 110 orrank component 120. More particularly, user interaction with segments of media content can include but is not limited to, viewing a segment of a media content, controlling playing of a segment of media content, bookmarking a segment of media content, referencing a segment of media content, communicating a segment of media content, posting or storing a segment of media content, tagging or bookmarking a segment of media content. For example, themonitoring component 110 can monitor the number of views or the number of different user views of a segment of media content. - The
monitoring component 110 can also identify a segment of media content as popular based on number of views. For example, the monitoring component may determine that 85% of users of a media item are interested in a segment starting at 0:53:02 to 1:21:39. In another example, themonitoring component 110 can monitor time spent monitoring a section of media content. In an aspect, controlling a segment of media content can include but is not limited to fast-forwarding to a segment of media content, rewinding to a segment of media content, replaying a segment of media content, pausing at a segment of media content, or editing a segment of media content. - In yet another aspect,
monitoring component 110 can monitor or employ extrinsic information in conjunction with monitoring user interaction with segments of media content. For example, extrinsic information can include but is not limited to, world wide web (web) postings associated with segments of media content, clippings of segments of media content, or web links associated with the segments of the media content, user queries associated with the media content. According to this aspect, extrinsic information can be employed by monitoringcomponent 110 orrank component 120 to determine or infer content consumer interest in segments of themedia content 170. For example, multiple views of a particular segment of media content accompanied by postings of links to the particular segment of the media content and multiple search queries for the particular segment of the media content can be employed as a measure of content consumer interest in the particular segment of the media content. - In an embodiment, in addition to monitoring content consumer interest in respective segments of media content,
monitoring component 110 can monitor characteristics of the respective segments of the media content. In an aspect, a characteristic of the segment of the media content can include tags embedded in the media content. A tag can include metadata that identifies a data point or a segment of the media content. In an aspect, the tag can identify a data point or segment of media content as having a distinguishing characteristic (e.g., person, object, location, audio, scene, and event). The tags, for example, can be user generated, computer generated or social network generated. In an aspect of user generated tags, tags can refer to information gathered from user interaction with the media content. The user interaction can be any number of traceable acts such as bookmarks, user queries, content published by user, user comments on content, user creation of content (e.g., uploading a video to a video distribution site), user created value-add content to existing content. Furthermore, other extrinsic sources that can be employed in connection with assessing popularity of respective media segments can include but are not limited to: communication content technologies, published media content, problem processing content applications, news content, gossip content, research content, digital media content technologies, questions-answer databases, digital video content, blogged content, podcast content, content forums, or review-website content. - Additionally, in an embodiment,
monitoring component 110 monitors traffic and can predict quantity of future traffic associated with respective segments of media content. For example,monitoring component 110 may monitor time-varying characteristics relating to “advertising traffic” for a particular segment of content. For example,monitoring component 110 can monitor one or a combination of the following factors: (1) the extent to and rate at which advertisements are presented or updated by a given segment of media content over time; (2) the quality of the advertisers (e.g., a segment of content whose advertisements refer/link to documents known toanalysis component 606 over time to have relatively high traffic and trust may be given relatively more weight than those segment of media content whose advertisements refer to low traffic/untrustworthy documents, such as a adult content site); and (3) the extent to which the segment of content generate user traffic to the advertisement which they relate (e.g., their click-through rate). - In another aspect,
monitoring component 110 predicts quantities of future traffic associated with respective segments of media content based on any one or more of the above advertising traffic characteristics as well as factors such as total number of monthly views, total number of unique monthly users, total number of impressions where one advertisement view is one impression (e.g. if a segment of content contains four advertisements there will be four impressions per segment of content view), number of fraudulent clicks, click-through rate (e.g. number of clicks on an advertisement divided by number of impressions), display time of advertisement, and other such factors. Further, based on any of the above identified elements, themonitoring component 110 orrank component 120 can identify segments of media where characteristics of the media segments drive content consumer traffic thereto. For example, advanced digital effects relating to a popular movie can be identified as a characteristic that is driving content consumer interest to the respective media segment. In an embodiment,rank component 120 can be employed to rank respective segments of themedia content 170 based at least in part on content consumer interest. - In an embodiment, the
rank component 120 can be configured to rank a segment of media content based at least in part on user interest in that segment. In an aspect, ranking based at least in part on user interest can apply a priority scheme relating to recommended respective content segments of a media item. For example, for a media item, therank component 120 can rank a user's interest in one segment as higher than another. In another aspect, therank component 120 can rank content consumer interest in a segment of media content against one or more segments of media content from the same or different media items. For example, therank component 120 can rank a first set of media content segment frames of a first media item higher or lower than a second set of content segment frames of a second media item. In yet another aspect, rankings can be multi-tiered. For instance, a segment of media content can be ranked against other segments as well as against segments of another media item based at least in part on viewing traffic. Therank component 120 can rank media segments based at least in part on a set of users, a subset of users, user preference, user historical preferences, user feedback, number of views, number of references, etc. Respective advertisements can be placed and/or priced in accordance with the rankings. - In an embodiment,
system 100 further comprises a classifyingcomponent 130.Classifying component 130 can be employed to classify respective segments of themedia content 170 and/or advertisements to be placed or priced based at least in part on content consumer interest. The classifyingcomponent 130 can be configured to classify a segment of media content and/or advertisements to be placed or priced based at least in part on user interest in that segment. In an aspect, classification based at least in part on user interest can apply a categorization scheme relating to respective content segments of a media item. For example, for a media item, the classifyingcomponent 130 can classify a user's interest in one segment and/or advertisement within a category different from a user's interest in another segment (e.g. categorize a movie segment as drama and another segment from the same movie as action). In another aspect, the classifyingcomponent 130 can classify content consumer interest in a segment of media content and/or advertisement against one or more segments of media content and/or advertisements from the same or different media items. For example, the classifyingcomponent 130 can classify a first set of media content segment frames of a first media item within a different category than a second set of content segment frames of a second media item. - In an embodiment, classifying
component 130 can classify media content and/or advertisements to be placed or priced into genres or categories.Classifying component 130 may use the predetermined label categories to associate a genre with media content. For example, classifyingcomponent 130 may extract a title, words from the title, or other meta-data words associated with media content (e.g., videos, audio). The extracted words or identifiers may be associated with categories or genres in the predetermined label categories. Further, classifyingcomponent 130 can retrieve the associated segment of content from the predetermined label categories using extracted identifiers. In an example, any movie title or segment of content tagged with the words “Christmas,” “Thanksgiving,” and “Easter” are classified into a movie category labeled “holiday movies.” - In an aspect, classifying
component 130 can classify media content and/or advertisements to be placed or priced based on external information such as users social network labels (e.g. predetermined classifications labels). For example, classifyingcomponent 130 can use text analysis to determine classification labels to associate with user nodes in a generated social graph. The subject of the analysis can include media content and/or advertisements associated with user profiles, comments posted by a user (e.g. comments on a youtube video posted to user facebook account), descriptions of groups to which a user belongs, etc. In an aspect, predetermined classification labels for media content and/or advertisements can be based on keywords, which can be submitted by advertisers and/or users. For example, the keywords can include the term “furniture.” This can be used as a predetermined classification label, which classifyingcomponent 130 associates with media content and/or advertisements to be placed or priced that include the term “furniture.” Additionally, classifyingcomponent 130 can classify media content and/or advertisements with associations to a label. For instance, classifyingcomponent 130 can classify under the label “furniture” advertisements that include words associated with “furniture,” such as chair, table, or home decorating. -
Classifying component 130 in connection withrank component 120 can also rank classified segments of media content and/or advertisements to be placed or priced based at least in part on content user interest. For instance, classifyingcomponent 130 can classify a group of segments of media content andrank component 120 can rank a segments of media content within the category based at least in part on user interest in that segment. In an aspect, classifyingcomponent 130 can classify, based at least in part on rankings fromrank component 120, categorized segments of media content and/or advertisements based at least in part on user interest and can apply a priority scheme relating to recommended respective content segments of a media item. For example, for a media item, the classifyingcomponent 130 can classify and therank component 120 can rank a user's interest in one segment of content within a category as higher than another segment of content within the same category. In another aspect, the classifyingcomponent 130 can classify and therank component 120 can rank content consumer interest in a categorized segment of media content and/or advertisements against one or more categorized segments of media content and/or advertisements from the same or different media items. For example, the classification component can classify a first set of media content frames and therank component 120 can rank a first set of categorized media content segment frames of a first media item higher or lower than a second set of categorized content segment frames of a second media item. - In an embodiment,
advertising component 140 can match, place, and/or price respective advertisements to ranked segments of media content. Advertising is often conventionally presented to a general audience that may include many disinterested viewers and fail to include many interested viewers.System 100 identifies and ranks content of user interest and popular segments of media content that can be used to present advertisements likely to have impact on particular content consumers, relevant to user interest, and/or likely to capture content consumer attention. Theadvertising component 140 can determine good matches between respective advertisements, media segments, target audience, geography, user demographics, purchasing history, etc. in order to optimize advertising efficacy in connection with provisioning of content. Moreover, theadvertising component 140 can facilitate pricing of advertising impressions. For example, a content provider can charge a premium for display or clicking of an advertisement matched to a highly ranked segment as compared to a lowered ranked segment. -
Advertising component 140 can match, place and/or price advertisements based at least in part on classifyingcomponent 130. In an aspect, classifyingcomponent 130 can classify segments of content according to various characters, and theadvertising component 140 can match advertisements to the classified content based on similarity and/or relevance of the advertised products or services to the classification. Furthermore,advertising component 140 can match, place and/or price based at least in part onrank component 120. In an aspect,rank component 120 ranks segments of content according to various factors (e.g. number of views) andadvertising component 140 can match, place and/or price advertisements to the ranked content based on similarity and/or relevance of the advertised products or services to the classification.Advertising component 140 can access and/or utilize a variety of advertising information including information about how the advertisements are to be rendered (e.g., position, click-through or not, impression time, impression date, size, conversion or not, etc.), content to be associated with the advertisement (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, etc.), form of advertisements such as graphical advertisements, so-called banner advertisements, text only advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, etc. - Additionally,
advertising component 140 can effect inventorying of advertisements, storing advertisement information, utilizing historical (e.g. statistical) information regarding advertisements, access and utilize advertisement targeting information (e.g. geo-targeting”), perform cost determination operations, allow advertisers to interface with the component, and contain billing operations. In an embodiment,advertising component 140 can match, place, and/or price respective advertisements to ranked segments of media content in connection with therank component 120 and/or classified segments of media content in connection with classifyingcomponent 130.Advertising component 140 can match, place, and/or price advertised products and/or services based on similarity to content of media segments considering classification of segments of content (based at least in part on classifying component 130).Advertising component 140 can match advertised products or services based on similarity to content of media segments considering classification of segments of content (based at least in part on rank component 120).Advertising component 140 can match, place, and/or price advertised products and/or services based on similarity to content of media segments considering classification (based at least in part on classifying component 130) and rank of segments of content (based at least in part on rank component 120). - In another embodiment,
advertising component 140 can match, place and/or price advertisements where the advertisements include information (e.g., embedded information) concerning accounts, campaigns, targeting, etc. An account refers to information for a given advertiser (e.g., a unique email address, a password, billing information, etc.). A campaign refers to one or more groups of one or more advertisements, and may include a start date, an end date, budget information, geo-targeting information, syndication information, etc. For example, a car manufacturer may have one advertising campaign for its automotive line, and a separate advertising campaign for its motorcycle line. The manufacturer's campaign for its automotive line may have one or more advertisement groups, each containing one or more advertisements. Each advertisement group may include a set of keywords, and a maximum cost bid (cost per click-though, cost per conversion, etc.). Alternatively, or in addition, each advertisement group may include an average cost bid (e.g., average cost per click-through, average cost per conversion, etc.). Therefore, a single maximum cost bid and/or a single average cost bid may be associated with one or more keywords. Further, each advertisement group may have one or more advertisements or “creatives” (That is, advertisement content that is ultimately rendered to an end user.). - Turning now to
FIG. 2 , presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment ofsystem 200 in accordance with the subject of the disclosure. In an aspect,system 200 facilitates pricing advertisement slots for advertisements to be matched to media segments.System 200 employspricing component 210 that prices advertisement slots associated with respectively ranked media segments based at least in part on the ranking. Thepricing component 210 can price advertising slots matched to highly ranked segments of content at greater prices than advertising slots matched to low ranked segments of content. In an aspect,pricing component 210 can price advertising slots based on any one or more price parameters described herein. - A candidate advertisement can be placed in one or more advertising slots. Advertisers can bid to place their candidate advertisement in an advertising slot matched to a segment of content. An auction component 710 (described herein) can coordinate bidding among advertisers for placements of their advertisements in the one or more available advertising slots. In an aspect, advertisers may bid on one or more price parameters. A price parameter is a factor on which the price of an advertisement slot can be based (as a function of price component 210). In another aspect, advertisers do not bid on an advertisement slot nor a price parameter, but instead advertisers pay a pre-set price as priced by
pricing component 210. Examples of a price parameter include, but are not limited to, a cost-per-impression, a maximum cost-per-click, a cost-per-conversion, and a cost per action. In one aspect, advertisers can bid on one or more price parameters related to a particular advertising slot. For instance, a cost-per click bid is a price for an advertisement slot based on the aggregate number of clicks (i.e. by users) received by an advertisement matched to a segment of content. For example, assume that at a given point in time, advertisement slot Z has the following costs-per-click bids from advertisers, respectively: $5.00 per click, $1.50 per click, $1.00 per click, $0.90 per click, and $0.25 per click. The advertiser who bid $5.00 per click is awarded the advertisement slot Z for placement of their candidate advertisement. Other price parameters may be used with the embodiments described herein. - Similarly, a price parameter can be based on a price per impression, which is a price for the number of counts an advertisement loads (also known as an impression) onto a user's screen (i.e. pop-up advertisements). Further, a cost per action is a price parameter based on specified actions linked to an advertisement (i.e. a purchase of an advertised good, submission of an advertised application, subscription to an advertised service, etc.). Another price parameter is a cost-per conversion which is a price based on any number of “conversions” or value related to acquiring a customer (e.g. value of a customer lead, revenue from a sale, value of exposure to a demographic of users, an estimate of percentage of users who an advertisement or keyword make a purchase, etc.)
- In another embodiment,
pricing component 210 can price an advertisement slot based on normalizing advertisement bids for a specific advertising slot based on different price parameters, This normalization can allow advertisers that want to pay for an advertising slot using different price parameters to compete by bidding on a common basis (the bid values can be normalized to a common basis, such as dollars). Thuspricing component 210 based in part onauction component 710 can award an advertising slot to an advertiser who bids on a cost-per-click basis over an advertiser who bids on the same advertising slot on a cost-per-conversion basis. - Additionally, with respect to price-per-conversion, using conversion rate information may be particularly attractive to advertisers, for it provides a direct way for advertisers to compare their advertising cost to the benefits they obtain from that advertisement. For example, suppose an advertiser (Advertiser W) is able to estimate that approximately 15% of users who see an advertisement for a set of keywords ultimately make a purchase from Advertiser W. And suppose further that Advertiser W can estimate that on average each such purchase resulted in revenue of $50 to Advertiser W. Advertiser W can then determine that the value to it of each advertisement is $7.50 (0.15 multiplied by $50). Advertiser W can use that information to decide how much it is willing to pay for those advertisements, which would presumably be some amount less than $7.50.
- Suppose further that Advertiser X is able to estimate that for the same set of keywords, approximately 30% of user who see its advertisement make a purchase from Advertiser X for an average price of $50. The value of the advertisement to Advertiser X is $15 (0.30 multiplied by $50). Therefore, Advertiser X ought to be willing to pay more for its advertisement than Advertiser W would be (e.g., up to $15 rather than up to $7.50). An advertiser, however, may not want to provide
system 200 with the conversion information specified above (e.g., revenue generated per number of views). The advertiser may, instead, simply specify the price they are willing to pay for each conversion. Using the example above, Advertiser X may specify a maximum (or average, or other) price per conversion of $15, while Advertiser W may specify a price per conversion of $7.50.System 200 based in part onrank component 120 can then use that information in determining how to rank the advertisements (e.g., Advertiser X's advertisement first, then that of Advertiser W) and how much to charge for those advertisements (i.e. ifpricing component 210 is basing price on a pre-set amount or minimum start bid). - The identity of a conversion may vary from case to case and can be determined in a variety of ways. For example, it may be the case that a conversion occurs when a user clicks on an advertisement, is referred to the advertiser's web page, and consummates a purchase there before leaving that web page. Alternatively, a conversion may be defined as a user being shown an advertisement, and making a purchase of the advertiser's web page within seven days. Many other definitions of what constitutes a conversion are possible.
Pricing component 210 may price advertisements by numerous other techniques. - In other embodiments, the
pricing component 210 adjusts pricing of the advertisement slots based at least in part on advertiser demand. In an aspect,pricing component 210 can determine demand based on any one or more factors such as number of clicks, number of shares, amount of traffic, content consumer loyalty (e.g. to long running shows or consumer won't illegally download), the nature of the content (e.g. drama, comedy) and its affect on content consumer experience (e.g. emotional response), consumption of segments of content (e.g. clips) vs. consumption of content in entirety (e.g. episodes), nature of content, user recommendations of content, subject matter of previously watched content, number of views, barriers to viewing content (e.g. difficult account registration or poor video quality), the demand for both dynamic experiences (e.g. demand for functionality to enhance active experience such as ability to compile and share playlists that can be cued up to a player) vs. inactive experiences. - In another embodiment,
pricing component 210 can employ predictingcomponent 506 to predict traffic flow associated with future streaming of media segments and set pricing for the advertising slots based at least in part on the predicted traffic flow. In an aspect,pricing component 210 predicts traffic flow based on a number of factors such as total number of monthly views, total number of unique monthly users, total number of impressions where one advertisement view is one impression (e.g. if a segment of content contains four advertisements there will be four impressions per segment of content view), number of fraudulent clicks, click-through rate (e.g. number of clicks on an advertisement divided by number of impressions), display time of advertisement, and other such factors. - Furthermore,
pricing component 210 can price advertisement slots based on any one or more pricing models such as cost per action (e.g. advertiser is charged each time consumer purchases a product or service), cost per acquisition, cost per lead, cost per purchase, cost per click (advertiser is charged per each click on its advertisement), cost per mille (e.g. advertiser is charged per thousand impressions), flat rate (e.g. advertiser pays fixed price to display advertisement for a period of time), hybrid models, combination of multiple models. The price of an advertising slot may also be calculated based on other characteristics as well, such as time of day, location of the user, age or other demographic information associated with the user, or the like. - With reference to
FIG. 3 , presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment of asystem 300 that facilitates matching an advertisement to segments of media based at least in part on ranking.System 300 includes amatching component 308 employed byadvertising component 140. Theadvertising component 140 employs thematching component 308 to facilitate matching an advertisement to a media segment based at least in part on similarity between content of the media segment and a product or service associated with the advertisement. Content may include the content itself (e.g., video, audio), a category corresponding to the content (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), or attributes of the content (geo-location, age of the content, etc.). -
Matching component 308 matches advertisements to the content of media segments by scoring similarity of the content of the media segment to a product or service advertised. In an example, a subject matter of the content that is relevant to the advertised product or service can receive a higher score than a subject matter less relevant to the product or service advertised. For instance,matching component 308 can designate a higher score to a segment of content relating to tourism in Italy with an advertisement for a special price on a flight to Italy, rather than a score for a segment of content relating to an action sequence in South Africa. Also,matching component 308 can match advertisements to the content of media segments by scoring an advertisement (in lieu of or in addition to scoring a segment of content). In another example,matching component 308 can match advertisements to segments of content based on similarity of the content type (e.g., animated advertisement, 3-D advertisement, comedy advertisement, audio-focused advertisement, etc.). For instance, a children's cartoon video may be more similar (higher score segment of content) to an animated advertisement over a cooking segment video (lower score segment of content). Another example occurs where an attribute of the media content or advertised product and/or service may be used to score an advertisement or segment of content higher than another advertisement or segment of content (e.g., geo-location of user consuming the media content). For example, a content consumer downloading a video from Oakland, Calif. would likely take greater interest in an advertisement for tickets to an Oakland-based sport team (e.g. higher score advertisement) rather than an advertisement for tickets to a Cincinnati-based sports team (e.g. lower score advertisement). - In another embodiment,
matching component 308 matches respective advertisements to the ranked segments of media. In an aspect, matchingcomponent 308 can be configured to match an advertisement to a media segment based at least in part on similarity between context of the media segment and a product or service associated with the advertisement. As described herein, context refers to the surrounding suggestion or expression that a segment of media or advertisement conveys (appeal, tone, perception, meaning, sensation, emotion, etc.). In an aspect, matchingcomponent 308 matches based on a score of the similarity between the context of the media segment and the product or service advertised. In an embodiment,matching component 308 may score the similarity between media content and advertisement based on a level of match between a list of keywords associated with a user or segment of media content consumed, and keywords associated with the advertisement. For example, if user consumes media content related to an athletic activity with a keyword in the title being “college football,” a beer advertiser may associate keywords like “beer,” “football,” “college,” “sports,” and “comedy” with an advertisement. Thus the advertisement can be displayed on a search result page displaying the respective segment of media content.Matching component 308 may account for contextual factors including, but are not limited to, genre of content, relevance to user interest, target audience, user demographics, navigation history of user, geography, social interests, and perspectives of a user. - Likewise, matching
component 308 may match a segment of content to an advertisement based on a score for similarity of context based at least in part on user interactions associated with keywords, such as through a “tagging” process by which a submitter of media content (i.e. video) or a content consumer assign tags to the program.Matching component 308 based at least in part onadvertising component 140 can match advertisements with segments of media content using such tags or keywords. For instance,matching component 308 may match a music video segment tagged by user wherein the artist wears designer sunglasses to an advertisement for a discount at a designer sunglass store. Furthermore, user may identify keywords as inputs for searching, commenting, and labeling segments of media content and the keywords can correlate to advertisements likely to capture the attention of user. - In another embodiment,
matching component 308 matches an advertisement to a media segment based at least in part on demographics of users that deem the media segment popular. Demographics of users refers to statistical characteristics of a set of users consuming a segment of media. The statistical characteristics can include, but are not limited to user age, gender, race, employment status, marital status, geo-location information, sexual disposition, and so on. In an aspect, matchingcomponent 308 can match an advertisement to a media section consumed by a large set of common users, (e.g. a popular segment) belonging to one or more particular demographic characteristics. For example, when multiple users between the age of 18 and 25 repeatedly view a skateboarding video segment, matchingcomponent 308 may match an advertisement catering to adolescent men such as a skateboarding video game. Additionally, matchingcomponent 308 can match the advertisement to other same or similar segment of media content wherein users belonging to a particular demographic repeatedly consume content segments - With reference to
FIG. 4 , presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment of asystem 400 in accordance with the subject disclosure. In an aspect,system 400 facilitates launching an advertisement.System 400 includes launchingcomponent 406 wherein an object within the media segment can be clicked to launch the advertisement. For example if the user then selects an object, such as a retrieved advertising link (e.g., by clicking on an advertising link), a document corresponding to the advertisement may be retrieved and presented to the user. - A “document,” as the term is used herein, include, but is not limited to, any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may include, for example, an e-mail, a web site, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, a web advertisement, etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page. Web pages often include textual information and may include embedded information (such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc.) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript, etc.). A “link,” as the term is used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any reference to/from a document from/to another document or another part of the same document. Accordingly,
launch component 406 launches a document (e.g. advertisement) when user selects an object (e.g. clicks on an icon) within media content and launches the advertisement for user consumption. - With reference to
FIG. 5 presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment of asystem 500. In an aspect,system 500 employs predictingcomponent 506 that predicts when future demand for a segment of media content will level off or decline. Predictingcomponent 506 may predict future demand by applying any one or more algorithms to predict or anticipate the future demand for a segment of media content. As an aspect, predictingcomponent 506 can predict future demand by considering numerous factors regarding future demand for a segment of media content by one or more users such as trafficking logistics, media programming logistics, content ratings, historical number of viewers, seasonal correlations to number of views, timing correlations to number of views, newness or staleness of media content, individual characteristics of content consumers, availability of segment of content and other such factors relating to demand. - With reference to
FIG. 6 presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment ofsystem 600. In an aspect,system 600 facilitates analysis of the number of views of an advertising impression and/or segment of media content.System 600 includesanalysis component 606 that analyzes number of views of an advertising impression. In an embodiment,system 600 may provide advertising links, to users when they consume segments of content. A user may select (or click) the advertising link, which can cause the user to navigate to a web page belonging to the advertiser associated with the advertising link. This selection of an advertising link by a user is commonly referred to as a “click.” -
System 600 employsanalysis component 606 to analyze the number of impressions and clicks for a segment of media content and/or an advertisement. For example,analysis component 606 may analyze the number of clicks that an advertising link receives during a given period of time. If the user then selects one of the retrieved advertising links (e.g., by clicking on an advertising link), an advertisement click request may be generated.Analysis component 606 can analyze the number of views of an advertisement and/or segment of media content by aggregating the number of clicks and tracking the number of impressions for purposes of calculating prices to charge for respective advertisements, compiling statistics, gathering data for advertisers and other such purposes. Theanalysis component 606 may also analyze whether an advertising link that was previously retrieved by an advertisement query request was selected by a specific user. Furthermore,analysis component 606 can analyze browser information, client information, and/or user information may be collected with both the advertisement query request and the advertisement click request. - In another aspect,
analysis component 606 analyzes traffic patterns for the media segments and/or advertisement based at least in part on at least one of: user demographics, user preferences, user relevance, content genre, target user, or pre-defined criteria. Information relating to traffic associated with a segment of media content over time may be used to generate (or alter) the score associated with the segment of media. For example,analysis component 606 may monitor the time-varying characteristics of traffic to, or other “use” of, a segment of content by one or more users. A large reduction in traffic may indicate that a segment of media content may be stale (e.g., no longer be updated or may be superseded by another segment of media content). - In one implementation,
analysis component 606 can analyze traffic patterns by comparing the average traffic for a segment of content over the last j days (e.g., where j=30) to the average traffic during the month where the segment of content and/or advertisement received the most traffic, optionally adjusted for seasonal changes, or during the last k days (e.g., where k=365). Optionally,analysis component 606 may identify repeating traffic patterns or perhaps a change in traffic patterns over time. It may be discovered that there are periods when a segment of content is more or less popular (i.e., has more or less traffic), such as during the summer months, on weekends, or during some other seasonal time period. By analyzing and identifying repeating traffic patterns or changes in traffic patterns,analysis component 606 can employrank component 120 to rank advertisements segments based in part on a score to account for traffic patterns and/or other information analyzed fromanalysis component 606. - In an aspect,
analysis component 606 analyzes traffic patterns for the media segments based at least in part on at least one of user demographics, user preferences, user relevance, content genre, target user, or pre-defined criteria. For example, an advertiser may produce a commercial that is targeted to a particular user group or to reach a particular group of viewers. For example, the advertiser may assign a set of fixed attribute values, such as household income and age, to a commercial that demographically define a group of viewers. Also, an advertiser may select a program or group of programs during which a promotion is to air. For example, a pharmaceutical company may set a commercials profile so that its drug advertisement airs only during news programming, while an advertiser of a convertible car may target its commercial to advertisement slots within music programs or programs associated with a younger demographic. - In accordance with these criteria,
analysis component 606 can analyze an advertisement and/or segment of content to consider any number of factors, including but not limited to, audience relating to a segment of content, user age, user gender, user locations, different characteristics of content, user contexts, user interests, and perspectives of a user. Examples of other factors that may be employed in analyzing a segment of media content can include the type of video article, time period (e.g., time of day, or day of the week), user location (e.g., to match (by employing matching component 308) video articles broadcast in close proximity to the user), selection of the video article by previous users (e.g., users querying for the same or similar terms), and whether the video article is available for playback (e.g., video articles available for playback have greater user interest). Theanalysis component 606 can also analyze traffic patterns based on user preferences (e.g., media format, media quality, rendering device capabilities, media encoding, video or audio resolution . . . ). - User preferences can be basic information about characteristics, attributes or categorization of content that respective users prefer to consume. User preference may include format of content, type of content interface preferred, display resolution, video quality, audio quality, bit rate, number of frames per second, aspect ratio, scaling formats, audio output options, display options, and other preferential information. Furthermore, user preference can factor determined user viewing intent by filtering content according to user preference. For example, a user of video content may prefer to view only videos in high definition (HD) format; thus
analysis component 606 can analyze and filter out media segments that are not in HD format, or alternatively up-weight ranking of HD formatted content over non-HD formatted media. - With reference to
FIG. 7 presented is another exemplary non-limiting embodiment of asystem 700. In an aspect,system 700 facilitates analysis of the number of views of an advertising impression.System 700 includesauction component 710 that sets and receives bids for advertising slots associated with the ranked segments. Thesystem 700 based at least in part onauction component 710 which can employmatching component 308 to match candidate advertisements to match to segments of media content based on advertiser bids, advertiser budgets, and/or any quality metrics that have been collected (e.g. viewer actions, impressions, . . . ) For example, advertisements can be placed within advertisement slots according to a computer-implemented auction. In one aspect,auction component 710 can set and receive bids for advertising slots based on a Vickrey-style auction in which each advertiser pays the bid of the next highest advertisement. Other auction processes can also be used, e.g., setting an advertiser bid equal to the estimated number of viewer impressions multiplied by the price an advertiser has offered to pay for each impression, etc. -
Auction component 710 can set and receive bids for advertising slots by making use of one or more different bidding types. For example, the bidding types can be cost per airing, a cost per impression, a cost per full viewing of the advertisement, a cost per partial viewing of the advertisement, etc. Other types of costs per action bids can also be used, such as a cost per network airing (e.g., $5.00 per 1000 impressions on a first network, $6.00 per 1000 impressions on a second network), cost per action scaled by the time of day, etc. An auction process can, for example, support advertisements with different or even multiple (hybrid) bidding types.Auction component 710 can set and receive bids for advertising slots so advertisers may provide their advertisements based on preferred factors (duration of time for advertisement slot, etc.). - In an aspect,
auction component 710 can set and receive bids for advertising slots based on a sliding scale. For instance an advertiser can bid on an advertising slot based on price per impression by a percentage of targeted. Thus advertiser can bid on an advertisement slot at a price per impression to a demographic of users within the age of 18 to 25 wherein the percentage of total impressions received from the 18 to 25 age demographic is set at a different bid price than impressions not received from such age demographic. The bids can be based on various thresholds (e.g. impressions from 25% of viewers age 18 to 25 cost at X bid price, impressions from 50% of viewers age 28 to 25 cost Y bid price) and the thresholds can fluctuate over the course of the advertisement campaign. - The advertising provider can thereafter provide a status to the
advertisement system 700 regarding when the advertisement aired. The provider can also, for example, provide anonymous impression data related to viewing devices. Examples of viewing devices include set top boxes, digital video recorders and tuners, and other television processing devices that facilitate the viewing of the television signal on a television device. For example, logs related to viewing device 164 activity, e.g., set top box logs, can be anonymous to remove personal information related to viewing activities and provided to theadvertisement system 700. An auction model can create pricing efficiencies for both buyers and sellers of advertising. Advertisers can benefit from efficiencies by paying only for delivered impressions, or delivered actions, or other types of measurable events. Advertisers can also benefit form receiving the information the advertisers need to continually enhance the effectiveness of the advertiser's advertisements. In an aspect,auction component 710 sets and receives bids for advertising slots by making use of one or more auctions to allow advertisers seeking different thresholds of exposure (1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and/or 1,000,000 views/impressions) to participate in respective auctions that match their thresholds. For example,auction component 710 can set and receive bids in one auction for advertising slots to place advertisements for a period of time lasting 100,000 views and a different auction to set and receive bids for advertising slots that accommodate advertisements for a period lasting 10,000 views. - In one embodiment, a client device/component/software notifies users of the types of information that are stored in respective applications logs and transmitted to a server, and provides the user the opportunity to opt-out of having such information collected and/or shared with the server.
