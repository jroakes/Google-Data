- MMM Media mix modeling
- causal diagrams of the content item search environment are used to create a search bias correction in media mix modeling. Once a causal diagram is known, a method of bias correction can be derived.
- Pearl's causal theory is used to create an estimate of a causal effect of two variables.
- a back-door criterion of the causal effect can be used to determine whether the causal effect is identifiable from the data.
- a set of variables can satisfy the back-door criterion relative to an ordered pair of variables when certain conditions are met. If the back-door criterion is met, the causal effect is identifiable and given by a specific formula.
- One embodiment of a method for evaluating the ROAS comprises collecting the search query data and fitting a model to the search query data. Since the volumes of relevant search queries may be very large, the search queries may be summarized so they are more adapted to model fitting. Summarizing the search queries may comprise, identifying the content provider's website and its top competitors' websites, collecting all queries over a target region in a given time window, and partitioning the query set into three groups according to the destination URLs that appear for each query. Destination URLs may be classified into groups such as a) belongs to the content provider, b) belongs to top competitors, c) does not belong to either, but belongs to the business category, and d) does not belong to the business category.
- the number of impressions may be used to classify the URLs into groups resulting in three subsets of queries for target-favoring queries, competitor favoring queries, and general interest queries.
- Pre-determined thresholds may be used to establish the thresholds for the segmentation procedure into subsets of queries.
- the models generated from the causal diagrams are applied to the subsets of queries to generate the ROAS.
- model stability is checked by using a non-parametric model fitting procedure.
- MMM Media Mix Modeling
- Various limitations of MMM are recognized, for example, data collection, selection bias, long-term effects, seasonality, and funnel effects.
- a typical MMM is described as a regression model, where the dependent variable is a key performance indicator (KPI), i.e., performance metric, and independent variables include various media inputs (e.g. spend levels, impressions or GRPs), product price, economic factors, competitors' activities, etc.
- KPI key performance indicator
- GRPs performance metric
- a performance metric may be measured in a particular area on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.
- causal inference is known to be notoriously hard with observational data.
- One of the major challenges to valid causal inference in MMM is selection bias due to sponsored content targeting.
- Sponsored content targeting is common across many different media channels, but is particularly acute in digital channels.
- Selection bias from sponsored content targeting arises when an underlying interest or demand from the target population is driving both the sponsored content spend and the sales.
- causal diagrams of the content item are used to derive a statistically principled method for content item search bias correction (SBC) in MMM. In some embodiments, this is based on the back-door criterion of causal inference.

- a causal diagram 200 is a representation of a causal diagram for content at a query level, where Q stands for a query, A stands for auction factors, O stands for organic search results, P indicates a paid search impression, and Y stands for the sales value.
- a causal diagram may be a directed acyclic graph (DAG), representing causal relationships between variables in a causal model. It comprises a set of variables, represented as nodes of the graph, defined as being within the scope of the model. An arrow from a first node to a second node represents causal influence from the first node to the second node. All other factors being equal, a change in the first node may cause changes in the second node.
- estimation methodology using the causal diagram is based on Pearl's causal theory.
- a simplified causal diagram about how search content affect sales is as follows.
- a search query e.g., flower delivery
- a search engine e.g., www.google.com
- search query e.g., flower delivery
- search engine e.g., www.google.com
- the auction considers various factors including bid, content item quality and content provider homepage quality.
- the user may click on some URLs from organic results or click on the content items, and then land on some flower delivery websites to make an order.
- A represents the auction factors
- Q is the search query controlled by a search user
- P indicates the presence of a paid search impression
- O is organic search results.
- O is determined by the search engine (plus user information if it is personalized search)
- P is determined by the search engine and other parties in the auction.
- Y be the sales value.
- the causal path goes as follows: 1) Q has two consequences P and O; 2) P is affected by both Q and A; 3) Y is affected by both O and P. Therefore, intervention on P has a direct effect on Y, while intervention on A does not have an effect on Y unless it causes changes in P.
- the causal diagram can be described by the directed acyclic graph shown in FIG. 2 .
- organic search content does not depend on paid search content—there is no arrow between P and O.
- x ⁇ hacek over ( ) ⁇ ) the causal effect of X on Y, denoted Pr(y
- the x ⁇ hacek over ( ) ⁇ notation indicates intervene by setting X to x.
- the causal effect of X on Y is identifiable if the quantity Pr(y
- identifiability means that, given an arbitrarily large sample from the joint distribution described by the causal diagram, the causal effect Pr(y
- a path between two nodes on a causal diagram is said to be d-separated or blocked by a subset of variables (nodes) Z if and only if either of the two conditions is satisfied: 1) the path contains a chain i ⁇ m ⁇ j or a fork i ⁇ m ⁇ j such that m E Z, or 2) the path contains an inverted fork i ⁇ m ⁇ j such that m/ ⁇ Z and such that no descendant of m belongs to Z.
- the back-door criterion can be stated as follows, given a causal diagram, a set of variables Z satisfies the back-door criterion relative to an ordered pair of variables (X, Y) in the diagram if: 1) no node in Z is a descendant of X; and 2) Z blocks every path between X and Y that contains an arrow into X.
- Condition 1) in the definition of the back-door criterion rules out covariates which are consequences of X, and condition 2) makes sure that Z contains the right set of confounding factors.
- x ⁇ ) ⁇ z ⁇ Pr ⁇ ( Y
- Z makes it possible to estimate the causal effect of X on Y.
- the node Q search query
- the node Q meets the back-door criterion for the causal effect of node P on Y. In some embodiments, this makes it possible to estimate the causal impact of search content item given proper query level data.
- Pearl's framework has the same goal as and can be translated to the counterfactual framework defined in the Neyman-Rubin causal model, but it also provides formal semantics to help visualize causal relationships.
- the back-door criterion provides a convenient tool for us to identify the proper set of covariates which satisfies the so-called ignorability assumption in order to identify causal effects from observational data.
- a general identification condition for causal effects is used.
- the methodology of selection bias correction for search content items is based on the back-door criterion.
- the process comprises determining if factors exist to derive a causal diagram and determining if any impact of auction factors is ignorable. If the impact of auction factors is not ignorable, then the process returns to determining if factors exist to derive a causal diagram. If the impact of auction factors are ignorable, the process determines if the budget of spend is unconstrained. If the budget for spend is unconstrained, then the process continues generating a first simple causal diagram. If the budget for spend is not unconstrained, the process comprises determining if the spend is directly connected to a factor of the causal diagram. If the spend is not directly connected, the process continues generating a first complex causal diagram. If the spend is not directly connected, the process continues generating a second complex causal diagram.
- a major factor which prevents the obtaining unbiased estimates of ⁇ 1 by ordinary least squares (OLS) is the correlation between X t and t . This can be caused by the endogeneity problem in econometrics.
- a further factor and an important contributor to sales is the direct impact from underlying consumer demand, denoted as 0 , which can be affected by economic factors and seasonality.
- Organic search results may contribute directly to sales, denoted as 1 .
- Due to content items targeting, factor to determine include organic search content and paid search content are typically positively correlated, resulting in cov(X, ⁇ 1 )>0.
- a main effect can be modeled as in model 4.1.
- a user submits a search query. There are typically two consequences: 1) the user would see a list of URLs plus a few lines of description in the main body of the search pages, called organic results, which are ranked by the search engine based on their relevance to the search query; 2) if the search query matches certain keywords targeted by a set of content providers, then the content items to be shown on the page will be chosen by auction.
- the auction considers various factors including bid, content item quality and content provider homepage quality. The user may click on some URLs from organic results or click on the ads, and then land on some relevant websites. The auction considers various factors including bid, content item quality and content provider homepage quality. The user may click on some URLs from organic results or click on the ads, and then land on some relevant content specific websites to make an order.
- search content items are determined by two parts: search queries are available to match keywords targeted by the content provider and the content provider has the budget to participate in the auction for search content items.
- a sponsored content providers budget can be evaluated to see if the budget is unconstrained for search content items specifically or if there are conditional or predetermined thresholds of volumes of relevant search queries. Larger or unconditional budgets allows for the consideration of the impact of consumer demand on auction factors such as content item provider's bids and competitors' actions in auction to be ignorable.
- organic search results may contribute directly to sales.
- due to content items targeting, organic search content and paid search content are positively correlated, resulting in a connection to a factor of the causal diagram.
- a first simple causal diagram is generated at 308 .
- a simple causal diagram is generated when a determination is made that that the budget for spend is unconstrained.
- a budget over a predetermined threshold amount is treated as unconstrained.
- search advertising is assumed to be the only advertising channel, and the contribution of other media channels on sales, if any, is ignorable.
- Xt is set to be the search content item spend for a particular product sold by an content provider at the tth time window and Yt is set as sales for the product during the t-th time window.
- a determination can be made that the impact of search content items on sales occurs within the same period as the content item exposure.
- a first complex causal diagram is generated at 312 . If search content item spend is not directly correlated with other media spend, but is mostly determined by the availability of search content item inventory through consumers' relevant search query volume, then the causal diagram reduces to FIG. 6 . This holds approximately for many content providers, for example when content providers use bid optimization instead of specific budget constraint to control search content item spend.
- non-search contributors as well as their potential lag effects do not affect the identifiability of ⁇ 1.
- search content providing is not the only channel that may affect sales significantly.
- X2 denotes all non-search content item contributors, e.g. traditional media channels and non-search digital channels, which may directly affect sales. Non-search contributors may also trigger consumers to search more online for the product (i.e. a funnel effect).
- Content providers may want to plan budgets for both search content items and other media channels.
- a second complex causal diagram is generated at 314 .
- the second complex causal diagram can be generated if the first complex causal diagram can be reduced because spend is not directly correlated with other media spend, but is mostly determined by the availability of search content inventory. If search content item spend is not directly correlated with other media spend, but is mostly determined by the availability of search content item inventory through consumers' relevant search query volume, then the causal diagram reduces to FIG. 6 . This holds approximately for many content providers, for example when content providers use bid optimization instead of specific budget constraint to control search content item spend. Under this approximation, non-search contributors as well as their potential lag effects do not affect the identifiability of ⁇ 1.
- a block diagram is shown of a simple causal diagram 400 according to an example embodiment.
- a block diagram 500 is shown of a complex causal diagram according to an example embodiment.
- a block diagram 600 is shown of a complex causal diagram with some simplifying assumptions according to an example embodiment.
- this causal diagram represents a simple case where search content item is the only media channel that a content provider has invested.
- the back-door criterion to derive the method of bias correction for the corresponding causal diagram is used.
- search advertising is assumed to be the only advertising channel, and the contribution of other media channels on sales, if any, is ignorable. If Xt are the search content item spend for a particular product sold by a content provider at the t-th time window and Yt be sales for the product during the t-th time window, it can be assumed that the impact of search content items on sales occurs within the same period as the content item exposure.
- ⁇ 1 is called the ROAS for search ads. That is, ⁇ 1Xt measures the causal impact of search content items on sales, and t represents other impact on sales (with the mean absorbed by the intercept ⁇ 0) which are not explained by Xt.
- a factor which prevents the obtaining of unbiased estimates of ⁇ 1 by ordinary least squares (OLS) is the correlation between Xt and t. This is called the endogeneity problem in econometrics.
- OLS ordinary least squares
- V the sufficient statistics to summarize the volumes of relevant search queries that have potential impact on the sales of the product. Since different queries may have a different effect on sales, V is measured as a multi-dimensional time series. When V is measured accurately, based on the search content items mechanism it is reasonable to assume that ⁇ 1 ⁇ X
- search content items are determined by two parts: search queries are available to match keywords targeted by the content provider and the content provider has the budget to participate in the auction for search content items.
- X,V ) ⁇ 0 + ⁇ 1 X+E ( ⁇
- X,V ) E ( ⁇ 51 V ). then E ( Y
- X,V ) ⁇ 0 + ⁇ 1 X+ ⁇ ( V ).
- both ⁇ (•) and ⁇ 1 are identifiable. Therefore, under regularity conditions, ⁇ 1 can be estimated consistently by the usual regression method which minimizes ⁇ Y ⁇ 0 ⁇ 1 X ⁇ (V) ⁇ with respect to parameters ( ⁇ 0 , ⁇ 1 , ⁇ ) with proper regularization on ⁇ .
- ⁇ is known to be a linear function, the estimate of ⁇ 1 is not only consistent but unbiased.
- the model represented in FIG. 6 falls into a class of semiparametric models where the parameter of interest is ⁇ 1 and the nuisance parameters include ⁇ (•) and the residual distribution of ⁇ , assumed to have mean 0 and unknown finite variance.
- the formulation of the model in FIG. 4 may still provide interesting insight regarding the average causal effect. The result can be extended naturally when the linear form ⁇ 1 X is relaxed to an unknown function.
- assumption (a) and (b) above are special cases where one expects the causal diagram in FIG. 4 to hold.
- assumption (a) can be checked.
- the essential assumption required by the causal diagram is that search content item spend only depends on the volumes of relevant search queries and other factors can be treated as noise unaffected by consumer demand.
- the assumptions in Theorem 1 are sufficient but not necessary, for example, if search content item spend only depends on content item budget and is entirely randomized so that assumption (a) is violated, then model, 4.3, can still give a consistent estimate of search ad ROAS as defined in model, 4.1,
- FIG. 6 a block diagram 600 is shown of a complex causal diagram with some simplifying assumptions according to an example embodiment.
- the more complex causal diagram models cases where search advertising is not the only channel that may affect sales significantly.
- X2 denotes all non-search content item contributors, e.g. traditional media channels and non-search digital channels, which may directly affect sales. Non-search contributors may also trigger consumers to search more online for the product (i.e. a funnel effect). Content providers might want to plan budgets for both search content items and other media channels.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example of causal diagram for such a scenario. As in the case above, this graph is a dramatic simplification. For example, it does not describe complexity such as historical content items may impact current sales (lag effect of non-search contributors), and it may ignore potentially weak links not shown on the diagram.
- search content item spend is not directly correlated with other media spend, but is mostly determined by the availability of search content item inventory through consumers' relevant search query volume, then the causal diagram reduces the model represented in FIG. 6 . This holds approximately for many content providers, for example when content providers use bid optimization instead of specific budget constraint to control search content item spend. Under this approximation, non-search contributors as well as their potential lag effects do not affect the identifiability of ⁇ 1.
- the simplified theory for the complex scenarios may be derived as in Theorem 2.
- Remark 4 there is no budget constraint on search content item spend. This implies that the scenario identified by FIG. 6 can be more common than the more complex one in FIG. 5 . Practical models for the scenario of FIG. 5 may require careful consideration of lag effects in X2.
- (X1,V) does not satisfy the back-door criterion for X2 ⁇ Y, since the path X2 ⁇ consumer demand is not blocked.
- X2 may represent social media content item spend. This suggests that the causal effect of X2 on sales cannot be estimated consistently by observations on (Y, X1, X2, V) only.
- Remark 6 if an additional variable can be collected so as to satisfy the back-door criterion for X2 ⁇ Y, there is no guarantee that one can estimate the causal effects of X1 and X2 simultaneously from a single regression in traditional MMMs. If the two subsets of variables that satisfy the back-door criterion for X1 ⁇ Y and X2 ⁇ Y separately, are not the same, by regression against all relevant variables one may obtain uninterpretable results and even Simpson paradox, for example, by conditioning on unnecessary covariates, one may obtain negative impact for some media while the true impact is positive.
- the process comprises identifying a first URL associated with an incremental value change of a first metric, identifying a plurality of URLs associated with the first URL, receiving search query data comprising queries, partition the received search query data to a plurality of groups, generating a plurality of search query subsets based on the plurality of the groups, generating an additive regression model based on a causal diagram, and calculating a bias corrected estimate of the incremental value change.
- the process may also comprise generating a causal diagram for use when generating an additive egression model based on the plurality of groups.
- a causal diagram is generated at 702 in some embodiments.
- a causal diagram can be a directed acyclic graph (DAG), representing causal relationships between variables in a causal model. It comprises of a set of variables, represented as nodes of the graph, defined as being within the scope of the model.
- An arrow from node i to another node j represents causal in sequence from i to j, i.e. all other factors being equal, a change in i may cause changes in j.
- a first URL associated with an incremental value change of a first metric is identified at 704 .
- V represents the volumes of relevant search queries that have potential impact on the sales of the product. The total number of relevant search queries is potentially very large, so it is important to summarize search queries in a way that can be used conveniently for model fitting. The summarization of V may not be straightforward, as the potential impact of each query term can be different.
- a first URL may be identified by identifying a content provider's website. In some embodiments, the content provider's top competitor's websites are also identified and its top competitors' websites.
- a plurality of URLs associated with the first URL is identified at 706 .
- search query data comprising queries is received. For example, all queries associated with a target region, time window, demographic, and the like may be collected. For each query, the number of times each URL appears in the organic search results is counted (e.g., destination URLs). In some embodiments, if the set of URLs associated with the query contains the content provider's website, then the query is considered relevant to that content provider. Each relevant query in S may represent a different level of demand for the content provider's product.
- the received search query data is partitioned to a plurality of groups at 710 .
- a relevant query set S is partitioned into three groups according to the mix of URLs that appear for each query.
- the destination URLs appearing in the organic results can also be classified into four groups: a) belongs to the content provider, b) belongs to top competitors, c) does not belong to the content provider or its competitors, but belongs to the business category, and d) does not belong to the business category.
- the sum of the number of impressions for the URLs classified into each group can be denoted as wi,a, wi,b, wi,c and wi,d respectively.
- wi,total wi,a+wi,b+wi,c+wi,d be the total impressions for qi
- wi,category wi,a+wi,b+wi,c be the category impressions for qi.
- a plurality of search query subsets based on the plurality of groups is generated at 712 .
- the queries are ignored as it is less likely to be relevant. Otherwise: if a target subset is greater than a pre-determined threshold, classify it as target-favoring, else if an associated competitor's subset is greater than a threshold, classify it as competitor-favoring, else classify it as general-interest. In some embodiments, this results in three subsets of queries, say, S1 containing all target-favoring queries, S2 containing all competitors-favoring queries, and S3 containing all general-interest queries.
- V1t target-favoring
- V2t competitiveors-favoring
- V3t general-interest
- the sum V1t+V2t+V3t can be designated category search volume at time window t.
- 50% is a reasonable choice for the thresholds required for the above segmentation procedure.
- An additive regression model based on a causal diagram is generated at 714 .
- Implementation of the SBC method may rely on fitting the additive models identified by Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.
- a bias corrected estimate of the incremental value change is calculated at 716 .
- the bias corrected estimation of ⁇ 1 may be implemented by fitting an additive regression model.
- the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) algorithm is used which reformulates the additive regression procedure as fitting a parametric mixed effect model.
- ⁇ (V) when the number of search queries is large enough, instead of approximating ⁇ (V) by an additive function, one can approximate ⁇ (V) directly by a 3-dimension full tensor product smooth and estimate ⁇ 1 by the regression below: Y ⁇ 0+ ⁇ 1 X+te ( V 1, V 2, V 3) (5.2) where te is the R function in MGCV to implement the full tensor product smooth.
- the naive estimate fitted by OLS can also be calculated as follows: Y ⁇ 0+ ⁇ 1 X. (5.3)
- a demand-adjusted estimate is also included and is calculated by: Y ⁇ 0+ ⁇ 1 X+s ( S ) (5.4) where S stands for a consumer demand proxy variable.
- Category search volume may used for S.
- each dot is for a relevant query.
- the x-axis shows target_weight/category_weight and y-axis shows category_weight/total_weight.
- the queries on the right hand side of the vertical red line are grouped as target-favoring.
- the time series of sales, search ad.spend and search query volume may be simulated from real data in the first case study below, where each time series is rescaled by its median value.
- the time series of each variable in each case follows a clear seasonality pattern, e.g. day of the week, and seasonal trends.
- data is kept private and the scale of each variable is not reported to keep data privacy, the scale of each variable is not reported, but some high level summary statistics are reported such as pairwise correlation and fitted model parameters.
- the experimental point estimate is scaled to equal one and all results and standard errors are indexed to that result.
- a scatter plot and block diagram 900 illustrating correlations between metrics and an estimated ROAS for a first case study is illustrated according to an example embodiment.
- the content provider is a medium-size (with annual revenue of tens of millions of USD) e-commerce retailer and provides offline delivery of the product after receiving customers' orders online.
- Search advertising was the only major marketing channel, with no significant spend on other media channels.
- the data available in this example comprises y metrics of sales, content item spend and search query volumes for 65 days in 2015.
- the left panel in the top row of FIG. 6.2 shows the pairwise scatterplot, where the numbers on the upper panels are the Pearson correlation. For example, the correlation between ad.spend and sales is 0.91.
- a simple linear model with ad.spend may fit and predict sales well.
- the strong correlation (0.91) between target-favoring search query volume and content item spend in this case suggests that: 1) there may be strong content item targeting, and 2) the content provider rarely or never hits the top of their search content item budget.
- the correlation between search volume and sales is 0.97.
- SBC-SP is fitted as described in model (5.1): response ⁇ 0 + ⁇ 1 ⁇ ad.spend+s(target)+s(competitors)+s(general.interest) where target, competitors and general.interest represent target-favoring, competitor-favoring and general interest search query volumes separately.
- the point estimate of ⁇ 1 is 3.0 with standard error 1.02.
- the fitted smooth function for target-favoring query volume is monotonically increasing and almost linear (see FIG. 12 ).
- the adjusted R2 value is 0.95.
- the monotonicity is expected, but it is interesting to see the fitted curve from data directly without forcing monotonicity in any way.
- the fitted function for competitors-favoring search volume on the other hand is not statistically significant, while the one for general interest is statistically significant.
- model 5.3 The naive estimate of ⁇ 1 based on OLS, model 5.3 is 14.7, with std.error 0.83.
- the fitted value is 7.1 with std.error 1.51.
- the content provider conducted the randomized geo experiments during the second month of the period.
- the indexed experimental estimate of ROAS has std.error 0.66.
- the naive estimate of ROAS is almost 15-fold larger than the experimental result.
- the gap shrinks but the estimate is still seven times as large.
- the SBC estimate is much closer to the experimental result. See the comparison in FIG. 9 .
- a scatter plot and block diagram 1000 illustrating correlations between metrics and an estimated ROAS for a second case study is illustrated according to an example embodiment.
- the content provider's business is, for example, a travel marketplace.
- the search content item spend, KPI, search query volumes data are illustrated on a daily basis over a period of about four months (135 days). A randomized experiment is shown in the last six weeks.
- the demand adjustment does not reduce the bias much, bringing the estimated ROAS from 8.4 (with standard error 1.30) to 7.3 (with standard error 1.14).
- the SBC estimate is 1.9 with standard error 0.71, much closer to the experimental result with standard error 0.14. See the comparison in FIG. 10 .
- the fitted smooth function for the target-favoring search volume again is monotonically increasing and almost linear.
- the competitors favoring search volume is not statistically significant, as shown in FIG. 10 . It is noticeable that the correlation between target-favoring search volume and search content item spend is only 0.47, much lower than that in FIG. 9 , but the strong correlation between sales and search volume may suggest that underlying consumer demand or organic search or both have contributed to sales dramatically in this case.
- FIG. 11 a scatter plot and block diagram 1100 illustrating correlations between metrics and an estimated ROAS for a third case study is illustrated according to an example embodiment.
- the content provider is, for example, a national apparel retailer and the KPI is the number of visits to their website.
- the data covers about three months (88 days). A randomized experiment is shown in the last six weeks.
- the SBC estimate of ROAS is 0.8 with standard error 0.28, the naive estimate is 2.9 with standard error 0.23, while the demand-adjusted estimate is 1.4 with standard error 0.33. See the graphical comparison in FIG. 11 .
- the naive estimate is about three times larger than the experimental result.
- the demand adjusted estimate is about half of that, much closer to the experimental result.
- the SBC estimate is again quite comparable to the experimental result.
- the fitted curve for target-favoring search query volume is again almost linear except steeper at the left end and the other two search dimensions have ignorable impact, as shown in FIG. 6.3( c ) .

Abstract
Description
X i=ƒi(pa i,∈i)
where ƒi is a function, pai is the set of parents of Xi and i is an arbitrarily y determined random disturbance that must be independent of all other variables and disturbances in the model.
In other words, in some embodiments, Z makes it possible to estimate the causal effect of X on Y.
Y=β 0+(β1+γ)X+η.
Y t=β0+β1 X t +∈t (4.1)
where the parameter of interest is β1, measuring the expected incremental value of one unit change in search content item spend Xt but conditional on no change in t. Here β1 is called the ROAS for search ads. That is, β1Xt measures the causal impact of search content items on sales, and t represents other impact on sales (with the mean absorbed by the intercept β0) which are not explained by Xt.
∈1 ⊥X|V (4.2)
i.e. conditional on the relevant search queries, search content item spend is independent of potential organic search impact.
-
- (a) the content provider's budget for search content items is unconstrained
- (b) conditional on volumes of relevant search queries, the impact of consumer demand on auction factors such as the content provider's bid and competitors' actions is ignorable
In some embodiments, under these assumptions, the causal diagram can be described as inFIG. 4 . The diagram implicitly assumes both
∈1 ⊥X|V and ∈0 ⊥X|V.
Y=β 0+β1 X+ƒ(V)+η (4.3)
where ƒ(•) is an unknown function and η is the residual, uncorrelated with X and ƒ(V). For example, there are four paths from search content item spend X to sales that contains an arrow into search content item as shown in
E(Y|X,V)=β0+β1 X+E(∈|X,V).
Due to the conditional independence (∈0,∈1)⊥X|V assumed by the causal diagram, the following is derived:
E(∈|X,V)=E(∈51 V).
then
E(Y|X,V)=β0+β1 X+ƒ(V).
Y=β0+β1X1+ƒ(V,X2)+η (4.4)
where
ƒ(v,x 2)=E(∈0 |V=v,X 2 =x 2)+E(∈1 |V=v)+E(∈2 |X 2 =x 2)
and η is the residual, uncorrelated with X1 and ƒ(V,X2).
Y=β0+β1X1+ƒ(V)+η (4.5)
where β1 is the parameter of interest and ƒ is an unknown function. That is, the estimation procedure is the same as for the simple scenario described earlier. In some embodiments, upon proof of (1), it may be verified by definition that (V,X2) satisfies the back-door criterion for X1→Y and thus makes the causal effect of X1 on Y identifiable. Next due to ∈1⊥X1|V, ∈2⊥X1|X2 and ∈0⊥X1|(V,X2), from the causal diagram, it may be shown that
E(Y|X 1 ,X 2 ,V)=β0+β1 +E(∈1 |V)+E(∈2 |X 2)+E(β0 |V,X 2)
Y˜β0+β1X+te(V1,V2,V3) (5.2)
where te is the R function in MGCV to implement the full tensor product smooth.
β^1=\sum_t(s^((1+δ)Xt)−s^(Xt))/(δ\sum_tXt)
Y˜β0+β1X. (5.3)
Y˜β0+β1X+s(S) (5.4)
where S stands for a consumer demand proxy variable. Category search volume may used for S.
