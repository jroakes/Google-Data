Definitions
- This document relates to systems and techniques for multi-modal input into an electronic device and conversion of spoken input to text.
- keyboards are common input devices, and they typically include single-digit numbers (e.g., in a cellular telephone) each of the letters in the alphabet, and some characters (e.g., in Qwerty or Dvorak keyboards).
- keyboards are frequently “virtual” in form, and are displayed on a touch screen of a device.
- Such keyboards may be made available to various different applications running on a device, using a program known as an Input Method Editor, or IME, so that the IME receives the user input and then passes it to whatever application is currently active on the device.
- IME Input Method Editor
- An IME can also translate user input, such as when a user enters Roman characters in a written language like Pinyin, and the IME generates Chinese characters that correspond to the typed Pinyin. Where the Pinyin corresponds to multiple possible characters, the IME can display all such characters, the user can tap the intended character, and the IME can pass that character to the operating application.
- keyboards Users of computer devices, and particularly of mobile computing devices, may be constrained in their use of a keyboard.
- the keyboard itself may be constrained in size because mobile device displays are small, so that only a sub-set of relevant characters can be displayed or the keys may be too small to press accurately.
- the user may be constrained, in that they cannot easily type on a keyboard while walking through a crowded airport or driving a car. In such situations, spoken input may be preferred over typed input.
- speech-to-text conversion or translation typically requires lots of computer processing power, and mobile devices typically do not have much processing power. Also, such conversion often requires a particular user to “train” the system so that it better understands the user's voice and speech patterns.
- an IME that provides keyboard services to a device may also provide for spoken input to the device.
- Much of the IME services may be unchanged from an ordinary IME, but the IME may be augmented to provide for speech-to-text conversion.
- the IME may take a user input in whatever form (e.g., typed, spoken, D Pad, etc.) and may convert it to a standard form for presentation to an active application (e.g., passing characters or other key presses).
- Applications may subscribe to the IME's services just as they would subscribe if the IME did not accept voice input, and the provision of such speech-to-text functionality can be transparent to the applications.
- a user could choose when to provide typed input and when to provide spoken input to the IME.
- the user may be in an application that requires input, and may take an appropriate action to invoke the IME (e.g., pressing a particular button or soft key on the device, moving the device in a certain manner, and the like).
- a keyboard may be initially displayed on the user's device, and the user may take another appropriate action to indicate that he or she will provide speech input. For example, the user may press a microphone button on the virtual keyboard, or may make a swipe across the virtual keyboard or another action that is inconsistent with an intent to provide typed input in the virtual keyboard.
- the IME can begin “listening” to the device's microphone and after the user has spoken, may pass corresponding text to the application.
- speech-to-text functionality may be provided on a computing device relatively simply, while re-using other IME functionality (e.g., interfaces to applications on a device) that is needed for keyboard-based IME translation.
- IME functionality e.g., interfaces to applications on a device
- Use of context-specific language models in the manners discussed above and below may also permit more accurate conversion of speech to text, regardless of whether the system is trained to a particular user.
- Such context-specificity may also be provided automatically and transparently for a user, and at a level of specificity that is most suited to a particular situation.
- the language model for the page may be used, but if the user is interacting with a form on the page, a more specific language model that is directed to that form or a particular field on the form may be used (with lower weightings, but higher-than-normal weightings, applied to the page-specific model).
- Particular manners of using public user activity, such as search activity, to build contextual language models may also result in the generation of accurate models in a convenient manner.
- Such data may be made available via natural user activity that is already occurring voluntarily by the users.
- the activity may occur in large enough volumes to provide enough data needed to generate a complete and accurate model for many contexts, and in this case, for many web pages.
- the models may also be updated over time, because the public user activity occurs continuously over time, so that continuously up-to-date models may be provided to users seeking speech-to-text conversion services.
- a request can be received from a user of an electronic device for an application-independent input method editor having written and spoken input capabilities. That the user intends to provide spoken input to the application-independent input method editor can be identified, and the spoken input can be received from the user.
- the spoken input can be input to an application executing on the electronic device.
- the spoken input can be provided to a remote server.
- the remote server includes a speech recognition system configured to recognize text based on the spoken input. Text can be received from the remote server, where the text represents the spoken input. The text can be provided to the application as user input.
- a request is received from a user of an electronic device for an application-independent input method editor having written and spoken input capabilities.
- the application-independent input method editor is configured to receive input for multiple applications executable by the electronic device. It is identified that the user is about to provide spoken input to the application-independent input method editor.
- the spoken input is received from the user and corresponds to an input to an application from the multiple applications.
- the spoken input is provided to a remote server, which remote server includes a speech recognition system configured to recognize text based on the spoken input and is a server that is remote to the electronic device. Text is received from the remote server that represents the spoken input. The text is provided as the input to the application.
- Implementations of the methods, computer program products and systems can include one or more of the following features.
- a list of candidates of text representing the spoken input can be presented to the user.
- a selection can be received from the user of a candidate from the list.
- Providing the text to the application as user input can include providing the selection of the candidate from the list to the application.
- a written input can be received from the user and a language of the written input determined.
- a language indicator can be provided to the remote server based on the determined language indicating the language of the spoken input.
- a context indicator can be provided to the remote server such that the speech recognition system can select a language model from multiple language models based on the context indicator.
- the context indicator can specify the context in which the user input is received, a webpage in which the user input is received, an application in which the user input is received, a web form in which the user input is received, a field in the web form in which the user input is received and/or metadata associated with the field in the web form to name a few examples.
- a written input can be received from the user in a first writing system, and one or more candidates can be presented in a second writing system based on the written input in the first writing system.
- the first writing system is Pinyin and the second writing system is Hanzi.
- Intermediate processing can be performed on the received spoken input, e.g., noise reduction, filtering, or otherwise, and the spoken input provided to the remote server can be the intermediately processed spoken input.
- a request is received from a user of an electronic device for an application-independent input method editor having written and spoken input capabilities.
- the application-independent input method editor is configured to receive input for multiple applications executable by the electronic device. It is identified that the user is about to provide spoken input to the application-independent input method editor.
- the spoken input is received from the user and corresponds to an input to an application from the multiple applications.
- the spoken input is converted at the electronic device to text that represents the spoken input. The text is provided as the input to the application.

- This document describes techniques and systems that may be used to provide speech-to-text conversion for a user of a computing device, such as a smartphone.
- the speech input may be handled in a manner similar to other input (e.g., typed input) using an application such as an IME, where the IME can be switched into modes depending on the manner that the user chooses to enter data.
- an application such as an IME
- the input may in certain circumstances be transmitted (either in a raw or converted form) to a server system remote from the computing device that may be programmed to pass a transformed input back to the device, such as by providing text in response to receiving spoken inputs.
- the computing device may also provide the server system with meta data that is passed with, or at essentially the same time as, the spoken inputs, and the meta data may be used by the server system to identify a context in which the user is entering the spoken input.
- the server system may then use that meta data to identify a language model to be used and/or to build a language model on the fly, such as by dynamically applying particular weightings to different language models (which may each be derived from different input corpuses).
- FIG. 1A is a conceptual diagram of an example system 100 that includes a multi-modal input method editor (IME) 102 .

- the text 113 can be displayed to the user on a display 122 of the electronic device 104 .
- the user 101 can select a candidate from the list that corresponds to the user's spoken input, for example, using the keyboard 108 or another input mechanism, such as touching the touch screen over one of the candidates, to navigate the list and make a selection.
- the user can also provide written input, and can provide input using a combination of written and spoken input.
- the user can begin a search query in a web browser by speaking one or more words and can then add to the query string by typing additional input using the keyboard 108 .
- the IME 102 can provide the combined user input to the relevant application, i.e., the web browser application in this example.
- the language that the written input is written in can be determined and then provided as a language indicator to the remote server 114 .
- the remote server 114 can use the language indicator when converting the speech utterance 111 to the text 113 . For example, by knowing the language in which the speech is spoken, an appropriate language model 120 can be selected for use by the speech recognizer 118 .

- a Hanzi term can be composed of more than one Pinyin input.
- the first data store 134 and/or the second data store 136 can store an association of inputs. Based on a user input, the input method editor instance 133 can use information in the data store 134 and/or the data store 136 to identify one or more candidate selections represented by the input. In some implementations, if more than one candidate selection is identified, the candidate selections are displayed on an output device 140 . For example, if the user input is spoken input, then a list of candidate selections showing written text representations of the spoken input can be presented to the user on the output device 140 . In another example, if the user input is Pinyin inputs, the user can select from the candidate selections a Hanzi term, for example, that the user desires to input.

- the language model 168 can define one or more language sub-models, each sub-model tailored to a particular application, or webpage, or webform on a particular webpage, or website, to name a few examples.
- Each language sub-model can, for example, define a particular rule set, e.g., grammar particular to a language, phrase sets, verbals, etc., that can be used to determine a user's likely intent in entering a set of inputs (e.g., inputs for generating candidates that are translations, transliterations, or other types of phonetic representations).

- the request can be received by a mobile electronic device that has a touchscreen keyboard.
- Example screenshots from such a mobile electronic device are shown in FIGS. 3A-E . These screenshots can be used to illustrate the example process 200 , however, it should be understood that other devices can implement the process 200 , and the screenshots shown are not intended to be limiting.
- FIG. 3A shows a screenshot 300 where a user has selected to activate a web browser application. Through the web browser application, the user has selected to navigate to the Google search page at the URL www google.com 302 .
- FIG. 3B shows a screen shot 304 with a soft touchscreen keyboard 306 displayed in a lower portion of the display screen. For example, the user can touch or tap the screen in the search query field 308 to automatically have the keyboard 306 displayed, although other mechanisms can be used to trigger the display of the keyboard 306 .
- the example keyboard 306 shown includes a microphone key 310 .
- An example of a request that can be received from the user includes the user selecting the microphone key 310 .
- Another example includes the user selecting a graphical entity, such as a microphone icon or button, displayed next to or in an input field, e.g., in search query field 308 .
- a graphical entity such as a microphone icon or button
- Another example includes the user swiping his/her finger across the input field, e.g., in a left to right motion, or tapping the input field.
- Yet another example includes the user picking up the device in a manner that is consistent with raising a microphone included in the device to the proximity of the user's mouth, which can be detected, for example, by an accelerometer reading.
- Other forms of request can be received from the user for an application-independent input method editor having written and spoken input capabilities, and the above are but some examples.
- a user's intention to provide spoken input to the application-independent input method editor is then identified in the process (Step 204 ). For example, receiving a speech utterance from the user can be used to identify that the user intends to provide spoken input. In other implementations, receiving the request from the user for the input method editor with written and spoken input capabilities can also be used to identify that the user intends to provide spoken input, i.e., the same user action can provide both the request and be used to identify the user's intention. In some implementations, as shown in the screenshot 312 in FIG. 3C , a graphical element can be displayed that prompts the user to speak, such as the microphone graphic 314 and the instructions “Speak now” 316 .
- a spoken input i.e., a speech utterance
- the user provides the spoken input as input to an application that is executing on the device (Step 206 ).
- the spoken input is provided to a remote server that includes a speech recognition system configured to recognize text based on the spoken input (Step 208 )
- the spoken input can be sent over the network 146 to the remote system 148 , where the remote system 148 includes a speech recognition system to recognize text from a speech utterance.
- a graphic is displayed to the user to indicate that the process is in progress, such as the “Working” graphic 320 shown in the screenshot 322 in FIG. 3D .
- Text is then received from the remote server, where the text represents the spoken input (Step 210 ).
- the remote server e.g., remote system 148
- the corresponding text is sent back to the user's device and can be displayed for the user.
- the best candidate for representation of the speech utterance is selected by the speech recognition system at the remote server and provided to the device.
- an n-best list of candidates can be provided and presented to the user for selection of the correct candidate. For example, referring to FIG. 3E , a screen shot 324 shows a list of suggestions, with the best candidate “the man in the moon” displayed at the top of the list as the default selection.
- the text i.e., the spoken input converted to written input
- the application as user input (Step 212 ). That is, once the correct text conversion is selected, if a list of candidates was provided, or once the best candidate has been received, if only one was sent from the remote server, the written input can be passed to the application as the user input for processing by the application.
- a context indicator can be sent with the spoken input to the remote system for conversion to text.
- the remote system can use the context indicator to facilitate the speech-to-text conversion.
- the context indicator can be used as a basis for selecting an appropriate language model to use by the speech recognition system.
- the context indicator can specify the context in which the spoken user input was received.
- the context indicator can specify a name of a field, e.g., in a web form, the name of the application in which the input was received, and/or identify a web page if the user input was received in a web browser application.
- the context indicator can include metadata relating to a field in which the user input was received.
- the metadata can specify that the field requires a one-word answer, or a date, or a name, and the like.
- the context indicator information can be obtained by the input method editor from the operating system of the electronic device.
- the device may pass a sound file (including streaming sound data) of the spoken input to a remote server system, and may take steps to improve the quality of the speech-to-text conversion.
- the device may pass information that allows the server system to select a language model that is relatively small in size and is specific to the task that the user is currently facing. For example, when applications register with the IME, they may provide information about fields into which a user can enter information in the applications. The IME can pass such information to the server system, so that the server system may select an appropriate language model.
- the IME can pass such information to the server system so that, for example, a user utterance that sounds like “scheet” is interpreted as “street” and not “sweet.”
- the language model that is applied may also be a composite of, or interpolation of, multiple separate language models.
- the different models may be relatively small models that have been derived from large data corpuses (e.g., SMS messages and e-mail messages).
- the models may be prepared off-line by analyzing such corpuses, and the mixture weights that are applied to the models may be generated on-the-fly at run-time, including after data from a particular instance of speech input starts being received from a user.
- the weightings may be a function, for example, of the field into which a user is currently making an utterance (e.g., the “to” or “from” fields of an email message versus the “body” field of an email message).
- the language model may also be chosen more generally, without reference to a particular input field in which the cursor is located.
- an application developer may register their application with an app store, and may indicate the type of application that it is, such as a music player.
- a server system may have a number of topic-specific language models that it stores.
- the IME may pass a “music” indication to the server system, so that the application is passed the word “heart,” and the user sees a song list for the female-led rock band.
- the IME may pass the word “Hart” (assuming there are no great movies or television shows with the word “heart” in their titles) so that the user is shown an index of the episodes of the iconic detective drama “Hart to Hart.”
- the domain or a sub-domain for the page may be provided, so that the that the language model will be specific to the particular type of web site.
- the language model may be one in which “shopping” terms have higher prominence.
- “product” may have a higher score than “protect” for similar sounds
- such a model may be prepared to be directed to the site itself (e.g., by analyzing input forms on the site, and analyzing text on the site), or on a category that the site matches.
- the same language model may be used for the sites Amazon.com, Buy.com, and the like.
- FIG. 4 is a block diagram of an example system 400 for receiving speech input and training language models to interpret the speech input.
- users of client devices enter data into text input fields, and a speech server analyzes that data to determine the type of text the users entered.
- the speech server builds language models from this information, and uses the language models to recognize speech input associated with similar input fields.
- Clients 402 can receive text input for web forms. When this input is used as part of a process to browse to another page, such as typing in a search field or order form field before pressing a submit button, the text and destination information can be saved in a toolbar log 404 .
- Clients 406 such as computers and mobile computing devices, can receive text based web search queries from users. These queries can be resolved by a web search server (not shown) and the queries and search results can be stored in query logs 408 .
- the client 406 can receive text input to applications, such as an email client, a messaging client, and/or a word processor and spoken input to applications. The text input and transcriptions of spoken input can be stored in input logs 409 .
- a speech recognition server 410 can retrieve the data in the toolbar logs 404 , the query logs 408 , and/or the input logs 409 .
- a speech recognition system 412 can group this data into categories or classifications.
- the speech recognition system 412 creates a series of language models 414 a - 414 n .
- the language models can contain words, phrases, sentences, etc. from the toolbar logs 404 , query logs 408 , and/or the input logs 409 based on a particular topic.
- the language model A 414 a is a language model of British last name, it can contain “Churchill.” “Bean,” and “Pigou.”
- the language model B 414 b contains technology-related language, it can contain “object oriented programming,” “reverse polish notation,” and “garbage in, garbage out.”
- the speech recognition system 412 can build interpolated language models from the language models 414 a - 414 n .
- the speech recognition system 412 can use an utterance with a known text result, and poll the language models 414 a - 414 n to determine the confidence level that each language model 414 a - 414 n would associate with the utterance/known text pair.
- the confidence level returned by each language model 414 a - 414 n can be used by the speech recognition system 412 to create an interpolated language model. For example, using a test utterance and text of “Mr.
- the language model A 414 a gives a confidence level of 50%
- the language model B 414 b give a confidence level of 65%
- the other language models 414 c - 414 n give substantially 0% confidence levels.
- the speech recognition system 412 can create an interpolated language model that heavily weighs the language model A and B 414 a - b .
- the particular weightings may be equal to or proportional to the confidence levels, in certain implementations.
- a client device 416 can execute an application that accepts text input and can receive an utterance from a user for that text input.
- the client device 416 can transmit the utterance, along with the context in which the utterance was made or received, to the speech recognition server 410 for translation into text.
- the context in which an utterance is received is determined by the client device 416 with the field name or label associated with the text input.
- some applications include metadata for an application input field such as package name, field number or name, and/or attribute flags (e.g. long sentence, email, street address, etc.).
- a text label associated with or displayed near an input box is used to determine the context.
- a speech service 418 can receive the utterance and context.
- the speech service 418 can map the context to broader categories or to the categories of the language models 414 a - 414 n .
- the speech service 418 can maintain a cache of utterances and resultant texts, and if a received utterance substantially matches a cached utterance, the speech service 418 can return the appropriate cached resultant texts.
- the speech recognition system 412 uses or creates an interpolated language model to recognize the text in the utterance.
- a single candidate text is identified.
- the top n candidates are identified either wherein all candidates meet a certain confidence threshold, or wherein the top n candidates are selected.
- the text or texts identified by the speech recognition system 412 is returned to the client 416 , where it is, for example, displayed in a text input field that has focus.
- Such context-specific language models may be generated in a variety of ways, including by using search information from a public search engine. For example, bi-grams may be made between search queries and web sites that are highly relevant to those queries (e.g., are in the list of top 10 sites returned to the queries). The queries and sites may then be assigned as nodes in a graph, joined by the relationship between the two clusters of such relationships may then be identified, and language models may be generated for those clusters. A particular language model for a web site may then be generated as a weighted combination of the language models for the clusters around the site in the graph.
- FIG. 5A is a block diagram 500 of queries and associated websites in search results.
- a group of queries 502 is a collection of example queries that can be collected from a browser executing a toolbar.
- the queries can be submitted to a web search engine, and a list of search results can be returned.
- a search for “mike lebeau” can result in search results including facebook.com and linkedin.com.
- a search for “blink” can result in search results including amazon.com.
- the queries and associated websites can be used, for example, in determining a relationship between queries and related topics or categories.
- facebook.com and linkedin.com are social network websites, it can be determined that the queries “bill byrne,” “will rusch,” “mike lebeau,” and “brian stope” may be the names of people.
- amazon.com is a retailer with a reputation as a book retailer, it can be determined that “blink” and “great gatsby” may be the names or titles of a retail products, perhaps books.
- a search for “william gibson” returns links to both facebook.com and amazon.com, it can be determined that “william gibson” may be an author.
- FIG. 5B is a URL showing search terms in a query.
- the URL in this example can be recorded by a web browser executing a toolbar.
- a user submits a form via a GET request, the contents of the form can be encoded and logged in the URL parameters.
- a search on the webpage facebook.com can generate the URL shown.
- the name parameter 550 in this example “bill %20byrne”, indicates that “bill byrne” was entered into a field in a web form.
- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an example system 600 for recognizing speech input to a computing device.
- a user enters speech input to an application via an IME.
- the speech input is analyzed at a speech recognition server and text is returned to the application.
- An application 604 executes on a computing device 602 , for example a mobile computing device.
- An input method manager 608 can manage input methods that the application 604 accepts, including speech input from a user.
- a speech IME 610 in the operating system of the computing device 602 records speech input and collects context data from an input context 612 .
- Speech IME 160 can transmit the speech input and context to a voice data center 614 .
- a speech service front end 616 can receive the speech input and context and prepare the speech input and context for analysis. For example, statistics can be collected, recognition jobs can be created and sorted, etc.
- a speech recognition system 618 examines the context, and selects an associated language model from a big table of language models 622 .
- the associated language model in the big table of language models 622 can contain a reference to a language model in a ProdLM 620 .
- the speech recognition system 618 uses the referenced language model in the ProdLM 620 to analyze the speech input and determine a text string.
- the text string is returned to the speech input method 610 , for example by way of the speech service front end 616 .
- the text string can be presented to the user of the computing device 602 , and if approved by the user, can be sent to the application 604 as text input.
- data obtained from web toolbar logs can be used in determining an interpolated language model.
- a sample of content of user input (e.g., queries) into a web form can be obtained from web toolbar logs, e.g., in URLs. That is, when a user submits a web form via a GET request, the content of the user input into fields of the web form can be encoded and logged in the URL parameters (e.g., as was described above in reference to FIG. 5B ).
- a toolbar log can therefore provide sample data of what users have input (i.e., typed) into each of the fields of a number of web forms.
- the volume of this data may be too sparse to train a good language model for the web form.
- a larger training set can be available if queries of the same category as the queries input into the particular web form are used. That is, queries that correspond to search results having similar websites in the top N search results (where N is an integer, e.g., 10) as each other are probably generally within the same category.
- clusters in a search query-search result (website) graph (where queries and websites are assigned to nodes) can be identified, where an edge between a particular query node and a particular website node occurs whenever the website appears in the top N results for the particular query.
- a language model can then be trained per cluster, that is, language models can be trained for a category (if a cluster is representative of a category of queries).
- the interpolated language model can be built using multiple language models formed from a number of clusters.
- the multiple language models can be selected as follows
- a sample of user input into the particular web form i.e., sample queries
- the sample data may be the query “bill byrne” that is input into a web form on the www.facebook.com website, which is also reflected in the graph shown in FIG. 5A .
- “bill byrne” belongs to a cluster that includes people-oriented websites (e.g., facebook.com and linkedin.com) and people names (Bill Byrne, Will Rusch, Mike Lebeau. Brian Strope and William Gibson).
- the “bill byrne” query belongs to only the people names cluster. However, a query may belong to many clusters. In such instances, for the sample queries obtained from the web toolbar data, the K most significant clusters (K is a number/integer) can be identified and weighted, with the sum of their weights adding to 1.0.
- the K most significant clusters can be determined by counting the number of sample queries (from the web toolbar log sample data) that fall into each cluster and then optimizing the weights of only the top K clusters Other techniques to determine the K most significant clusters can be used.
- the interpolated language model for the web form can be used to convert a speech input received for a field in the form into text.
- the converted text can be transmitted to an electronic device that initially received the speech input, or transmitted elsewhere, to be used as text input for the field in the web form.
- FIG. 7A shows a flowchart of an example process 700 of building an interpolated language model for a website (or a web form of a website).
- pairs of queries and results are collected, base language models are created, and interpolated language models are created.
- pairs containing web queries and result sites are extracted from web search logs.
- a web browser or web browser add on can report queries, query result URLs, or search results to a central repository.
- a web search server can create a log of search terms and website domain names that were returned in response to those search terms.
- a cluster bipartite graph also known as a bigraph, is formed by the pairs.
- a bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in the first set to one in the second set.
- the first set can contain nodes representing queries and the second set can contain nodes representing results.
- Clusters are identified in the bipartite graph, for example so that each cluster consists of queries and results that may by semantically or syntactically similar.
- step 706 language models are trained based on the queries in the clusters.
- sample utterances are recorded by a range of speakers and associated with the queries.
- the utterances for each query can be aggregated, such as by determining an average waveform and a deviation factor indicating how much deviation from the mean was found for most utterances.
- web form sample data is obtained from toolbar logs, the web form sample data relating to the particular web form (or website) for which the interpolated language model is being generated (e.g., the interpolated language model can be for the web form).
- a web browser toolbar can record and transmit the URLs of websites visited by the browser.
- the URLs can include input text (i.e., sample queries) that has been entered into the web form and submitted. This information can be used to associate a particular website domain, or web page with a particular topic or idea.
- the K most significant clusters for the input text i.e., the sample queries, obtained from the web form sample data are identified.
- a list of cluster names is collected and ranked in order of significance or similarity to the data collected in the step 708 .
- a predetermined number (K, in this case) of the most significant clusters are identified. For example, clusters are identified that include the sample queries.
- the number of sample queries that fall into each cluster can be counted and the weights assigned to each cluster optimized for only the top K clusters.
- an interpolated language model for the web form is built.
- a data structure is created that contains links to the K most significant language models. This data structure represents a combined language model that delegates speech recognition functionality to the referenced language models.
- each referenced language model can have a weight, such as a percentage, integer in a particular range, or probability, associated with the referenced language model in the interpolated language model. In some implementations, this weight can be determined by testing a known pairs of utterances and text. The pairs can be submitted to the referenced language models, which can return a confidence level representing the likelihood or accuracy of the language model to correctly identify the text in the utterance. The confidence levels, optionally normalized or otherwise converted, can be used as weighting values in the interpolated language model. Thus, reference language models likely to correctly identify text in a particular classification are most heavily weighted.
- step 704 can be used in the step 704 .
- input field flags and descriptions are obtained in the step 708 .
- step 702 and step 714 can be combined using a process that builds an interpolation model and interpolation weights in one step.
- FIG. 7B shows a flowchart of an example process 750 of building an interpolated language model.
- text input and associated metadata is collected, base language models are created, and interpolated language models are created using the base models and interpolation factors such as weightings to be provided to each of multiple base models.
- step 752 text input and input metadata pairs are extracted from input logs.
- an application can report to a central repository input entered into an input field and metadata for the input field.
- the text input can include voice input that is transcribed into a text format.
- application wide or operating system wide metadata schemes can define or describe the type of input field, such as an address field, a free form text field, a search field, or a social status field.
- a cluster bipartite graph also known as a bigraph, is formed by the pairs.
- a bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in the first set to one in the second set.
- the first set can contain nodes representing input metadata and the second set can contain nodes representing text input.
- Clusters are identified in the bipartite graph, for example so that each cluster consists of similar input metadata.
- step 756 language models are trained based on the text input in the clusters.
- sample utterances are recorded by a range of speakers and associated with the metadata.
- the utterances for each text input can be aggregated, such as by determining an average waveform and a deviation factor indicating how much deviation from the mean was found for most utterances.
- input metadata is categorized.
- the input metadata can be used to associate a particular input field or application with a particular topic or idea.
- Example topics or ideas include, but are not limited to, address fields, free form text fields, search field, social status fields, and numeric fields.
- step 760 the K most significant clusters for a category are identified.
- a list of cluster names is collected and ranked in order of significance or similarity to the data collected in the step 758 .
- a predetermined number (K, in this case) of the most significant clusters are then identified.
- an interpolated language model is built.
- a data structure is created that contains links to the K most significant language models. This data structure represents a combined language model that delegates speech recognition functionality to the referenced language models.
- K interpolation weights are optimized.
- Each referenced language model that is referenced in the data structure can have a weight, such as a percentage, integer in a particular range, or probability, associated with it. In some implementations, this weight can be determined by testing a known pair or pairs of utterances and text. The pairs can be submitted to the referenced language models, which can return a confidence level representing the likelihood or accuracy of the language model to correctly identify the text in the utterance. The confidence levels, optionally normalized or otherwise converted, can be used as weighting values in the interpolated language model. Thus, reference language models that are likely to identify text in a particular classification correctly are most heavily weighted.
- a data structure with weighted links to the K most significant language models can be selected from a collection of some or all possible data structures with weighted links to language models.
- FIG. 8 shows a flowchart of an example process 800 for recognizing text in an utterance.
- an utterance is received, the speech in the utterance is recognized, and text, or a list of text options, is returned.
- an utterance is received.
- a speech recognition server can receive translation requests from clients.
- the translation request can include an utterance (e.g. an audio file) and a context (e.g. text or other data describing how the utterance may be used or categorized).
- a relevant language model is determined. For example, an interpolated language model for web search, free form text input, or social status can be determined.
- language models including interpolated language models, can be indexed by keyword, web domain, application type, or other criteria Using metadata associated with the utterance, such as context or source information, a relevant language model can be determined.
- step 806 speech recognition is performed.
- the utterance can used by a speech recognition application using the language model.
- the speech recognition application can calculate one or more candidate text strings from the utterance.
- a confidence level can be associated with each text string.
- a K-best list of text strings representing the utterance is returned (where K is an integer)
- the text string with the highest confidence value is selected and returned.
- a particular number (K, in this case) of text strings with the highest confidence level are returned.
- step 808 all text strings with a confidence level above a particular threshold can be returned.
- an utterance can be preprocessed before step 806 to improve recognition.

- multiple semantic categories 1002 can be linked to a single interpolated language model 1004 .
- interpolated language models 1004 can be created on demand, such as when a semantic category 1002 is added to the data structure.
- the interpolated language models 1004 can persists after the removal of semantic categories (not shown). For example, previously removed semantic categories (not shown) may have prompted the creation of the interpolated language models 1004 a , 1004 b , and 1004 c .
- a new semantica category 1008 can be added to the data structure 1004 , and linked to any of the interpolated language models 1004 .
- every possible interpolated language model 1004 can be pre-created for use by a new semantic category 1008 . Some of these examples can be used in situations, such as when many new semantic categories 1008 are expected, when pre-processing time is available, and/or when few base language models 1006 are expected.
