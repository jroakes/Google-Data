Embodiment
The general introduction of third party's service
One embodiment of the present of invention relate to based on can expand to user security distribute and can select arbitrarily and third party's service of dynamic content.For example, an embodiment relates to four kinds of entities: (1) trusteeship service device system (for example, the customized homepage server of Google), its will be highly configurable, dynamic and safe the containing document portal page of the individualized webpage of Google (for example, such as) be distributed to affiliate or other groups of users; (2) affiliate, wherein each affiliate by select it wish any and dynamic content that its user sees in containing document and make its final user further customized content configuration is provided; (3) final user who is associated with the affiliate, it can select to comprise the further customization of additional any and dynamic content; And (4) content provider.These sides are with safety and extendible mode and trusteeship service device system interaction.Then, the final user is from extendible trusteeship service device system receiving vessel document, and this containing document has been configured according to multi-level configuration and has comprised the optional content of incorporating into secured fashion (comprising dynamically and static content).
The feature of service
Some features of this service and system comprise: third party's service, security, alternative, dynamic content, extensibility, multi-level configurability and the dynamic regulation of containing document arbitrarily.
Third party's service: because trusteeship service device system (for example, Google) act as with respect to following third party: the final user who (i) is just being distributed content (ii) stipulates the entity of the content that can use the final user, and (iii) content provider, so this service can be thought " third party's service ".The entity of specified content is groups of users typically, such as the affiliate.As an example, when using the term affiliate in this explanation, be to be understood that to be applicable to other groups of users too, and when using terms user group, be to be understood that also to be applicable to the affiliate.Company and client thereof are respectively affiliate's entity and final user's examples.University and student thereof also are affiliate's entity and final user's thereof examples.Therefore, company can experience for its user provides the homepage that is configured, and selection company wishes the content that its user sees on this homepage that is configured.This point is accomplished in the service of its trusteeship service device system by utilizing containing document.In other words, the affiliate can provide this service under the situation of the technology of the homepage that is configured that does not provide output to be provided by trusteeship service device system.As used in this explanation, term content supplier is meant the source of information.Content provider's example includes but not limited to following supplier: module, news are submitted the article, source of traffic information, Financial Information source and/or entertainment information source.
Security: containing document can be safe still can selecting arbitrarily and dynamic content (being that trusteeship service device system does not limit the initial selection of being undertaken by third party or user).For example, the affiliate can select by for trusteeship service device system being the module that unknown entity is created.The containing document of the module that comprises unknown entity can be presented by implement security feature to avoid and must must ratify it before each entity of selection by trusteeship service device system.Can be by dividing, encapsulate (for example by using IFRAME technology as described in detail further below) and/or importing filtration (for example, the blacklist of content, white list etc.) and implement security.In the present context, division relate to restriction by malice or vulnerable (for example, dangerous) the affiliate or the influence of the attack of final user's pair customised container document that is associated with affiliate or final user, and not from the identical login of the containing document that is used to visit customization or other division or the account that the identity system associated can be used.
Division is the key component of security, although because content is any optional and dynamic fact, do not jeopardize third-party security.If for example malice affiliate or because affiliate's susceptibility (XSS etc.) makes the authentication that has jeopardized the user then only jeopardizes user's individualized webpage.Even after successful attack, the assailant can not obtain search history or email message or other " division " of calling party.The security features of implementing makes affiliate and user thereof to dispose its experience when utilizing trusteeship service device system platform.
Alternative arbitrarily: the above-mentioned security features system that makes can allow any selection to content.Affiliate's entity and the user who is associated can select to make it can be used for the content of distributing to the user who is associated with affiliate's entity from any content provider (source, third party and/or the other guide source that for example, comprise trusteeship service device system).The affiliate can selectional restriction or is not limited the selection that can use its final user.System can avoid using content provider's tabulation of approval in advance in this way.As described below, content also can be various widely input types.
Dynamic content: selected content can be dynamic content, static content or its both.Content also can be a program.
Extensibility: but trusteeship service device system is from for example providing this service by the data of using with non-relational database server are cut apart the expansion platform that obtains.This scheme balance the scale and the convenience of data consistent.The non-relation data storage system of some type allows very extendible write operation.For example, with the stripes not match order provide affairs or locking support and storage time sequence data database do not think relational database be not unique but seasonal effect in time series because be used for the clauses and subclauses of relation (row 1 value, row 2 values ...).By using the non-relational database of this class, system can become and very can expand.Most of write operation to shared data is to start from one of the user very little group (one or several partner management person), and the read operation quilt widely (for example, each final user's requests for page may load the template that is used for the associated container document) start.Use traditional relational database also can realize extensibility, highly duplicate for extendible read operation, have hostdown and shift (master failover), make in this way and may increase expense to enable highly scalable, and increase the complicacy and the delay of system.
Yet aforesaid simple non-to concern that storage system makes the system be used to distribute configurable containing document and service to carry out on extensive good.This type systematic and service relate to centralized write with distributing read, high-throughput (extensibility and simplicity) and high availability (supporting fault to shift).Above-mentioned database structure make compare can be much lower such as other alternatives of the relational database that highly duplicates expense (on given scale, needing server still less) implement.
Multi-level configurability: can dispose the content of distributing by affiliate/groups of users, the final user that this configuration can stipulate to be associated with entity is in its constraint that can further be configured content down.
To dynamically providing of containing document: affiliate/groups of users can be selected the affiliate territory of unique index, and this affiliate territory can be stored in the dynamic table by trusteeship service device system.By storing the affiliate territory of this unique index, trusteeship service device system can dynamically provide the containing document that is associated with affiliate/groups of users with highly extendible mode.
Below go through one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.Although particular exemplary embodiment has been discussed, be to be understood that this only is used to the purpose of explaining.Those skilled in the relevant art will recognize can use other assemblies and configuration under the prerequisite that does not depart from spirit and scope of the invention.
The advantage of service
Some advantages that this service provides comprise: can use service and needn't distribute content and realize its brand scheme such as company, university, club, businessman, ISP's etc. entity (for example, affiliate or groups of users).It provides great dirigibility on the user that what content is distributed to entity is associated.This service also offers the user that it is associated with entity for entity provides a kind of mechanism with the unique content that provides.
And, use the entity of this service that the expense center is converted to the profit center.Such as frequent paying of the entity of company content is distributed to its client.Use above-mentioned service, company, derives a profit such as the content of serve ads by comprising the content that produces income, and this profit the people to serve ads on various payings basis pay.
And via intuition and wieldy interface, this service is wieldy, and by this interface, the human operator who relevant with affiliate's entity (for example representative) is configured content on physical layer or final user's layer.
The general introduction of system and operation thereof
Fig. 1 (a) has described the general introduction of the various entities that relate in this system and service.Can use with one or more content provider's 31 cooperations provides the trusteeship service device system 10 of service to implement this service and system via network 26 (for example the Internet) to affiliate system 40.This selection and configuration indication can be selected and configuration by using partner management person user 17 provide to trusteeship service device system 10 by affiliate system 40: the territory that is associated with the affiliate system, to one or more affiliate final users' method for authenticating and will be distributed to the content that is provided in one or more affiliate final users' 11 the containing document by trusteeship service device system 10.
Trusteeship service device system 10 can be with Distributor 13 running, delivery of services is given one or more affiliate system.The data-storage system 200 of storage container data, user data and affiliate's data can be provided.These data can be used for based on being come user's dispensing containers document by affiliate and the set configuration of each affiliate final user 11 (if providing) by server system 10 in trust.Usually in fact, partner management person user 17 has administration authority, and affiliate final user 11 does not have administration authority.Partner management person user 17 can for example control: the method for authenticating that is used for affiliate final user 11 is carried out authentication; And which content provider will be available to affiliate final user 11 selection; And further, the degree of configurability.
Fig. 1 (b) provides the figure that the action that may relate to is described in this service.In frame 102, affiliate or groups of users and trusteeship service device system opening relationships.The affiliate can be company, university, club or other tissue of wishing its user is provided customized experience.In frame 104, partner management person user can use all multiple mode dispensing containers documents described in detail below then, such as the Internet-portals page or customized homepage.Customization can comprise among its final user for example one affiliate's that will obey for chosen content and/or for the configuration personalized webpage constraint qualification.Notice that the affiliate can stipulate different constraints to different final users.System then can be so that the containing document that the is configured couple user who is associated with this affiliate can use.
In frame 106, the affiliate can discern the affiliate final user by some way to host computer system.The affiliate final user can comprise the subscriber of the student of employee, university or other school of company, club member, service etc.In frame 108, the containing document that the affiliate of acquiescence can be disposed is distributed to the affiliate final user.The containing document of affiliate's configuration of this acquiescence comprises first rank content and/or the configuration that is distributed to its user by partner selection.In frame 110, the configuration of the containing document that the final user can be provided for being configured.This containing document that is configured comprises the content choice and/or the configuration based on final user's expectation of additional level.
The concrete feature of implementing
Under the situation of having remembered whole general framework, in this system and service, can comprise multiple enforcement feature, comprise: multi-level configuration, content is freezed, incorporate polytype module into, many passages of the containing document that visit is configured, use preference and user ID to change content module and the content in module, incorporate search or other income generation module into, the internationalization of module, the data-driven containing document is implemented, use is based on the module of ordering, dispose the containing document of continuous modification acquiescence according to the affiliate, the live preview of customization and to the real-time update of the containing document that is configured that produces.Describe below every kind and implement feature, and do further specific explanations subsequently at the document.
Multi-level configuration control user experience: the affiliate can be provided with other configuration of level and/or preference, be included in the containing document of affiliate configuration of acquiescence and (for example will comprise what module, the affiliate wants weather module, traffic module, stock module and calculator modules), (provide postcode to any input value of module to weather and traffic, or provide stock tabulation to the stock module), color, skin type, module and a lot of other location shown in the page as described below, and if any, can freeze any module.If the affiliate makes any change to its configuration, then they can be applied to be used for all containing documents that are configured of all final users that this affiliate is associated automatically.The mode that the affiliate provides configuration/customized information is described in detail in detail below.Dispose under the situation of the containing document that is applied to the affiliate's configuration that is used for this final user in such final user's configuration and affiliate, the final user can stipulate the configuration/customization of second level then.
Content is freezed: a kind of particular type of affiliate's configuration can be that content is freezed.Service provides the affiliate to make to be used for making all or the technology that lost efficacy of the configurability of the content of a part only that is distributed to the final user.The content of selected inefficacy is frozen in essence, because this content can not be done further configuration by the affiliate final user.Note, content freeze can but the unnecessary dynamic content that freezes, for example, its can be still individualized webpage freeze implement in the part.(just, a part of freezing the page prevents the further configuration to this part, but allows this part to comprise dynamic content).For example, can thereby freeze individualized webpage otherwise be the row of configurable content.Yet when the affiliate was in the process of dispensing containers document, the content of this inefficacy may not be frozen for partner management person's user subject.Can implement this feature by CGI parameter and authentication techniques.For example, the page request that is used to specify the user and is partner management person user can provide authentication values by cookie, enable specific query argument, thereby trusteeship service device system provides the non-page that freezes, and the final user who is associated with this affiliate can receive and has the version that freezes content.
It is that non-superuser is checked the page as this keeper that this service also allows partner management person.As mentioned above, partner management person user can non-freeze to check in the context freeze content.Yet, if affiliate's preview page determines whether it has suitably been disposed, and the affiliate also can check the page in freezing context.Service uses authentication-tokens to enable the contextual behavior of correct dependence, and this authentication-tokens not only is used for authentication is carried out in the visit of the page, also authentication is carried out in the visit that is used to enable to rely on the query argument of contextual behavior.
Incorporate polytype module into: this system makes affiliate and final user can specify various widely modules to be used for merging, comprise: RSS module, far module, be used for the module based on API of customized homepage, such as Google Gadget API module etc.The ability that merges these modules has been described in appended patented claim in more detail.
Enter the multiple entry point of system: the final user can have relation with affiliate and trusteeship service device system.Therefore, trusteeship service device system can make the user can visit affiliate's containing document with the account that is provided by trusteeship service device system and/or by the authentication values that the account that the affiliate provided is associated by using.For example, if trusteeship service device system is Google, then the user can visit personalized major network specific to the affiliate by using Google login and password.And the user can visit personalized major network specific to the affiliate by using the login be associated with the affiliate and password.Also can use user ID to receive containing document specific to the affiliate.And during configuration affiliate containing document, partner management person user can select to be used for the final user is carried out the method for authenticating of authentication from the predetermined method for authenticating tabulation that system can adopt.For example, in one embodiment, if system allows three kinds of method for authenticating, then partner management person can only select a kind of in three kinds.Alternatively, partner management person can allow more than one method for authenticating.Then, system is based on carrying out authentication by administrator's method selected.For example, partner management person user can select to come all affiliate final users are carried out authentication via the account that trusteeship service device system is provided.Even this user also has the account with the affiliate, also can use this authentication.In another example, the partner management person user account that can select to provide via the affiliate comes all affiliate final users are carried out authentication.Can use this authentication that the account that is provided by trusteeship service device system is provided.Can select other authentication scheme, such as for example only based on the anonymous method for authenticating of cookie.
Controlled experience based on registration: can revise certain module based on the authentication of registration or other form.For example, help module can be incorporated into its affiliate as computing machine manufacturing person's affiliate customizes on the major network.Content in help module can change (for example, user's present customer support of whether having contracted, what level they require, and other is supported etc.) according to user's registration-level.
Commerce in the module: controlled experience can make that the affiliate can be with the monetization of affiliate's containing document.The affiliate can collect subscription fee to user capture certain module or the content in this module.For example, the affiliate can provide music module.Order to affiliate's music module can be so that the user can select to listen to some music selected works based on ordering.And in music module, the affiliate can provide different orders.For example, an order can allow the final user to listen to music, and another can allow the user to listen to and down-load music.
The search box module: one of module that the affiliate can select can be a search module, and it guides to the search page (for example, being linked to the existing AdSense that is used to search for) of the serve ads of trustship.Be associated display ads with search module, for the affiliate provides another kind of mode with the monetization of affiliate's containing document.In one example, the search box module can be the module of the containing document of request.
Optionally and automatically internationalize: containing document can be based on by configuration/customization that affiliate or its user provided containing document being internationalized.
The containing document of data-driven: the containing document that is used for the affiliate can be designed to produce common template (for example, using WiFi to detect position-based that affiliate's containing document is made amendment) with different content based on the data of the system of being input to.System also provides different localized affiliate's containing documents.
The modification of default container document: the default container document that system can provide the affiliate to dispose subsequently.Containing document server and/or trusteeship service device system cooperate with the interface that provides then, satisfy affiliate's selection of configuration with the content of guaranteeing to provide with secured fashion.
Global function preview: can check live version based on the containing document of the configuration information of input with the partner management person user of configuration interface interaction, and the content that the user sees is to comprise from the actual content of trusteeship service device system and the containing document of module (for example, being not only model).System can further allow editing from the module in the preview page.
Real-time update and live preview to containing document: use the central library system that makes of the incident that is associated with interested parties to upgrade live preview and real-time containing document based on the variation relevant with these.The storehouse can be followed the tracks of will be to the incident of which user interface or notifying changed its performance of module, and notifies them then immediately.As example, if partner management person user asks to change the background colour of affiliate's customised container document, in case then partner management person user has selected color card, background colour just changes (rather than requiring the user for example to represent " application ") automatically to be used for real, real-time preview.
In the context of system subsequently discussed below, method and example page, will understand in these features each in further detail.
Multi-level configurability and content are freezed
Implement the multi-level configurability that feature relates to the content of containing document for one that is used for this service and system.Next, describe the example container document with example system, this example system can be used to make affiliate and final user that configuration information can be provided.
An example of containing document is the personalized portals page that is associated with the user of affiliate or other groups of users.Can come a part of content on the pre-defined personalized portals page by affiliate/groups of users, and can dispose and customize a part of personalized portals page by the final user.
Containing document " comprises " one or more modules.Can come module or other content of pre-defined " comprising " any amount in containing document by the representative of groups of users.As used herein, term " containing document " or " container " should be interpreted as and comprise: the tool bar of the customized homepage of website, the portal page that is associated with groups of users, sidebar, one or more these generic modules of merging, the page of website trustship, the form (document (for example any document that can present HTML code or xml code) that for example, XML) presents module that can enough modules.And containing document can be to incorporate the website of another entity that offers the module of website from association system into.
As used herein, term " module " can be interpreted as and refer to present a part of software and/or the hardware that is used for the data used at containing document.For example, the module individual character can be turned to the preference of preference, environment or other input of user preference, container, comprise by the defined preference of groups of users.The module standard can be interpreted as the one group of instruction that comprises the data that are used to use predefined element to present to be used for containing document.
Should be appreciated that to have various forms of containing documents, but in Fig. 2, described a kind of this class declaration example.Fig. 2 has described to have and has used IFRAME and embedded HTML technology to be incorporated into the containers page 200 of a plurality of modules of containing document.These IFRAME can be so that trusteeship service device system can be to being encapsulated by the defined any chosen content of groups of users.In one example, also can in containing document, distribute module being with or without under the situation of encapsulated layer.Encapsulated layer can provide the function (for example, distributing module in the IFRAME in html document provides security to strengthen barrier) of usefulness in polytype system.Other application may be more prone to distribute module contents (for example, in order to improve performance or to be easy to layout or Content Management) under the situation that does not have this class encapsulated layer.
Fig. 2 has described a plurality of modules and the other guide in containing document 200, comprising: module 206, far module 207, far module 208 and far module 209 that top margin 201, sign 202, search box 203, groups of users content 204, " interpolation content " element 205, user select.The different-format that is used for various modules can exist according to the founder's of for example module regulation and/or by the representative of the groups of users definition to module.According to description, some modules can provide scroll bar, and other can not.Some modules other module relatively may have different sizes or shape.In addition, some modules can be edited the data of the each use that shows preference and/or be associated with module for the user offers an opportunity.(for example, referring to editor's module 206,208 and 209 of link is provided).For example, if module is relevant with the weather module, then can offers an opportunity and edit city or the postcode that in this module, it is shown weather the user.
Can create and/or pre-defined a part of content on containers page 200 by the representative of groups of users and/or groups of users.For example, top margin 201 can comprise the 201a that links that is associated with this groups of users.Sign 202 also can be the sign that is associated with this groups of users.(as described below) be created and/or define and be locked alternatively or be freezed to groups of users content 204 can by groups of users, makes the user of personalized containing document can not remove, edit or increase the groups of users content.
Top margin 201 can comprise HTML and/or xml code, for example to create title on containers page 200.Top margin 201 can comprise the 201a that links that can be associated with this groups of users.For example, under groups of users and situation that the computer hardware supplier is associated, link 201a (for example can be included in the specific service that provided by the computer hardware supplier, service and support) link, and to the link of the particular commodity that is provided by the computer hardware supplier (for example, desktop computer, notebook computer, peripheral hardware and/or printer).Under groups of users and situation that ISP (ISP) is associated, link 201a can be included in the link of the content driven page (for example, physical culture, finance, shopping etc.) that Email, ISP provide, customer service etc.
Search box 203 can comprise text area 203a and search button 203b, wherein the user can be input to text text area 203a, and (for example activate, click) search button 203b, the search engine that its startup may be associated with containers page 200 is input to text among the text area 203a with search.As described in more detail below, when returning Search Results, the search engine that is associated with containing document can be followed the tracks of the performed any continuation action of user.
Containers page 200 can comprise groups of users content 204.Groups of users content 204 can comprise groups of users module 204a-204c.Can create and/or define groups of users content and groups of users module 204a-204c by groups of users.Module 204a-204c can be the module related with the groups of users specific phase, and/or can select to be included in any other the incoherent module among the groups of users content 204.The representative that can give to be associated with groups of users is with management concession, to create and/or definition groups of users content 204.
One of function that this example container document 200 provides is that the user has an opportunity by selecting " interpolation content " element 205 to add content to containers page.Can define and/or limit the content (for example, classification) that can be used for adding to containers page 200 by groups of users.For example, the groups of users module of can limited subscriber adding the rival maybe may be thought any other module that groups of users is not expected.
For example, in case select " interpolation content " element, then system can be based on the defined classification of groups of users, offers final user's chance and comes the interactively indication will be included in add-on module among the containers page.The various forms of interfaces that receive this input can be provided.
Module 206 that the user selects and far module 207-209 can be the results who adds content.
Content is freezed:
The content that the user can be added is placed among the containers page 200 according to user's preference.Yet, can limit or prevent that the user from placing, moving or revising by defined some content of groups of users.In other words, some part of affiliate/groups of users definition containing document can be freezed the user.So containers page 200 can comprise the preference of setting up according to groups of users by the defined a part of containers page of groups of users as a result, and according to user's preference by the defined a part of containers page of user.For example, can freeze a row module or delegation's module, make the user can not eliminate, move, change or change its position and/or content.In addition, can be frozen in some white space on affiliate's containers page, module be added on this white space to prevent the user.
Mutual with the container server system
As mentioned above, trusteeship service device system 10 can be distributed to containing document affiliate's final user based on specific to affiliate's configuration with specific to final user's configuration.For reality produces the containing document with content, can use various platforms.
A kind of this class platform can be far module system and the personalized Google homepage system that is associated, the U.S. Patent application No.11/298 common co-pending that it was submitted on Dec 12nd, 2005,930, name is called in " Remote Module Incorporation Into A ContainerDocument " and is described in detail, and its content is attached to here as appendix A.(notice that under inconsistent situation between the disclosure and the appendix A, the disclosure has authority individually for each embodiment.Under the disclosure and the corresponding to situation of appendix A, but the scope difference, and then more the disclosure of wide region has authority individually for each embodiment.This application is described example trusteeship service device system 10 in detail.Fig. 1 (c) has been provided by the overall system view that provides with the 10 common a plurality of systems that move of trusteeship service device system.Details back in this document of taking from the exemplary host system of ' 930 applications provides.
Can utilize the advantage of service for the ease of the affiliate, affiliate/groups of users can so that one or more partner management person user can with the configuration server system interaction, this configuration server system is communicated by letter with trusteeship service device system 10 or its part.An example of this type systematic is shown in the element 40 among Fig. 1 (c).Configuration server system 40 can have: configuration server 41, mandate/authenticating unit 42 and data server 43.In addition, one or more groups of users Database Systems 44 can combine with the various unit of configuration server system 40 and move.Configuration server system 40 can be connected to trusteeship service device system 10 via network 26 (for example the Internet).In one example, configuration server 40 can be in trust.
About configuration server system 40, a part of containing document (a for example pack module) that can provide configuration server 41 to create and/or define containing document or will be associated with groups of users with the representative that allows groups of users, and make the affiliate final user can select/discern to be applied to the method for authenticating of containing document.Configuration server 41 can also communicate with trusteeship service device system 10, containing document is distributed to the user of groups of users.

The illustrative configuration server
Fig. 3 has described the exemplary embodiment of configuration server 300.Configuration server 300 can be that the user's who is used for groups of users the one or more containing documents and the instrument of the method for authenticating of setting up the user who is used for groups of users are created and/or defined in the representative that is used for groups of users.As described in Figure 3, configuration server 300 can comprise servlet layer 301, checking layer 302, action layer 303 and back end layers 304.
For example, servlet layer 301 can be cooperated mutually with the application of carrying out on the custom system of representative and be carried out three exemplary servlet.As will be understood, in such embodiments, servlet can comprise any program, such as web server, servlet engine, CGI scripting or non-remote configuration process based on web.For example, can carry out the authorized user that a servlet is distributed to user interface configuration server.For example, a servlet can accept parameterless HTTPGET request, and initial HTML interface and JavaScript client can be distributed to authorized user, such as the representative of groups of users.And a servlet can receive data (for example, can be used for the page listings of being upgraded by authorized user) from back end interface, and these data are presented to the user.
For example, can carry out the 2nd servlet to receive renewal to a containing document.Can receive and send input and output respectively with JavaScript object symbol (JSON) form by this servlet.Input parameter can be associated with " action ", and value can be the JSON expression of a collection of " action " object.This servlet can express JSON unserializing (for example, " action " object being converted to the JAVA file), and the parameter of unserializing is passed to other layer in configuration server.And, this servlet can be generally (it is grand etc. for example, JSON) to be converted to HTML, XML, the word of Microsoft from its user input format with configuration information.
Can carry out the 3rd servlet uploads with for example deal with data.The Data Receiving that includes but not limited to image can be " data of many parts/form ", and may need to extract with being different from the mode of extracting the GET/POST parameter.In case extract, the request that uploads data can be passed to other layer in the configuration server.
Above-mentioned servlet can be only represents just addressable to those of authorized groups of users.Use in order to receive web, the user can initially be distributed to request the one servlet, is authorized, is distributed by user interface by authentication/granted unit, and via user interface other request is distributed to other servlet indirectly subsequently.And in order to receive local independent utility, affiliate/groups of users can provide application or make it can supply user's download on disc.Then, the user can install and use and the operation application, via user interface other request is distributed to other servlet indirectly.
Checking layer 302 can be verified the data that received by servlet, and data are changed, for other layer use of configuration server.For example, servlet layer 301 can be accepted external request, and because these data are outside, so may need it is verified as safe.In addition, servlet layer 301 can receive parameter as character string.When parameter is received as character string, may need these Parameters Transformation are the parameter such as key entry.
Checking layer 302 can be accepted " action " object from servlet layer 301." action " object can provide " action " of request, and title-value mapping of carrying out the character string-character string of being somebody's turn to do " action " parameters needed.After providing " action ", checking layer 302 can need determine the parameter of what type to carry out this " action " from another layer of configuration server.Determine that based on this checking layer 302 can be verified the character string of input, and the character string of input is converted to the parameter of adequate types.
The type list of parameter can be shown " action parameter type ".Be shown " action parameter type " by type list, can replace the java class type of standard parameter.For example, URL(uniform resource locator) (URL) and HTML piece can be expressed as character string in Java.Different proof rules (for example can be applied to these different parameters, URL can improve form and only comprise significant character with the scheme of having discerned, and can scrub (scrub) HTML, make it can not comprise the JavaScript that can open security breaches).For different proof rules is applied to dissimilar parameters, checking layer 302 can move different " action parameter type " by different validators.
The tabulation that each " action " is mapped to " action parameter type " also can allow checking layer 302 to select automatically which validator each " action " is needed.Fig. 4 has described the exemplary embodiment of process flow diagram 400, is used for selecting automatically which validator can solve specific " action ".In frame 401, can determine " action " from " action " input.Among frame 402, can determine to carry out " action " parameters needed type.Can finish this by another layer among configuration server determines.
For carrying out " action " needed every kind of parameter type, in frame 403, can receive " action parameter type ".In frame 404, can be identified for the validator of " action parameter type ".In frame 405, can determine character string-value from the parameter of " action " input.In frame 406, character string-value can be by the validator transmission.In frame 407, for corresponding characters string-value, validator can be exported effective Java-types value.In frame 408, can preserve the Java-types value.
Can use one or more methods that are used to verify.For example, simple parameter (for example, Boolean expression) can use boolean's filtrator to resolve, and complex parameters (for example, object) can unserializing be the Java object.Checking layer 302 can send the parameter of checking to be used to move action layer 303.
" action " can be registered to " action manager ", make and to carry out " action ".In such embodiments,, can stipulate to indicate for example " action message " object of java class for " action " is registered to " action manager ", and the public method that comprises needed logic of execution " action " and parameter.When registration " action ", can carry out " action " parameters needed to " action manager " inquiry, and then action layer 303 can ask to carry out " action " and transmit these parameters.
As mentioned above, action layer 303 can with back end layers 304 interactions to carry out " action ".In such embodiments, when with back end layers 304 when mutual, action layer 303 can cushion the data that receive from back end layers 304.Similarly, the action layer can be stored a plurality of renewals for example before renewal is passed to back end layers 304.
Back end layers 304 can provide the interface with backend unit in system.Backend unit in system can store and provide data that are associated with groups of users and the visit that is used for the containing document of groups of users.These class data for example can comprise: the preference of groups of users (default preferences that for example, is used for containing document), with groups of users be mapped to the preference separately of groups of users data, login authentication and authorization data (comprising data), image about the authorised representative of groups of users, can define and/or content and/or any other data relevant, the representative of groups of users or the user of groups of users of personalized a part of page by groups of users with groups of users.
The illustrative process that is used for the dispensing containers document
Can come by the representative of groups of users containing document (for example, the portal page or the personalized portals page) is carried out initial configuration.And, can be that result or first group of group's ballot requires (for example, the group among group) with the containing document initial configuration.Also content initially can be defined as the result of collaborative filtering.As mentioned above, personalized containing document can comprise a part of content that can create and/or design and/or dispose for groups of users, and a part of content that can be disposed by the user of groups of users.The configuration that the user did that can come limited subscriber group by configuration that groups of users presented and/or design.
Fig. 5 has described explanation and has been used to design exemplary process diagram 500 with the illustrative methods of dispensing containers document.In frame 501, can set up relation with groups of users.For example, groups of users can with the main frame opening relationships of containing document.For with main frame opening relationships, groups of users can be discerned self and one or more representatives, can authorize described representative to come design of representative of consumer group and/or dispensing containers document.In one example, groups of users also can be established to the account of main frame.Account can be a Google AdSense account, or can be used for storing any other account about any data of groups of users.
Have under the situation of the account that is pre-existing in of main frame in groups of users, groups of users can be indicated this, and system can be associated groups of users with the account that is pre-existing in.When discerning groups of users, the identifier that is associated with groups of users can be stored among the Database Systems that are associated with configuration server.Also domain name can be included in the mapped file, for example, mapped file can be mapped to groups of users the data that are associated with the containing document that is used for groups of users.
In one example, can select domain name by groups of users.For example, groups of users for example can be selected the domain name of " start.usergroup.net ".Then, the domain name that this groups of users is selected for example can be mapped to clean path more, such as " partnerpage.host.com/usergroup.net ", and can by trusteeship service device system with this assumed name/another name information stores among the dynamic table in the affiliate territory of unique index.
In order to begin layoutprocedure, in frame 502, the representative of groups of users can be logined into configuration server system.For example, representative can comprise: the legal representative of groups of users, owner web of groups of users, by the procurator of the selected groups of users of groups of users or select any other people or the lineup of representative of consumer group for the dispensing containers document.Mandate/authenticating unit can receive the logging request that comprises the username and password that for example is associated with representative, whether definite representative is useful on the management concession of groups of users, and based on determining that representative has the management concession that is used for groups of users and ratifies visit to configuration server system.
In frame 503, configuration server system can be used web and be distributed to representative.Representative can move and input can be offered client device and/or the custom system that web uses (or independent utility), with dispensing containers document or personalized containing document.The servlet that is associated with configuration server can use web and be distributed to client device and/or custom system.Client device can receive the web application and the web of execution on client device uses.In application is under the situation of independent utility, can install and carry out this independent utility on client device.Web uses (or independent utility) and for example can comprise: be used to edit the editing machine of the top margin of containing document and/or other parts and be used to dispose and/or other instrument of design personalized containing document.Other instrument so for example can comprise: the action bar is used to receive pending action; Set of tags comprises layout tab, color label, color code editing machine and other modules; Create the available content label of client's module and/or definition module classification; The live preview plate; The module pick-up; Top margin and footer label; With URL editing machine label.
The action bar can comprise for example icon or button, when being activated, and execution that can trigger action.This class action can comprise: form, demonstration live preview, insertion object or module and any other similar action of preserving, delete, edit, open file, opening blank containing document, change containing document.Layout tab can comprise for example making the user can freeze some part of (or locking) containing document or allowing the user to control the selection of the predetermined layout of all the elements on the containing document.Fig. 6 has described the exemplary application interface 600 that comprises layout tab 601 according to exemplary embodiment.As shown in Figure 6, use 600 and also can comprise action bar 602 with " preserving now " button 602a and " preview " element 602b.As shown in Figure 6, use 600 and also can comprise the lock part that allows representative to select whether to freeze (or locking) a part of containing document.In order to select to freeze (or locking) option, representative can activate and freeze the radio button 604 that (or locking) content is associated.In order to allow the user to come complete customised container document, representative can select the radio button 605 that is associated with the release content.
In case received application, representative can be chosen in the frame 504 will dispose for which containing document.If groups of users had not before had the dispensing containers document, the representative containing document that can initialization will dispose then.If groups of users has been configured the example of one or more containing documents, then the interface that makes representative to select to be configured can be presented to representative from containing document.
In frame 506, can select layout.Representative can select whether to freeze alternatively (or locking) one or more row on containing document, or the permission user controls all the elements on the page.For example, Fig. 6 illustrates layout tab 601, is used to make representative can select to be used for the layout of containing document.
