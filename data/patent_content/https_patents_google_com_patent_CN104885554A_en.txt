Referring again to Fig. 1, the general communication pattern of network 100 according to an embodiment of the invention will be described now.Network entity and UE intercom with the physics DL channel through DL carrier wave mutually through the physics UL channel of UL carrier wave usually.In LTE embodiment, the modulation scheme for the communication between network entity and UE depends on and sends signal and different UL direction (propagating into network entity from UE) or DL direction (propagating into UE from network entity).The modulation scheme be used in DL direction is the multiple access version of the OFDM being called OFDM (OFDMA).In UL direction, usually use single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) or DFT-SOFDM.In LTE realizes, the bandwidth of UL or DL carrier wave depend on whether just use carrier aggregation and change (such as, without during CA up to 20MHz, or up to 100MHz when there is CA).In FDD operation, the frequency in the bandwidth of the frequency in the bandwidth of UL carrier wave and DL carrier wave is not overlapping.
With reference to figure 4A, will describe according to embodiments of the invention now, for carrying the LTE frame structure of data between the UE on UL carrier wave and DL carrier wave and network entity.In LTE FDD operates, up link and downlink radio frame are that 10 milliseconds (10ms) is long respectively, and are divided into 10 subframes, and each is the 1ms duration.Each subframe is all divided into two time slots of 0.5ms respectively.Each time slot comprises multiple OFDM symbol, and each OFDM symbol can have Cyclic Prefix (CP).The duration of CP is according to selected change of format, but in the example of Fig. 4 A, be about 4.7 microseconds, whole symbol is about 71 microseconds.In the context of T/F, subframe is divided into the unit of RB, as shown in Figure 4 B.When using normal CP, each RB 402 is 12 subcarrier × 7 symbols (1 time slot).Each RB (when using normal CP) and then is made up of 84 RE 404, and each RE 404 is 1 subcarrier × 1 symbol.But RB and RE can be other sizes in other embodiments.Thus, term RE and RB can comprise the time-frequency resources of any size.In LTE, RB or RB is to the typical flat being the Resourse Distribute of assigning for up link and downlink communication.
With reference to figure 5, now, will describe according to LTE embodiment of the present invention, be used for data being carried to from UE the UL subframe structure of network entity on UL carrier wave.The horizontal ruler of Fig. 6 represents frequency, and Vertical surveyors' staff represents the time.In LTE, UE physically data is sent to network entity by ink Shared Channel (PUSCH) usually, and usually physically control information is sent to network entity by Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH).The user data of such as video data (such as stream-type video) or voice data (such as audio call) is carried to network entity from UE by PUSCH usually.UE is communicating control information on PUSCH also, such as HARQ feedback, CSI report.In addition, UE also transmits dispatch request (SR) on PUCCH.UE can also transmit detection reference signal (SRS), and it is not a part for any particular channel.
In an embodiment of the present invention, for from network entity requests uplink resource, dispatch request is sent to network entity by UE.With reference to figure 6, if network entity permits this request, it is by being sent to UE to respond by scheduling authorization.Scheduling authorization is a part of down link control information (DCI).Network entity transmits DCI on downlink control channel (such as, physical downlink control channel (PDCCH)).Scheduling authorization provides UE to be used for transmitting the parameter of data on PUSCH for UE.These parameters comprise Data Modulation and encoding scheme, transmission block size, Resourse Distribute (Resource Block such as, in transmission bandwidth configuration and position), jump parameter, power control information and other control informations.
In an embodiment of the present invention, there is different PUCCH format, but usually the form that control information is carried to network entity from UE is had nothing to do with PUCCH.PUCCH resource block is usually located at the edge of UL carrier wave, and RB therebetween may be used for PUSCH assignment of resources.In each embodiment described herein, network implementation physical efficiency configuration PUCCH comes, in D2D communication, data to be carried to UE from UE.Part for the PUCCH of D2D will be called PUCCH-D2D.
On PUCCH, the control information transmitted by UE comprises HARQ feedback, SR and CSI report.UE sends HARQ feedback so that the data that receive from network entity of this UE of ACK or NACK.SR is made, for asking UL resource from network 100, to comprise from one or more network entity by UE.CSI report by UE make for report to network entity as the viewpoint from UE the information of relevant DL transmission channel seen.
It is one or more that each CSI report sent by UE can comprise in CQI, PMI, PTI and RI.UE uses CQI to represent if you are using, will cause having the highest MCS of the DL transmission of the BLER not exceeding 10%.UE uses PMI to represent which pre-encoder matrix should be used for DL transmission to network entity.RI by UE be used for UE advise should be preferably used for DL transmit transmission rank (transmission rank) (number of transport layer).PTI distinguishes slow fading environment and rapid fading environment.
According to embodiments of the invention, UE the RB configured for PUCCH-D2D on communicating control information.PUCCH-D2D RB need not be continuous.Each RB of one centering such as can be positioned at the opposite end of the frequency range of transmission bandwidth.
UE can with network service during transmit UL DM-RS and/or SRS.UL DM-RS is used for by network entity the coherent demodulation that channel estimating realizes PUSCH and/or PUCCH.SRS is used for channel status by network entity and estimates to come the relevant scheduling of support uplink channel and link adaptation.
With reference to figure 6, use description to now on DL carrier wave, data are carried to the T/F figure of the DL subframe of UE from one or more network entity.The horizontal ruler of Fig. 6 represents frequency, and Vertical surveyors' staff represents the time.Horizontal ruler is divided into multiple frequency chunks or OFDM subcarrier (" subcarrier ") that can be assigned with to transmit.The Vertical surveyors' staff of Fig. 6 is divided into multiple time block or OFDM symbol (" symbol ") that can be assigned with to transmit.Subframe is divided into time-frequency resources block (RB).To normal CP, each RB is 12 subcarrier × 7 symbols.Subframe is that 1ms grows and is divided into two time slots being respectively 0.5ms altogether.Conversely, each RB can be divided into multiple resource element (RE).Each RE is 1 subcarrier × 1 symbol.
DL subframe comprises several reference signal.Reference signal is sent to UE by network entity and performs various function to make UE.A kind of this reference signal is the channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS) being used for determining channel condition information (CSI) by UE.UE by CSI report to network entity.CSI-RS not necessarily transmits in all subframes.
Comprise the demodulated reference signal (DM-RS) with RE referring again to other reference signals in Fig. 6, UL subframe, be called as DM-RS RE.Usually, corresponding to the reference signal used code of antenna port 7 and 8 divide multiplexing (CDM) or other schemes multiplexing and be mapped to identical RE in time and frequency domain.Subframe can also comprise other reference signals in the controlled area and/or user data area being distributed in subframe, such as cell specific reference signal (CRS), location reference signals (PRS), master sync signal (PSS) and auxiliary synchronous signal (SSS).
CSI-RS configuration, through RRC signaling, is supplied to UE by network entity.CSI-RS configuration information is supplied to the physical layer (such as " higher level signaling ") in UE by the rrc layer in UE.
With reference to figure 7A, the structure of uplink carrier will be described now.UL carrier wave 700 has the channel width 732 of the frequency range striden across from the first edge, edge 716 to the second 720.Carrier wave 700 also has the frequency range of composition transmission bandwidth configuration 734.Transmission bandwidth is configured in the first edge 722 to start and terminates at the second edge 724.Between the first edge 716 of channel width and the first edge 722 of transmission bandwidth configuration, it is the first spectral emission district 708.Between the second edge 720 of channel width and the second edge 724 of transmission bandwidth configuration, it is the second spectral emission district 710.
Still with reference to figure 7A, channel width 732 is RF bandwidth of the single RF carrier wave of support with the transmission bandwidth configured in the up link or down link of community.Channel width is measured and the reference be typically used as transmitter and receiver RF demand with MHz usually.Transmission bandwidth configuration 734 is in given channel width, the maximum transmission bandwidth (such as, according to industry standard or government regulation) that up link or down link are permitted.In some cases (such as, when carrier wave is E-UTRA/LTE carrier wave), in units of Resource Block, measure transmission bandwidth configuration.
With reference to figure 7B, show polymerization carrier wave 750.Carrier wave 750 has aggregate channel bandwidth 780 and aggregation transfer band width configuration 782.Polymerization carrier wave 750 is made up of three component carriers 752,754 and 756.As shown in Figure 7 B, in carrier wave 750, present the identical element described in composition graphs 7A.Especially, the outer but RB 760 that is that define in spectral emission district in the channel width of each of three carrier waves of the transmission bandwidth of each configuration that there are three component carriers.
Still with reference to figure 7B, aggregate channel bandwidth 780 is RF bandwidth that UE could transmit and/or receive multiple continuous polymerization carrier wave.Aggregation transfer band width configuration 782 is maximum transmission bandwidths (such as according to industry standard or government regulation) that up link or down link are permitted in given aggregate channel bandwidth.In some cases (such as when carrier wave is E-UTRA/LTE carrier wave), in units of Resource Block, measure transmission bandwidth configuration.
Use HARQ
Now, with reference to Fig. 3 and 14, describe in an embodiment of the present invention, use the structure of the soft buffer of the form of soft buffer with UE.With reference to figure 3, transceiver 302 is through carrier wave (such as UL carrier wave, DL carrier wave or D2D carrier wave) Received signal strength.Transceiver 302 passes the signal along to processor 304, and in this example, this processor 304 is baseband processor.One or more in transceiver 302 and processor 304 comprise the Signal Processing Element 1400 shown in Figure 14.
Signal Processing Element 1400 can realize with hardware, software or both combinations.Signal Processing Element 1400 is organized into functional block.These blocks illustrate in fig. 14, and will describe their function now.By transceiver 302 (Fig. 3) Received signal strength, this this signal of transceiver 302 demodulation and generate and be used for the reception log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of given TB.HARQ composition element 1408 combines the LLR and the LLR stored for carrying out the defeated TB of comfortable forward pass that receive.To be decoded by processor 304 at block 1410 through the LLR of combination and another process (such as, being sent to more high-rise, for further process) can be passed to.If decode TB unsuccessfully, the LLR through combination so for that TB is stored in the subregion 314 of soft buffer 1412.
If at block 1410, decode TB, UE line link can transmit HARQ feedback thereon unsuccessfully.The LLR through combination for TB preserved by soft buffer 1412 until UE carries out another trial of decoding TB.
Transmit entity (not shown in Figure 14) receive represent UE unsuccessful receive the HARQ feedback of TB time, attempt retransmit this TB.The TB retransmitted by with front identical functional block, but when UE attempts decoding at block 1410 TB retransmitted, UE is used for the LLR of this TB from the retrieval of its memory 1414, and use HARQ composition element 1408 in the process being called " soft combination ", the LLR that combination receives and the storage LLR for this TB.The LLR combined is provided to decoder 1410, this decoder 1410 decode this TB and by success decode TB be supplied to more high-rise, for further process.
Soft buffer 1412 also can be called HARQ memory or harq buffer device.Owing to there is multiple HARQ procedure, make HARQ process index or HARQ mark (usually use the explicit segment signal in the DCI format be associated with TB to inform (such as down link), or determine (such as down link) through subframe numbering, system frame number etc. implicit expression) can be used for HARQ composition element 1418 and correctly perform combination operation.To ul transmissions, implicit expression HARQ procedure index makes the bits of coded for correctly determining ul transmissions by UE.
If UE configuration has the transmission mode of maximum every HARQ procedure TB (or every TTI TB), the soft buffer of UE can be divided into 8 subregions 1414, as shown in figure 14.If UE configuration has the transmission mode of maximum every HARQ procedure 2 TB (or every TTI two TB), the soft buffer that each of 8 subregions 1414 can be divided into the first subregion 1414A and the second subregion 1414B or UE further can be divided into 16 subregions.
In LTE embodiment of the present invention, determined the soft buffer configuration of UE at least partly by its classification.Reference table 1, such as, expects that the UE of classification-3 provides 1, the soft channel position of 237,248, and wherein, each soft channel position can store log-likelihood ratio (LLR).
For FDD, to given component carrier, UE has 8 HARQ procedure in DL.Based on transmission mode, UE can receive one or two transmission block (corresponding to HARQ procedure) in TTI.Thus, UE based on the maximum number of the total number of soft channels bits, HARQ procedure, transmission mode etc., can determine that each receives the memory space of transmission block.Similarly, NE1 can encode and only transmit and know those bits of coded that UE can process and/or store.
In some cases, if UE is to given transmission block, have not enough memory space, and decode and unsuccessfully occur, UE can select to store some LLR and abandon some other LLR.In other cases, if without storing available or thinking that unsuccessfully occur if decoded, UE can abandon all LLR corresponding to transmission block to transmission block without the need to storing.The situation that network entity transmission exceeds the quantity of the bits of coded of the memory capacity of UE often occurs.Typical example comprises: (1) when use carrier aggregation time (such as, UE supports two or more carrier wave, and each carrier wave 8 HARQ procedure), and (2) are when using tdd (such as, UE supports that every carrier wave is up to 15 HARQ procedure).For FDD, and for up link, to given component carrier, when UE is not configured in UL-MIMO transmission mode, UE has 8 HARQ procedure (when UE is configured in UL-MIMO transmission mode, having 16 HARQ procedure).For FDD, configure based on TDD UL/DL, determine the number of the HARQ procedure of up link.
Reference table 1, assuming that limited buffering rate coupling (LBRM), the soft buffer of the UE classification 3 that definition is used in LTE Rel-8/9 is measured.By LBRM, to the subset of large TB size, permission UE provides the soft buffer sizes of every TB being less than maximum required soft buffer size to realize female code check of 1/3.Such as, the standard compliant LTE classification 3UE operated with 2 space layer should support the maximum TB size of 75376.To this TB size, the total soft channels bits (that is, corresponding to these soft buffer sizes) of given 1237248, in every TTI two may each of TB, and UE only can provide the soft channels bits of 77328.This is actually that TB size, and effective female code check (ECR) or the most I of about 0.97 reach code check.Effective female code check can be defined as the number of number divided by the bits of coded that can store in soft buffer of information bit.
It should be noted that effective female code check can be different from the code check (such as, turbo code) adopted by FEC encoder, because define them from different viewpoints.Turbo code (FFC encoder) code check of 1/3 can be had, wherein, shorten this code or intercept some output verification positions (because soft buffer stores restriction), cause the effective female code check being greater than 1/3.Such as, if intercept the output verification position of 50%, so ECR is about 2/3, and turbo code check is 1/3.To the TB size being about less than 25456, ECR is identical with female code check of 1/3, means and does not need to adopt LBRM.
In LTE embodiment of the present invention, the number for the soft channels bits of the TB that encodes is defined as follows:
Wherein, N

limitbe equal 8 constant, K
cdepend on UE classification and about supporting the value (from 1,2 or 5) of UE performance of multiple space layer of the component carrier for transmitting transmission block.If UE signal informs Rel-10UE classification (in 6,7,8), also signal informs second classification (in 4,5) of the correspondence for back compatible (such as, allowing Rel-10 classification 6UE to operate in Rel-8/9 network).For the N of the TB that encodes
softvalue UE classification, the maximum number of plies etc. supported by the UE on certain components carrier wave of informing based on signal.In UE side, by above-mentioned identical formula, provide the number that UE is provided for storing the soft channels bits of TB on carrier wave, but by N

When transmission block is sent to network entity by UE on uplink, usually do not apply LBRM, because network entity has enough memory resources.Therefore, to ul transmissions, by the female code check of turbo code, provide the number of the bits of coded for transmission block, and LBRM is transparent.Rate-matched (that is, w/o LBRM) in this hint downlink side rate-matched process (passing through LBRM) upwards and uplink direction is not symmetrical.
D2D communicates
In an embodiment of the present invention, UE uses the resource of UL or DL carrier wave, adds D2D communication.UE also can use and can't help the resource that UE makes for other carrier waves communicated with network entity, adds D2D communication.
In an embodiment of the present invention, UE on the frame structure of time-frequency resources using UL carrier wave or DL carrier wave, can add mutual D2D communication.In certain embodiments, the structure of frame is based on tdd frame.D2D frame/subframe can be different from completely and is used for and the frame/subframe of network element communication by UE.
In various embodiments of the present invention, when UE adds D2D communication, such as D2D-SCH (D2D shared channel) or PUCCH-D2D, UE are with on the channel of the similar definition of PUSCH, mutually transmit data.PUCCH-D2D can regard another illustration of configured D2D shared channel as.
Can adjoin each other in subframe to the RB of the RB centering of D2D link allocation, or can separate in frequency.In some cases, when UE adds D2D communication, UE, in the separate physical channel (such as D2D-SCH) being D2D communication definitions specially, transmits data mutually.
Can adjoin each other in subframe to the RB of the RB centering that D2D-SCH assigns, or can separate in frequency.The RB to the RB centering that PUSCH assigns can be close to the RB of the RB centering that D2D-SCH assigns.To PUSCH assign RB and to D2D-SCH assign RB can share same UL carrier wave.The D2D link of carry user data and control information between UE can occur on the link of D2D-SCH or similar definition.Configuration for D2D link can be similar to PUSCH, PDSCH or PUCCH.Due to a UE forward another transmit, PDSCH can be suitable, with in conventional cellular communication, to UE transmit network class seemingly.
Use D2D is determined whether to communicate
According to embodiments of the invention, UE, based on decision process, enters D2D pattern.This decision process by one or more in UE and/or can be performed by network entity.When the ue is in an idle mode, wherein, except transmission or receiving position information, paging signal and urgency signal, UE does not communicate with network 100 usually, and UE or network implementation physical efficiency carry out this judgement.When UE is in connection mode, wherein, network 100 obtains the information about particular UE and keeps this information, and UE or network entity also can carry out this judgement.
As long as judge that beginnings intercoms mutually by UE in D2D pattern, any one or more of UE communicate from network entity requests license to start D2D, or network entity is not when receiving request, and to order in UE one or more enters D2D pattern.In an embodiment of the present invention, judged by core 106 at least partly.But will appreciate that, even if the resource participative decision making of core 106, the judgement (instruction such as, done like this) whether UE can enter D2D communication is delivered to UE by from network entity.
According to embodiments of the invention, based on various factors, comprise the intensity of a reference signal received from another UE in the UE degree of approach each other, UE, the intensity of signal that network entity receives from one or more UE, one or more user's input of detecting, carry out the judgement about whether UE should use D2D to communicate.
In one embodiment, the intensity of public safety network signal (such as, public safety UE reference signal) that UE or network entity detect based on UE and/or network entity carries out D2D judgement.As the result of detected intensity, can judge that UE will reduce their maximum transmission power, or will D2D be suppressed completely to communicate.Such as, if public safety network signal is weak, so UE or network entity can determine to suppress D2D communication.If public safety network signal is strong, so UE or network entity can determine to continue D2D communication.But, in case of emergency (such as, UE dialing 911), UE can be permitted in D2D pattern, transmit key message, such as its position.In this case, UE will use limited, allocated resource collection (subframe and/or Resource Block) to communicate.
In an embodiment of the present invention, network entity adds the ability of D2D communication based on each UE, and adds the ability of D2D and conventional cellular communication based on each UE simultaneously, determines whether that between UE, set up D2D connects.Before carrying out this judgement, network entity can connect with one or more in UE.In this case, D2D communication can occur in network entity and is used for being connected on the same carrier wave of UE.
With reference to figure 1, network entity and UE can ask from core 106 and reception information helps carry out D2D judgement.Network entity, by reporting from core request positional information (can keep record and/or the subscription information of the position of UE) or use from the GPS location of UE, determines the degree of approach between UE.Network entity, by obtaining the report of the intensity describing the reference signal transmitted by UE1 from UE2, is determined such as, the intensity of the signal that UE2 receives from UE1.UE can also use the DM-RS of another UE sent by network entity to configure, and determines its mutual degree of approach.DM-RS is used as reference signal, and it is made for determining the mutual degree of approach in conjunction with threshold value by UE.
In some cases, UE can in different districts, but enough near and have operation in the community of enough strong signal between them and transmit D2D.Such as, in FIG, UE2 with UE3 can use D2D to communicate, even if UE1 is in C1, and UE3 is in C2.In this case, the network entity of C1 needs to communicate with the network entity of C2 through backhaul network to coordinate the setting that this D2D communicates.
For the reference signal found
According to embodiments of the invention, the UE with D2D ability can transmit reference signal, and to allow other to support, the UE of D2D function finds them.For D2D finds object, there is the multi-signal perhaps that UE can regard reference signal as.In an embodiment of the present invention, UE, by transmitting zero energy PUSCH or PDSCH, implements D2D and finds reference signal, wherein, only embeds DM-RS and has non-power level.Or SRS, SR, HARQ feedback information are used as reference signal by UE.Or UE can transmit specially for D2D finds the beacon signal of definition.Specially for D2D finds that the beacon signal of definition can be mapped to UE and will be used for the same RE position be sent to by UL DM-RS or SRS in the T/F of network entity.
Reference signal can also comprise solid data.Such as, SR or HARQ feedback information can be used as reference signal by UE.SR and HARQ feedback have 1 bit field respectively, UE can use this field to represent the information about itself, such as its receiver type performance, power control information, mobility information are (such as, that equipment is fixed), or the relevant information of its preferred/required D2D operator scheme that will be used for communicating.
In one embodiment of the invention, network entity excessively provides existing channel to provide Resource Block, for being made by UE for transmitting reference signal.In this embodiment, UE on the edge that the transmission bandwidth of carrier wave configures or near Resource Block on transmit reference signal.Transmission bandwidth configuration packet has been configured for containing network entity the Resource Block that typical UE carrys out network service.During preset time, not must use all Resource Block in transmission bandwidth configuration.At Fig. 7 A and 7B, example is shown.
In another embodiment of the invention, network entity definition UE can transmit the other Resource Block of reference signal.Resource Block of these other definition in the channel width of carrier wave, but outside transmission bandwidth configuration.These Resource Block are in the frequency on the border close to spectrum emission mask (SEM).In some cases, the transmission in these frequencies has the energy lower than those frequencies in channel width.
There is UE can use reference signal to determine the many modes whether D2D communication is feasible.In one embodiment, UE uses slope (ramping) scheme, changes the power level of reference signal.Such as, reference signal is transmitted with reference to figure 8A, UE1.UE1 changes to be increased in continuously, the energy of reference signal in adjacent-symbol/subframe.UE2 receives reference signal, and the energy of each symbol of measuring reference signals or each subframe.Then, UE2 determines whether the energy detected in reference signal at least reaches predetermined level (such as, making a reservation for according to the communication standard used by UE1 and UE2).Then, UE2, based on detected reference signal energy, carries out the judgement of D2D feasibility.If the reference signal energy detected by UE2 does not reach predetermined level, so UE2 does not initiate D2D communication.If the energy level detected reaches threshold value, UE2 initiates D2D communication.Or what UE2 can receive by UE2 is the highlyest reported to network entity with reference to signal power level, and network entity determines whether D2D communication should occur, and one or two of ordering in UE adds D2D communication.
In another embodiment, reference signal can be transmitted with predetermined power level.The maximal power level that predetermined power level may allow lower than D2D.Predetermined power level can be power level that all UE in community are known and can determine based on the signal received from the network entity be associated with community.Such as, network entity broadcasts the reference signal power level allowed, and the D2D for all UE served in Na mono-community communicates.This allows network entity to control the scope of the D2D communication be attached between the UE of that Serving cell effectively.
In another embodiment, use specific RAT, the report relevant with another RAT can be measured with the UE in the Serving cell that network entity communicates or other information reportings to network entity, and network implementation physical efficiency uses this information to determine the degree of approach of UE.Such as, UE can by the service set identifier (SSID) of the WAP (wireless access point) of their " visible " or other medium access control ID (MAC ID) (such as, signal strength signal intensity or other measurement of correlations, such as RSRP or RSRQ or RSSI exceed threshold value) be reported to network entity, if and base station determines that (namely two UE can see same access point, two UE report identical SSID or MAC ID), so it can configure this equipment to connect their D2D reference signal.More generally, UE can by the small-cell identifier report of the small-cell of their " visible " to network entity, and if base station determine that two UE can see identical small-cell, so it can configure this equipment to connect their D2D reference signal.

With reference to figure 9, file is just sent to UE2 by supposition UE1, and to distributing to each subframe of UE1, UE1 three subframes are assigned with.In addition, will suppose that the data just transmitted are organized into data block, such as transmission block, grouping, burst of pulses (burst) etc.In subframe 900,910,920 and 930, UE1 is sent to UE2 by first piece 912.UE1 and UE2, during the specific sub-frame of time slot 940, switches transmitter and receiver role.(such as, data and/or control information, such as ACK) is transmitted to UE1 in subframe 950, UE2.Again, UE1 and UE2 switches role during specific sub-frame 960.During subframe 970,980 and 990, UE1 is sent to UE2 by second piece 914.
With reference to Figure 10, show another embodiment, in this embodiment, UE1 with UE2 communicates on time duplex time slot.At time slot 1000,1010,1020 and 1030, UE1, block 1012 is sent to UE2.At time slot 1040, there is specific sub-frame, be configured to the subframe 801 and 803 shown in Fig. 8 B.UE1 and UE2 switches transmitter and receiver role during the specific sub-frame of time slot 1040.Then, during time slot 1050,1060,1010,1080, UE1 is sent to UE2 by second piece 1014.Switch role at the time slot 1090, UE1 and UE2 that comprise specific sub-frame, UE2 becomes transmitter, and UE1 becomes receiver.
With reference to Figure 11, show another embodiment.In this embodiment, subframe is reserved to allow UE1 and UE2 from network entity NE1 Received signal strength (such as beep-page message).In the example shown, UE2 transmits in subframe 1110,1120; UE1 transmits in subframe 1140 (comprising a mark space in beginning), 1150,1160,1170 and 1180; And UE2 comprises transmission in the subframe 1190 of a mark space in beginning.In subframe 1100, UE1 and UE2 all intercepts signal from NE1.UE1 and UE2 can intercept NE1 during each subframe termly, such as after transition subframe.
The D2D communication that network is initiated
Referring again to Fig. 8 A, in an embodiment of the present invention, network entity is by being used for reasonable time-frequency resource allocation of intercoming mutually to UE, the information signal about distributed resource is informed UE by UE, and order UE uses the mutual direct communication of resource distributed, and initiation D2D communicates.One in UE or both may be in idle pulley when initiating D2D communication, but occupied, therefore, they are known to network entity.
The time-frequency resources distributing to UE can be the subset of UL resource, can be maybe the subset of DL resource.Such as, network entity can distribute one or more Resource Block of UL subframe or DL subframe.These Resource Block distributed can regularly occur, such as each frame, subframe or time slot.Use the RB that these distribute, UE1 and UE2 produces data flow, and it is such as structured as a series of time-multiplexed subframe or time slot, and wherein, each subframe or time slot use a RB in UL carrier wave or DL carrier wave.The RB of UL or the DL carrier wave that UE uses can on arbitrary subcarrier of UL or DL carrier wave.In certain embodiments, but, can obtain from UL carrier wave the RB used by UE.These RB can select from the PUCCH of UL carrier wave, and are positioned at the highest of UL carrier wave and low-limit frequency subcarrier thus.
Still with reference to figure 8A, the carrier wave being UE1 and UE2D2D Resources allocation from it is first carrier.The carrier wave that UE1 or UE2 is used for communicating with network entity is the second carrier wave.In addition, UE1 and UE2 can use the 3rd not overlapping with the first or second carrier wave carrier wave, communicates in D2D pattern.
With reference to Figure 12, now, how initiate by network 100 example that D2D communicates by describing.As pointed in the drawings, UL carrier wave is designated as first carrier, and DL carrier wave is designated as the second carrier wave.In step 1200, UE1 and NE1 sets up communication.This step (such as, through RACH) can be performed before remaining step very early.In step 1201, NE1, based on aforesaid one or more standard, determines whether the D2D communication needed or expect between UE1 and UE2.
If NE1 determines to need or expect D2D, so, in step 1202, its reference signal is connected in NE1 order.If UE2 is connected to NE1, so in step 1204, NE1 asks the information of the link-quality about the reference signal such as measured by UE2 from UE2.
If there is UE2 not to be connected to NE1, so NE1 can through back haul system and core 106, and request UE2 and NE1 connects.Core 106 can be passed through through another network element, such as NE2, and paging UE2 realizes.In response to this paging, then, UE2 initiates the connection with NE1.
In step 1206, UE2 determines link-quality and link-quality (such as RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI, CSI) is reported to NE1.In step 1208, NE1 determines whether to meet D2D standard, such as whether (a) UE1 and UE2 be all in mutual preset distance, whether the quality of b reference signal that () is received from UE1 by UE2 is higher than predeterminated level, and whether (c) allows UE1 and UE2 to affect public safety communication.
If the affirmative that NE1 makes about these factors judges, so in step 1210, this process continues, and in this step 1210, NE1 divides the resource being used in D2D (such as, distributing PUCCH resource block).If any one negative that NE1 makes about these factors judges, so NE1 does not initiate the D2D pattern for UE.
In step 1211A and 1211B, NE1, order is sent to UE1 and UE2.This order instruction UE uses D2D phase to intercom, and identifies the RB that they should use.Order can be sent to UE by NE1 on such as PDSCH or PDCCH/EPDCCH.In step 1212, the resource that UE can distribute via NE1, adds handshake procedure.In step 1214, UE intercoms mutually in D2D pattern.It should be noted that step 1210 and step 1211A (or 1211B) can perform as one step.Also note that in various embodiments, UE can communicate on UL carrier wave, DL carrier wave or the 3rd separate carrier.
The D2D communication that equipment is initiated
In the scheme that equipment is initiated, one or more in UE transfer a request to network.This request comprises the identity that the UE just asked wishes another UE communicated.If this request of network authorization, network is by distributing suitable resource and configuration UE uses those resources to respond.
Such as, assuming that the user of UE1 and UE2 understands mutually, (such as, they are mutually adjacent, use " looking for friend " to apply, such as Google Latitude
tMor near-field communication (NFC) finds mutually).The user of UE1 determines user file being flowed to UE2.If two UE are not all also on network, UE1 should ask UE2 to be connected to network or the public network of UE1.Then, UE1 and UE2 operates on identical frequency band/carrier wave, and as mentioned above, from the network allocation resource that they are just operating.
In an embodiment of the present invention, if UE is in idle pulley, so UE1 is by being connected to NE1 and showing that " D2D interest " enters connection mode to NE1.Information about UE2 can be supplied to NE1 by UE1.These information can comprise the IMEI of UE2, or the information of similar handle, such as UE2's
useridnetwork_name.d2detc..This information is delivered to core 106 (such as, accounting server) (Fig. 1) by network entity.Whether the data plan that the subscription information that one or more control element verification is used for two UE determines UE comprises D2D ability.Then, core provides to NE 1 and successfully or unsuccessfully indicates.
NE1 can obtain the renewal mobility measurements for each UE, and renewal mobility measurements is supplied to UE, allows NE1 control survey and mobility thus.
In the one of the D2D of equipment initiation realizes, UE1 (idle pulley) determines to use the frequency spectrum in special frequency band, performs and communicates with the D2D of UE2.Then, UE1 will be connected to the network entity operated in that frequency band and download the information that can be used for D2D communication from network 100, the maximum power that such as reference signal power, reference signal identification information, D2D communication allow and other power contorl parameters, and network 100 allows UE1 to be used for the subframe of D2D communication.Then, UE1 initiates D2D (such as, by starting to transmit reference signal).UE2 performs similar step and also initiates D2D.UE can after download D2D information, discharge its connection (namely getting back to idle pulley) with network, and continuation communicates in D2D pattern, even if they are in idle pulley relative to network 100.To this realization, network 100 can also show " term of validity " that be associated with the information transmitted about D2D.Or UE can suppose the predetermined term of validity, and if the duration of D2D session exceed this term of validity, UE may need to reconnect to network to verify D2D information whether still effectively or they whether must download new value.
UE may be postponed and be switched to another from NE1, until after completing the D2D session between UE.
According to embodiments of the invention, UE1 is after determining to use D2D, and in the up link RB set in the frequency band comprising uplink carrier, the autonomous D2D of initiation communicates.UE1 based on the signaling received from NE1, can determine that up link RB gathers.NE1 can suppress the conventional UE transmission (namely UE is to network entity transmission) of dispatching in those RB.If NE1 completes this operation, the UE in D2D pattern is by can be used for the maximum power communication of D2D communication.Such as when using UE in public safety situation, this is very useful.Such as, if public safety UE determines not at the area of coverage of the LTE network for communicating based on architecture, in potential predetermined uplink RB set, can independently get back to D2D pattern.
With reference to Figure 13, the example of the D2D the communication now equipment of description initiated.In step 1300, user and the user interface of UE1 show to add the user that D2D communicates alternately and expect.In step 1302, UE1, through first carrier or UL carrier wave, transmits to NE1 and is used for carrying out with UE2 the request that D2D communicates.In step 1304, NE1 determines whether UE2 connects.If do not connected, so NE1 asks core 106, makes UE2 be connected to NE1.If UE2 connects, or become in response to the request from NE1 and connect, so NE1 divides the resource (such as, from the RB of UL carrier wave or DL carrier wave) being used in and being communicated for D2D by UE.In step 1306A and 1306B, NE1 through the second carrier wave or DL carrier wave, will identify that the information of the resource of distributing is sent to UE.In step 1308, UE can use the resource of distributing, and uses D2D subframe structure, performs handshake procedure.In step 1310, UE uses D2D subframe to intercom mutually.
UE performance and performance segmentation
According to embodiments of the invention, each UE has one or more performance set, that is, performance configuration.Performance configuration can comprise following one or more:
(1) data rate (such as maximum data rate) of UE support;
(2) UE has how many transmitting and/or reception antenna;
(3) type (table 3 and 4 illustrates the example of transmission plan) of the transmission plan of UE support;
(4) the soft buffer configuration of UE;
(5) the MIMO performance (such as, the number of layers of the support of each frequency band, supports UL MIMO) of UE;
(6) the carrier aggregation performance of UE;
(7) battery life of UE;
(8) the maximum transmitted block bit rate number of each TTI supported by UE;
(9) handling property (such as, the processor number that UE has, the parallel procedure number that once can perform of UE.
In an embodiment of the present invention, each UE can divide its performance.Each divides performance set will be called performance segmentation configuration.
As mentioned, the performance that UE can be split is its soft buffer configuration.The soft buffer configuration of UE is following one or more: (1) UE will be used for receiving the maximum HARQ procedure number (required buffer partition number) of grouping; (2) UE will be used for the size of the soft buffer receiving grouping; And (3) UE will be used for the soft channels bits number receiving grouping.Thus, the first one or more set of these characteristics is by soft for formation first buffer configuration, and the second set is by soft for formation second buffer configuration.
Such as, a given UE and the 2nd UE, first buffer divides configuration can comprise following at least one: (1) the one UE will be used for from network entity receive maximum HARQ procedure number; (2) the one UE will be used for the size of the soft buffer received from network entity, and (3) the one UE will be used for the soft channels bits number received from network entity.
Second buffer divides configuration comprises following at least one: (1) the one UE will be used for the maximum HARQ procedure number received from the 2nd UE; (2) the one UE will be used for the size of the soft buffer received from the 2nd UE, and (3) the one UE will be used for the soft channels bits number received from the 2nd UE.
Now, split providing UE that its performance is divided into performance the example configured.If UE has two processors and two antennas, the first performance partition that these performances can be divided into formation processor and an antenna is put, and the second performance partition forming a processor and an antenna is put.
In an embodiment of the present invention, different performance segmentation is configured for and communicates with distinct device by UE.Such as, UE may use 1 processor, the first performance partition of 4 soft buffer partition is put, and in transmission mode 1, communicated with network entity.UE also may use 1 processor, the second performance partition of 2 soft buffer partition is put, and in D2D transmission mode, communicates with another UE in D2D pattern.This example also example UE changes its soft buffer configuration.First soft buffer configuration comprises 4 soft buffer partition, and the second soft buffer configuration comprises 2 soft buffer partition.
In certain embodiments, UE uses the first and second performance segmentation configurations simultaneously, and with two other equipment, such as another UE communicates with network entity.In other embodiments, UE puts from use performance partition and switches to another, depends on the equipment that UE is just communicating, and realizes in a time multiplexed manner.
Comprise by any one of the performance configuration of the UE of one or more performance configuration formed of above-mentioned performance, multiple performance segmentation configuration can be divided into.
With reference to figure 1, such as, UE1 can change its performance segmentation configuration (such as, reduce its data rate, change soft buffer partition number etc.), make its configuration compatible to allow UE1 and UE2 phase to intercom with the configuration of UE2, also support the communication between UE1 and network entity simultaneously.UE2 can also change its performance segmentation configuration, makes the configuration of the performance segmentation configuration of UE1 and UE2 compatible.
Such as, can transmit up to 100 megabits if UE1 is per second, and UE2 energy per second receives only 50 megabits, so UE1 can change its performance configuration, makes per second only transmission up to 50 megabits.
In table 1 (for down link) and table 2 (for up link), illustrate in an embodiment of the present invention, the example of Different L TE UE classification/performance that UE can have.

Signaling performance and classification
According to LTE embodiment, its version of UE informing network entity, classification and other performance.This allows network entity suitably to configure the communication with UE.UE can abandon, and (or ignorance) does not meet any receipt message/signal of its version/classification/performance.The UE of particular category provides characteristic/performance as shown in Tables 1 and 2 (down link and up link in).
During their D2D handshake procedure, UE can set up MS master-slave relation.The UE (such as UE supports larger data speed, longer battery life etc.) with optimum performance will be generally main.Such as, if two UE participating in D2D belong to a different category, the UE so with larger classification can be main equipment.Such as, if classification 3 and classification 7 equipment participate in D2D, so classification 7 can be main equipment.Appointment from the resource expected from UE, communicates for D2D by main UE.Can not provide the message of this resource to respond by representing from UE.If occurred, main UE may need to reduce the expection from UE.Such as, may need to use at least some of its soft buffer partition to communicate with network entity from UE.
Capability exchange example
With reference to Figure 15, now D2D will be described as communication objective, the example of UE how switching performance information.In this example, following supposition is carried out.UE1 uses the RB from UL carrier wave to use all structures as shown in Figure 8 B, on D2D carrier wave, subframe is sent to UE2.UE1 in this example is classification 4UE, and UE2 is classification 2UE.As shown in Tables 1 and 2, classification 4UE has the DL/UL speed of 150 150Mbps/50Mbps, and classification 2UE has the DL/UL speed of 50Mbps/25Mbps.Thus, UE1 to UE2 link has the maximum data rate of 50Mbps (UE2-rx), and UE2 to UE1 has the maximum data rate of 25Mbps (UE2-tx).This is asymmetric ignores the fact that two UE all have the ability of decoding 50Mbps.
Also hypothetical network entity has been granted UE1 and is authorized and add and communicate with the D2D of UE2, and UE1 knows UE2 (UE2 knows UE1 too).Be only example object and provide these supposition.
In step 1500, UE1 and NE1 sets up communication.In step 1501, NE1 distributes UE can be used for the RB that intercoms mutually in D2D pattern and/or subframe.These RB can be the RB of RB or the UL carrier wave of DL carrier wave.In step 1510, UE1 determines that UE gathers first of the RB distributed being used for intercoming mutually and/or subframe.In step 1520, UE1 receives the information (classification of such as UE2) of the performance about UE2 from NE1.Or, in step 1520', UE2, its performance information is sent to UE1 through D2D carrier wave.
Then, UE1 and UE2 in step 1530, can initiate mutual handshake procedure, and wherein, they set up MS master-slave relation, decides through consultation that UE1 is main.In step 1540, UE1 determines that UE enters the suitable configuration of communication, comprises UE and should be what resource of D2D allocation of communications (such as performance).These comprise the configuration of data rate, encoding scheme and harq buffer device.In this example, UE1 determines that three soft buffer partition 1416 (Figure 14) should be exclusively used in from UE1 reception transmission block by UE2.Then, remaining 5 soft buffer partition 1418 can such as be used for communicating with NE1 by UE2.In step 1550, the resource of expectation can be informed that UE2 or UE1 can be configured for the resource requirement of the UE2 of D2D communication by UE1.In step 1560, UE1 and UE2 is used in D2D carrier wave, the RB/ subframe of being distributed by NE1, and uses UE1 to determine the internal resource that should use, and communicates in D2D pattern.In step 1560, UE1 with UE2 adds D2D and communicates.
Illustrate the improvement version of the process of Figure 15 in figure 16.In the process of Figure 16, the user of UE1 initiates D2D communication in step 1600.In step 1602, illustrate three replacement schemes.The performance of UE2 can be informed UE1 by NE1, and UE1 can from the direct receptivity information of UE2, or UE1 and UE2 can interchangeability energy information.Remaining step and Figure 15 similar.
For according to embodiment, further example exchanges in the performance of D2D communication period and classification, to communicate and UE1 knows the version/performance/classification of UE2 assuming that UE1 with UE2 adds D2D.Then, UE1 will configure D2D link, make UE2 suitably encoded message to be sent to UE1 and to receive encoded transmission from UE1.If UE is different classes of, UE1 based on the classification of UE2, can select its soft buffer configuration.In D2D connects, other for higher-class UE can be configured to main.
In another embodiment of the invention, when UE adds D2D communication, its classification direct signal can be informed another UE by UE.In addition, network entity or main equipment can configure (a) the one in UE, for D2D receive soft buffer allocation and/or the 2nd UE in, the harq buffer device received for D2D distributes, b) from a UE to the maximum HARQ procedure number of the D2D of the 2nd UE transmission and/or the maximum HARQ procedure number for configuring from the 2nd UE to the D2D of UE transmission.In addition, network entity can configure the one or more of following restriction:
A) transmission mode restriction
B) modulation limitations (being limited to QPSK/16-QAM)
C) bandwidth restriction (such as, if UE1 and UE2 just operates on different B W, UE1 is common UE, and UE2 is the MTC device with less Rx BW).
Network entity can inform the default configuration communicated for D2D by signal.The signaling of default configuration can be cell-specific signaling or UE dedicated signaling, and the default configuration for direct communication can comprise: for directly transmit transmission mode, configure for transmission plan, the demodulation RS directly transmitted, for the component carrier etc. of direct communication.When realizing the direct communication with another UE, some or all of default configuration parameter can be overthrown/reconfigure to network entity.In some predetermined lasting times, this configuration to this session effectively or can be used for by UE and the direct communication of another UE.Receiving specific signaling from network entity, be converted to RRC idle pulley, in the predetermined lasting time to switch etc., configuration information can be reset to default configuration.
Control channel is crossed to be provided
With reference to figure 7A, will describe according to embodiments of the invention now, how RB distributes, the example used by reference signal.This example by concentrate on transmission bandwidth configuration the first edge 722 near those RB on.But identical RB allocative decision also can be applied to those RB near the second edge 724.
To this example, assuming that be not any RB that D2D is reserved, RB0 and RB1 normally will be distributed to UE by network entity, for transmitting on PUCCH.For ease of D2D communication, but network entity distributes RB1 and RB2 for PUCCH on the contrary, and is that D2D reference signaling reserves RB0.In D2D situation, the information of the signal configures of pertinent reference signal (such as through more high-level signaling, such as RRC signaling) is supplied to UE by network entity NE1.But the network entity of Resources allocation not necessarily must provide signal configuration information.Second network entity, such as NE2 can complete this operation.
In this example, the signal configures of reference signal is that RB1 and RB2 will be used for PUCCH, and RB0 will be made for transmitting reference signal by UE.This RB allocative decision allow UE unlike they originally have and use the D2D performance of PUCCH, but use RB1 and RB2, RB0 can also be used for reference signaling by the UE simultaneously with D2D function except use PUCCH.Meanwhile, in many cases, the through-put power being expected to be useful in D2D communication is little, and edge RB is used for D2D and contributes to reducing the interference outside channel width.
The signal configures of the reference signal about the 2nd UE is informed that a kind of method of a UE is by the information of distributing about revised PUCCH RB is sent to a UE by network implementation physical efficiency.This information can be the form of the nRB-CQI value revised.
In LTE embodiment, such as, nRB-CQI (or
) according in each time slot in subframe, can be used for transmitting by PUCCH format 2/2a/2b the Resource Block used, represent bandwidth.PUCCH format 2/2a/2b may be used for transmitting regular CSI report.LTE UE can use nRB-CQI value to determine and use PUCCH format 1/1a/1b to transmit the PUCCH resource of HARQ-ACK by being used for.More particularly, LTE UE, in the edge RB identified by nRB-CQI value, does not use PUCCH format 1/1a/1b to transmit HARQ-ACK.
For allowing the D2D communication on the edge RB of transmission bandwidth configuration, the signal configuration information sent by network entity can show other RB side-play amount (such as, D2D-RB-offset), use this side-play amount, the UE of energy D2D can determine the edge RB of D2D communication.Such as, if by transmission bandwidth configure RB be numbered RB0, RB1, RB2, RB3, RB4 ..., RB0 is closest to transmission bandwidth edge, and network implementation physical efficiency signal informs D2D-RB-offset value 2, and nRB-CQI value 5.Do not configure D2D communication UE (and can not D2D communication UE) in front 5 RB the edge configured from transmission bandwidth (i.e. RB0 to RB4) do not transmit HARQ-ACK.For the first two RB (i.e. RB0 with RB1) communicates for D2D by the UE of D2D communication configuration.Other RB (that is, RB2, RB3, RB4) can be used for PUCCH format 2/2a/2b by all UE to be transmitted.As found out from this example, cross and provide PUCCH resource value (namely, signal informs the greater value of n_RB_CQI than supporting needed for PUCCH format 2/2a/2b transmission) allow network 100 with to the mode that UE that D2D communicate can not be supported transparent, support that D2D communicates.These transparent operations can improve overall network efficiency, because support that the UE of D2D communication can with the UE shared-carrier not supporting D2D to communicate.
In another example, assuming that carrier wave 700 is just using the channel (such as channel 13) adjacent with public safety channel (such as channel 14), and network entity is not allowed to use RB0, RB1 and RB2.In these cases, network entity distributes RB4 and RB5, for being used for PUCCH by UE and distributing RB3, for D2D reference signaling.
In another embodiment of the invention, network entity defines one or more interior RB (RB 730 and 718) in the first spectral emission district 708 and the second spectral emission district 710.These districts will be not used in data or control signal usually, because the restriction of the power to the signal in those districts (such as being permitted to force by law or industry), for avoiding and adjacent-channel interference.But because find that the reference signal of object not necessarily must be equally strong with conventional control signals for D2D, therefore, those RB can be used for D2D reference signal by UE.Expect that the interference caused by D2D reference signal is quite little, as long as the through-put power of signal remains on enough low level.
In another embodiment of the invention, the technology described in composition graphs 7A can be applied to polymerization carrier wave 750 (Fig. 7 B).The edge RB 0 of three component carriers 752,754 and 756 of carrier wave 750 is for D2D reference signaling, and RB 1 and 2 is for PUCCH.As described in composition graphs 7A, by UE be used for D2D reference signaling spectrum transmissions screen in, one or more RB 760 can be defined.
In another embodiment, define specific PUCCH resource index to show on the contrary for D2D reference signaling channel reservation can be used for which part of normal (such as Rel-8LTE) control channel of given PUCCH.Notice that other normal control channel of being supported by given PUCCH can be HARQ-ACK channels, SRS channel, SR channel and comprise channel condition information channel and the channel quality feedback channel of order information and precoding feedback.The radio resource being used as a part for system information block to send controls (RRC) message, informs (broadcast) this index by higher level signaling-information.By the field in broadcast scheduling mandate, PUCCH resource index or which D2D reference signaling channel that UE performs D2D reference signaling can be determined.These broadcast scheduling mandates also can show in subframe which do not dispatch/unallocated Resource Block can be used for arbitrary access or D2D transfer of data.These broadcast scheduling mandates can also be called that (contentiongrant) is authorized in competition.Hash function based on user ID (such as such as IMSI, radio net terminal identifier) and/or subframe, time slot or radio frame index can also determine which D2D reference signaling channel is for transmitting given D2D reference signal.If be only used in the specific sub-frame of radio frame or time slot for the PUCCH resource of D2D reference signaling or in particular radio frames, so also signal informs subframe, the time slot about D2D reference signaling resource, and/or radio frame designator.Can use
value,
value or
identify PUCCH resource index.The combination of " dispatch request (SR) resource " value or SR resource value and above-mentioned one or more value can also be used, identify PUCCH resource index, allly to inform by network entity signal.Candidate radio resource collection for D2D reference signaling can be considered as the common source that one or more UE can transmit in resource simultaneously.
In certain embodiments, in the DL carrier wave in the downlink operation frequency band of Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) (FDD) mode operating frequency band, the configuration information of pertinent reference signal can be received from network entity by UE.In UL carrier wave in the up link working band of fdd mode working band, reference signal (from another UE) can be received by UE.Although receive reference signal in the UL carrier wave of fdd mode working band, can receive in independent carrier wave and transmit relevant other data (such as, for the application data of other UE of physical layer transmission format) with D2D.These independent carrier waves can in different operating frequency band.Or, in the UL carrier wave in the up link working band of fdd mode working band, other data can be received.In some cases, can in separate carrier, by UE transmission of reference signals.
After receiving reference signal from another UE (UE2), UE (UE1) by measuring reference signals with use the configuration information relevant with reference signal, determine the link-quality between UE1 and UE2.For determining link-quality, UE can measuring reference signals received power (RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) or received signal strength indicator symbol (RSSI) or channel condition information (CSI).Link-quality measured by UE can report to the network entity receiving reference signal configuration information from it.In some cases, UE can by measured Link Quality Reports to heterogeneous networks entity.Such as, UE can receive reference signal configuration information from the first transfer point, and after a while, gives another transfer point by (the D2D link between UE and UE2) Link Quality Reports.
Usually, Link Quality Reports occurs in different subframe to network entity by UE reception reference signal and UE.UE is received in the UL carrier wave of fdd mode working band to the situation of reference signal, only expect that UE receives reference signal in those subframes that transmit on identical UL carrier wave of not being scheduled.
The configuration information relevant with reference signal can comprise identify expect UE receive the subframe of reference signal information, identify expect UE receives the information of resource element in the subframe of reference signal, UE can receive the RB of reference signal RB index, UE can receive RB skew (such as, D2D-RB-offset) of the RB of reference signal, the information identifying reference signal sequence index or the reference signal cyclic shift of reference signal that is associated with reference signal.
In certain embodiments, UE can receive about the information for must transmit the maximum transmission power restriction that the carrier wave of reference signal and/or other D2D data communicates at UE.In some implementations, maximum transmission power restriction can be the maximum UE power output PCMAX configured of the carrier wave transmitting reference signal and/or D2D data for UE, c (wherein, c is carrier index).
