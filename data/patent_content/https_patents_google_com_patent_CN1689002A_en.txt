§1.
§1.1
Technical field
The present invention relates to advertisement.Specifically, the present invention relates to enlarge the chance of the target of the advertisement of determining them into advertiser.
§1.2
Background technology
The advertisement of the traditional media use such as TV, broadcasting, the papers and magazines is well known.Regrettably, even utilize demographic studies and suppose that about the rational fully of typical audience of various medium advertiser recognizes that also their most of advertising budget is waste just.In addition, it is also very difficult to discern and eliminate such waste.
Recently, become more and more popular by the stronger medium advertisement of interactivity.For example, along with the number rapid growth that uses the Internet, advertiser begins to recognize that the medium and the service that provide by the Internet are the modes of the effective advertisement of potentialization.
Advertiser has formulated a plurality of strategies, in the hope of improving the value of such advertisement to greatest extent.In a strategy, advertiser uses means commonly used to provide interactive media or service (abbreviate " website " in instructions as and be without loss of generality) as the channel that feeds through to a large amount of audients.By using this first method, advertiser can be on the homepage of the website of New York Times or USA Today website placing advertisement.In another kind of strategy, advertiser may attempt narrow audient colony is pointed in its advertisement, thereby improves the possibility that the audient makes active response.For example, a family promotes and advertisement may be placed in the eco-tour sub-directory of Yahoo website in the mechanism that Costa Rica rainforest is traveled.Advertiser determines such target directing with manual type usually.
No matter adopt any strategy, the form that---that is, comprises the rectangular box of graphic assembly---normally with " banner " based on the advertisement (also abbreviating " Web advertisement " as) of website is presented to their commercial audience.As a people in the commercial audience (abbreviate " viewer " or " user " in instructions as and be without loss of generality) when selecting the some advertisements in these banners by click, the hypertext link of embedding is usually with the website of viewer's advertiser.Wherein the viewer has selected this process of advertisement to abbreviate " click " (click-through) (" click " be used to contain Any user select) usually as.The ratio of the number of times of the number of times of clicking and the generation impression of advertisement (that is, advertisement be shown number of times) abbreviates " clicking rate " of advertisement usually as.When the user has realized relating to the transaction of the advertisement of supply in advance, just say " conversion " taken place.Be what constituted conversion may be according to different situations and different, and can determine in every way.For example, has such situation: when the user clicks an advertisement, be drawn towards the gray Web page, and bought commodity there, just leave this Web page then, thereby conversion has taken place.Perhaps, conversion can be defined as having shown advertisement to the user, and bought commodity on (for example, seven days) the inherent gray Web page of predetermined time.Many other definition what has constituted conversion about also are fine.The ratio of the number of times of conversion and the number of times of the generation impression of advertisement (that is, advertisement be shown number of times) abbreviates " conversion ratio " of advertisement usually as.If conversion is defined as and can taking place in the predetermined time after serving advertisements, then conversion ratio possible definition may only consider the past than the predetermined time supply also long advertisement.
Although based on the initial promise of the advertisement of website,, still there are a plurality of problems in existing method.Though a large amount of audients can be involved in advertiser,, they usually feel dissatisfied to their repayment of investment in advertising.Some advertiser attempts to be accustomed to improving the performance of advertisement by following the tracks of user's online, and still, this method can cause encroaching on the situation of privacy.
(abbreviating " website custody person " or " ad consumer " as also can run into and improve the difficult problem that advertising income can not influence simultaneously website user's impression again to greatest extent to present the trustship person of the website of advertisement equally, in the above.Some website custody person has selected advertising income is placed on user's the interests.Such website is " Overture.com ", this website custody a kind of so-called " search engine " service, this service response user inquiring returns the advertisement that is masquerading as " Search Results ".The Overture.com website allows advertiser to spend their advertisement of website (or targeted website) is placed on higher position in the tabulation of the Search Results of claiming.If implement such scheme: only clicked that advertiser just pays the bill (promptly under the situation of advertisement the user, each cost of clicking), then advertiser lacks the stimulation of the target of the advertisement of determining them effectively, because the not strong advertisement of target will can be not clicked, therefore, do not need payment yet.Therefore, the advertisement that each cost of clicking is high is showing near the top or at apical position, but not necessarily is converted into advertisement publishers' real revenue, because the viewer can not click them.In addition, the viewer with the advertisement meeting clicked tabulation by under the position, perhaps not in tabulation, therefore, the correlativity of advertisement is destroyed.
Search engine such as Google can make advertiser determine the target of their advertisement, infers that the inquiry relevant with advertisement presents advertisement with result of page searching so that respond.Though result of page searching provides huge advertisement with them to point to relatively to be easy to the audient's who accepts chance to advertiser,, result of page searching is the sub-fraction of the page view of WWW.
Some advertiser attempts with manual type the Web page-map to be arrived one or more classifications based on classification.The manual sort to the Web page like this has many shortcomings.At first, the manual sort is time-consuming, and cost is big, and easily causes inconsistent application owing to different classification persons' subjectivity.In addition, the quantity of the Web page is huge, and content change is so frequent, and therefore, it is unpractical carrying out the manual sort on a large scale.
So, it is useful allowing advertiser will have the advertisement of target to be placed on any page on the Web (or some other document of any medium type) and just not to be placed on the result of page searching.Such scheme should avoid the manual sort with and the intrinsic shortcoming that overcomes of usually being difficult to.

§ 4.2.1.1 obtains document in advance
The document information 530 of high-speed cache can comprise recently and/or the document information of document of request continually.
Bigger " aimless " document information 540 collection may use the search engine program 560 of creeping to make up, and can upgrade.In U.S. Patent No. 6,285, a kind of typical search engine program 560 of creeping has been described in 999, at this this application is quoted.Though the information of relevant bigger document sets can be used,, the information of relevant needed particular document may be unavailable.In the case, in the implementation of so-called unblock of the present invention (if do not obtain and storing at present document information in advance, the ad-request supply operation that content is relevant can not waited for the situation of obtaining document information), request to the advertisement of the document that do not have available document information may obtain so-called " reception (house) advertisement " (advertisement of Advertisement Server itself, the free advertisement that shows, or some can not produce the advertisement of income), perhaps obtain random advertisements or generally speaking performance advertisement preferably, if advertising income is based on user's operation (for example, click or change).(note that if random advertisements or generally speaking performance advertisement preferably supply in so aimless mode, then their performance statistical information (if any) should not be affected.Perhaps, desirablely be when the request that receives the advertisement of the document that do not have available usually document information, to make " best conjecture " to estimate document information.Such estimation can be used and carry out from the catalogue (classification) in the classification of identical, similar or higher (wideer) or lower (narrower) or the information of other documents by checking the position of document in bibliographic structure.Also can check the daily record of the search inquiry that has produced Search Results, be included in the flow of document, and distinguish from search inquiry and to relate to the alternative document of relevant document.All right, under these circumstances, get in touch with the website custody person of document, and information is provided.
" target is arranged " document information collection 550 that one or more mode acquiring and maintainings in can be in many ways are less.For example, can use document information retrieval (for example, creeping) the operation 580 content supplier websites of creeping specific of target, as affiliate website 588.May import some or all affiliate website by content supplier's input interface operation 585.Perhaps, or in addition, the content supplier such as Web publisher itself can directly provide document information (for example, the URL of the Web page or the new Web page that adds) 550 by content supplier's input interface operation 585.
Nobody serves syndicate's method can allow content supplier login such as the publisher, with by fast, convenient and process standard the advertisement that content is relevant is placed on their website.The concrete example that like this nobody serves syndicate's method can be supported one or more in following:
(i) publisher enters login page/new User Page.
(ii) the publisher clicks new user.
(iii) the publisher fills in its title, the check addressee that its is wished, the address that check sent that its is wished, website territory, associated person information, (SSN (social security number) or tax revenue ID number, have password of Email login or the like).Look-up table that can reference standard is checked this information, is real website with the website of guaranteeing to import.
(iv) then, the website that can ratify or refuse to import.
(v) Email can be sent to the publisher
If (vi) approval then can indicate the publisher to accept service agreement and click they are directed to the link of login page.
(vii) in case login, the publisher can download one section code of level (486 * 60) with unique identifier or vertical (660 * 120) advertisement.In one embodiment, provide unique code snippet for different Advertisement Servers.
(viii) then, the publisher can be placed on code in their Advertisement Server.
Other unmanned service functions can be supported:
(i) publisher can sign in to its account, how much has been earned to check it.Income that report can comprise date, page view, bring in or the like.
(ii) can allow the publisher to select to comprise that they wish to stop the URL of its advertisement.
(iii) regularly (for example, every month) may pay according to selecteed advertisement and/or conversion to the publisher pays the advertisement that shows on their website expense.
(iv) the publisher should have way to change their associated person information.
Should allow the relevant Advertisement Server keeper of content can:
(i) check where display ads of specific publisher.
(ii) generate every publisher/all publishers' of frame income statement any time.
(iii) the publisher is labeled as swindle.
(iv) mark is to whose payment.
Fig. 6 can be used for obtaining as the part of the relevant ad serving operation of content in the mode consistent with principle of the present invention the process flow diagram of the typical method 600 of document information.Accept document identifier (for example, URL).(square frame 610) judged whether that document relevance information can use then.(decisional block 620) if there is the document relevance can be with (being called as " hitting "), then the ad serving process continues to use document relevance information.On the other hand, if document relevance information is unavailable, judged whether that then document information can be with (for example, in high-speed cache 530, main knowledge base 540 and/or CRAS knowledge base 550).(square frame 630) is if then use document information to extract and/or generation document relevance information (square frame 640), the continuation of ad serving process.If not (below abbreviate " missing the target " as) can judge then whether content supplier (for example, affiliate) has the document that can be arrived by retrieval (for example, creeping) like a cork.Under the situation of website, if (a) content dynamically collects, (b) content (for example changes continually or refreshes continually (square frame 640), news or stock), and/or (c) website has many replacement schemes (for example, the person of searching), can think that then the website is difficult to creep.If content supplier is difficult to creep, and in their content, have the script or the link of normal embedding, then before square frame 640 continues, can use executable instruction (for example, Javascript) to obtain document information (square frame 645) in method 600.If content supplier is easier to creep, judge then whether the relevant Advertisement Server of content is configured to use the ad serving of obstruction or unblock.(decisional block 650) if type block, search file information (square frame 660) immediately then, method 600 continues at square frame 640.On the other hand, if type is unblock, then stores document identifier and (for example, URL) (for example, store in the daily record of unsatisfied request 570), for later retrieval.(square frame 670) can carry out alternative ad serving then.(square frame 675).Note that if document relevance information is unavailable, then as previously described, also can use " best-guess " method.
Now more please referring to Fig. 5, then, there is the document information of target (for example to retrieve, creep) daily record (and identifier such as URL of (affiliate) content supplier website that is provided by the external source such as (affiliate) content supplier website) of unsatisfied request 570 is provided in operation 580, and relevant document information retrieved in the CRAS knowledge base 550, in order to using in the future.Can also use the operation 580 of creeping of target to come the Web page of given website is creeped in advance, so that CRAS knowledge base 550 is carried out " preheating ".This will help to guarantee that the relevant advertisement of content is with available.
Fig. 7 can be used for carrying out in the mode consistent with principle of the present invention the process flow diagram of typical method 700 of the document information retrieval of target.Respond some trigger event 710, accept document identifier.(square frame 730) retrieves the document information of the document that is identified for each document identifier (circulation 730-750).(square frame 740).
Under the situation of the Web page that is identified by URL, the URL of such Web page can comprise the information that the different session on the same Web page is distinguished in different being used to of session of striding.Like this usually append to URL such as sessionid, shopperid or the like additional information.Yet when being stripped from this additional information, given URL will point to same Web content of pages.If session information not from the URL deletion, then uses the URL with session information may not can to find the document information of the storage related with the URL that does not have session information as key.That is, even Web content of pages (or some other document information) is available, then may be owing to the session information among the URL thinks unavailable.Can provide document identifier (URL) rewrite operation 595 so that such session information is peeled off from URL, and make their standards, so that the search key is provided, with the document information of storage in storage and search knowledge base 540,550 and the high-speed cache 530.
There is the document information search operaqtion 580 of target can creep that program 560 (this program of creeping can not be to creep so continually to Web) is cooperated with search engine and therewith use.For example, in one embodiment, may wish to allow the document information search operaqtion 580 of target be to handle the Web of a spot of Web page (for example,＜the 2.5M Web page/sky) program of creeping every day.In such embodiments, it 580 can mainly be used as to search engine the replenishing of program 560 of creeping, to satisfy the freshness standard and/or to reduce the time lag that starts affiliate's website.Should be as far as possible transmit ongoing working load as much as possible to the search engine program 560 of creeping.Under these circumstances, the URL that may should (i) will not store document information is written in the daily record, and the search engine program 560 of creeping is picked up document information, and replenishes its oneself knowledge base 540.As time goes on, main knowledge base 540 should have the document information of more needs.
§ 4.2.1.2 obtains in real time
The content that can not be creeped is usually arranged.Such as those Dynamic Web pages that use search engine to generate is exactly such example.Other examples comprise by the page of the page of filling the list generation, personalization, need page of login and password or the like.Can use real-time document information to extract operation 590 and extract such Web page, and the Web page that does not obtain in advance, but the content that (its context) needs.In one embodiment, document information (for example, content) uses the instruction of the embedding that comprises in the document (for example, Javascript) to extract.Specifically, the instruction of embedding (for example, Javascript) can send to some information in whole document information (for example, content) the relevant ad serving operation 410 of content to obtain one or more advertisements that target is arranged of dynamic document." being correlated with " document information that will extract from the Web page can comprise meta-tag, header, title or the like.Contents extraction is carried out with obtaining in real time.
In one embodiment of the invention, Javascript will use under agency's background.This Javascript extracts " being correlated with " document information such as meta-tag, header, title or the like thereon from its available any Web page.Target pages can comprise the instruction of following Javascript as embedding:
<iframe?id＝′google_ads_frame′src＝′about：blank′hight＝80...>
…
content?of?the?page
…
<script>
extract?important?key?words?like?title，meta?tags，headers?etc，till?we
have?reached?1?Kbyte?limit.
frames?[′google_ads_frame′].src＝http：//pagead.google.com/ads？url＝<
url>&contents＝word1+word2+....
</script>
The URL of iframe is provided with the indication browser is reloaded frame.Can provide this Javascript to content server, in all Web pages that are inserted into them.
Though the aforesaid embodiment of the operation of document information extraction in real time 590 is useful, it also has some shortcomings.At first, this Javascript is quite big, and each page ground is carried out can be slow.Secondly, As time goes on improve the variation (for example, extract what content and how to extract) of actual Javascript and must accept and implement, rather than by mistake revise it by content supplier for it.So, generally speaking, for such implementation, Javascript is big more, and its renewal is frequent more, just may use different incompatible versions more.
An alternative method to the Javascript that embeds provides static Javascript link.Specifically, the size of each Web page can be improved about 4KByte for avoiding embedding Javascript, the link that can use the static Javascript page replaces.Be the example of pointing to the link of the static javascript page below:
<script?src＝pagead.google.com/ads/scrape.js></script>
Because most of browsers will be to obtain actual Javascript occasionally with this Javascript link of high-speed cache.
Second alternative method avoided by using two stage models unconditionally to send the content of 1KByte to the relevant ad serving operation 410 of the content of all Web page views.In the phase one, the document information that the trial use has been stored (for example, in high-speed cache 530, main knowledge base 540 and/or CRAS knowledge base 550) supply one or more advertisements, and needn't be to the relevant ad serving operation 410 transmission contents of content.If document information not there, then in subordinate phase, provides Javascript to browser, this browser will send " being correlated with " content of the Web page, so that determine the target of advertisement.For example, target pages can comprise following content:
<iframe?id＝′google_ads_frame′
src＝http://pagead.google.com/ads？url＝document.location>
</iframe>
If document information or document relevance information (for example, content) are available, then this iframe can obtain the relevant advertisement of one or more contents.Otherwise iframe will obtain Javascript, and this Javascript will obtain document relevance information (for example, content).Because " identical come source policy " of Javascript, this scheme may bad making.Identically come source policy to mean, the frame in territory (for example, pagead.google.com) can not read other territories (for example, content aol.com).Therefore, the method in above-mentioned two stages of branch can be amended as follows:
<iframe?id＝′google_ads_frame′
src＝http://pagead.google.com/ads？url＝document.location>
</iframe>
…
Contents?of?the?page
…
<script
src＝http://pagead.google.com/ads？url＝document.location&js_reque
st＝true>?</script>
Here, iframe obtains one or more advertisements with trial the same as before.If do not have document information or document relevance information (for example, content) available, then can return " reception advertisement " or blank advertisement or say the advertisement of " advertisement trade and investment promotion ".Script in the footer of the Web page sends its oneself parallel request, and special boolean " js_request " sign is set to " true ".This request there are two possible responses.At first, when (perhaps at high-speed cache 530, in high-speed cache 530, main knowledge base 540 or CRAS knowledge base 550) in document information or document relevance information are arranged (for example, content) but the time spent, " null " response can take place, and under these circumstances, iframe may load one or more advertisements that target is arranged.Secondly, when (perhaps at high-speed cache 530, in high-speed cache 530, main knowledge base 540 or CRAS knowledge base 550) in do not have document information or document relevance information (for example, content) but " Javascript to read the contents " response can take place in the time spent.Under this second kind of situation, the script of extraction document information the same as before (for example, content) or document relevance information will be sent to browser, iframe URL is provided with content.Then, Iframe will obtain the advertisement of target.
This dual stage process efficient sometimes is lower, because when document information (content) in high-speed cache 530 (perhaps, in high-speed cache 530, in main knowledge base 540 or the CRAS knowledge base 550), or document relevance information is when unavailable, and whole Javascript is sent to browser.The third alternative method is to utilize the three stage Javascripts of static linkage corresponding to two stage Javascript.This three stage method fetches the high-speed cache that utilizes browser by return the chain that points to static Javascript to browser.Browser will only if necessary just load complete Javascript.
Three stage methods send two requests to the relevant ad serving operation 410 of content all the time.Because these requests walk abreast, therefore, they can not influence the final user and postpone.Yet this can cause the load of more rear end.Yet expense is relatively low because second Request Processing in three stage methods got up, and therefore, so more rear end load is an acceptable.
Fig. 8 can be used for carrying out in the mode consistent with principle of the present invention the process flow diagram of the typical method 800 of real-time document information retrieval.Two stages and three stage methods have been shown.Response receive (for example, whether available request Javascript) (square frame 810) judge document information (for example, in high-speed cache 530, perhaps high-speed cache 530, main knowledge base 540, or in the CRAS knowledge base 550) to executable program.(decisional block 820) is if document information is available, then leave method 800 (node 860) before, the executable program (for example, Kong script) of sky is turned back to the content of having asked executable program present application program (for example, browser) (square frame 850).On the other hand, if document information is unavailable, then leaving method 800 (node 860) before, (for example present application program to the content of having asked executable program, browser) returns and (for example be used to read document information, Javascript) executable program (two stage models) or return points to the link (three stage models) (square frame 830) of the executable program be used to read document information, and document identifier is set to point to suitable document information (for example, advertisement iframe URL being resetted to comprise content of pages) (square frame 840).
The 4th kind of alternative method is to avoid sending all the time the quadravalence phase method of two requests by implementing following skill.The Iframe part is the same as before.Javascript in the footer will attempt to read the content of this iframe, whether show correct advertisement to understand fully it.If do not have the document information of document or document relevance information (for example, content) available in high-speed cache 530, then Iframe will be redirected to about:blank and (the blank advertisement of this page or leaf supply, say the advertisement of " advertisement trade and investment promotion ".) in the case, Javascipt can read the content of this iframe, because it is not in different territories.The existence of security exception means that iframe has good advertisement.Otherwise Javascript will obtain document information or document relevance information (for example, content) and obtain one or more advertisements that target is arranged.Yet it is a bit complicated that this quadravalence phase method implements, and need some other function (be redirected, load) of browser.
Be 4KB if suppose (i) Javascipt size, the size that (ii) has any URL of content is 1KB, (iii) the browser cache hit rate is 90%, (iv) the document information hit rate of high-speed cache is 95%, and (v) the document information hit rate of browser cache hit rate and high-speed cache is independently, and three stage techniques provide the favourable combination of delay and bandwidth performance.
Yet,, may need special consideration to obtain the actual quantity of the Web page view of seeing if follow the tracks of advertistics information.Specifically, if in high-speed cache 530 (perhaps), do not have document information or document relevance information (for example, content) available, then send two ad-request in high-speed cache 530, main knowledge base 540 or CRAS knowledge base 550.Therefore, may too high estimation page view, this can damage many important statistical informations, as per thousand incomes (RPM) that produce impression, or the like.Though can not show the advertisement (or showing static) among the iframe when not having document information or document relevance information (for example, content), for the page that does not have Javascript in footer, this will damage statistical information.Some content supplier will be not can not allow such footer Javascript relating on the page of privacy.A kind of mode that solves this difficult problem is added supplemental flag with being in the URL of iframe, do not have the page of footer Javascript with difference.
Though implementation as described above has been used Javascript,, the present invention is not limited only to Javascript, and can use some other scripts or executable program.In addition, in another alternative method, (for example, browser/OS) interpolation can send the toolbar/client of document information (for example, Web content of pages) to Advertisement Server can to present application program to user's content.In another alternative method, can use http agency to come to smell spy mailing on all document information of user (for example, content).Then, this agency can send this document information to Advertisement Server.
General document finger URL of § 4.2.1.2.1
Under the situation of the Web page, for determine the target of advertisement based on the content of the Web page, be the document information (for example, content) that obtains the Web page, need wherein the URL of the Web page that will display ads.Fig. 9 A has shown the Web page 900 with one or more advertisement positions.The Web page 900 comprises content 910, and has URL
MP915.The Web page 900 can also comprise one or more iframe 920a, 920b, and each iframe comprises its oneself URL 925a, 925b.If script (or point to script pointer) will be provided,, obtain the document information (for example, content) of the Web page 900 to allow the relevant Advertisement Server of content, because the URL of the main page such as script as described above
MP915 may be different from one or more iframe 920a, those URL 925a of 920b, and therefore 925b, can produce potential problem.Specifically, shown in Fig. 9 C, some affiliate of content supplier can be directly with the main page 900 of script (or point to script pointer) 930 ' be placed on " on; and shown in Fig. 9 B; other content supplier can be encapsulated in script (or point to script pointer) 930a or 930b in iframe 920a or the 920b, and have from URLMP 915 ' father Web page 900 ' different URL
IF1925a ' or URL
IF2925b '.If script 930 ' be arranged in the main Web page shown in Fig. 9 C, then uses a Javascript attribute " document.location " to discern the main Web page 900 " position (URL
MP) 915 ".On the other hand, if script 930a or 930b are arranged in iframe 920a or 920b, shown in Fig. 9 B, then use the 2nd Javascript attribute " document.referrer " to discern the main Web page 900 " position (URL
MP) 915 ', rather than return the URL of iframe
IF1925a ' or URL
IF2925b '.Also can use such as " window.document.location " or the like mutation.Under any circumstance, obtain suitable document information (for example, content 910) in order to make script, it needs suitable URLmp, therefore must know any method-document.location or the document.referrer that will use in two kinds of methods.Though can provide different Javascript for the different affiliates of content supplier so that use in both cases, do to make situation become complicated like this, and the dependence affiliate be that correct page is used correct script.
Figure 10 determines to use two kinds of root documents to determine the process flow diagram of the typical method 1000 of any method in the method in the mode consistent with principle of the present invention.The method 1000 has been utilized iframe safe mode and Javascript abnormality processing.Trial compares the location advertising (" document.location ") and the main page (" window.top.location ").(square frame 1010) then uses " document.location " method to determine the root document if they are identical.(square frame 1020 and 1030) if they are inequality, then or relatively failure (if the main page and iframe are arranged in same territory), or generate the breach of security unusual (iframe can not check the value of itself outside).Do not match or unusual situation under, " document.referrer " method of use is discerned root document (the main page) position.The mode that (square frame 1020 and 1040) this use has the abnormality processing of iframe safe mode provides definite main page URL
MPPowerful and novel mode.
In one embodiment, use Javascript " onerror " abnormality processing.Another kind of alternative method will be to use " try/catch " abnormality processing.
§ 4.2.1.3 obtains the alternative method of document information
Described the fetch-on-miss scheme at § 4.2.1.1 above multiple alternative method has been arranged.Such replacement scheme can realize by make up following implementation option with diverse ways:
1. when obtain document information
A) before request, obtain (obtaining in advance)
B) fetch-on-miss (block as required and obtain) during asking
C) fetch-on-miss (unblock is obtained as required) after request
2. to obtain any document information
A) only obtain the Web page itself
B) obtain the Web page and follow its link.
3. how to obtain
A) use the independent program of creeping
B) fetcher is embedded in the relevant advertising objective system of content.
Implementation as described above is used the independent program of creeping (recall Fig. 5 580), and before request, obtain the Web page with and link (obtaining in advance).If it is unavailable to handle the needed document information of request, then (for example, by advertisement not being provided or " reception advertisement " being provided) obtains the Web page after request has been satisfied.(recall the square frame 670 and 675 of Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.Yet), can other mutation.
After obtaining document information, can be further processed it.
§ 4.2.2 determines the correlation information of advertisement and/or content
Please later referring to Fig. 4, recall, the ad serving operation 410 that content is relevant can comprise that correlation information extracts and/or generating run 412.The Jeffrey A.Dean that proposes on September 24th, 2002, Georges R.Harik and Paul Bucheit are the U.S. Provisional Patent Application sequence number No.60/413 of " METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR SERVINGRELEVANT ADVERTISEMENTS " as inventor's title, 536, and the Jeffrey A.Dean that proposes on Dec 6th, 2002, Georges R.Harik and Paul Bucheit are the U.S. Patent Application Serial Number No.10/314 of " METHODSAND APPARATUS FOR SERVING RELEVANTADVERTISEMENTS " as inventor's title, have described the variety of way of extracting and generate correlation information in 427.This two applications have been quoted at this.These applications are referred to as " related advertising server application ").Correlation information can be regarded as the theme under advertisement or the document or troop.The title that on October 3rd, 2002 proposed is the U.S. Provisional Application sequence number No.60/416 of " Methodsand Apparatus for Probabilistic Hierarchical Inferential Learner ", and 144 (quoting at this) have been described the typical way according to one or more notions of the operable definite information of principle of the present invention or theme (being called " philosophy is trooped ").
In an exemplary embodiments of the present invention, use off line (perhaps every night) dump of complete advertising database to generate index, this index is mapped to one group of match advertisements group with theme (for example, philosophy troop identifier).This can use one or multinomial finishing in following: the one group of supply constraint (target criteria) in (i) the advertisement group, the literal of the advertisement in the (ii) advertisement group, content on the (iii) gray website or the like.
§ 4.2.3 is related with relevant advertisements with content
Recall from Fig. 4, the ad serving operation 410 that content is relevant can comprise compare operation 414 of advertisement document correlation information and advertisement document operation associated 416.Can use various similarity technology,, determine the similarity between advertisement and the document as the described technology in the related advertising server application.Such similarity technology can be used correlation information extraction and/or that generate.Then, can be based on the similarity judged result, advertisement and document associations that one or more contents are relevant.For example, if the similarity of certain advertisement surpasses certain absolute and/or relative threshold, then can be with this advertisement and document associations.
In an exemplary embodiments of the present invention, by with document identifier (for example, URL) be mapped to one or more advertisements, can document is related with one or more advertisements.For example, can handle document information, with the generation correlation information, as troop (for example, philosophy is trooped), theme or the like.Then, can use coupling to troop as to the query and search speech in the big OR inquiry of an index, this index is mapped to one group of match advertisements group with theme (for example, philosophy troop identifier), as the index of determining by the mode described in § 4.2.2.Then, can use first cut set of the result of this inquiry as the candidate target standard.Then, (for example candidate's advertisement group can be sent to once more correlation information extraction and/or generating run, the philosophy server), to determine actual information retrieval (IR) mark of each advertisement group, summarize the matching degree that standard information adds copy itself and document relevance information.When help determining best score advertisement group, can consider performance parameter estimation or known (for example, clicking rate, conversion ratio or the like) of advertisement group.
In case selected one group of optimal advertising group, then can use standard list from the optimal advertising group, to select final one or more set of advertisements.If K the single advertisement group of coupling in M the standard that sends, then the Advertisement Server that content is relevant can use this list request that advertisement is beamed back.If so, then advertisement is offered the requestor.
Can be (for example with performance information, the selection in each URL or each territory or the history of conversion) feed back to system, tend to obtain trooping or the Web page of performance preferably so that can determine advertisement (for example, belonging to the advertisement of particular cluster or theme) for particular type.This can be used to the advertisement that content is correlated with is resequenced, so that use certain function of content-correlativity and performance to determine the advertisement of supply.Can use many performance optimization methods.For example, can high-speed cache mapping from URL to relevant advertisement group collection, to avoid recomputating for the page of frequently checking.
§ 4.2.4 is with relevant advertisements and related document combination
Can shift to an earlier date or in real time that content is relevant as required advertisement and related document combination.Such combination can be by the relevant Advertisement Server of (a) content, (b) content supplier, or (c) final user's content presents application program (for example, browser).
§ 4.2.5 uses the typical Advertisement Server of principle of the present invention
If the present invention will use, then can provide following many assemblies in Advertisement Server.
§ 4.2.5.1 account and record keeping
In one embodiment of the invention, specify a different billing identification symbol can for each affiliate of syndicate (for example, content supplier).Ad system can be followed the tracks of generation impression and performance information (for example, selecting conversion or the like) in each client ground, particularly under many affiliates' of syndicate situation.
§ 4.2.5.2 report advertiser
In one embodiment of the invention, can be presented at summary on which website or the Web page for advertiser provides which advertisement that comprises its advertisement.
§ 4.2.5.3 strides a plurality of websites serving advertisements
In one embodiment of the invention, advertiser may where their advertisement be shown-on the Web page, on the result of page searching that search engine generates or the like-not control.In an improved embodiment of the present invention, advertiser can control the advertisement of how to supply them.Such control can by allow advertiser's decision to participate in, decision be withdrawed from, bid rigging or budget control or the like realize.For example, can make scale-of-two decision participation/decision by advertiser and withdraw from selection, or withdraw from selection according to gray inertia deduction decision participation/decision.Perhaps, can for advertiser be provided as they be ready payment " click on the page that target is arranged of content-based correlativity " (this may be based on the advertisement of content relevance, or mate they the notion of target criteria but advertisement on the searched page of the actual key that do not match) each advertisement group go out second price (and may also have more price).In this replacement scheme, advertiser can be by being 0 to withdraw from fully for result's (for example, click, conversion or the like) quotation.
The filtration of § 4.2.5.4 advertisement
In one embodiment of the invention, it may be right controlling or filter the presenting of advertisement that shows with some document.For example, certain control of advertisement that provide to the affiliate of advertisement syndicate the document with them is shown (for example, they the website or the Web page on or show with their website or the Web page).A kind of plain mode that such control is provided is to allow the affiliate of syndicate to use advertiser (for example, rival, notorious company or the like) URL blacklist, should not allow the term of advertisement (for example, inappropriate product, service or term).Specifically, can allow advertiser will " negate key word " related with advertisement or advertising campaign, wherein, ability display ads under search engine inquiry does not match the situation of negative key word only.For example, the percussion instrument shop can be selected but can select to use negative key word " ear " with key word " drum " advertisement, the inquiry such as " eardrum " so that they do not match.The method is quite required great effort, and makes mistakes easily.In one embodiment of the invention, allow content publisher or advertiser to specify negative preference in many ways.
