Put 106 user wish from cloud printer print data when, it may be desired to the user makes server 110 know the user first
Which just operated on cloud printer (for example, printer 102).For example, this information can be included in step 306a so that
Server 110 knows which printer (for example, printer 102) can access the data of user.In this way, when printer 102 is in step
When sending the request to print data in rapid 318a, if printer 102 matches printer used in user, then server
110 can authorize access.Therefore, even if produced print data positional information is destroyed, the print data of user can still keep pacifying
Entirely.
In step 320, server 110 retrieves print data using print data positional information from cloud.In step 322a
And in 322b, print data is transmitted into printer 102 by server 110 via network connection.Before so doing, server
110 can be by the printing data format for printer 102.Then it can terminate and (not show) and be established in step 316a and 316b
Network connection.Then printing receives print data to printer 102 in step 324.
Fig. 4 is the block diagram for implementing the system of cloud print service.In the example in figure 4, cloud printing server 402 can be right
Should be in Fig. 1 server 110, device 426 may correspond to electronic installation 106, and cloud perceives printer 438 and old-fashioned printer 456
Printer 102 is may correspond to, and network 424 may correspond to network 108.
In this regard, device 426, which is illustrated as user, can wish from the upper any calculating of the fact that its execution print job
The example of device.On knee or desktop PC, net book, flat board so can be included by non-limiting examples, device 426
Computer, smart phone, camera can store or access any device that user can it is expected the data of printing.
Cloud print service 404 can perform on the cloud printing server 402 for providing print capacity via network 424.It is as follows
Text describes in detail, cloud print service 404 can therefore provide the user with independently of platform and unload user need to configure, update or
Person otherwise maintains or the unified printing experience of the burden of monitor printer operation.It is described in detail below and/or will be bright
The various other features and advantage of cloud print service 404.
In the example in figure 4, operating system 428 is illustrated as performing application program 430.Again, by explanation and in fact
Example includes these elements, and these elements can include in fact any operating system or in fact any application program can be thereon
Other platforms of operation.Operating system 428 can include the operating system based on browser.
Therefore, application program 430, which can include, any on the fact that run on any underlying Operating System or platform to answer
Use program.The example of such application program can not be referred to be well-known and too many with any details, but generally comprise text
Shelves processing application program, email application, picture editting are presented software, web browser or provide the user with user
The upper any application program of the fact that render of the data of printing can be wished.
Application program 430 may correspond on device 426 local application performed.Or application program 430 can table
It is shown as the weblication that application program 436 performs on remote application server 434.That is, application program 436 can
Comprising accessed by user via network 424 and (such as) use device 426 run browser exist as application program 430
Any function of application locally experienced., it is known that such weblication allows all of apps server 434
Person undertakes the responsibility for being installed at apps server 434, configuring, performing and maintain application program 436 so that device 426
User can be answered in the case of many or any associated costs and responsibility in without associated cost and responsibility
With the benefit of program 436.For perform this weblication technology and correlation technique to be well known in the art and
Therefore will not describe in further detail herein, operation that only can be to the system 400 for understanding Fig. 4 is helpful or necessary
Except situation.
Network 424 can represent (for example) internet or other public or private wide area networks.In other examples, network
424 can represent company or other Intranets and/or small-scale part or personal network, any one usable standard therein
Network technology is implemented.
In addition, in Fig. 4, illustrate the cloud perception for being configured to communicate with cloud print service 404 via network 424 and beat
Print machine 438.As described above, cloud computing allow remotely provided via network (such as internet) computing resource (such as using
Program and file storage).For example, computing resource can be provided by web browser.Many web browsers can be by itself
Can be that the application program of application programming interface (" API ") operate to run on the remote server more complicated and apply journey
Sequence.In cloud computing example, web browser and the application program run on the remote server, which are interfaced with and controlled, described applies journey
Sequence.By browser, user can create, edit, preserve and delete the file on remote server via remote application.Cause
This, can be observed, and apps server 434 and associated application 436 can also represent the example of cloud computing.
In the background that cloud perceives printer 438, cloud print service 404 enable application program 430 not requiring or
Need directly to perceive printer 438 to cloud in the case of the participation of (for example, independently of) operating system 428 and print.In other words,
Application program 430 can (such as) do not need operating system 428 in local drive in the case of it is straight with cloud print service 404
Letter is connected to print to perceive printer 438 to cloud whereby.Therefore, on the fact that can be configured to be communicated with cloud print service 438
Any application program 430 can utilize cloud to perceive printer 438, and following article describes in detail.
For example, cloud print service 404 can be configured perceives printer with registered user and/or device 426 and cloud
438.In particular instances, described device can be smart phone, and application program 430 can be used to buy tickets (for example, film in user
Ticket or plane ticket).So, although device 426 and/or operating system 428 may not have resource or otherwise through matching somebody with somebody
Put to support the machine in a conventional sense to print (for example, may not currently perform times associated with cloud perception printer 438
The print driver of which kind of class), but the ticket bought directly can be perceived printer 438 to cloud and printed by user.In this way, may be used
User to application program 430 provides the Printing Qptions not provided in routinely printing example and technology currently and associated energy
Power.It is described herein or will become apparent from many other such examples.
Cloud perceives printer 438 can not support that the old-fashioned printer 456 that is communicated with cloud print service 404 is opposite with the machine.
Therefore, to illustrate the extra or alternate example of the embodiment of Fig. 4 system 400, isolated system 460 is illustrated, list
Only device 460 may be modified to assign the advantages of cloud print service 404 to old-fashioned printer 456 (as described below).It is similar
Ground, router 452 can be additionally or alternatively modified to enable old-fashioned printer 456 to participate in by cloud print service whereby
The cloud printing example that 404 operation is defined, following article describe in detail.
Briefly, system 400 gives any application program (example on the fact that run on any device in network 424
Such as, application program 430,436 and device 426) provide communicated with cloud print service 404 with whereby to also with cloud print service 404
Communicate the ability that any printer of (direct or indirect) prints.Therefore, user can benefit from increased Printing Qptions and ability,
And experience the overall reduction of the cost associated with so doing and effort.Meanwhile printer manufacturer can be experienced and provided the user with
(updated) driver and user experience the needs reduced or eliminated of other prerequisites of the benefit of its product completely.Citing
For, this can produce the cost of higher customer satisfaction and production and the reduction for safeguarding printer.
In more detail, cloud print service 404 is included and can be configured to register the registration manager 406 of printer and user.
So, as demonstrated, Plotter Manager 408 can be configured to receive cloud and perceive printer 438 and/or old-fashioned printer 456
Registration, comprising therefore by identification information be stored in through register printer data storage area 412 in.Similarly, user management
Device 410 can be configured to register the user that may currently or be potentially desirable for cloud print service 404 and perform print job, and
Identification information for such user is stored in the data storage area 414 through registered user.
User be present and/or many that printer can be registered by it by from registration manager 406 to cloud print service 404
Exemplary situation and technology.For example, in general, the user of device 426 can be used browser and be taken to access to print with cloud
The associated website of business 404, and username/password combination can be inputted to establish the user account on print service.
In other examples, such user may have the use on independent and possible related service or ISP
Family account.For example, various online services (for example, other computing resources based on cloud) can provide such as Email, number
According to features such as storage and document process, and in such situation, user may have the secured user's account for combining its foundation
Family.In such situation, cloud print service 404 is available or the such existing user account of access (such as) to avoid creating new use
Family account needs and promotes access of the existing user to other services by cloud print service.
Therefore, it may be appreciated that, although User Manager 410 and being illustrated as through registered user data storage area 414 in cloud
In print service 404, but related functionality can also occur and be present in outside cloud print service and by the situation of its access.Citing comes
Say, apps server 434 can provide email application as application program 436, and the user of device 426 can be to
This email application (service) is registered.In this case, apps server 434 can have the account for safeguarding user
Responsibility, once and cloud print service 404 only can be interfaced with apps server 434 and user signs in application program
Access to user is just provided in 436.
Technology for registered user, the security safeguarded user account and safeguard user account is many institutes in technique
It is known, and be not necessarily to describe in detail herein, only can to understand system 400 or related system operation necessity or
Except helpful situation.
Meanwhile as mentioned above, Plotter Manager 408 is responsible for registration cloud and perceives printer 438, old-fashioned printer
456 and/or it can interface with and may be current or potentially any be beaten by what the user of cloud print service accessed with cloud print service 404
Print machine 102.
Application manager 416 can be configured with that can it is expected any application for being printed in system 400
Program (including (for example) application program 430 and application program 436) communicates.So that it takes up a position, for example, application manager 416
It can implement to make it possible to carry out this various application programming interface (API) to communicate with external application.
But in general, application manager 416 can include from (such as) application program 430 receives and print request and connects
The function of receiving actual print job.Reception print data to be printed can be included by receiving print job, and is characterized and it is expected
How print print data preference and other side print characteristic (for example, colored with black and white, paper size, orientation, copy
Number or any other related or wanted print characteristic).Application manager 416 can also be carried out and application program 430
Other communications, such as, there is provided printer or the state of print job.
The first function according to print request in terms of exemplary, is received can include to the user of application program 430 (directly or
Print dialog is provided indirectly) or user can be by available/associated other user interfaces through registering printer of its selection.
Or specifying for printer can occur via NFC.In this regard, device 426, cloud perception printer 438 and device 460 can divide
Bao Han not NFC interface 426,446 and 470.Each of NFC interface 426,446 and 470 may correspond to Fig. 2 NFC interface
208, and available for the NFC participated in other devices with NFC abilities.
For example, NFC interface 432 and 446, which can be presented, establishes NFC connections for perceiving printer in device 426 and cloud
The mode of data transmission is carried out between 438.In addition, the user of application program 430 can ask print job and by associated printing
Data are saved in cloud.When print job is saved in into cloud, print data can be stored in the storage in cloud by cloud print service 404
In position, the print data positional information of designated storage location is produced, and provide print data positional information to device 406.
As described above, print data positional information may correspond to URL or any other form of the position for identifying print data.
When user gets out printout, he/her can by lap device 426 and printer (for example, cloud perceive printer 438 or
It is device 460 for old-fashioned printer 456) NFC connections are established, specify the printer to be used to print out whereby.Once build
Print data positional information can be sent to printer by vertical NFC connections, device 426.Print data position can be used in printer again
Put information request and receive print data from cloud print service 404.Printer can then since cloud receive data and print.
By passing on print data between device 426 and cloud perceive printer 438 via NFC interface 432 and 446 respectively
Positional information, user may be abandoned and select printer from available list of Printers or avoid showing list of Printers completely.In addition,
Carrying out specific printer using NFC can allow to arrange multiple print jobs on cloud.In particular, user can be by multiple print jobs
Be sent to cloud, and can when he/her gets out all printouts lap device 426 and printer.
Application manager 416 can independently of particular printer form (for example, relative to the institute in system 400
Have available or general associated printer form) communicated with application program 430 (or other application program).In this way, mitigate
Application program 430 with when formulating and/or sending print job to the needs of destination printer know it is associated negative
Some or all of burdens in load.
For example, application program 430 can formulate both print data and print characteristic in the same manner, regardless of whether
Specify to print job (such as) cloud perceives printer 438 or old-fashioned printer 456.In fact, the even if use of application program 430
Print job can be still forwarded to cloud by family currently without associated with his or her user account any through registration printer
Print service 404 for storage, and later to finally to cloud print service 404 register no matter the account of which printer and user
Family prints.As described above, can also be by establishing NFC connections between device 426 and printer by print job to described
Printer prints.
Therefore, application program 430 can include to the API that communicate with the application manager 416 or use API or
Person is associated with the API, wherein such API can be light-duty, consistent, customizable and be easy in various application programs or work as
Middle implementation.In addition, such API can be needed for user using cloud print service 404 seldom (if mistake) from using journey
Sequence prints and is updated by user or safeguarded.Alternatively, the keeper or other suppliers that such renewal can be by cloud print service 404
And/or managed by the supplier of application program 430 so that unload associated effort and the responsibility of the user of application program 430
Burden.Even when new printer is incorporated into market with the time, user can have application program 430 can only by
Cloud print service 404 registers new printer and utilizes the experience of new printer.
Can with the form independently of printer or the print job received with general format at application manager 416
Be delivered to format converter 418, format converter 418 can be configured with from application manager 416 receive print job and
Print job is converted into associated with the printer (type) specified for discussed print job by promotion or execution
Form.Optionally, therefore this conversion can generally comprise specified in print data in itself conversion and given print job
The conversion of print characteristic.Wherein by establishing NFC connections between device 426 and printer and the situation of specific printer
In, format converter 418 may not receive print job and/or format print job until having established NFC connections to refer to
It is possible to determine printer.
In addition, printer usually requires low-level device or type specific instruction, it is actually logical that the instruction provides printer
Cross it and ink is applied to paper to realize the basis of wanted outward appearance.It is such instruction therefore can include use (such as) page-describing
Very specific description of the language (PDL) to wanted print result.For example, language PostScript can be used to describe to want
Print result, and (for example, rasterisation) is then rendered to produce through print text or image by particular printer.It additionally, there are
It is designed to promote the printing independently of device while maintains the fixation layout document form of document fidelity.For example, just
The example that formula document format (.pdf) is this form is taken, wherein PostScript can be used to produce .pdf documents.Somewhat similarly,
XML paper specification (XPS) provides this fixation layout document form based on extensible markup language (XML).
Can including (for example) any form on the fact that HTML (HTML) or with document process and/or
The associated form (for example .jpeg) of image is beaten with PDF or XPS forms referred to above from the reception of application program 430
Printing evidence.Therefore format converter 418 can be configured to the print data received in these and other various form and will print
Data conversion into can by specific printer recognize form.
Similarly, format converter 418 can be configured so that be converted into the print characteristic associated with print job can be by
The form of specific printer identification.I.e., as mentioned above, print characteristic can include following aspect：Should how or can be how
Print print data；Preference namely based on user and/or the ability based on specific printer (or its deficiency).For example, always
Formula printer 456 can be the black-and-white printer without duplex printing capability, and it can be to be beaten with two-sided that cloud, which perceives printer 438,
The color printer of print.Therefore, depending on selecting printer, format converter 418 can then provide conversion.
Format converter 418 can be used (such as) agreement that is referred to herein as cloud print protocol (CPP) provides and performs institute
Obtain converted print job.Therefore, cloud print protocol allows cloud print service to perceive printer 438 or old-fashioned printer with cloud
456 communications.The further detail below and other side of cloud print protocol are more fully hereinafter described.
Converted print job can be stored in the data storage area 422 for being illustrated as job storage area 422 in Fig. 4
In.Although individually illustrated for the sake of clear and explanation in Fig. 4, it can be appreciated that job storage area 422 can be with registration management
The data storage area 412 and 414 of device 406 is overlapping or overlaps.I.e., for example, the print job of given user can be together with user
User account and stored together with to one or more printers of the user's registration.Therefore, print job can
It is directed to storing for a long time so that (for example) even if user accesses from different from for being originally sent given printing making later
The cloud print service 404 of the device of the device of industry, user can still position, identify and print wanted print job again.Storing
During print job (for example, in job storage area 422), there may be the position of specified print job for cloud print service 404
Print data positional information, it includes associated print data and the characteristic of print job.
Therefore, can be observed, the conversion device that source application performs thereon from least in part of print job
(for example, device 426, apps server 434) is in isolated system (for example, cloud printing server 402, cloud perceive printer
438th, device 460 or router 452) place's generation.For example, in this manner it is possible to printing job to printer particular bin
The conversion of formula is discretely formulated and submits the print job at least in part, and makes this conversion whereby with performing application program
Underlying Operating System separates.
Print job router 420 can be configured so that converted print job is routed into specific printer.Such as institute above
State, the printer can specify via print dialog or via NFC establishment of connections.Print job router 420 can enter
One step monitors and reconciles the execution and successfully/failure of print job.Therefore print job router 420 can be responsible for and monitor
The ongoing print job from multiple users specified for corresponding multiple printers, following article describe in detail.
So do when, print job router 420 can be configured with (such as) with cloud perceive printer 438 firmware
The Printing 444 performed on 440 performs together.Cloud print protocol (example referred to above can be used in Printing 444
As) communicated by print job router 420 and/or registration manager 406 with cloud print service 404.
More particularly, Printing 444 can be configured perceives printer 438 to register cloud to cloud print service 404,
And the printer 438 for making whereby therefore registering is associated with the user of device 426.In addition, Printing 444 can be configured with
Actually drive cloud to perceive printer 438 and perform to be printed whereby.
In the example in figure 4, cloud perceives the Printing that printer 438 is illustrated as being included in firmware 440
444.As those skilled in the art will understand, firmware 440 can represent be not usually required to or do not allowing user to change or match somebody with somebody
The hardware and/or software for the factory's installation for specifying function are provided in the case of putting (for example, using read-only storage).Therefore,
Cloud perceives printer 438 and can be pre-configured with before the time buying to communicate and coordinate with cloud print service 404, to provide whereby
Convenient and pleasant Consumer's Experience.
For example, cloud, which perceives printer 438, can include network insertion manager 442, user's input 448 and display
(or other users output) 450, it can generally represent general components, and the general components are not described in detail herein, only in need
Except helping to understand the situation of the operation of system 400.Certainly, cloud perceive printer 438 can also include here for clear and
The other general components do not discussed for purpose of brevity and.
Network insertion manager 442 can represent to enable cloud to perceive printer 438 via network 424 and cloud print service
The associated hardware and/or software of 404 communications.For example, if cloud perceives scope of the printer 438 in appropriate wireless network
It is interior, then this communication can be carried out wirelessly.In other examples, network insertion manager 442 may be such that cloud perceives printer 438
Can (such as) by being connected to router (such as router 452) network 424 is connected to through a cable.
User's input 448 can represent in fact any kind of keypad, writing pencil or for entering data into cloud sense
Know other technologies of printer 438.Similarly, display 450 can represent to perceive printer 438 information is output into cloud
Any kind of audio and/or video display on the fact that user.
So, in exemplary situation, user can purchase cloud and perceive printer 438.After power up, cloud perceives printer
438 can (such as) automatically export or identify at once in the following manner cloud print service 404：URL or other identifiers are beaten
It is printed on and is loaded on the paper that cloud is perceived in the paper box of printer 438, or this information is shown using display 450.Similarly, cloud
The exportable log-on message of of printer 438 itself is perceived, for example, sequence number or other unique identifiers.
Then, in an exemplary situation, buyer can (such as) use device 426 or other nets in the following manner
Network device communicates with cloud print service 404：The cloud print service provided by cloud printing server 402 is accessed using browser
404 website.User/buyer can then log in the his or her user account associated with cloud print service 404 and be carried
Show that input cloud perceives the log-on message of printer 438.
In other exemplary embodiments, can be similarly used network insertion manager 442 using user input 448 and
Display 450 and the direct communication of cloud print service 404.For example, after power up, cloud perception printer 438, which can be used, beats
Print client 444 and network insertion manager 442 are automatically attached to cloud print service 404 at once, and then use display
450 prompt user/buyer to sign in cloud print service 404, to make chartered cloud perceive printer 438 with using whereby
Family/buyer is automatically associated.
For comparing, old-fashioned printer 456 may not be fabricated to perceives printing comprising Printing 444 and/or cloud
Other components of machine 438.For example, old-fashioned printer 456 may manufacture before the availability of cloud print service 404,
Or the only possible necessary component for being made as not having communicating with cloud print service 404.
In this case, old-fashioned printer 456 can be conventionally connected to device 460 (for example, by USB or other
It is adapted to wired or wireless connection).For example, device 460 can include the operating system that can be used to trustship Printing 464
462, Printing 464 is conceptually similar to Printing 444 and serves as the agency of old-fashioned printer 456 to permit whereby
Perhaps old-fashioned printer 456 participates in system 400.
In some embodiments, Printing/agency 464 can be come with the old-fashioned direct communication of printer 456 with performing
From the print job of cloud print service 404.In other embodiments, operating system 462, which can have, is directed to old-fashioned printer 456
The conventional printer driver 466 of installation, in the situation, system 400 can be utilized in the feature of print driver 466
Some or all of features drive old-fashioned printer 456.
Therefore, in operation, Printing/agency 464 can be configured and with similar mode described above and
Existence or non-existence depending on the ability of old-fashioned printer 456 is (for example, whether old-fashioned printer 456 includes network insertion, use
Family inputs and/or display module) register old-fashioned beat to the registration manager 406 (Plotter Manager 408) of cloud print service 404
Print machine 456.
Once registration, it may be desirable to old-fashioned printer 456 print application program 468 can (such as) with above for should
Print job is delivered to cloud print service 404 with the mode described by program 430.Because therefore old-fashioned printer 456 is incorporated to
And be integrated into system 400, it can therefore be appreciated that, therefore application program 430 and/or application program 436 can be beaten as cloud in the same direction perceives
Print machine 438 prints equally easily to be printed to old-fashioned printer 456.For example, though old-fashioned printer 456 printing when
Application program 430 still can be used to perform the printing to old-fashioned printer 456 away from device 426, the user of device 426 on network
Operation.
Similarly, the extra or alternative form as Printing 464, Printing 454 can be used as Agent components
It is installed on router 452 so that old-fashioned printer 456 is integrated into system 400.Printing (agency) 454 can therefore class
As allow to cloud print service 404 and one or more users (for example, one or more users of device 426)
Register old-fashioned printer 456, and the acceptable print job from the cloud print service 404 specified for old-fashioned printer 456.
For example, the user of device 426 may establish via the NFC interface 470 of device 460 and connect with the NFC of old-fashioned printer 456
Connect, so as to which old-fashioned printer 456 to be appointed as to the printer for particular print.
Many features and advantage are provided by system 400 and its version, as referenced herein and/or such as art
Technical staff will become apparent from.For example, as described, system 400 is promoted remote in a manner of simple and direct and can easily implement
Journey prints, because user needs only sign on cloud print service 404 and using any device (for example, personal computer, intelligence
Energy phone or other mobile devices or printer are in itself) registration printer.Then, though device and printer away from each other,
User still can thereafter from any device, on network 424 from anywhere in sign in cloud print service 404, and printing is made
The printer that industry is sent to therefore registered from any compatible application.
In other exemplary embodiments, printer sharing is possible among different users.For example, currently
In the presence of for sharing the document in existing document process/management system based on cloud (for example, when the first user is by to be shared
The link of document when Email is sent into second user) technology.By system 400, such technology and concept can expand
Open up printing field.For example, the first user is transmittable quotes printer to be shared (for example, quoting or being beaten comprising described
The log-on message of print machine) link so that second reception user can only follow the link so that identified printer and second
The cloud print service user account of user is associated.In these and other situation, user can (such as) by document directly to connecing
User's printing is received, or by job documentation to household printer (or vice versa as the same) printing, and otherwise experience remote printing
Benefit.
Fig. 5 is the block diagram of the more detailed example of the embodiment for the cloud print service for illustrating Fig. 4.More particularly,
Fig. 5 illustrates the specific API that can be used by the various assemblies of cloud print service 404.In this way, it can be appreciated that such API can be indivedual
Ground be contained in one of various assemblies of cloud print service 404 illustrated in Fig. 5 or it is one or more of in, such as will be bright
.
In the example of fig. 5, cloud print service 404 is illustrated as comprising the print dialog to be communicated with memorandum 510
API 502.Memorandum 510 can be the exercisable notice for giving printer to send new print job can be used for.
Then, after user is authorized by print dialog API 502, can (such as) will by sharing print dialog 520
List of Printers, associated printer capabilities and the current work of each printer and other status informations, which provide to arrive, applies journey
Sequence user, described information can (such as) rendered using Javascript.This print dialog 520 can be similar in appearance to routine
Print dialog, situation about only stating in addition herein is (for example, can allow selection that printer and associated printing can be used special
Sign) except.In the example of unconventional aspect of print dialog 520 is shared, sharing print dialog 520 can include to permit
Search and identify the field of the previous/stored print operation permanently stored by cloud print service 404 in family allowable.Such as institute above
State, user can be by selecting printer or by establishing and wanting printer from the list of Printers in print dialog 520
NFC connections and specify the printer for disposing print job.
Therefore print dialog API 502 can provide (for example, rendering) to application user substantially complete shared
Print dialog 520, and the shared print dialog framework across the application program interfaced with cloud print service 404 is provided whereby
Test.As be also depicted, print dialog API can also only provide sufficient for application developer construction third party dialog box 522
