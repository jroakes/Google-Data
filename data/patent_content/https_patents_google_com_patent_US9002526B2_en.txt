- additional bridges 620 which are interconnected with high-speed serial links or with multiple controllers 622 - 627 , such as controller 627 , that provide access to various different types of mass-storage devices 628 , electronic displays, input devices, and other such components, subcomponents, and computational resources.
- FIG. 7 illustrates features and characteristics of an intelligent controller of the general class of intelligent controllers to which the current application is directed.
- An intelligent controller includes controller logic 702 generally implemented as electronic circuitry and processor-based computational components controlled by computer instructions stored in physical data-storage components, including various types of electronic memory and/or mass-storage devices.
- controller logic 702 generally implemented as electronic circuitry and processor-based computational components controlled by computer instructions stored in physical data-storage components, including various types of electronic memory and/or mass-storage devices.
- computer instructions stored in physical data-storage devices and executed within processors comprise the control components of a wide variety of modern devices, machines, and systems, and are as tangible, physical, and real as any other component of a device, machine, or system.
- statements are encountered that suggest that computer-instruction-implemented control logic is “merely software” or something abstract and less tangible than physical machine components.
- Computer instructions executed by processors must be physical entities stored in physical devices. Otherwise, the processors would not be able to access and execute the instructions.
- the term “software” can be applied to a symbolic representation of a program or routine, such as a printout or displayed list of programming-language statements, but such symbolic representations of computer programs are not executed by processors. Instead, processors fetch and execute computer instructions stored in physical states within physical data-storage devices.
- computer-readable media are physical data-storage media, such as disks, memories, and mass-storage devices that store data in a tangible, physical form that can be subsequently retrieved from the physical data-storage media.
- the controller logic accesses and uses a variety of different types of stored information and inputs in order to generate output control signals 704 that control the operational behavior of one or more controlled entities.
- the information used by the controller logic may include one or more stored control schedules 706 , received output from one or more sensors 708 - 710 , immediate control inputs received through an immediate-control interface 712 , and data, commands, and other information received from remote data-processing systems, including cloud-based data-processing systems 713 .
- the controller logic provides an interface 714 that allows users to create and modify control schedules and may also output data and information to remote entities, other intelligent controllers, and to users through an information-output interface.
- FIG. 8 illustrates a typical control environment within which an intelligent controller operates.
- an intelligent controller 802 receives control inputs from users or other entities 804 and uses the control inputs, along with stored control schedules and other information, to generate output control signals 805 that control operation of one or more controlled entities 808 . Operation of the controlled entities may alter an environment within which sensors 810 - 812 are embedded. The sensors return sensor output, or feedback, to the intelligent controller 802 . Based on this feedback, the intelligent controller modifies the output control signals in order to achieve a specified goal or goals for controlled-system operation. In essence, an intelligent controller modifies the output control signals according to two different feedback loops.
- the first, most direct feedback loop includes output from sensors that the controller can use to determine subsequent output control signals or control-output modification in order to achieve the desired goal for controlled-system operation.
- a second feedback loop involves environmental or other feedback 816 to users which, in turn, elicits subsequent user control and scheduling inputs to the intelligent controller 802 .
- users can either be viewed as another type of sensor that outputs immediate-control directives and control-schedule changes, rather than raw sensor output, or can be viewed as a component of a higher-level feedback loop.
- sensor output is directly or indirectly related to some type of parameter, machine state, organization state, computational state, or physical environmental parameter.
- FIG. 9 illustrates the general characteristics of sensor output.
- a sensor may output a signal, represented by curve 904 , over time, with the signal directly or indirectly related to a parameter P, plotted with respect to the vertical axis 906 .
- the sensor may output a signal continuously or at intervals, with the time of output plotted with respect to the horizontal axis 908 .
- sensor output may be related to two or more parameters.
- a sensor outputs values directly or indirectly related to two different parameters P 1 and P 2 , plotted with respect to axes 912 and 914 , respectively, over time, plotted with respect to vertical axis 916 .
- sensors produce output directly or indirectly related to a single parameter, as in plot 902 in FIG. 9 .
- the sensor output is assumed to be a set of parameter values for a parameter P.
- the parameter may be related to environmental conditions, such as temperature, ambient light level, sound level, and other such characteristics.
- the parameter may also be the position or positions of machine components, the data states of memory-storage address in data-storage devices, the current drawn from a power supply, the flow rate of a gas or fluid, the pressure of a gas or fluid, and many other types of parameters that comprise useful information for control purposes.
- FIGS. 10A-D illustrate information processed and generated by an intelligent controller during control operations. All the figures show plots, similar to plot 902 in FIG. 9 , in which values of a parameter or another set of control-related values are plotted with respect to a vertical axis and time is plotted with respect to a horizontal axis.
- FIG. 10A shows an idealized specification for the results of controlled-entity operation.
- the vertical axis 1002 in FIG. 10A represents a specified parameter value, P S .
- the specified parameter value may be temperature.
- the specified parameter value may be flow rate.
- 10A is the plot of a continuous curve 1004 that represents desired parameter values, over time, that an intelligent controller is directed to achieve through control of one or more devices, machines, or systems.
- the specification indicates that the parameter value is desired to be initially low 1006 , then rise to a relatively high value 1008 , then subside to an intermediate value 1010 , and then again rise to a higher value 1012 .
- a control specification can be visually displayed to a user, as one example, as a control schedule.
- FIG. 10B shows an alternate view, or an encoded-data view, of a control schedule corresponding to the control specification illustrated in FIG. 10A .
- the control schedule includes indications of a parameter-value increase 1016 corresponding to edge 1018 in FIG. 10A , a parameter-value decrease 1020 corresponding to edge 1022 in FIG. 10A , and a parameter-value increase 1024 corresponding to edge 1016 in FIG. 10A .
- the directional arrows plotted in FIG. 10B can be considered to be setpoint changes, or indications of desired parameter changes at particular points in time within some period of time.
- a setpoint change may be stored as a record with multiple fields, including fields that indicate whether the setpoint change is a system-generated setpoint or a user-generated setpoint, whether the setpoint change is an immediate-control-input setpoint change or a scheduled setpoint change, the time and date of creation of the setpoint change, the time and date of the last edit of the setpoint change, and other such fields.
- a setpoint may be associated with two or more parameter values.
- a range setpoint may indicate a range of parameter values within which the intelligent controller should maintain a controlled environment. Setpoint changes are often referred to as “setpoints.”
- FIG. 10C illustrates the control output by an intelligent controller that might result from the control schedule illustrated in FIG. 10B .
- the magnitude of an output control signal is plotted with respect to the vertical axis 1026 .
- the control output may be a voltage signal output by an intelligent thermostat to a heating unit, with a high-voltage signal indicating that the heating unit should be currently operating and a low-voltage output indicating that the heating system should not be operating.
- Edge 1028 in FIG. 10C corresponds to setpoint 1016 in FIG. 10B .
- the width of the positive control output 1030 may be related to the length, or magnitude, of the desired parameter-value change, indicated by the length of setpoint arrow 1016 .
- the intelligent controller discontinues output of a high-voltage signal, as represented by edge 1032 .
- Similar positive output control signals 1034 and 1036 are elicited by setpoints 1020 and 1024 in FIG. 10B .
- FIG. 10D illustrates the observed parameter changes, as indicated by sensor output, resulting from control, by the intelligent controller, of one or more controlled entities.
- the sensor output directly or indirectly related to the parameter P, is plotted with respect to the vertical axis 1040 .
- the observed parameter value is represented by a smooth, continuous curve 1042 .
- this continuous curve can be seen to be related to the initial specification curve, plotted in FIG. 10A , the observed curve does not exactly match that specification curve.
- the parameter value may begin to fall 1046 , resulting in a feedback-initiated control output to resume operation of the controlled entity in order to maintain the desired parameter value.
- the desired high-level constant parameter value 1008 in FIG. 10A may, in actuality, end up as a time-varying curve 1048 that does not exactly correspond to the control specification 1004 .
- the first level of feedback discussed above with reference to FIG. 8 , is used by the intelligent controller to control one or more control entities so that the observed parameter value, over time, as illustrated in FIG. 10D , matches the specified time behavior of the parameter in FIG. 10A as closely as possible.
- the second level feedback control loop discussed above with reference to FIG.
- FIG. 8 may involve alteration of the specification, illustrated in FIG. 10A , by a user, over time, either by changes to stored control schedules or by input of immediate-control directives, in order to generate a modified specification that produces a parameter-value/time curve reflective of a user's desired operational results.
- FIGS. 11A-C show three different types of control schedules.
- the control schedule is a continuous curve 1102 representing a parameter value, plotted with respect to the vertical axis 1104 , as a function of time, plotted with respect to the horizontal axis 1106 .
- the continuous curve comprises only horizontal and vertical sections. Horizontal sections represent periods of time at which the parameter is desired to remain constant and vertical sections represent desired changes in the parameter value at particular points in time.
- This is a simple type of control schedule and is used, below, in various examples of automated control-schedule learning. However, automated control-schedule-learning methods can also learn more complex types of schedules. For example, FIG.
- 11B shows a control schedule that includes not only horizontal and vertical segments, but arbitrarily angled straight-line segments.
- a change in the parameter value may be specified, by such a control schedule, to occur at a given rate, rather than specified to occur instantaneously, as in the simple control schedule shown in FIG. 11A .
- Automated-control-schedule-learning methods may also accommodate smooth-continuous-curve-based control schedules, such as that shown in FIG. 11C .
- the characterization and data encoding of smooth, continuous-curve-based control schedules, such as that shown in FIG. 11C is more complex and includes a greater amount of stored data than the simpler control schedules shown in FIGS. 11B and 11A .
- Setpoint changes are generally encoded as records within electronic memory and/or mass-storage devices,
- a parameter value tends to relax towards lower values in the absence of system operation, such as when the parameter value is temperature and the controlled system is a heating unit.
- the parameter value may relax toward higher values in the absence of system operation, such as when the parameter value is temperature and the controlled system is an air conditioner.
- the direction of relaxation often corresponds to the direction of lower resource or expenditure by the system.
- the direction of relaxation may depend on the environment or other external conditions, such as when the parameter value is temperature and the controlled system is an HVAC system including both heating and cooling functionality.
- the continuous-curve-represented control schedule 1102 may be alternatively encoded as discrete setpoints corresponding to vertical segments, or edges, in the continuous curve.
- a continuous-curve control schedule is generally used, in the following discussion, to represent a stored control schedule either created by a user or remote entity via a schedule-creation interface provided by the intelligent controller or created by the intelligent controller based on already-existing control schedules, recorded immediate-control inputs, and/or recorded sensor data, or a combination of these types of information.
- FIGS. 12A-G show representations of immediate-control inputs that may be received and executed by an intelligent controller, and then recorded and overlaid onto control schedules, such as those discussed above with reference to FIGS. 11A-C , as part of automated control-schedule learning.
- An immediate-control input is represented graphically by a vertical line segment that ends in a small filled or shaded disk.
- FIG. 12A shows representations of two immediate-control inputs 1202 and 1204 .
- An immediate-control input is essentially equivalent to an edge in a control schedule, such as that shown in FIG.
- An immediate-control input is therefore a real-time setpoint input through a control-input interface to the intelligent controller.
- an immediate-control input alters the current control schedule
- an immediate-control input is generally associated with a subsequent, temporary control schedule, shown in FIG. 12A as dashed horizontal and vertical lines that form a temporary-control-schedule parameter vs. time curve extending forward in time from the immediate-control input.
- Temporary control schedules 1206 and 1208 are associated with immediate-control inputs 1202 and 1204 , respectively, in FIG. 12A .
- FIG. 12B illustrates an example of immediate-control input and associated temporary control schedule.
- the immediate-control input 1210 is essentially an input setpoint that overrides the current control schedule and directs the intelligent controller to control one or more controlled entities in order to achieve a parameter value equal to the vertical coordinate of the filled disk 1212 in the representation of the immediate-control input.
- a temporary constant-temperature control-schedule interval 1214 extends for a period of time following the immediate-control input, and the immediate-control input is then relaxed by a subsequent immediate-control-input endpoint, or subsequent setpoint 1216 .
- the length of time for which the immediate-control input is maintained, in interval 1214 is a parameter of automated control-schedule learning.
- the direction and magnitude of the subsequent immediate-control-input endpoint setpoint 1216 represents one or more additional automated-control-schedule-learning parameters.
- an automated-control-schedule-learning parameter is an adjustable parameter that controls operation of automated control-schedule learning, and is different from the one or more parameter values plotted with respect to time that comprise control schedules.
- the parameter values plotted with respect to the vertical axis in the example control schedules to which the current discussion refers are related directly or indirectly to observables, including environmental conditions, machines states, and the like.
- FIG. 12C shows an existing control schedule on which an immediate-control input is superimposed.
- the existing control schedule called for an increase in the parameter value P, represented by edge 1220 , at 7:00 a.m. ( 1222 in FIG. 12C ).
- the immediate-control input 1224 specifies an earlier parameter-value change of somewhat less magnitude.
- FIGS. 12D-G illustrate various subsequent temporary control schedules that may obtain, depending on various different implementations of intelligent-controller logic and/or current values of automated-control-schedule-learning parameter values.
- the temporary control schedule associated with an immediate-control input is shown with dashed line segments and that portion of the existing control schedule overridden by the immediate-control input is shown by dotted line segments. In one approach, shown in FIG.
- the desired parameter value indicated by the immediate-control input 1224 is maintained for a fixed period of time 1226 after which the temporary control schedule relaxes, as represented by edge 1228 , to the parameter value that was specified by the control schedule at the point in time that the immediate-control input is carried out.
- This parameter value is maintained 1230 until the next scheduled setpoint, which corresponds to edge 1232 in FIG. 12C , at which point the intelligent controller resumes control according to the control schedule.
- the parameter value specified by the immediate-control input 1224 is maintained 1232 until a next scheduled setpoint is reached, in this case the setpoint corresponding to edge 1220 in the control schedule shown in FIG. 12C .
- the intelligent controller resumes control according to the existing control schedule.
- the parameter value specified by the immediate-control input 1224 is maintained by the intelligent controller for a fixed period of time 1234 , following which the parameter value that would have been specified by the existing control schedule at that point in time is resumed 1236 .
- the parameter value specified by the immediate-control input 1224 is maintained 1238 until a setpoint with opposite direction from the immediate-control input is reached, at which the existing control schedule is resumed 1240 .
- the immediate-control input may be relaxed further, to a lowest-reasonable level, in order to attempt to optimize system operation with respect to resource and/or energy expenditure.
- a user is compelled to positively select parameter values greater than, or less than, a parameter value associated with a minimal or low rate of energy or resource usage.
- an intelligent controller monitors immediate-control inputs and schedule changes over the course of a monitoring period, generally coinciding with the time span of a control schedule or subschedule, while controlling one or more entities according to an existing control schedule except as overridden by immediate-control inputs and input schedule changes.
- the recorded data is superimposed over the existing control schedule and a new provisional schedule is generated by combining features of the existing control schedule and schedule changes and immediate-control inputs.
- the new provisional schedule is promoted to the existing control schedule for future time intervals for which the existing control schedule is intended to control system operation.
- FIGS. 13A-D illustrate the general context in which intelligent controllers, to which the current application is directed, operate.
- this context comprises a region or volume 1302 , one or more intelligent controllers 1304 and 1306 , and one or more devices, systems, or other entities 1306 - 1308 that are controlled by the one or more intelligent controllers and that operate on the region or volume 1302 .
- the intelligent controllers are described as controlling the region or volume 1302 although, in fact, they directly control the one or more devices, systems, or other entities 1306 - 1308 .
- the region or volume 1302 may be a complex region or volume that includes multiple connected or separate subregions or subvolumes.
- the region, regions, volume, or volumes controlled by an intelligent controller is referred to, below, as the “controlled environment.”
- the intelligent controllers may reside within the environment, as intelligent controller 1304 shown in FIG. 13 A, or may reside externally, as, for example, intelligent controller 1306 in FIG. 13A .
- the devices, systems, or other entities that operate on the environment 1306 - 1308 may reside within the environment, as, for example, system 1306 in FIG. 13A , or may be located outside of the environment, as, for example, systems 1307 - 1308 in FIG. 13A .
- the systems are HVAC systems and/or additional air conditioners and heaters and the intelligent controllers are intelligent thermostats, with the environment a residence, multi-family dwelling, commercial building, or industrial building that is heated, cooled, and/or ventilated by the systems controlled by the intelligent thermostats.
- the intelligent controllers 1304 and 1306 generally intercommunicate with one another and may additionally intercommunicate with a remote computing system 1310 to which certain of control tasks and intelligent-control-related computations are distributed.
- the intelligent controllers generally output control signals to, and receive data signals from, the systems 1306 - 1308 controlled by the intelligent controllers.
- the systems 1306 - 1308 are controlled by the intelligent controllers to operate on the environment 1302 . This operation may involve exchange of various types of substances, operations that result in heat exchange with the environment, exchange of electrical current with the environment, and many other types of operations. These operations generally affect one or more characteristics or parameters of the environment which are directly or indirectly monitored by the intelligent controllers.
- the intelligent controllers to which the current application is directed, generally control the environment based on control schedules and immediate-control inputs that can be thought of as overlaid on or added to the control schedules.
- the context within which the general class of intelligent controllers operates is illustrated, in FIG. 13C , with two plots 1312 and 1314 .
- the first plot 1312 is a portion of a control schedule to which an immediate-control input 1316 has been added.
- the portion of the control schedule may feature a scheduled setpoint rather than the immediate-control input 1316 .
- the vertical axis is labeled “P” 1318 to represent the value of a particular parameter or characteristic of the environment, referred to as an “environmental parameter,” and the horizontal axis represents time 1320 .
- the immediate-control input 1316 or, alternatively, a scheduled setpoint generally represent a desired change in the parameter or characteristic 1322 , designated ⁇ P.
- the intelligent controller At the time of the immediate-control input, or before or at the time of a scheduled input, the intelligent controller generally outputs control signals to the systems in order to change the parameter or characteristic P by ⁇ P.
- ⁇ P is positive, with the desired parameter P greater than the current value of the parameter P, the ⁇ P may also be negative, with the desired value of P less than the current P.
- intelligent controllers control the systems with respect to multiple parameters, in which case there may be separate control schedules for each parameter, and multiple parameters may be combined together to form a composite parameter for a single control schedule.
- setpoints may be associated with multiple P values for each of one or more environmental parameters.
- each setpoint specifies a single parameter value, and that intelligent controllers output control signals to one or more systems in order to control the value of the parameter P within the controlled environment 1302 .
- the parameter P changes, over time, in a continuous manner from the initial P value 1324 to the desired P value 1326 .
- the P values cannot be instantaneously altered at times corresponding to immediate-control inputs or scheduled setpoints.
- ⁇ t 1328 there is a time interval ⁇ t 1328 , referred to as the “response time,” that separates the time of an immediate-control input or scheduled setpoint change in the time which the parameter value specified by the setpoint change or immediate-control input is achieved.
- Intelligent controllers to which the current application is directed model the P versus t behavior within this response-time ⁇ t interval 1328 so that, at any point in time during the response time, the time remaining to a point in time the desired t value is obtained, or, in other words, the remaining response time, can be displayed or reported.
- the intelligent controller calculates the length of time interval ⁇ t 1 1332 , the remaining response time, and reports the length of this time interval in a textural, graphical, or numeric display output on an intelligent-controller display device, such as display device 410 in FIG. 4 , or outputs the information through a remote-display interface for display on a remote display device, such as a smart phone.
- the information may include a remaining-response-time indication, an indication of the remaining response time relative to the entire response time, information including the response time so far elapsed, and other response-time related information. It should be noted that calculation of the time remaining before a desired P value is achieved may be used independently, for various different intelligent-controller operations, from the display of the remaining response time. For example, intelligent controllers may alter control strategies depending on the remaining response time computed for various different control strategies.
- FIG. 13D shows various different conditions and effects that may alter the P versus t behavior of a controlled environment.
- the time of day, weather, and time of year 1340 may alter the P versus t behavior of the environment, referred to below as the environment's P response.
- the P response may also be altered by different types of inputs 1342 - 1344 to the systems or internal states of the systems. For example, a system that requires electricity for operation may be inoperable during power failures, as a result of which the P response during power failures may be substantially different than the P response when power is available.
- the P response may also be affected by external entities other than the systems 1346 which operate on the environment or by internal systems and devices other than systems 1306 - 1308 that operate on the environment 1348 .
- changes to buildings or structures, such as opened windows 1350 may significantly alter the P response to the environment due to a thermal or material exchange 1352 .
- FIGS. 14A-E illustrate construction of one or more of a first type of P-response model based on observed P-response data.
- FIG. 14A shows a collection of data by an intelligent controller and construction of a parameterized P-response curve from the data.
- the horizontal axis 1402 is a time axis with respect to which various data states are shown.
- the intelligent controller monitors the change in P value in time and plots points to represent an observed P-response curve.
- the first such plot 1404 represents the points plotted with respect to a first observed P-response curve of the intelligent controller.
- the points are stored in a file or database, often as encoded coordinate pairs, rather than plotted in a graphical plot.
- the stored data is referred to as a “plot” in the following discussion.
- Observation of a first P response generally produces a set of points, such as those shown plotted in plot 1404 , that describe a general trend in P versus t behavior.
- the intelligent controller continues to make observations of P responses, over time, adding observed P versus t points to the plot, as shown by plots 1406 - 1409 in FIG. 14A . After some time, were the recorded P versus t points plotted visually in a graph, they would form a relatively dense cloud of points that suggest a P versus t curve that describes the P response for the control environment.
- the intelligent controller can generate a parameterized model, or function, that statistically best fits the collected points, as represented in FIG. 14A by parameterized plot 1410 .
- a parameterized plot is a plot that is associated with a model that represents the observed P versus t data over the course of many P-response observations.
- the P-response data may be discarded following plot parameterization, or after passage of significant periods of time.
- FIG. 14B illustrates one P-response-curve model.
- the expression 1416 is one P-response-curve model.
- the model is non-linear between zero and about 15 minutes, is approximately linear for ten minutes, is again non-linear until about 35 minutes, and then flattens considerably thereafter.
- this model can be appropriate for certain ⁇ P changes and certain types of characteristics and parameters in certain environments acted on by certain types of devices and systems, but is certainly not appropriate for a large number or even a large fraction of possible controlled environments, ⁇ P changes, and characteristics and parameters.
- the expression is parameterized by two constants a and b.
- the model computes ⁇ P as a function of time, the function parameterized by and one or more constant-valued parameters that are determined for a given P and a given controlled environment. In the case of the model shown in FIG.
- the slope of the straight-line portion of the P-response curve generated from the model can be varied by varying the value of parameter b, while the range in ⁇ P values can be altered by changing the value of parameter a.
- Many other types of models can be used for P-response curves.
- the parameterized model generated for a collection of observed P responses is generally only an estimate and, because of all the different factors that may affect P responses, the parameterized model is generally an estimate for the average P response of the controlled environment.
- the model curve to be plotted within the dense clouds of points representing the observed data, generally only a very few of the observed points would actually fall on the P-response curve generated by the model.
- Models are selected and evaluated by evaluating how well the data fits the model. There are many statistical methods that may be employed to compute the fit of a model to experimental data.
- FIGS. 14C-D illustrate one such method.
- FIG. 14C shows the model P response curve in a graphical plot 1430 similar to that shown in FIG. 14B along with one of the observed P versus t points 1432 .
- a vertical line segment 1434 passing through the observed P versus t point 1432 , also passes through the model curve at point 1436 and through the time axis at point 1438 , the time coordinate of which is referred to as t 1 .
- the ⁇ P coordinate 1438 of the observed P versus t point is labeled ⁇ p o and the ⁇ P coordinate 1440 of the point on the model curve corresponding to time t 1 1410 is labeled ⁇ p c .
- a discrepancy ⁇ o/c i between the observed data point i 1432 and corresponding model point 1436 can be computed as:
- ⁇ oic i ( ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ p o - ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ p c ) 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ p c
- a fit value for the curve with respect to the observed data can be computed by summing all of the discrepancies for all of the data points, as follows:
- fit values calculated from various different data sets fall into a particular type of probability distribution.
- One such probability distribution is shown in FIG. 14D .
- the vertical axis 1460 represents the probability of observing a particular fit value and the horizontal axis 1462 represents the different possible fit values.
- the area under the probability-distribution curve to the right of the fit value 1466 shown cross-hatched in FIG. 14D , represents the probability of observing the fit value 1464 or a fit value greater than that fit value.
- This probability can also be used to evaluate the reasonableness of the model with respect to observed data. When the probability of a fit value equal to or greater than the observed fit value falls below a threshold probability, the model may be rejected.
- the intelligent controller may, after observing each response and adding the data points for the observed P response to a plot, compute the fit value of various different models with respect to the data and, when one or more models is associated with a fit value less than a first threshold value or with a corresponding probability value greater than a second threshold value, the intelligent controller may select the best fitting model from the one or more models and generate a parameterized plot by associating the selected model, including selected constant values for the model parameters, with the plot. This constitutes what is referred to as “parameterizing the plot” in the following discussion. Once a plot is parameterized, the plot becomes a global model that can be used, by the intelligent controller, to predict remaining response time, or time-to, values for display and for other purposes.
- the parameterized plot may be continued to be refined, over time, following addition of new P-response data, including changing the global model associated with the parameterized plot and altering constant-parameter values. This refinement may continue indefinitely, or may be discontinued after a highly reliable model is constructed. Alternatively, the parameterized plot may represent a sliding data window, with only recent data used to select a current associated model and parameter values.
- An intelligent controller may generate various different parameterized models, also referred to as “global models,” for various different conditions.
- FIG. 14E illustrates generation of multiple global models as a continuation of the timeline shown in FIG. 14A .
- the intelligent controller may elect to divide the collected data points among multiple plots 1412 - 1415 each collecting observed P responses under different conditions. For example, when it is determined that weather and outside-temperature are important influences on P responses, the intelligent controller may collect separate P-response data for sunny days, cloudy days, nighttime, days with high wind, and other such different weather conditions.
- FIG. 14E illustrates division of the initial plot 1410 into four plots 1412 - 1415 arranged along a vertical parameter or condition dimension, such as a weather-and-temperature dimension. Then, as shown in FIG. 14E , the intelligent controller may continue to collect data for each of these individual plots until they can be parameterized, with the parameterized plots shown in column 1420 . At this point, the intelligent controller may then generate new plots, essentially extending the data collection along a new dimension, as represented by the column of sets of plots 1422 shown in FIG. 14E .
- the intermediate global models, such as global model 1410 may be retained in addition to the subsequently generated global models for particular conditions.
- an intelligent controller need not be constrained to generating only a single global model, but may generate multiple global models, each for a different condition or set of conditions, in order to better approximate P response curves that obtain under those conditions.
- the response model may depend on the magnitude of the ⁇ P represented by a scheduled setpoint change or immediate-input control.
- a second type of P-response model that may be employed by intelligent controllers is referred to as a “local model.”
- a local model A second type of P-response model that may be employed by intelligent controllers.
- FIGS. 15A-B illustrate several types of local modeling techniques.
- FIG. 15A illustrates one type of local model.
- ⁇ t unstable 1502 Following output of control signals to one or more systems by an intelligent controller, there is a period of time referred to as ⁇ t unstable 1502 during which the P value may fail to change or actually change in the direction opposite from the desired direction.
- the ⁇ P versus t response may be nearly linear 1504 .
- FIG. 15B even when the response following the unstable period is not linear, but is instead a curve, the response may be approximated by a series of local linear models. In FIG.
- Another portion of the P-response curve within dashed circle 1510 can be approximated by a different linear model with a different slope.
- global models and local models provide models of P responses.
- the global models are generally used during the initial portion of a response time following an immediate-control input or scheduled setpoint because, during this initial period of time, there is generally insufficient observed data to compute parameters for a local model and/or to select a particular local model.
- a local model can be selected and parameterized to provide more accurate remaining-response-time predictions up until the time that the desired P value is obtained. This is, however, not always the case.
- the global model is more predictive throughout the entire response time or that, after a local model is selected and used, the global model again, after another period of time, is again better able to predict the remaining-response-time value from a local model.
- neither global nor local models provide adequate predictive power. For this reason, many intelligent controllers of the class of intelligent controllers to which the current application is directed continuously reevaluate P-response models and attempt to select the best model for each point in time over an entire interval during which the remaining-response-time values are continuously, periodically, or intermittently calculated and displayed.
- FIGS. 16-17 illustrate, using plots similar to the plots shown in FIGS. 14B-C and 15 A-B, two additional types of information that may be obtained by monitoring P versus t response behaviors and various types of additional information with respect to the systems controlled by the intelligent controller.
- FIG. 16-17 illustrate, using plots similar to the plots shown in FIGS. 14B-C and 15 A-B, two additional types of information that may be obtained by monitoring P versus t response behaviors and various types of additional information with respect to the systems controlled by the intelligent controller.
- FIG. 16 shows a ⁇ P/ ⁇ t versus P curve for a particular type of system that affects a controlled environment and that is controlled directly by the intelligent controller.
- a portion of the ⁇ P/ ⁇ t versus P curve is a straight line 1602 .
- This line represents the fact that, for the particular system for which the data has been collected, the rate at which the system changes the value of parameter P within the controlled environment varies with respect to the current value of P.
- the current value of P may be the current value of P within the controlled environment or the current value of P external to the controlled environment. For example, this type of curve is frequently used to describe dependence of heat-pump effectiveness with respect to outside temperature. As shown in FIG.
- P c 1604 there is a critical P value, P c 1604 , at which ⁇ P/ ⁇ t transitions from a positive to a negative value.
- P c 1604 a critical P value
- an intelligent controller When an intelligent controller is attempting to increase the P value in the controlled environment, it clearly would not choose to use a system with ⁇ P/ ⁇ t characteristics such as those shown in FIG. 16 when the current P value, such as the outside temperature, is less than the critical P value P c .
- an intelligent controller establishes a P-value cutoff, or lockout value, substantially higher than P c , below which the intelligent controller does not activate the system in order to increase the value of P in a controlled environment due to the poor effectiveness, or rate of change in P, of the system below the lockout value.
- FIG. 17 shows a different type of information that may be obtained and electronically stored by an intelligent controller to characterize a particular system.
- FIG. 17 shows a plot of ⁇ E/ ⁇ P versus P for a particular system, where ⁇ E is the amount of energy needed to change the value of the parameter P within a controlled environment by ⁇ P.
- ⁇ E is the amount of energy needed to change the value of the parameter P within a controlled environment by ⁇ P.
- this curve is reflective of the dependence of the energy efficiency of a system with respect to the current value of P.
- the current value of P may be the current value of P within the controlled environment or the current value of P external to the controlled environment. As one example, such a curve may represent the energy efficiency of a furnace with respect to the outside temperature.
- the energy efficiency is maximized, when ⁇ E/ ⁇ P is lowest, at a P value of approximately P 1 1704 and decreases as P is either increased or decreased from this maximum-efficiency P value.
- the energy efficiency of the furnace may decrease as outside temperatures decreases due to increasing thermal exchange of the controlled environment with the external environment and may also decrease as temperatures reach a relatively high value, due to the decreasing difference between the temperature of air output by the furnace with respect to the ambient temperature. In other words, when the temperature is neither too cold nor too hot, the furnace may not be capable of efficiently increasing the temperature of a controlled environment.
- the data plotted in FIGS. 16 and 17 is generally stored as a collection of data points in memory and/or mass-storage devices.

- FIG. 22B provides a control-flow diagram for the routine “initial system activation” called in step 2204 in FIG. 22A .
- the routine “initial system activation” determines the ⁇ P corresponding to an immediate-control input or scheduled setpoint change as well as the current P value, P initial , a target P value, P target , and the current time, or initial time.
- the initial-system-activation routine determines the current auto-component-activation level, in certain embodiments set through an auto-component-activation-level user interface, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 18 .
- the intelligent controller uses the determined auto-component-activation-level value and system-configuration information to determine the maximum response time for carrying out the immediate-control input or scheduled setpoint change which resulted in a call to the routine “initial system activation” from an immediate-control-input event handler or scheduled-setpoint-change event handler.
- the routine “select system combination” is called to select one or more systems for initial activation in order to carry out the immediate-control input or scheduled setpoint change.

- FIG. 22C provides a control-flow diagram for the routine “select system combination” called in step 2216 of FIG. 22B .
- the routine “select system combination” sets numerous local variables, including setting the local variables energy 1 , time 1 , energy 2 , and time 2 to large values and setting the local variables combo 1 and combo 2 to null. Then, in the for-loop of steps 2225 - 2233 , the routine “select system combination” considers possible combinations of one or more systems in order to select a best combination for activation by the intelligent controller in order to achieve a specified ⁇ P P-value change as a result of an immediate-control input or scheduled setpoint change.
- step 2226 the routine “select system combination” uses the appropriate compatibility table for the current P-value range, discussed above with reference to FIG. 19C , to ensure that the currently considered system combination contains no incompatible systems. Also, in step 2226 , the routine “select system combination” uses the table discussed above in FIG. 19A to ensure that none of the systems in the currently considered system combination is outside of its P-value range.
- the routine “select system combination” uses the system specific information, such as the data 1936 , 1938 , and 1940 for system 1930 in FIG. 19D , for each system in the currently considered combination in order to compute a time needed to achieve P target and the amount of energy used to do so.
- the estimation of P target may additionally use other types of information, including weather forecasts, system operational status, and other such information obtained from remote information sources.
- Various different methods can be used to obtain the time and energy values.
- Simplistic methods may employ additive combination of the energies and times needed for individual systems to achieve P target , with weighting or subsequent averaging, in order to compute a total time and energy value.
- more complex types of calculations may be used in order to precisely estimate the response time and energy usage needed for the currently considered combination of systems to achieve P target .
- step 2230 the local variable combo 1 is set to the currently considered combination of systems, energy 1 is set to the computed energy, and time 1 is set to the computed time.
- the computed time is not less than or equal to the max response time, but the computed time is less than the value currently stored in the local variable time 2 , as determined in step 2231 , then the local variable combo 2 is set to the currently considered combination of systems, energy 2 is set to the computed energy, and time 2 is set to the computed time in step 2232 .

- the maximum response time may be dynamically altered, from values stored in memory, such as in the tables discussed above with reference to FIG. 19B , according to various additional rules, heuristics, and considerations, such as the nature of the setpoint change being carried out.
- additional rules and characterizations may be used to dynamically alter various of the thresholds employed for monitoring and adjustment of the control strategies.
- FIG. 22D provides a control-flow diagram for the routine “response time monitoring,” called in step 2122 of FIG. 21 .
- This is an event handler for the response-time-monitoring event, and carries out the monitoring for the P-response as discussed above with reference to 2012 in FIG. 20 .
- the routine “response time monitoring” determines the current value for the environmental variable P.
- the routine “reselect” is called in step 2246 in order to attempt to choose a better combination of one or more systems to activate in order to achieve P target as quickly as possible.
- the routine “reselect” corresponds to the subsequent decision discussed above with reference to 2018 in FIG. 20 .
- the change in P value is opposite, in direction, from the desired change.
- the constant value added to the current time ensures that a reselection of active systems is not undertaken during an initial unstable period following initial system activation.
- the routine “reselect” is called in step 2246 .
- the routine “response time monitoring” returns without scheduling a next response-time-monitoring event, since P target the response-time monitoring is no longer needed. Otherwise, a next response-time-monitoring event is scheduled in step 2252 .
- FIG. 22E provides a control-flow diagram for the routine “reselect” called in step 2246 of FIG. 22D .
- This routine is similar to the routine “select system combination” shown in FIG. 22C .
- the routine “reschedule” the combination of one or more systems that provides the most rapid achievement of P target is determined, in the for-loop of steps 2259 - 2264 , and the appropriate control signals are output to the selected one or more systems in step 2266 .
- step 2268 a next response-time-monitoring event is scheduled.
- the routine “initial system activation,” shown in FIG. 22B is called in order to decide which combination of one or more systems to activate in order to achieve the target P value, a step represented by decision 2010 in FIG. 20 .
- the routine “response time monitoring” is repeatedly called, during the response time, to monitor progress towards target P, as represented by the unfilled circles, such as unfilled circle 2012 in FIG. 20 .
- a rescheduling operation is illustrated in FIG. 20 by filled disk 2018 .
- the monitoring may be carried out, using simple heuristics, by a low-power processor within the intelligent controller, in one implementation, while the system-activation decisions may be made by a higher-power processor that is awaken by the low-power processor when the need for active-system reselection is determined.
- the continuous, intermittent, or periodic monitoring, by the intelligent controller, of the progress towards a target P value following an immediate-control input or scheduled setpoint change allows the intelligent controller to achieve a desired balance between energy efficiency and response time.
- other considerations may be factored into the selection of one or more subsystems for activation in order to achieve a specified value of an environmental parameter.
- more complex considerations may be made by an intelligent controller in order to achieve specified values for multiple parameters under various different constraints.
- the intelligent controller computes response-time values and stores the computed remaining-response-time values in at least one memory during response-monitoring.
- the intelligent controller also stores selections of one or more systems for activation in memory in order to subsequently generate control signals.
- the response-monitoring techniques discussed with reference to FIGS. 20-22E find particular application in intelligent thermostats, one class of intelligent controllers.
- Many residential and commercial controlled environments employ heat pumps for heating and cooling. Heat pumps are efficient at higher temperatures but lose their efficiency as the outside temperature falls. For this reason, many residential and commercial controlled environments include some type of auxiliary heating system, in addition to the heat pump, to allow for reasonable response times at temperatures below those for which heat pumps efficiently heat a controlled environment.
- the auxiliary heating systems tend to be less energy efficient than heat pumps, more costly to operate than heat pumps, or, commonly, both less energy efficient and more costly, often by a factor of between 3 and 5.
- an intelligent thermostat can attempt to dynamically strike an acceptable balance between activating only a heat pump, in order to conserve energy, and activating the auxiliary heating system instead of, or concurrently with, the heat pump in order to achieve acceptable response times.
- the user interface for an energy-saving device generally needs to provide, to users, an easy, enjoyable, and pleasant experience, or else the user may disregard the energy-saving features of the device, such as by avoiding interaction with advanced energy-saving features, de-activating the advanced features by, for example, setting a thermostat to a temporary manual-override mode on a permanent basis, or even exchanging the device for an older-technology device with a less complicated user interface.
- Certain of the above described intelligent-controller interfaces contribute to providing an intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected, energy-saving device for adoption into the home in an easy, pleasant, seamless, and user-friendly manner.
- An intelligent-thermostat implementation incorporates many features that contribute to providing an intelligent, multi-sensing, network-connected, energy-saving device for adoption into the home in an easy, pleasant, seamless, and user-friendly manner.

- FETs in the switching circuitry allows for active power stealing, i.e., taking power during the HVAC ON cycle, by briefly diverting power from the HVAC relay circuit to the reservoir capacitors for a very small interval, such as 100 micro-seconds. This time is small enough not to trip the HVAC relay into the OFF state but is sufficient to charge up the reservoir capacitors.
- the use of FETs allows for this fast switching time (100 micro-seconds), which would be difficult to achieve using relays (which stay on for tens of milliseconds). Also, such relays would readily degrade with fast switching, and they would also make audible noise. In contrast, the FETS operate with essentially no audible noise.
- a combined temperature/humidity sensor module 3112 such as a Sensirion SHT21 module, is additionally provided.
- the backplate microcontroller 3102 performs polling of the various sensors, sensing for mechanical wire insertion at installation, alerting the head unit regarding current vs. setpoint temperature conditions and actuating the switches accordingly, and other functions such as looking for appropriate signal on the inserted wire at installation.
- control strategies are chosen by an intelligent thermostat to achieve a change in temperature corresponding to a setpoint change within a maximum response time in as energy efficient, least costly, or, commonly, both energy efficient and least costly manner as possible.
- cost of operating a heat pump is a, where a is expressed in units of money per time or energy-usage per time
- cost of operating an AUX is b
- the ratio a/b is low, or, in other words, when it is substantially less costly to operate the heat pump than the AUX, then it may often be the case that the total time of heat pump and/or AUX operation for a cost effective control strategy is greater than the total time of heat pump and/or AUX operation for a less cost effective control strategy.
- a/b is 1 ⁇ 4
- a first control strategy that operates the heat pump alone for 120 minutes has a cost significantly less than a second control
- FIGS. 32A-B illustrate a problem domain related to intelligent-thermostat control of heat pumps and how the above discussed intelligent-controller monitoring and adjustment methods are applied to that problem domain in one intelligent-thermostat implementation.
- FIG. 32A shows a plot 3202 of a first setpoint change 3204 within a control schedule, using illustration conventions used previously in FIGS. 11A , 12 A-G, and 18 .
- a thermostat might immediately invoke the auxiliary heating unit (“AUX”), at decision point 3206 , generating response 3208 which carries out the setpoint change within a predetermined response time 3210 .
- AUX auxiliary heating unit
- the heat pump represents a first system, often referred to as the “compressor,” and the AUX represents a second system.
- the P highLockout for the AUX is often referred to as “AUX lockout.”
- the response time includes an initial period of AUX heating 3214 followed by spare time 3216 during which maintenance heating occurs. This spare time was available for carrying out the setpoint change, but is unused, resulting is use of costly AUX heating for the entire setpoint change.
- the period of time for costly operation 3218 is shown labeled b, using the cost notation discussed above.
- FIG. 32A also shows a plot 3220 of a second setpoint change within a control schedule.
- the AUX is not initially used, in the initial determination 3222 , and a shallow-sloped initial response results 3224 .
- the thermostat switches to AUX heating, resulting in a steep, final response 3226 .
- the response time includes an initial heat-pump interval 3228 , an AUX interval 3230 , and a spare-time interval 3232 .
- the spare time interval represents time that was available for slower, more energy-efficient heating.
- the costs 3224 and 3236 are illustrated as in plot 3202 .
- FIG. 32B shows a plot 3240 of a third setpoint change within a control schedule.
- the intelligent-controller monitoring and adjustment methods have been incorporated into an intelligent thermostat.
- the intelligent thermostat carefully considers information, such as that described with reference to FIGS. 19A-D , and initially determines 3242 that the heat pump can be initially employed alone, resulting in initial response 3244 .
- the intelligent thermostat determines 3246 that AUX heating is needed, and deploys the AUX, resulting in a final steep response 3228 .
- the AUX may not be needed at all. However, even when needed, the intelligent controller, armed with the information discussed above with reference to FIGS.
- 19A-D and able to closely monitor progress towards the setpoint temperature employs a control strategy that results in a long initial heat-pump interval 3230 , a very short AUX interval, and no spare time, as in the examples shown in FIG. 32A .
- a/b is a relative low value, well below 1
- the longer response time of the control strategy shown in FIG. 32B may represent the least costly of the three strategies shown in FIGS. 32A and 32B .
- the above-described intelligent-controller monitoring and adjustment methods can be used to make use of the available maximum response time in order to employ control strategies that take more time, but end up costing less than control strategies that fail to employ all of the maximum response time available.
- FIG. 33 illustrates night-time-temperature economization.
- the setpoint represents a first, early morning setpoint.
- the intelligent controller may end up using an initial heat-pump interval 3304 followed by an AUX-heating period 3306 .
- the intelligent controller can use only heat-pump heating 3310 to carry out the setpoint change within a maximum response time.
- FIG. 34 illustrates example responses for setpoint changes obtained by an intelligent controller for different auto-component-configuration levels.
- either the heat pump is operated alone or the AUX is operated alone.
- both the heat pump and AUX may be operated together, and therefore the costs labeled b in the figures would be replaced by a cost labeled a+b.
- FIG. 34 shows three setpoint diagrams 3402 - 3404 for responses following a setpoint with auto-component-configuration levels max savings, balance, and max comfort, respectively.
- a temperature change from initial temperature 3406 to final temperature 3408 is specified by setpoint change 3410 .
- the intelligent controller initially determines 3412 to use only the heat pump, resulting in response 3414 , since, for the max-savings auto-component-configuration level, the maximum response time 3415 and pre-heating 3416 intervals are relatively long, as a result of which the heat pump can be used, without any AUX heating, to carry out the setpoint change. Whether or not AUX heating is needed depends on the outside temperature and other factors, but the maximum response time is sufficiently long to minimize AUX usage. Thus, in the max-savings mode, the heat-pump is used in both a pre-heating mode 3412 and the remaining response time 3418 , resulting in a heat-pump-only operational cost 3420 .
- the intelligent controller initially determines 3422 to use only the heat pump, resulting in response 3423 , but then decides 3424 that AUX is needed, and deploys AUX to produce a steeper response curve 3425 . This is necessary due to shorter max response 3426 and pre-heating 3427 intervals.
- the remaining response time is divided between heat-pump heating 3428 and AUX heating 3429 , with operational costs 3432 and 3434 . Again, under certain conditions, no AUX heating would be used, and, under other conditions, only AUX heating might be used.
- FIG. 34 are provided in the context of an outside temperature and other condition when the need for AUX heating depends on the maximum response time.
- the intelligent controller initially determines 3436 to use only AUX, resulting in response 3438 , because of the much shorter max-response-time 3440 and pre-heating 3443 intervals.
- the remaining response time is entirely AUX heating 3429 , with operational cost 3446 .
- FIG. 35 illustrates steps for automated system matching that are carried out by an intelligent thermostat. It has been found particularly desirable to make thermostat setup and governance as user-friendly as possible by judiciously automating the selection of which among a variety of available energy-saving and comfort-promoting control algorithms are appropriate for the particular HVAC configuration of the home in which the thermostat is installed.
- the HVAC system features available for control by the thermostat are determined by virtue of at least one of (i) automated wire insertion detection, (ii) interactive user interview, (iii) automated inferences or deductions based on automated trial runs of the HVAC system at or near the time of thermostat installation, and (iv) automated inferences or deductions based on observed system behaviors or performance.
- a smart radiant control feature for heating mode operation is enabled.
- a smart radiant control feature is described in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13/632,152, filed even date herewith and entitled, “Radiant Heating Controls and Methods for an Environmental Control System”, which is incorporated by reference herein, in certain implementations, the smart radiant control feature is configured to monitor radiant heating cycles on an ongoing basis, compute an estimated thermal model of the home as heated by the radiant system, and predictively control the radiant system in a manner that takes into account the thermal model of the house, the time of day, and the previous heat cycle information.
- the smart radiant control feature is configured to achieve comfortable maintenance band temperatures while also minimizing frequent changes in HVAC on/off states and minimizing HVAC energy consumption. Among other advantages, uncomfortable and energy-wasting target temperature overshoots are avoided.
- a smart radiant control feature for heating mode operation is enabled.
- a smart radiant control feature is described in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13/632,150, filed even date herewith and entitled, “Radiant Heating Controls and Methods for an Environmental Control System”, which is incorporated by reference herein.
- the smart radiant control feature is configured to monitor radiant heating cycles on an ongoing basis, compute an estimated thermal model of the home as heated by the radiant system, and predictively control the radiant system in a manner that takes into account the thermal model of the house, the time of day, and the previous heat cycle information.
- the smart radiant control feature is configured to achieve comfortable maintenance band temperatures while also minimizing frequent changes in HVAC on/off states and minimizing HVAC energy consumption. Among other advantages, uncomfortable and energy-wasting target temperature overshoots are avoided.
- auxiliary resistive electrical heating i.e., so-called auxiliary or AUX heat
- the thermostat is network-connected (such that it can receive outside temperature information based on location data and an internet-based temperature information source) or otherwise has access to outside temperature information (such as by wired or wireless connection to an outside temperature sensor)
- a smart heat pump control feature is enabled.
- a smart preconditioning feature for heat mode is enabled, which can be a similar or identical opposing counterpart to the preconditioning feature for cooling mode discussed above with respect to step 9806 .
- the smart heat pump control feature of step 3516 is not enabled and instead the smart preconditioning feature of step 3514 is enabled.
- the smart heat pump control feature is configured to monitor heat pump heating cycles on an ongoing basis, tracking how fast the home is heated (for example, in units of degrees F per hour) by the heat pump compressor alone in view of the associated outside air temperatures.
- the smart heat pump control feature Based on computed correlations between effective heating rates and outside air temperatures, and further including a user preference setting in a range from “Max Comfort” to “Max Savings” (including a “Balanced” selection in between these end points), the smart heat pump control feature judiciously activates the AUX heating function in a manner that achieves an appropriate balance between user comfort and AUX heating costs.
- the factors affecting the judicious invocation of AUX heat include (i) a predicted amount of time needed for the heat pump alone to achieve the current temperature setpoint, (ii) whether the current temperature setpoint resulted from an immediate user control input versus whether it was a scheduled temperature setpoint, and (iii) the particular selected user preference within the “Max Comfort” to “Max Savings” range.
- the AUX function determination will be more favorable to invoking AUX heat as the compressor-alone time estimate increases, more favorable to invoking AUX heat for immediate user control inputs versus scheduled setpoints, and more favorable to invoking AUX heat for “Max Comfort” directed preferences than for “Max Savings” directed preferences.
- the smart heat pump control feature further provides for automated adjustment of a so-called AUX lockout temperature, which corresponds to an outside air temperature above which the AUX heat will never be turned on, based on the monitored heat pump heating cycle information and the user preference between “Max Comfort” and “Max Savings.”
- AUX lockout temperatures will be lower (leading to less AUX usage) for better-performing heat pumps, and will also be lower (leading to less AUX usage) as the user preference tends toward “Max Savings”.
- the smart heat pump control feature further provides for night time temperature economization in which an overnight setpoint temperature may be raised higher than a normally scheduled overnight setpoint if, based on the overnight temperature forecast, the AUX function would be required to reach a morning setpoint temperature from the normal overnight setpoint temperature when morning comes. In such situations, even though the overnight temperature inside the home is made higher it would otherwise be, the user actually saves energy and money by avoiding the use of the AUX function when morning comes.
- the determinations made at one or more of steps 3508 and 3510 can be based on automatically observed HVAC system performance information rather than specific system identification information. For example, it may be the case that a particular heating functionality of an HVAC system is not physically a radiant system, but nevertheless tends to exhibit signs of a high thermal mass combined with substantial control lag, making it similar in nature to a radiant heating system. For such cases, the smart radiant control feature may be enabled to improve performance.
- the HVAC system has a heat pump with AUX functionality, but it may have a two-stage heating functionality in which the first stage (which type was likely chosen as a first stage because it was more cost-effective) tends to be very slow or “fall behind” at lower outside temperatures, and in which the second stage (which type was likely chosen as a second stage because it was less cost-effective) tends to be very time-effective in heating up the home, thus making the system act very much like a heat pump system with AUX functionality.
- the smart heat pump control feature may be enabled to improve performance.
- FIGS. 36A-C illustrate an example auto-component-configuration-level-selection interface for an intelligent thermostat.
- the heat pump balance feature is not check marked in a feature-selection display.
- a user can invoke selection, via input to the intelligent-thermostat input interface, resulting in display of a heat-pump-balance-selection, or auto-component-configuration-level-selection interface, shown in FIG. 36B .
- Selection of an auto-component-configuration-level then returns to the feature-selection display, with the heat-pump balance feature now checked.
- FIG. 37 shows a settings display for an intelligent thermostat. Indications are provided, in the display, for whether or not various features are activated.
- FIGS. 38A-C illustrate additional types of information that an intelligent thermostat can obtain, and provide to users or employ during control operations.
- FIG. 38A shows an actual plot 3800 of heat-pump data points 3802 and a best-fit ⁇ T/ ⁇ t versus T curve 3804 for a heat pump, referred to as a heat-pump-rate curve (“HPR”). The data points are collected, as discussed above, over time by an intelligent thermostat during heat-pump operation when AUX is not operational.
- HPR heat-pump-rate curve
- 38B shows a plot 3804 of heat-pump data points and a best-fit HPR, collected by an intelligent thermostat during heat-pump operation when AUX is not operational, for a heat pump that exhibits outlier data points 3808 near the freezing point that indicate inefficient heat-pump operation due to accumulation of precipitation, such as frost, on internal heat-pump components.
- Certain heat pumps include logic for detection of the accumulation of precipitation, and take remedial actions to remove the precipitation. For example, the heat-pump logic may reverse heat-pump operation, temporarily, extracting heat from a residence in order to heat the heat-pump components with accumulated precipitation and remove the precipitation, followed by again reversing operation to continue heating the residence.
- AUX heating may be invoked by heat-pump logic in order to prevent cooling the residence.
- the detection and amelioration of the accumulation of precipitation is carried out internally, within the heat pump.
- an intelligent thermostat continuously, intermittently, or periodically monitors heat-pump operation and collects ⁇ T/ ⁇ t versus T data
- an intelligent controller is able to analyze the collected ⁇ T/ ⁇ t versus T data and detect outlier data points near the freezing point, and thus determine the precipitation accumulation characteristics of the heat pump.
- the intelligent thermostat can often consider many more factors than the internal heat-pump precipitation-accumulation logic, and therefore far better characterize the precipitation accumulation characteristics of the heat pump.
- the intelligent controller can combine this information with many additional types of information to create sophisticated control strategies for ameliorating precipitation accumulation.
- FIG. 38C illustrates another plot 3810 of a set of HPR heat-pump data points and a best-fit ⁇ T/ ⁇ t versus T curve 3812 for a heat pump.
- the critical temperature 3814 discussed above with reference to FIG. 16 , at which the ⁇ T/ ⁇ t for the heat pump becomes negative, is nearly 50° F. This critical temperature is much higher than would be expected for a properly functioning heat pump, and is indicative of a poorly operating or essentially inoperable heat pump. Often, residents fail to notice inoperable or poorly operating heat pumps, because the AUX is generally routinely activated when the heat pump fails to heat residential environments.
- An intelligent thermostat that continuously, intermittently, or periodically monitors heat-pump operation and collects ⁇ T/ ⁇ t versus T data can easily detect such problems and report them to users, utility companies, and other entities so that the heat pump can be repaired and the residence or other controlled environment can be then heated efficiently.
- FIG. 39 provides an example configuration of the response-time monitoring methods used in one implementation of an intelligent thermostat. This figure is provided simply as an example of certain parameters used in one example implementation, but does not apply generally to all implementations.
- each column 3902 - 3905 represents the control logic that transpires for each of four different auto-component-activation levels, including max savings, balanced, max conform, and off.
- Many of the parameters are derived from a ⁇ P/ ⁇ t versus P data, described above with reference to FIG. 16 , for the heat pump controlled by the intelligent controller.
- the HPR curve is, for heat pumps, a definitive system characteristic that allows for determination of the various parameters for the response-time-monitoring techniques used by one type of intelligent thermostat.
- FIG. 32 each column 3902 - 3905 represents the control logic that transpires for each of four different auto-component-activation levels, including max savings, balanced, max conform, and off.
- Many of the parameters are derived from a ⁇ P/ ⁇ t versus P data, described above with reference
- row 39 each row of the table, below the top row, describes the operational parameters for various functionalities related to response-time monitoring.
- row 3910 discusses how the auxiliary-heating-system P highLockout is determined for the various auto-component-activation levels. As indicated in the figure, there is a default P highLockout that is overridden when an HPR is available, with the P highLockout set to a temperature at which the ⁇ T/ ⁇ t is above a threshold value, such as 1° F./hour. Different thresholds are used for different auto-component-configuration levels.
- Row 3912 discusses whether night-time temperature economizing is deployed for each of the auto-component-activation levels.
- Night-time temperature economization refers to adjusting a control schedule for nighttime hours so that, in the morning, at a first scheduled setpoint change, the estimated response time will not be of sufficient length to result in use of the auxiliary heating system.
- This feature is deployed only when access to weather forecasts or other types of weather information are available, and thus is turned off when, for example, WiFi is unavailable to an intelligent thermostat which relies on WiFi to access such information.
- use of the HPR and response-monitoring techniques discussed above with reference to FIGS. 20-22E , can inform the intelligent controller of potential control-schedule adjustments that can result in more economical overall environmental control.
- Rows 3914 and 3916 describe a heuristic according to which the auxiliary heating unit is activated when estimated response times exceed threshold values.
- Row 3914 discusses activation of the auxiliary heating unit for response times following immediate-control inputs and row 3916 shows heuristics for response times following scheduled setpoint changes.
- the thresholds for activating AUX are lower for immediate-control inputs than for scheduled setpoint changes, since users generally expect faster response for manually input setpoint changes.
- t2T time-to-temperature
- the AUX is activated, while, for scheduled setpoint changes, the threshold is twice as long, or 120 minutes.
- Row 3918 indicates whether a pre-heating feature is deployed by various auto-component-activation levels. Pre-heating is activation of the heat pump prior to a scheduled setpoint change.
- pre-heating When pre-heating is deployed, it may be the case that a more efficient heat pump can be used for larger ⁇ t changes because the total response time distributed over an initial pre-heating period prior to the scheduled setpoint change as well as a period of time following the scheduled setpoint change.
- the scheduled setpoint change indicates a point in time that a user desires the temperature to rise
- pre-heating allows for use of the heat pump, with a shallower P-response curve, rather than employing auxiliary heating at the time corresponding to the scheduled setpoint change.
- response-time monitoring and system-rescheduling techniques employed by intelligent controllers may be implemented in many different ways by changing any of many different design and implementation parameters, including programming language, hardware platforms, logic types, control structures, data structures, modular organization, operating systems, and other such parameters.
- an intelligent controller may use information about the environment, information about system performance and system health, information about the controlled environment, and many additional types of information. For example, were the intelligent controller to know that the windows of a controlled environment are open and that the heating efficiency of the systems used to the controlled environment are therefore necessarily significantly less, under these circumstances, the intelligent controller may select a different system or combination of systems to activate in order to achieve a desired temperature change.
Abstract
Description
is plotted in
A fit value for the curve with respect to the observed data can be computed by summing all of the discrepancies for all of the data points, as follows:
Were all of the data points to fall along the model curve, the fit value would be 0. As the observed data departs further from the model curve, the fit value increases.
ΔP=mt−mt unstable
where m is the slope of the straight-line portion and is the single constant for the model. As shown in
ΔP=mtc.
Another portion of the P-response curve within dashed
cost=a×(time during which heat pump is operational)+b×(time during which AUX is operational)+(a+b)×(time during which both heat pump and AUX are operational)
When the ratio a/b is low, or, in other words, when it is substantially less costly to operate the heat pump than the AUX, then it may often be the case that the total time of heat pump and/or AUX operation for a cost effective control strategy is greater than the total time of heat pump and/or AUX operation for a less cost effective control strategy. For example, when a/b is ¼, a first control strategy that operates the heat pump alone for 120 minutes has a cost significantly less than a second control strategy that operates the heat pump alone for 60 minutes and the heat pump and AUX together for 30 minutes:
Thus, it may be less costly to employ a control strategy that takes longer to carry out a setpoint change, and an intelligent controller can make a determination as to the relative cost efficiency of control strategies knowing only the ratios of costs of operation, even when the absolute costs of operation are unavailable.
