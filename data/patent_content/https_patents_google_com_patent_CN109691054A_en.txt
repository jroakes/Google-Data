Deng), indicate the name of association user or the voice command of identifier etc..
In some embodiments, the user identifier of description can be displayed on the graphics environment shown by the first equipment
Or on the main screen or background of operating system.For example, more than one user identifier can be shown on the home screen, side
Just user's selection is to initiate to call.
Some embodiments can be shown in any list that can choose target user, menu or other groupings
The user identifier of description.For example, if the user desired that social group is formed in network service, then include in this group can
The list of the user of energy is (for example, the existing social group based on the first user, the previous communication etc. provided by the first equipment
Deng) list of user identifier can be shown as.First user can choose the user that the user of social group is included into expectation
Identifier.Similarly, if the first user sends electronic information (for example, Email or instant message), for this
The user identifier of the possible recipient user of message can be shown in a menu, be selected for the first user.
In some embodiments, the user identifier of description can also be shown so that association user to be expressed as and equipment
The specific content of upper display or the user of data correlation or promoter.For example, if the first equipment is exhaled from second user reception
It is request (for example, for video calling, voice communication, text chat etc.), then user identifier can be displayed on
In one equipment, to indicate that who is sending call requests to the first equipment.In another example, network is passed through by second user
Share to the first equipment image can with the user identifier of second user associatedly (for example, neighbouring) visual display, because
This indicates that who shares the image.In calendar or list of thing, user identifier can be with event correlation (for example, neighbouring

It has been shown that, for example to indicate that who writes, commenting, delivering, modification or otherwise content and user content are closed
Connection.
User identifier is shown in the electronic message delivery communication interface that some embodiments can be shown on the first device
Symbol.For example, in the case where user may have delay to respond, in the asynchronous text chat or Email with second user
In process, for example, by the beginning of each text manuscript from second user or at the end of show user identifier, merely
Each entry of the text (either image) from second user or manuscript can be with the use of second user in it or process
The association of family identifier.User identifier can similarly be displayed on video calling, in chat or meeting, to indicate not yet real
The user of existing video source.It is shown for example, user identifier can replace video source.Additional function can also use user
Identifier indicates second user in the user interface of display.
Some embodiments can choose and show the single image of the motion segments of user identifier (for example, movement
First image of segment, last image, the highest partial image of motion segments, for example, having is more than certain threshold as described in Fig. 3
First image of the motion segments of the score of value, etc.).In some instances, it is undesirable that animation is shown, then can show
Show the selected single image (for example, some examples described as follows for Fig. 5-8) of motion segments.In another example, exist
Under more than one specified conditions, single image can be shown to indicate user over the display.For example, for example, it is this
Condition may include the association user talked during video communication so that the animation of motion segments will not with used in video communication
Family is obscured or asynchronous if saying.
Fig. 3 is the flow chart of illustrated example method 300, to select the figure for including in the motion segments for user identifier
The set of picture.For example, method 300 can be used at least part of the box 212 of Fig. 2.Other methods can be alternatively used for
Box 212.
In box 302, a group multiple images are selected from a part of received storage image as video calling, are deposited
Storage image is, for example, the image stored in the box 210 of Fig. 2.Group of pictures can be any storage in various embodiments
Image.For example, in some embodiments, all images of the slave video calling storage in box 210 may be embodied in image
In group.In one example, the storage figure is stored at the initial stage of video calling (for example, several seconds, such as 5 seconds, 8 seconds etc. initial)
Picture, and all images at initial stage are selected in group of pictures.In some embodiments, the subset for storing image is provided at
In group of pictures, for example, the subset of storage image is less than all storage images of box 210.For example, storage image may come from
Initial 30 seconds of video calling, and the group of pictures selected can only include initial 8 seconds images from video calling.
In box 304, in order to select the set of the image for motion segments, it is determined whether further progress assessment.
In some embodiments, the group of pictures selected in box 302 is used as the image collection in motion segments, such as the box of figure
212 descriptions, and do not need further to assess.It in some embodiments, is image in the group of pictures that box 302 selects
Superset, from the superset of the image selection image subset, and the subset of image be used as motion segments in image set.
In some embodiments, agree to if having obtained suitable user, the use based on user's input, storage
The guidance of family preference, default setting, and/or other storages, may determine whether further to be assessed.Some embodiments
By making the special characteristic of systems inspection group of pictures and/or video calling, may determine whether further to be assessed.Example
Such as, if group of pictures describes the content type that particular detection arrives, or the content type lacked, then can indicate to assess.?
In one example, if system not the more than one image of selected group of pictures (for example, initially certain amount of image or
Within the initial specific several seconds) in detect face, then can indicate further to be assessed, and if detecting face,
So assessment can be omitted.Other conditions can also be detected, for example, if video calling is related to more than one specific user
(for example, contact person's indicator that specific user may prefer to assess them), local storage are limited (for example, assessment can be with
Less stored with more relevant images for motion segments selection), during video calling network connection be can not
Lean on (instruction assessment is needed to be ensured to be the motion segments and select suitable frame, for example, showing stable animation and not
Lack frame or almost without frame is lacked, there is clarity, resolution ratio, pixelation or other features for meeting specific threshold etc.
Deng) and/or other conditions may indicate whether assessment group of pictures.
If method proceeds to box 305 without further assessing, selected in box 305, box 302
Group of pictures be provided as the set of the image in the motion segments as described in the box 212 of Fig. 2.As described below, then square
Method proceeds to box 314.
If this method proceeds to box 306, in box as what is determined in box 304 will further be assessed
306, from the candidate collection of group of pictures selection multiple images.The image candidate set selected can be the particular sequence of image,
For example, the specific duration when consecutive image is shown, certain amount of image etc..In some instances, image
Candidate collection can be the continuous image subset of group of pictures.
In block 308, the image candidate set selected is assessed, using true as candidate collection based on more than one standard
Determine score (for example, overall score).The score can based on one in various types of features of image candidate set with
On feature.In some embodiments, each type of feature can provide the individual of own based on image candidate set
Score, and the individual score from different types of feature can be combined (for example, being summed), to be image candidate collection
It closes and gross score is provided.In some embodiments, different for example, based on the priority for being previously allocated to certain types of feature
The feature of type can be differently weighed in gross score.
For example, a type of feature can be the type of content characteristic.For example, can be associated with better score
Certain types of content characteristic check image, for example, being considered the content characteristic that more expectation is used for user identifier.Some
In example, the content characteristic of such as face can have score more better than other content feature, and other content feature is, for example,
Have a tree, road, vehicle, object or other there is no the landscape of the scene of face.It is, for example, possible to use image detecting technique, examples
Such as, in order to which facial characteristics carrys out check image using machine learning techniques, to detect whether face is depicted in the picture, face is special
Levy all mouthes in this way, nose, eyes etc..If obtaining agreement from second user identifies second to carry out face detection
User, then system can check whether the face described in the picture is second user, for example, checking second user
Know facial characteristics.If the face described is not second user, describing those of that face image can't (example
Such as, same highland) score, because user identifier will be associated with second user.In some embodiments, describe with multiple
The score of the image of the scene (for example, group photo) of face can be than describing the image difference of single face, because user identifier can
It can be used to indicate that single user.In some embodiments, user identifier can indicate a group user (for example, in user
The user group of multiple users is indicated in interface), and in this case, the score for describing the image of multiple faces can be than retouching
The image for drawing single face is more preferable.
In some embodiments, special characteristic can be checked for a type of content characteristic.In some instances, it examines
The face measured can be examined for direction or angle direction, for example, whether face is positive specific uncommon in display face
Within the angular range of prestige.In some embodiments, whether the face detected can be checked to determine face in image
Boundary within specific dimensions within the scope of, for example, whether face too small or too big (other embodiments can ignore face
The size of portion and other features, and adjustable image, so as to as described below, for the motion segments as user identifier
Desired size is described in display).It can be based on specific facial characteristics, be facial expression or the face that emotion inspection detects
Portion, specific facial characteristics include to smile, and are frowned, and indignation is taken aback, surprised, neutral emotion etc., such as based on the face detected
The shape of feature being detected and interval, the facial characteristics detected include mouth, eyes, the inclination on head etc..One
In a little examples, smiling face can be than frowning or better (for example, higher) score is matched in the face part of indignation.It can be that may be
The face that less desired other conditions inspection detects, for example, the eyes of face are the threshold amount of time that closed, for example, face
The eyes in portion are to closed to lead to poor (for example, lower) score.In some instances, system can with check image boundary it
Whether the position of interior content characteristic, such as the face detected or other objects are placed in the middle within image (for example, providing more
Good score), or whether it is biased to one side (for example, leading to poor score) of image-region.
It in some embodiments, can be cycle specificity check image, and the candidate collection of image can be according to spy
Sign carrys out score.How cycle specificity may include based on the animation for image candidate set smoothly from the final of fragment sequence
Image is shown to the feature of the first image of fragment sequence.For example, if the last frame of image candidate set is (or last several
Frame) it is very similar to first frame (or former frames) of candidate collection, then when image candidate set is from its final image
When being circulated back to its start image, by not big incoherence or jump in the movement of the feature of display or position
Jump.In some instances, box 308 can be with check image candidate collection, so as to for example using more than one image similarity
Measuring technique, determine first in candidate collection and last image whether be more than threshold difference in their pixel content.
If it is less than threshold difference, then specific periodic fraction can be assigned to candidate collection, or the class between these images
Candidate collection can be assigned to like the periodic fraction for spending proportional.In some instances, more than one feature is (for example, face
Portion, object or other features) it can be detected in image candidate set, the phase is continuously displayed in image candidate set
Between, Boundary Moving of the more than one feature relative to image, and the similar degree of the position of the feature within image boundary can
To be examined between the last image and the first image in candidate collection, and the score based on the similar degree.
It, can be in order to the more than one pixel of the image with specific score correlations in further example
Visual pattern feature, check image.For example, visual pattern feature may include brightness, saturation degree, contrast, fuzziness or
Acutance, color noise, colour cast, shade, bloom etc..In some embodiments, for the specific threshold of these visual characteristics
Value and/or value can be with specific score correlations.Such as the image of subset is fuzzyyer, it is poorer for the score of visual characteristic.
Some embodiments can provide individual visual characteristic score for examined each type of visual characteristic, for example, fuzziness
Score, brightness score etc..For example, individual visual characteristic score can be combined to provide total or overall visual signature
Score.
In some embodiments, the visual characteristic of candidate collection may include one detected in image candidate set
The amount of exercise of above characteristics of image.For example, if the side of the head of the user detected from frame boundaries mobile (example significantly
Such as, more than the threshold percentage of threshold angle range or picture size perhaps region) to the other side and/or locally or complete
It is moved to except frame boundaries entirely, then this amount of exercise may be that less expectation is made into user identifier.In one example,
Poor score can be assigned to the candidate collection more with the movement than other candidate collections, in other candidate collections,
The head of user all less moves from beginning to end in image sequence.In another example, the visual characteristic of candidate collection can be with
Deflection or undesirable rotation including the content described in image candidate set relative to desired reference direction.Example
Such as, the line detected or edge of the depicted features of the specific direction based on instruction content are (for example, using Image Edge-Detection
Technology), it can determine rotation of the picture material relative to desired horizontal reference direction (for example, horizon).Deflection turns
Dynamic bigger, the score that can be assigned is poorer.
In some instances, the user preference of second user is (on the first device if obtain the agreement of second user
Obtain), the user preference of the first user, and/or inputted in response to the user of display reminding, some candidate collections can be made special
Differently score is levied, is either assigned and assesses different weights from standard or default feature.For example, second user (and/or the
One user) there may be preference for describing the motion segments that second user is not smiled, and examined via more than one face
Survey technology, system can determine whether user is smiling in the more than one image in selected image candidate set, with
Corresponding poor score is just provided.In another example, user may have the emotion of the face in display motion segments to become
The preference of change, for example, from frowning smile or vice versa.The various user preferences of specific user can be related to indicating those
The user identifier of user, and/or can be related to indicating the user identifier of other users, other users are, for example, designated user
And/or all users.
In some embodiments, system can determine the individual images point for each individual images of candidate collection
Number, and individual images score is combined, to determine the gross score for being used for the image candidate set.As described above, some
Embodiment can determine individual score for the feature of each type, wherein for each image of candidate collection, this individual
Score is determined differently.It can be combined for the individual score of the feature of each type of each image of candidate collection,
To provide the gross score for being used for candidate collection.Some embodiments can determine found among the image of candidate collection it is worst
Image score (perhaps optimized image score) and using that is worst (or best) image score distributes to candidate collection as
Gross score (or gross score as the specific type feature for image candidate set).In some embodiments, if
That worst image score is rendered for the image of the number of thresholds of candidate collection, then worst image score can be assigned
As total candidate collection score.Other score technologies can alternatively or additionally be used.
In box 310, it is determined whether there is the additional candidate set to be assessed.In some embodiments, it can choose another
One candidate collection, another candidate collection include that there are no the more than one images being evaluated in selected group of pictures.Example
Such as, the candidate collection just assessed may have ten images for including, and another candidate collection can be selected with
Ten images of image (or certain amount of image) are shifted in the sequence of group of pictures forward.In some embodiments
In, can be selected from group of pictures with the entirely different image candidate set of the candidate collection of previous evaluation, for example, candidate collection
In all images be evaluated not yet.Some embodiments can determine which figure in the image candidate set of previous evaluation
Seem the individual images of worst score, and can never including those worst score images group of pictures in select new image
Candidate collection, for example, in the sequence of group of pictures fully forward or shifts backward image candidate set, so that worst score
Image except new candidate collection.Some embodiments can keep the image of standard number in selected candidate collection,
For example, all candidate collections have certain amount of image, while other embodiments can be selected for different candidate collections
The image of different number is selected, for example, within specified range of the instruction for the image of the minimum and maximum quantity of candidate collection.
If there is more image candidate set are to be evaluated, then box 306 is returned to, to be used for from group of pictures selection
The different image candidate set of assessment.If to assess without other image candidate set (for example, if the candidate of assessment
The quantity of set is equal to particular maximum value, if all images of group of pictures have been evaluated, if the specific combination of image is
Through evaluated etc.), then this method proceeds to box 312.
In box 312, the image candidate set with best score is selected as the image collection for motion segments.
In some instances, best score can be best (for example, highest) gross score of specific image candidate collection, wherein total score
Number may include the contribution of the individual score from candidate collection in example as described above.In some embodiments, right
Score, and the feature based on more than one type as described above are not provided in the different image candidate set assessed
As a result, image candidate set can be compared directly.For example, if cycle specificity is used to select image candidate set,
The similar degree between first and last image in different image candidate set can be determined and compare, so that in the first He
The image candidate set with most similar degrees is selected for use in the image collection of motion segments between last image.
In box 314, in some embodiments, being particularly shown setting for motion segments can be defined.One
In a little examples, display setting may include that the display rate (for example, frame rate) of each image of motion segments or display are held
The continuous time.For example, if the target time duration of motion segments is constant (for example, 5 seconds, 10 seconds etc.), then movement piece
The display rate of section can be adjusted to each image special time amount in display motion segments, to obtain the motion segments
Target time duration.As described above, when different displays can be arranged persistently in some embodiments for the different images in segment
Between, for example, with acceleration or the specific part of retarded motion segment.In some embodiments, motion segments can be designated
As shuttling movement segment or non-cyclic motion segment.After the last image of display motion segments, shuttling movement piece
Section restarts its display in the first image of motion segments.It so, it is possible to obtain and save meter by storing less frame
Calculate the technical effect that resource still realizes continuous animation effect simultaneously.It is non-to follow after the last image of display motion segments
Ring motion segments stop the image of display variation.For example, after a stop, non-cyclic motion segment can continuously be shown finally
Image, the first image or other storage images (for example, in user preference specify).Such as when motion segments are by equipment
When new display, the loop number of execution can also be specified for the motion segments by motion segments.For example, a circulation, special
The circulation of fixed number amount, or the continuous circulation not stopped can be specified for the motion segments in display setting.
In block 316, in some embodiments, one of the more than one image in motion segments can be modified
Above pixel and/or more than one image can be added to motion segments (and/or cutting from motion segments).For example,
If the face described in more than one image is found lower than threshold size (for example, during assessment of box 308), that
The more than one perimeter of the encirclement face of image can be trimmed to about, so that face occupies the biggish of trimmed image
Region.If it find that face or other objects deviate the center of image, then image can be trimmed to keep face placed in the middle.?
In some embodiments, the user identifier for the first equipment can have predetermined size and/or shape.Adjustable movement
The size and shape (for example, image resolution ratio, boundary dimensions, aspect ratio etc.) of the image of segment, to be suitble to user identifier
Requirement.Alternatively, such as when using Graphics overlay layer of undesirable part of covering image etc. to show image, one
The modification of a the above type can be made by user interface.
In some embodiments, brightness, contrast, tone, fuzziness/acutance, and/or other vision figures can be passed through
The more than one image of motion segments is modified as the variation in feature.In some embodiments, visual effect can be by
It is added to the more than one image of motion segments.For example, when the image sequence of motion segments starts and/or when the sequence ends
Visual effect can be added.Some examples of visual effect include image gradually brighten for white perhaps other light tones or
Dimmed is black or other are dark-coloured, for example, fading effect.If the display of the set of consecutive image from last image cycle to
First image, then fading effect or variant effect can make the transition for returning to the first image from the last image of sequence flat
It is sliding.Such as by least partially mixing these images, can create from the last image of motion segments to the of motion segments
The desalination or variant effect of one image.In some embodiments, if first is similar in mutual threshold value with last image
Within degree, then fading effect or variant effect can be provided.
Additional image can be added to motion segments by some embodiments.For example, more than one new image can be with
It is created and is added to the sequence, to facilitate visual effect as described above.Some embodiments pass through duplication motion segments
More than one image and the ends of motion segments is added them to opposite sequence order, Xiang Qianxiang can be provided
Circulation afterwards.This makes the movement described in image sequence in a manner of one or direction is mobile, then in the opposite manner or
Person direction is mobile, for example, in motion segments from the variation that travels forward to move backward when after.Because of first and last frame
Can be it is identical, so this can be provided in the circulating cycle from the last frame of segment to the stable and continuous mistake of first frame
It crosses.
Some embodiments can add the image to motion segments as interpolated image, for example, in the sequence of motion segments
The more than one image provided between two adjacent images in column.For example, interpolated image can with rendered object, face or
The position of other characteristics or state are being created between the position of characteristic those of in two adjacent images using interpositioning
The position or state.In some instances, this interpolation can provide stable movement, for example, if the original of motion segments
Beginning adjacent image depicts the big discontinuity in movement.Interpolated image can be added to motion segments by some embodiments
Therefore end or starting point to provide the biggish similar degree between first frame and last frame, and provide more for circulation animation
Big adaptability.
Fig. 4 is the flow chart for illustrating the exemplary method 400 for the user identifier that motion segments are distributed to user.For example,
Method 400 can be used for the box 214 of Fig. 2, wherein the motion segments of formation are assigned to the user identifier of second user.
Other methods can alternatively be used for box 212.
In box 402, check whether the motion segments (for example, the motion segments being newly created) of formation are automatically assigned
To the user identifier of second user.For example, in some embodiments, the motion segments of formation can always be assigned to use
The user identifier at family.In some embodiments, this can be is controlled by the user preference of the first user and/or second user
Option (for example, such preference can be received in association with video calling, or as user agrees to, in server or
Such preference is accessed in other equipment).In some embodiments, other conditions can be checked to determine the movement piece formed
Whether section should be assigned to user identifier.If the motion segments formed are automatically allocated to user identifier,
Method proceeds to box 410 as described below.
If the motion segments formed are not automatically allocated to user identifier, for example, checking to determine formation
Whether motion segments are assigned to the condition of user identifier, then method proceeds to box 404, in box 404, the fortune of formation
The score of movable plate section (for example, the motion segments being recently formed in block 212) and it is more than one be previously formed (" in the past
") scores of motion segments compared.For example, in some embodiments, the score and previous movement of the motion segments of formation
The score of segment is compared, wherein the motion segments of formation are that second user is still allocated to when carrying out box 404
User identifier motion segments, previous movement segment is to be assigned to the movement of the user identifier of second user in the past
Segment.In some embodiments, the score of multiple previous movement segments can be compared with the motion segments of formation, example
Such as, the past some when be assigned to the user identifier of second user and be stored in the addressable storage of the first equipment
Previous motion segments on device.In some embodiments, score can be similarly determined as referring to Figure 3 as described above, for example,
These scores can be stored in addressable memory with previous movement fragment association.For example, score can be based on movement
The more than one special characteristic of segment, for example, the type for the content characteristic described, visual pattern feature, circulation adaptability etc.
Deng.Score, which can also or be based instead on, is similar to setting as described above, user preference or user's input.Some
It differently can be that box 404 determines score with Fig. 3 score determined in embodiment.For example, in box 404, it can be to not
With condition differently weight, rather than feature different in Fig. 3 is examined etc..
In box 406, determine the score of the motion segments formed whether than the previous movement piece in box 404 compared with it
The score of section is more preferable (for example, higher).For example, it may be determined that whether the motion segments formed have best score.If it not,
The motion segments of box 408, formation will not be assigned to user identifier.This can enable previous movement pieces assigned recently
The user identifier of second user is still allocated in section.In some instances, the motion segments of formation can be dropped, and be deleted
It removes, or storage, is used for possible comparison later.If the score of the score ratio previous fragment of the motion segments formed is more preferable,
So carry out box 410.
Box 410 is carried out after the positive result of box 402 or box 406.In box 410, the movement of formation
Segment is assigned to the user identifier of second user.For example, distributing to any previous movement segment of user identifier by shape
At motion segments substitution.
Some embodiments can provide additional or replacement condition to determine the motion segments of formation (for example, recently
The motion segments of formation) whether it is assigned to the user identifier of second user.In some instances, period or time limit can be with
Be assigned to the special exercise segment for being already allocated to user identifier, and after the distribution period it is expired it
Afterwards, nearest motion segments are automatically allocated to user identifier, instead of that expired motion segments (for example, if most
The motion segments closely created are available).The user preference of second user and/or the first user (and are stored in implementation method
In the addressable memory of 400 equipment), or in response to display prompt and received user input, can be formed
Motion segments be assigned to user identifier, even if that motion segments have more than one previous movement is distributed than in the past
The worse score of the score of segment (for example, if score is not bound with user preference).For example, if second user (and/or
One user) with the stored preference for describing the user identifier of bareheaded user, and if in formation
Cap (for example, using image object detection technique) is detected in the more than one image of motion segments, then the fortune formed
The user identifier to second user that movable plate section still can not distribute, even if it and score more better than previous movement segment
Association, if the score does not consider that preference.For indicating themselves user identifier, for designated user and/or
Other examples of the user preference of all users may include smiling face (or non-smiling face), the motion segments image of certain luminance,
The random selection etc. for the motion segments conversed in the multiple storage motion segments formed by previous video.
Some embodiments can permit the first user and manually indicate the motion segments that be assigned to user identifier,
For example, be similar to it is as described above rewrite segment, but specified by the first user, rather than second user it is specified (or in addition to
Except second user is specified).For example, the motion segments of artificial selection may have access in the memory of the first equipment or the first equipment
Memory on be available.
Some embodiments, which can distribute, will be used to indicate multiple and different motion segments of single user.For example, more
A different motion segments can be assigned to the particular user identifier for specific user.In some embodiments, more
A different user identifier can be assigned to single specific user, wherein each different user identifier and more than one
Motion segments association.In various embodiments, distributing to the different motion segments of each of user can be in display equipment
It is shown under the different condition set of upper appearance.For example, different set of circumstances may include distinct device situation, for example, tool
Have the specific application of the output shown in equipment, it is shown or in addition export certain types of data (for example, text,
Image, video, audio etc.) or certain types of user interface feature (for example, window, icon, menu etc.), or go out
Existing event (for example, the calling received perhaps text message prompt or notice etc.).In some instances, if really
Determine second user and calling the first equipment, is set then the first motion segments for distributing to second user can be displayed on first
It is standby upper as user identifier, to indicate second user.For example, in the first equipment jingle bell to indicate that second user is requesting to lead to
In the equipment situation of words (describing in some instances similar to following), the first motion segments can be shown.Distribute to
The different motion segments of the second of two users can be displayed in different equipment situations, for example, if contact person menu
Shown and second user user identifier is displayed within menu, or if with the text chat of second user or
Other chat sessions of person are shown etc..In some embodiments, second user can provide preference to indicate multiple movements
Which motion segments in segment will be used for specified requirements (for example, the designated equipment feelings of the other equipment of such as the first equipment
Border).For example, some embodiments can in any specific situation to be displayed of the user identifier for second user
With the motion segments random from the Resource selection of the motion segments with the associated multiple storages of user identifier, to be shown.
For example, box 406-410 as described above can be used for determining in some embodiments in these embodiments
Whether the motion segments of formation will be assigned to user identifier with specified conditions set associative, for example, instead of be used for that
The associated previous user identifier of that set of circumstances of a user identifier.Some embodiments can force maximum quantity
Motion segments and each user identifier or user-association.
