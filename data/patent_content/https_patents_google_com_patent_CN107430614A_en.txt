Embodiment
As it is used in the present context, native application build environment example in the environment of the native application in user to set
Shown on standby and operated on the user equipment independently of browser application.Native application is specifically designed to specific
The application run in user facility operation system and machine firmware.Therefore, native application and the application based on browser and browse
The resource that device renders is different.When the resource that browser renders being instantiated or rendered every time, resource that the browser renders
Need all either at least some elements or the instruction downloaded from web server.Furthermore, it is possible to by all in browser
Hold the resource that web mobile device renders the application based on browser and browser to handle, and therefore, the application and
Resource is not specific for operating system.
The native application of mobile device and tablet device generally has the display surface than desktop device or laptop devices
The much smaller display area of product.Therefore, money that is being issued for the display of desktop type size and including multiple different pieces
Source often makes the several of content or more parts render outside the viewport in the equipment with smaller display.This drop
Low Consumer's Experience, because user must be navigated in viewport to find the information that user may be interested.When in response to
When have selected itself may think the search result of interesting pieces of information including user and provide resource, the aggravation of this problem.
Determine the link of native application partial-depth be present and by the native application partial-depth there is disclosed herein one kind
The system that link maps to corresponding resource address.In operation, the system accesses the resource identified by resource address, the resource
Address limits the content to be rendered in browser environment.The system determines that resource is included corresponding to part identifier and difference
Native application partial-depth links.Various pieces identifier is different from each other parts identifier, and identifies and render at this
The part of content in browser environment.By the content that part identifier identifies with identified by other parts identifier in
Hold different.The link identification of native application partial-depth is ready to use in what this partial content identified by part identifier was rendered
Native application and native application it is uniquely corresponding to identify that the partial-depth of the proper subclass of content links with part identifier.
Resource address is mapped to the link of native application partial-depth and stores the mapping in the index by the system.Then, visit is worked as
When asking the partial-depth link of the content of the resource identified by corresponding part identifier, the system can be by comparing by basis
The content of native application partial-depth link is verified using the content of offer.
For example, dining room may have website and corresponding native application.At the website of dining room, resource (for example, webpage) can
The information on the particular restaurant can be included, and in a part for resource, the comment to the particular restaurant may be included.Portion
Identifier is divided to be included in the HTML (HTML) of resource to identify the spy of the content provided in resource
Fixed part (for example, part identifier can identify the comment part of resource).For example, mapping can be performed by crawling operation
To generate in the pass of the resource where specific part of the native application partial-depth link identified as part identifier with content
Mapping between the resource address of connection.As described below, when the native application partial-depth chain for the native application for selecting dining room
When connecing, the content cited in the deep linking can be presented in native application.Partial content is commented on for dining room, search engine can visit
Ask content and the content that is presented by native application by the webpage of part identifier mark to verify the content of native application.
These features and supplementary features are described in more detail below.
Figure 1A is the block diagram for the example context 100 that the link of native application partial-depth is wherein mapped to resource address.It is all
The connection resource publisher website 104 of computer network 102 such as internet, using publisher 106, user equipment 108 and search
System 130.
Resource publisher website 104 include it is associated with domain and by one of one or more opening position or
One or more web resource 105 of multiple trust server.Generally, resource publisher website is to use hypertext html format
The class set of the webpage of change, text, image, content of multimedia and programming element can be included.Issued by content each website 104
Person safeguards that the content publisher is control, manages, and/or possess the entity of the website 104.
Web page resources are can be provided by network 102 by publisher website 104 and be positioned with such as unified resource
Accord with any data of the resource address of (URL).Web resource can be html page, image file, video file, audio file,
And feeding source, only give a few examples.Resource can include embedding information, for example, metamessage and hyperlink, and/or embedded instruction, example
Such as, client-side script.In more general terms, " resource " be can by Network Recognition anything, and can also include this
Original application.
It can also include one or more web resource 105 using publisher website 106, and native application is also provided
107.As described above, native application 107 is specifically designed to run in special user equipment operating system and machine firmware
Using.Native application 107 can include being designed as the miscellaneous editions run on different platforms.For example, and movie database
Native application corresponding to website can be included in run on the smart phone of the first kind the first native application, in Second Type
Smart phone on the second native application run, the 3rd native application run on the flat board of the first kind etc..
As used in the present note, " example environments " are in native application and show such as text, image
Etc. the display environment of content.Example environments are quoted specific to specific basis, and native application is specific to user equipment 108
Specific operation system.Example environments and the difference of the web resource rendered generate simultaneously in example environments in native application
And specific to native application, and web resource can be rendered in any browser environment that can be compatible with web page resources and
Independently of the operating system of user equipment.
User equipment 108 is electronic equipment under control of the user.User equipment 108 usually can pass through network 102
Ask and receive web page resources 105 and native application 107.Exemplary user equipment 108 includes personal computer, mobile communication is set
Standby and tablet PC.
In order to search for various websites and native application (and alternatively, other data sources), user equipment 108 will be searched for
Inquiry is committed to search system 130.Web resource 105 and native application 107 are searched in response to the inquiry, search system
130 access application references 114 and web indexes 116.Application references 114 are the indexes of the five application page of native application 107, and
The application references 114 are built by using application data extractor and processor 110 and index 112.Web indexes 116 are
Such as from the index for the web resource 105 for crawling publisher website 104 and establishing.In response to each inquiry, search system
130 access web indexes 116, and alternatively access application references 114 to identify that the resource related to the inquiry and basis should
With.Although being shown as single index, web indexes 116 and application references 114 can be combined in single index.
For example, search system 130 can identify the money of web resource search result and native application search result form respectively
Source and application.Once generating search result, search result is provided to the user equipment 108 for receiving inquiry.
Web resource search result is the data generated by search system 130, and the data are based on meeting particular search query
The content of resource identifies web resource.Web page title can be included to the web resource search result of resource, from Resource Access
The segment of text and the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of resource, for example, the URL (URL) of webpage.When
When being chosen at user equipment, web resource search result makes user equipment generation be pointed to the request of resource at URL.Then,
The web resource received is included in browser application.
Native application search result specifies native application, and alternatively specifies native application deep linking.When in user
When being chosen at equipment, native application search result makes the native application of installation on a user device ask consistent content.One
Denier native application receives the content of request, and native application shows the content in the user interface of native application.
In some embodiments, the publisher of webpage can be embedded in by using part identifier and web page code
The deep linking of native application is specified in webpage interior native application deep linking corresponding with the specific part of webpage in itself.It is this
Deep linking is referred to as " partial-depth link ", because the subdivision of the content of each partial-depth link and webpage is (that is, in webpage
The proper subclass of appearance) it is corresponding.Mapped system 120 can access the part identifier and deep linking of native application, and generate by
Web page resources map to the mapping data 122 of corresponding partial-depth link.
The relation between the webpage with part identifier and corresponding native application is illustrated in fig. ib, and Figure 1B is figure
The content part 152,154 and 156 in webpage 150 and the sheet for some content parts in these content parts are shown
The block diagram of the corresponding example environments 164 and 166 of original application.By the He of content part 154 limited for rendering the code of webpage 150
156 be to fetch identification by the partial-depth chain of part identifier and corresponding native application.When being accessed respectively by native application
Partial-depth link when, partial-depth link can make native application show corresponding to content 164 and 166.Another portion of webpage 150
152 are divided not have part identifier, and thus, there is no the corresponding local deep of the content in the part 152 for webpage 150
Degree link.
Mapped system 120 can access web indexes 116 and application references 114 to identify between webpage URL and application URI
Relation.Especially, mapped system 120 can identify resource address and native application partial-depth link between relation, and
And store the result into mapping data 122.
Reference picture 2A describes an instantiation procedure of generation mapping data, and Fig. 2A is to link native application partial-depth
Map to the flow chart of the instantiation procedure 200 of resource address.For example, can be by mapped system 120 come implementation process 200.One
In a little embodiments, the operation of instantiation procedure 200 can be embodied as being stored in the finger in non-transitory computer-readable medium
Order, in the non-transitory computer-readable medium, instruction makes the operation of data processing equipment execution instantiation procedure 200.
Process 200 determines that resource includes some identifiers and corresponding native application partial-depth link (202).Example
Such as, can be by one or more part identifier in the context of such as XHTML, HTML, XML markup language resource
It is included in resource.In some embodiments, can be by the fragment attributes in the code of resource come identification division identifier.
To other types of resource language, any data structure of the subdivision for the content for identifying resource can be used as portion identification
Symbol.The part identifier can be the hypertext element of any node, child node, local nodes or any other type.Separately
Outside, other types of part identifier, the byte index of the starting point and end point of such as specific part can be used.
For example, it is contemplated that the following markup language of the resource of the URL with android.example.com：
<html>
<head>
...
<Link rel=" alternate " href=" androidapp：//com.example.android/foo″/>
<Link rel=" alternate " deeplinkid=" bar " href=" androidapp：//
com.example.android/foo_bar″/>
<Link rel=" alternate " deeplinkid=" car " href=" androidapp：//
com.example.android/foo_car″/>
<Link rel=" alternate " deeplinkid=" dar " href=" androidapp：//
com.example.android/foo_dar″/>
...
innerHTML A
</head>
<body>
innerHTML B
<Deeplinkid id=" bar " ...>
innerHTML C
</div>
<Deeplinkid id=" car " ...>
innerHTML D
</div>
<Deeplinkid id=" dar " ...>
innerHTML E
</div>
</body>
Resource includes the corresponding deep linking of the full content of resource and three partial-depth chains of the part of resource
Connect.For the whole page deep linking " androidapp of native application " androidapp "：//com.example.android/foo”
Use " link (link) " label.Herein, the whole page deep linking includes stem " foo. ".Because this deep linking is not present
Part identifier, so deep linking should be included in all the elements included on web page resources.
Also in the presence of three of the native application additional partial-depth link " androidapp：//
com.example.android/foo_bar”、“androidapp：//com.example.android/foo_car " and
“androidapp：//com.example.android/foo_dar”.For declaring the every of each corresponding partial-depth link
Individual link attribute includes the part identifier identified by attribute " deeplinkid ".In the case of markup language, portion identification
Symbol can be the form for marking label.Corresponding part attribute is " bar ", " dar " and " car ".It is with the code of webpage
Div attributes " bar ", " dar " and " car ", and each limit a HTML part.Specifically, div attributes " bar "
It is corresponding with innerHTML C；Div attributes " car " are corresponding with innerHTML D；Div attributes " dar " and innerHTML D couple
Should.
In the embodiment as shown, part identifier that partial-depth chains is linked and is attached to by entire depth come shape
Partial-depth into part identifier links.This shows be used for checking by native application to deep linking to system 120
“androidapp：The content of corresponding contents shown in //com.example.android/foo_bar " is innerHTML C
Content, it should for verifying by native application to deep linking " androidapp：//com.example.android/foo_
The content of corresponding contents shown in car " is innerHTML D content, and should be used for checking by native application to depth
Link " androidapp：The content of corresponding contents shown in //com.example.android/foo_dar " is innerHTML
E content.However, in other embodiments, partial-depth can also be linked and the portion with some other unique texts
Identifier is divided uniquely to be associated.It is, for example, possible to use following scheme：
<html>
<head>
...
<Link rel=" alternate " href=" androidapp：//com.example.android/foo″/>
<Link rel=" alternate " deeplinkid=" bar " href=" androidapp：//
com.example.android/AA″/>
<Link rel=" alternate " deeplinkid=" car " href=" androidapp：//
com.example.android/BB″/>
<Link rel=" alternate " deeplinkid=" dar " href=" androidapp：//
com.example.android/CC″/>
...
innerHTML A
</head>
<body>
innerHTML B
<Deeplinkid id=" bar " ...>
innerHTML C
</div>
<Deeplinkid id=" car " ...>
innerHTML D
</div>
<Deeplinkid id=" dar " ...>
innerHTML E
</div>
</body>
Herein, value AA, BB and CC is uniquely corresponding with part identifier bar, car and dar respectively.
Mapped system 120 can access the web indexes 116 generated by search system 130 insertion in resource with identification
Part identifier and native application deep linking.
Process 200 generates the mapping (204) that resource address is mapped to the link of native application partial-depth.Once find portion
Divide identifier, then can be by resource address and the link mapping of native application partial-depth, and it is stored in reflecting for mapping data 122
Penetrate in index.In the examples described above, mapped system 120 can generate the mapping of following partial-depth link：
In some embodiments, mapped system 120 can be by by the native application deep linking in mapping data 122
The content of the resource of part identifier identification is deposited together with the mapping between being linked in resource address with native application partial-depth
Storage.For above-mentioned example, mapped system 120 can be captured by the data and HTML content of each deeplinkid Attribute Recognitions
(for example, from part identifier " bar " " innerHTML C " content etc.).
In some embodiments, the content of resource can be distributed when accessing deep linking by native application is actual
Content, i.e. native application can render the code snippet identified by part identifier.In other embodiments, by resource
Partial content is used to verify the content distributed by the partial-depth link of native application.Can using the checking with ensure with
It is consistent that native application partial-depth that web resource distributes together link refer to this corresponding part web resource really
Content.
If in native application partial-depth is linked and analyzed between the proper subclass of the corresponding content of Energy Resources Service
Appearance is confirmed as inconsistent, then mapped system 120 can prevent or otherwise disable that native application part is presented deeply
Part of the degree link as search result.
Fig. 2 B are the flow charts for verifying the instantiation procedure 250 of the native application content of local deep linking.Can be by
According to one or more computer implemented process 250 with the identical mode of implementation process 200 in being communicated in data
In data processing equipment.
Process 250 accesses the First partial deep linking of native application and the two address address pair of web resource
(252).For each right, First partial deep linking can be accessed by native application, and specify native application from its
The position of first content is received, and each second address is the address for the web resource for providing the second content respectively.Again, may be used
To determine address pair by mapped system 120 as described above.
Process 250 receives the first content (254) of First partial deep linking.For example, mapped system 120 can perform sheet
The data that original application and monitoring receive in response to the content requests of native application.Content can be collected by various modes.
For example, the text processor for the data processing equipment inquiry native application that can order, program list processing and view processing journey
Sequence is to obtain additional text and view data to be processed.Alternatively or additionally, it can monitor response to content requests simultaneously
And extract data from the response.It can also use and be supplied to collection data that are native application and/or being shown by native application
Other suitable modes.
Process 250 receives two address second content (256).In the case of web resource, it is extracted in web resource
By the content of part identifier identification as the second content.
Process 250 determines whether first content and the second content are consistent contents (258).If such as Entities Matching, n
One or more comparison procedure instruction of first similarity, phrase match and characteristic similarity first content and the second content it
Between exist threshold uniformity level, it is determined that content is consistent.
If it is consistent content that process 250, which determines first content and the second content, process 250 verify address pair and
Will checking data storage (260) in resource index.For example, the record of the URL in web indexes 116 can be updated to include
The address of native application partial-depth link and the identifier of native application.Search result is handled when in later time
When, if providing to user equipment, search system 130 and can giving birth to the URL web resources quoted as web search result
Into corresponding native application search result.
On the contrary, if process 250 does not determine first content and the second content is consistent content, process 250 is not verified
Address is to (262).Therefore, will for being confirmed as the native application address without the content consistent with corresponding web resource
The native application search result of the address will not be generated.
Once demonstrate partial-depth link, then when the content of the resource corresponding to local deep linking is determined as
In response to inquiry when, search system 130 can provide the partial-depth link.Fig. 3 be by refer to resource content it is true
The native application partial-depth link of a proper subclass in subset is provided to the flow of the instantiation procedure 300 of user equipment 108
Figure.In some embodiments, the operation of instantiation procedure 300 can be embodied as being stored in non-transitory computer-readable medium
On instruction, in the non-transitory computer-readable medium, instruction make data processing equipment perform instantiation procedure 300 behaviour
Make.
It is determined that treat to provide the native application deep linking of a proper subclass in the proper subclass that refer to the content of resource
To user equipment (302).For example, search system 130 can determine that the content of the corresponding resource of partial-depth link is determined
For in response to inquiry, and it is determined that native application search result (or deep linking) is provided to user equipment.Can be with base
Previous determination is completed in the proper subclass of the content identified by identifier and the relevance scores of inquiry.For example, the latter is true
Surely can be based on the native application installed on a user device.
The access map of process 300 is indexed to select refer to the native application partial-depth of the specific proper subclass of content to link
(304).Can be local deep to position the native application for the proper subclass that refer to content with the map index in access map data 122
Degree link, the proper subclass of the content is identified by part identifier.
Then process 300 provides the link of native application partial-depth to user equipment (306).Can be by partial-depth chain
