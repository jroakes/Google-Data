Use HARQ
Now, Fig. 3 and 14 will be referred to, description is in an embodiment of the present invention, soft in the form of UE is using soft buffer
The structure of buffer.With reference to Fig. 3, transceiver 302 receives signal through carrier wave (such as UL carrier wave, DL carrier wave or D2D carrier wave).Transmitting-receiving
Device 302 passes the signal along to processor 304, and in this example, which is baseband processor.Transceiver 302 and processing
One or more of device 304 includes Signal Processing Element 1400 shown in Figure 14.
Signal Processing Element 1400 can be realized with the combination of hardware, software or both.1400 quilt of Signal Processing Element
It is organized into functional block.These blocks illustrate in Figure 14, and their function will now be described.It is received by transceiver 302 (Fig. 3)
Signal, the transceiver 302 demodulate the signal and generate the reception log-likelihood ratio (LLR) for giving TB.HARQ composite unit
Part 1408 combination institute received LLR be used for from the LLR stored in the defeated TB of forward pass.Combined LLR is in block 1410
It is decoded by processor 304 and another processing (for example, being sent to higher, for further processing) can be passed to.Such as
Fruit not successfully decodes TB, then the combined LLR for that TB is stored in the subregion 314 of soft buffer 1412.
If not successfully decoding TB in block 1410, UE can transmit HARQ feedback on line link on it.Soft buffer
1412 save the combined LLR for TB until UE is decoded another trial of TB.
Transmission entity (being not shown in Figure 14) is attempted to retransmit when receiving indicates that UE not successfully receives the HARQ feedback of TB
The TB.The TB retransmitted by with preceding identical functional block, but when UE is attempted when block 1410 decodes retransmitted TB, UE from its
Memory 1414 retrieval be used for the TB LLR, and using HARQ composition element 1408 come be known as " soft-combine " during,
Combination the received LLR and storage LLR for the TB.Combined LLR is provided to decoder 1410, the decoder 1410
It decodes the TB and the TB being successfully decoded is supplied to higher, for further processing.
Soft buffer 1412 is referred to as HARQ memory or harq buffer device.Due to making there are multiple HARQ procedures
HARQ processing index or HARQ mark (explicit segment signal in usually used DCI format associated with TB inform (such as with
In downlink), or implicitly (such as downlink) is determined through subframe number, system frame number etc.) it can be used for HARQ
Combination operation is appropriately carried out in composition element 1418.Uplink is transmitted, implicit HARQ procedure index is by UE use come just
Really determine the bits of coded for uplink transmission.
If UE configuration has the transmission mode of maximum every one TB of HARQ procedure (or mono- TB of every TTI), can be by UE
Soft buffer be divided into 8 subregions 1414, as shown in figure 14.If UE configuration has maximum every 2 TB of HARQ procedure (or every
Two TB of TTI) transmission mode, each of 8 subregions 1414 can be further separated into the first subregion 1414A and the second subregion
The soft buffer of 1414B or UE is segmented into 16 subregions.
In LTE embodiment of the invention, at least partly determine that the soft buffer of UE configures by its classification.Reference table 1, example
Such as, it is expected that the UE of classification -3 provides 1,237,248 soft channel position, wherein each soft channel position can store log-likelihood
Than (LLR).
For FDD, to given component carrier, UE has 8 HARQ procedures in DL.Based on transmission mode, UE can be received
One or two transmission block (corresponding to HARQ procedure) in TTI.UE can total number, HARQ based on soft channel position as a result,
The maximum number of process, transmission mode etc. determine each amount of storage for receiving transmission block.Similarly, NE1 can be encoded and only
Transmission knows that UE those of can handle and/or store bits of coded.
In some cases, it if UE has insufficient amount of storage to given transmission block, and decodes and unsuccessfully occurs, UE can
Some LLR are stored with selection and abandon some other LLR.In other cases, if can be used or thought to transmission without storage
Block is without storage, if decoding unsuccessfully occurs, UE can abandon all LLR corresponding to transmission block.Network entity transmission exceeds
The case where quantity of the bits of coded of the memory capacity of UE, is frequent occurrence.Typically example includes：(1) when being polymerize using carrier wave
(for example, UE support 8 HARQ procedures of two or more carrier waves and each carrier wave), and (2) when using tdd (for example,
UE supports every carrier wave to be up to 15 HARQ procedures).For FDD, and for uplink, to given component carrier, when UE not
When configuration is in UL-MIMO transmission mode, there are UE 8 HARQ procedures (when UE configuration is in UL-MIMO transmission mode, to have
There are 16 HARQ procedures).It for FDD, is configured based on TDD UL/DL, determines the number of the HARQ procedure for uplink.
Reference table 1, it is assumed that limited buffers rate-matched (LBRM), definition are soft for the UE classification 3 in LTE Rel-8/9
Buffer measurement.UE is allowed to provide soft less than every TB of soft buffer size needed for maximum the subset of big TB size by LBRM
Buffer sizes come realize 1/3 female code rate.For example, should be propped up with the standard compliant LTE classification 3UE of 2 space layer operations
Hold 75376 maximum TB size.To the TB size, the total soft channel position for giving 1237248 (is delayed that is, corresponding to the soft of these
Rush device size), two possible TB in every TTI each, UE is only capable of providing 77328 soft channel position.This is actually pair
That TB size, about 0.97 effective female code rate (ECR) or minimum can reach code rate.Effectively mother's code rate can be defined as information bit
Number divided by the bits of coded that can be stored in soft buffer number.
It should be noted that effectively mother's code rate can be different from the code rate (for example, turbo code) used by FEC encoder, because
Them are defined from different viewpoints.It can have 1/3 turbo code (FFC encoder) code rate, wherein shorten the code or interception one
A little output verification positions (limiting since soft buffer stores), lead to effective female code rate greater than 1/3.For example, if interception 50%
Output verification position, then ECR is about 2/3, and turbo code rate is 1/3.To the TB size for being approximately less than 25456, ECR's and 1/3
Female code rate is identical, it is meant that does not need using LBRM.
In LTE embodiment of the invention, it is defined as follows for encoding the number of soft channel position of TB：
Wherein, NsoftIt is the total number of soft channel position, if UE is configured to answer based on the space with the order greater than 1
With such as transmission mode 3,4 or 8 receives PDSCH transmission, KMIMOEqual to 2, otherwise, MDL_HARQIt is DL HARQ procedure (that is, downlink
HARQ procedure in link direction) maximum number and MlimitIt is equal to 8 constant, KCIt is to depend on UE classification and related branch
Hold the value of the UE performance of multiple space layers of the component carrier for transmitting transmission block (from 1,2 or 5).If UE signal is informed
Rel-10UE classification (one in 6,7,8) is gone back signal and is informed for back compatible (for example, Rel-10 classification 6UE is allowed to exist
Operated in Rel-8/9 network) corresponding second category (one in 4,5).For encoding the N of TBsoftValue be based on signal
The UE classification of informing, the maximum number of plies etc. supported by the UE on certain components carrier wave.In the side UE, pass through above-mentioned identical public affairs
Formula provides the number for the soft channel position that UE is provided for storing TB on carrier wave, but by Nsoft/NcellInstead of Nsoft, wherein
NcellIt is the number of the configuration component carrier for UE.
When transmission block is transmitted to network entity on uplink by UE, LBRM is not applied usually, because of network entity
With enough memory resources.Therefore, uplink is transmitted, by the female code rate of turbo code, provides the volume for being used for transmission block
The number and LBRM of code bit are transparent.This imply downlink direction on rate-matched process (passing through LBRM) and
Rate-matched (that is, w/o LBRM) in uplink direction is not symmetrical.

Body NE1 receives signal (such as paging message).In the example shown, UE2 is transmitted in subframe 1110,1120；UE1 is in subframe
1140 (including a mark space at beginning) are transmitted on 1150,1160,1170 and 1180；And UE2 includes at beginning
It is transmitted in the subframe 1190 of one mark space.In subframe 1100, UE1 and UE2 listen to signal from NE1.UE1 and UE2 can
To listen to NE1 during each subframe regularly, such as after transition subframe.
The D2D communication that network is initiated
Referring again to Fig. 8 A, in an embodiment of the present invention, network entity is appropriate by the way that UE can be used to be in communication with each other
Time-frequency resources distribute to UE, the information signal of resource in relation to being distributed are informed UE, and order UE is using being distributed
The mutual direct communication of resource, initiate D2D communication.One or both in UE is initiated to be likely to be at idle mode when D2D communication,
But occupied, therefore, they are known to network entity.
The time-frequency resources for distributing to UE can be the subset of UL resource, or can be the subset of DL resource.For example,
Network entity can distribute one or more resource blocks of UL subframe or DL subframe.These resource blocks distributed can periodically be sent out
It is raw, such as each frame, subframe or time slot.Data flow is generated using RB, UE1 and the UE2 of these distribution, such as is structured as one
Series of time multiplexed sub frame or time slot, wherein each subframe or time slot use a RB in UL carrier wave or DL carrier wave.UE is used
The RB of UL or DL carrier wave can be on any subcarrier of UL or DL carrier wave.In certain embodiments, however, it is possible to be carried from UL
Wave obtains the RB as used in UE.These RB can be selected from the PUCCH of UL carrier wave, and thus positioned at UL carrier wave highest and
Low-limit frequency subcarrier.
It for the UE1 and UE2D2D carrier wave for distributing resource is first carrier from it referring still to Fig. 8 A.UE1 or UE2 be used to
The carrier wave of network entity communication is the second carrier wave.In addition, not Chong Die with first or second carrier wave can be used in UE1 and UE2
Three carrier waves communicate in D2D mode.
With reference to Figure 12, now, the example how description is communicated by the initiation of network 100 D2D.As pointed in figure,
UL carrier wave is designated as first carrier, and DL carrier wave is designated as the second carrier wave.In step 1200, UE1 is communicated with NE1 foundation.
The step (for example, through RACH) can be executed before remaining step is very early.In step 1201, NE1 be based on one above-mentioned or
Multiple standards, it is determined whether need or it is expected the D2D communication between UE1 and UE2.
If NE1, which is determined, needs or it is expected D2D, in step 1202, its reference signal is connected in NE1 order.If
UE2 is connected to NE1, then NE1 is requested from UE2 in relation to such as the link-quality of the reference signal measured by UE2 in step 1204
Information.
It is not attached to NE1 in case of UE2, then NE1 can request UE2 to connect with NE1 through back haul system and core 106.
Core 106 can be by paging UE2 to realize through another network element, such as NE2.In response to the paging, then, UE2 is initiated
With the connection of NE1.
In step 1206, UE2 determines link-quality and by link-quality (such as RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI, CSI) report
To NE1.In step 1208, NE1 determines whether to meet D2D standard, and whether such as (a) UE1 and UE2 is in mutual preset distance
It is interior, (b) whether it is higher than predeterminated level from the quality of the received reference signal of UE1 by UE2, and (c) whether allow UE1 and UE2
It can not adversely influence public safety communication.
If NE1 makes the judgement of the affirmative in relation to these factors, in step 1210, which continues, in the step
Resource (for example, distribution PUCCH resource block) of 1210, the NE1 distribution for D2D.If NE1 makes in relation to any of these factors
One negative determines, then NE1 does not initiate the D2D mode for UE.
In step 1211A and 1211B, order is transmitted to UE1 and UE2 by NE1.The order indicates that UE uses the intercommunication of D2D phase
Letter, and identify the RB that they should be used.Order can be transmitted to UE on such as PDSCH or PDCCH/EPDCCH by NE1.
In the resource that step 1212, UE can be distributed via NE1, handshake procedure is added.In step 1214, UE is mutual in D2D mode
Communication.It should be noted that step 1210 and step 1211A (or 1211B) can execute as single step.It should also be noted that each
In embodiment, UE can be communicated on UL carrier wave, DL carrier wave or third separate carrier.
The D2D communication that equipment is initiated
In the scheme that equipment is initiated, one or more of UE transfers a request to network.The request includes positive request
UE wish communication another UE identity.If the network authorization request, network is by distributing resource appropriate and configuring
UE is responded using those resources.
(for example, they are mutually adjacent, " looking for friend " is used to answer for example it is assumed that the user of UE1 and UE2 mutually understands
With such as Google LatitudeTMOr near-field communication (NFC) is mutually found).The user of UE1 determines file being conveyed to UE2
User.If two UE are not also on network, UE1 should can request that UE2 is connected to the network or public network of UE1.So
Afterwards, UE1 and UE2 is operated on identical frequency band/carrier wave, and as described above, the network distribution resource just operated from them.
In an embodiment of the present invention, if UE is in idle mode, UE1 is by being connected to NE1 and to NE1 table
Bright " D2D interest " enters connection mode.Information in relation to UE2 can be supplied to NE1 by UE1.These information may include UE2
IMEI, or the information of similar handle, such as UE2'suserid@network_name.d2dEtc..Network entity is by the information
It is transmitted to core 106 (for example, accounting server) (Fig. 1).Subscription letter of one or more control element verifications for two UE
Breath is to determine whether the data plan for UE includes D2D ability.Then, core provides success or failure instruction to NE 1.
NE1 can obtain the update mobility measurements for every UE, and be supplied to UE for mobility measurements are updated, by
This allows NE1 to control measurement and mobility.
In a kind of realization for the D2D that equipment is initiated, UE1 (idle mode) determines the frequency spectrum that can be used in special frequency band,
Execution is communicated with the D2D of UE2.Then, UE1 will be connected to the network entity operated in that frequency band and under network 100
Carry the information that can be used for D2D communication, the maximum power that such as reference signal power, reference signal identification information, D2D communication allow
UE1 is allowed to be used for the subframe that D2D is communicated with other power contorl parameters and network 100.Then, UE1 initiate D2D (for example,
By starting to transmit reference signal).UE2 executes similar step and also initiates D2D.UE can discharge it after downloading D2D information
With the connection (returning to idle mode) of network, and continue to communicate in D2D mode, even if relative to network 100 at them
In idle mode.To the realization, network 100 could also indicate that " validity period " associated with the information transmitted about D2D.Or
Person, UE can be assumed predetermined validity period, and if the duration of D2D session exceeds the validity period, UE may need again
Being connected to network, whether D2D information is still effective or whether they must download new value to verify.
It may postpone UE and be switched to another from NE1, after completing the D2D session between UE.
According to an embodiment of the invention, UE1 determine D2D can be used after, in the frequency band comprising uplink carrier
Uplink RB set in, it is autonomous to initiate D2D communication.UE1 can determine uplink RB collection based on from the received signaling of NE1
It closes.NE1 can inhibit to dispatch the transmission of the conventional UE in those RB (i.e. UE to network entity is transmitted).If NE1 completes this operation,
UE in D2D mode can be communicated by can be used for the maximum power of D2D communication.Such as when in public safety use UE
When, this is very useful.For example, if public safety UE is determined not in the area of coverage of the LTE network for being communicated based on architecture,
It can be closed in potential predetermined uplink RB collection, independently return to D2D mode.
With reference to Figure 13, the example of the D2D communication of equipment initiation will now be described.In step 1300, the user of user and UE1
Interactive interfacing it is expected to show to be added the user that D2D is communicated.In step 1302, UE1 is passed through first carrier or UL carrier wave to NE1
Send the request for carrying out D2D communication with UE2.In step 1304, NE1 determines whether UE2 connects.If not connected, NE1
Core 106 is requested, UE2 is made to be connected to NE1.If UE2 has been connected, or becomes having connected in response to the request from NE1, that
NE1 distribution is for being used for the resource (for example, RB from UL carrier wave or DL carrier wave) of D2D communication by UE.In step 1306A and
1306B, NE1 are transmitted to UE through the second carrier wave or DL carrier wave, by the information for identifying distributed resource.In step 1308, UE energy
Distributed resource is used, and uses D2D subframe structure, executes handshake procedure.In step 1310, UE uses D2D subframe phase
Mutual communication.
UE performance and performance segmentation
According to an embodiment of the invention, every UE has one or more performance sets, that is, performance configuration.Performance configuration
It may include following one or more：
(1) data rate (such as maximum data rate) that UE is supported；
(2) UE has how many transmittings and/or receiving antenna；
(3) type (example that table 3 and 4 shows transmission plan) for the transmission plan that UE is supported；
(4) the soft buffer configuration of UE；
(5) the MIMO performance (for example, the number of layers of the support of each frequency band, supports UL MIMO) of UE；
(6) the carrier wave polymerization of UE；
(7) battery life of UE；
(8) by the maximum transmitted block bit rate number of the UE every TTI supported；
(9) process performance of UE is (for example, the processor number that UE has, the parallel procedure number that can once execute.
In an embodiment of the present invention, every UE can divide its performance.Each division performance set is referred to as performance point
Cut configuration.
As mentioned, the performance that UE can be divided is its soft buffer configuration.The soft buffer configuration of UE is following
One or more：(1) UE will be used to receive the maximum HARQ procedure number (required buffer device number of partitions) of grouping；(2)UE
The size of the soft buffer of grouping will be used to receive；And (3) UE will be used to receive the soft channel bits number of grouping.As a result, this
One or more first sets of a little characteristics will constitute the first soft buffer configuration and second set will to constitute second soft slow
Rush device configuration.
For example, given first UE and the 2nd UE, the configuration of the first buffer divides may include it is following at least one：(1)
One UE will be used for from the received maximum HARQ procedure number of network entity；(2) the first UE will be used for received soft from network entity
The size of buffer, and (3) the first UE will be used for from the received soft channel bits number of network entity.
The configuration of second buffer divides includes at least one following：(1) the first UE will be used for received most from the 2nd UE
Big HARQ procedure number；(2) the first UE will be used for size from the received soft buffer of the 2nd UE, and (3) the first UE will be used
In from the received soft channel bits number of the 2nd UE.
Now, it will thus provide its performance is divided into the example of performance segmentation configuration by UE.If UE tool there are two processor and
These performances can be divided into the first performance segmentation configuration for constituting a processor and an antenna and structure by two antennas
It is set at the second performance partition of a processor and an antenna.
In an embodiment of the present invention, different performance segmentation is configured to communicate with distinct device by UE.For example, UE may
First performance using 1 processor, 4 soft buffer partitions divides configuration, and in transmission mode 1, with network entity
Communication.UE is also possible to set using the second performance partition of 1 processor, 2 soft buffer partitions, and transmits mould in D2D
In formula, with another UE communication in D2D mode.The example also example UE changes its soft buffer configuration.First soft buffer is matched
Setting including 4 soft buffer partitions and the second soft buffer configuration includes 2 soft buffer partitions.
In some embodiments, UE uses the segmentation configuration of the first and second performances simultaneously, and two other equipment, such as separately
One UE and network entity communication.In other embodiments, UE switches to another, depends on from using a performance partition to set
The equipment that UE is just being communicated, and realize in a time multiplexed manner.
Any one of the performance configuration of UE including the performance configuration being made of the one or more of above-mentioned performance, can be with
It is divided into multiple performance segmentation configurations.
With reference to Fig. 1, for example, UE1, which can change the segmentation configuration of its performance, (for example, reducing its data rate, changes soft buffering
Device number of partitions etc.) so that its configuration is compatible with the configuration of UE2 to allow UE1 and UE2 to be in communication with each other, while also supporting
Communication between UE1 and network entity.UE2 can also change its performance segmentation configuration so that UE1 performance segmentation configuration and
The configuration of UE2 is compatible.
For example, can be up to 100 megabits and UE2 only 50 megabits of energy reception per second of transmission if UE1 is per second, UE1 can
To change its performance configuration, so that up to 50 megabits of only transmission per second.
In table 1 (being used for downlink) and table 2 (being used for uplink), show in an embodiment of the present invention, UE can
With the example for the different LTE UE classification/performances having.

The transmission mode of downlink.UE is configured in one of transmission mode by network entity.UE in given transmission mode is
Corresponding to down link control information (DCI) format of transmission mode, downlink control channel is monitored, and based on corresponding
Transmission plan is (for example, the transmission that single antenna port, transmitting diversity, Open-Loop Spatial Multiplexing, Closed-Loop Spatial Multiplexing, light beam are formed is (single
Antenna port, port 7) etc.) receive PDSCH.
Signaling performance and classification
According to LTE embodiment, UE informing network entity its version, classification and other performance.This allows network entity suitable
The communication of locality configuration and UE.UE can abandon (or ignorance) and not meet any reception message/letter of its version/classification/performance
Number.The UE of particular category provides characteristic/performance as shown in Tables 1 and 2 (in downlink and uplink).
During their D2D handshake procedure, UE can establish MS master-slave relationship.UE (such as UE branch with optimum performance
Hold larger data rate, longer battery life etc.) will usually based on.For example, if two UE for participating in D2D belong to inhomogeneity
Not, then the UE with larger classification can be main equipment.For example, if classification 3 and 7 equipment of classification participate in D2D, classification
7 can be main equipment.Main UE will be specified from from the desired resource of UE, be communicated for D2D.It can be by indicating to provide from UE
The message of this resource responds.If it happens, main UE may need to reduce the expection from UE.For example, may need to make from UE
At least some with its soft buffer partition communicate with network entity.
Capability exchange example
With reference to Figure 15, will now be described for D2D it is communication objective, UE how the example of switching performance information.In this example,
Carry out following hypothesis.UE1 using the RB from UL carrier wave come using structure shown in such as Fig. 8 B, on D2D carrier wave, by subframe
It is transmitted to UE2.UE1 in the example is classification 4UE, and UE2 is classification 2UE.As shown in Tables 1 and 2, classification 4UE has
The DL/UL rate and classification 2UE of 150150Mbps/50Mbps has the DL/UL rate of 50Mbps/25Mbps.UE1 as a result,
Maximum data rate and UE2 to UE1 to UE2 link with 50Mbps (UE2-rx) have 25Mbps (UE2-tx) most
Big data rate.The asymmetry ignores the fact that two UE all have the ability of decoding 50Mbps.
It is also assumed that network entity has been granted, UE1 authorization addition is communicated with the D2D of UE2 and UE1 knows UE2 (UE2
Also recall that UE1).Merely illustrative purpose provides these hypothesis.
In step 1500, UE1 is communicated with NE1 foundation.In step 1501, NE1, which distributes UE, can be used to the phase in D2D mode
The RB and/or subframe of mutual communication.These RB can be the RB of the RB or UL carrier wave of DL carrier wave.In step 1510, UE1 determines that UE will
For the RB distributed being in communication with each other and/or the first set of subframe.In step 1520, UE1 receives related UE2's from NE1
The information (such as classification of UE2) of performance.Alternatively, its performance information is transmitted to UE1 through D2D carrier wave by UE2 in step 1520'.
Then, UE1 and UE2 can initiate mutual handshake procedure in step 1530, wherein they establish MS master-slave pass
System, decides through consultation based on UE1.In step 1540, UE1 determines that UE enters the appropriately configured of communication, including UE should be D2D allocation of communications
What resource (such as performance).These include data rate, encoding scheme and the configuration of harq buffer device.In this example, UE1 is true
Three soft buffer partitions 1416 (Figure 14) should be exclusively used in receive transmission block from UE1 by determining UE2.Then, UE2 can for example by
Remaining 5 soft buffer partitions 1418 with NE1 for communicating.In step 1550, desired resource can be informed UE2 by UE1
Or UE1 may be configured to the required resource of the UE2 of D2D communication.In step 1560, UE1 and UE2 use in D2D carrier wave, by
The RB/ subframe of NE1 distribution, and using UE1 it is determined that the internal resource used, communicates in D2D mode.In step
D2D communication is added in 1560, UE1 and UE2.
The modified version of the process of pictorial image 15 in Figure 16.During Figure 16, the user of UE1 sends out in step 1600
Play D2D communication.In step 1602, three alternative solutions are illustrated.The performance of UE2 can be informed UE1 by NE1, and UE1 can be from UE2
Direct receptivity information or UE1 and UE2 can be exchanged with each other performance information.Remaining step is similar with Figure 15.
For according to embodiment, further example is exchanged in the performance and classification of D2D communication period, it is assumed that UE1 and UE2 is added
D2D communication and UE1 know version/performance/classification of UE2.Then, UE1 will configure D2D link, and UE2 suitably will
Encoded messaging receives encoded transmission to UE1 and from UE1.If UE be it is different classes of, UE1 can be based on UE2
Classification, select its soft buffer configuration.It, can will be based on higher-class other UE configuration in D2D connection.
In another embodiment of the invention, when D2D communication is added in UE, UE can inform its classification direct signal another
One UE.In addition, network entity or main equipment can configure in (a) the first UE, for the received soft buffer allocation of D2D and/or
In 2nd UE, for D2D received harq buffer device distribution, b) the maximum HARQ mistake of D2D transmission from the first UE to the 2nd UE
Number of passes mesh and/or the maximum HARQ procedure number configured to be transmitted from the 2nd UE to the D2D of the first UE.In addition, network entity
The one or more of following limitations can be configured：
A) transmission mode limits
B) modulation limitation (being limited to QPSK/16-QAM)
C) (for example, if UE1 and UE2 are operated on difference BW, UE1 is common UE, and UE2 is that have for bandwidth limitation
The MTC device of smaller Rx BW).
Network entity can inform the default configuration for D2D communication with signal.It is special that the signaling of default configuration can be cell
With signaling or UE dedicated signaling, the default configuration for direct communication may include：Transmission mode for directly transmitting is used for
Transmission plan, the demodulation RS directly transmitted is configured, for component carrier of direct communication etc..It is direct with another UE when realizing
When communication, some or all of default configuration parameters can be overthrown/be reconfigured to network entity.In some predetermined lasting times,
The configuration is effective to the session or can be by UE for the direct communication with another UE.Specific signaling is being received from network entity, is being turned
It changes in the predetermined lasting time of RRC idle mode, switching etc., configuration information can be reset into default configuration.
Control channel crosses offer
With reference to Fig. 7 A, it will now be described according to an embodiment of the invention, how RB distributes, shown by what reference signal used
Example.The example will focus on the first edge 722 of transmission bandwidth configuration those of nearby on RB.However, the identical distribution side RB
Case also can be applied to second edge 724 nearby those of RB.
To the example, it is assumed that any RB not reserved for D2D, network entity will normally distribute to RB0 and RB1
UE, for being transmitted on PUCCH.To be communicated convenient for D2D, however, network entity is PUCCH distribution RB1 and RB2 instead, and it is
D2D reference signaling reserves RB0.In D2D, network entity NE1 by relation to reference signal signal configure information (such as
Through higher level signaling, such as RRC signaling) it is supplied to UE.However, the network entity of distribution resource must not necessarily provide signal and match
Confidence breath.Second network entity, such as NE2 can complete this operation.
In this example, the signal configuration of reference signal is that RB1 and RB2 will be used for PUCCH and RB0 and will be used by UE
To transmit reference signal.The RB allocation plan allows UE to have the D2D performance using PUCCH unlike they are original, but
Using RB1 and RB2, while there is the UE of D2D function RB0 can also be used for reference signaling in addition to using PUCCH.Meanwhile being permitted
In more situations, it is expected that for D2D communication transimission power it is small, and by edge RB be used for D2D facilitate reduce channel width outside
Interference.
Signal about the reference signal of the 2nd UE can be configured and inform that a kind of method of the first UE is to pass through by network entity
Information in relation to the PUCCH RB distribution modified is transmitted to the first UE.This information can be the nRB-CQI value with modification
Form.
In LTE embodiment, for example, nRB-CQI (or) can according in each time slot in subframe, can be used for by
PUCCH format 2/2a/2b transmits the resource block used, indicates bandwidth.PUCCH format 2/2a/2b can be used to deliver regular CSI
Report.LTE UE can be determined using nRB-CQI value will be used to transmit the PUCCH of HARQ-ACK using PUCCH format 1/1a/1b
Resource.More specifically, LTE UE is transmitted in the edge RB identified by nRB-CQI value without using PUCCH format 1/1a/1b
HARQ-ACK。
The D2D on edge RB to allow transmission bandwidth configuration is communicated, the signal configuration information energy sent by network entity
Show other RB offset (for example, D2D-RB-offset), using the offset, the UE of energy D2D can determine that logical for D2D
The edge RB of letter.For example, if by transmission bandwidth configure RB number for RB0, RB1, RB2, RB3, RB4 ..., RB0 is closest
Transmission bandwidth edge, network entity energy signal inform D2D-RB-offset value 2 and nRB-CQI value 5.D2D communication is not configured
UE (and the UE for being unable to D2D communication) (i.e. RB0 to RB4) is not passed from preceding 5 RB the edge that transmission bandwidth configures
Send HARQ-ACK.The first two RB (i.e. RB0 and RB1) is communicated for D2D for the UE of D2D communication configuration.Other RB (that is, RB2,
RB3, RB4) it can be transmitted by all UE for PUCCH format 2/2a/2b.Such as find out from the example, offer PUCCH resource value is provided
(that is, signal informs the greater value than n_RB_CQI needed for supporting PUCCH format 2/2a/2b transmission) allows network 100 with right
The UE that D2D cannot be supported to communicate transparent mode supports D2D communication.Overall network efficiency can be improved in these transparent operations, because
To support that the UE of D2D communication can be with the UE shared-carrier of not supporting D2D to communicate.
In another example, it is assumed that carrier wave 700 just uses the channel (example adjacent with public safety channel (such as channel 14)
Such as channel 13), and network entity is not allowed to use RB0, RB1 and RB2.In these cases, network entity distribution RB4 and
RB5 is used for D2D reference signaling for for PUCCH and distributing RB3 by UE.
In another embodiment of the invention, network entity defines the first spectral emission area 708 and the second spectral emission area
RB (RB 730 and 718) in 710 one or more.These areas will usually be not used in data or control signaling, because to that
The limitation (such as being forced by law or industry license) of the power of signal in a little areas, for avoiding and adjacent-channel interference.So
And because the reference signal for D2D discovery purpose not necessarily must be strong as conventional control signals, UE can be incited somebody to action
Those RB are used for D2D reference signal.It is expected that the interference as caused by D2D reference signal is fairly small, as long as the transimission power of signal is protected
It holds in sufficiently low level.
In another embodiment of the invention, the technology in conjunction with described in Fig. 7 A can apply to polymerization carrier wave 750 (Fig. 7 B).It carries
The edge RB 0 of three component carriers 752,754 and 756 of wave 750 is used for for D2D reference signaling and RB 1 and 2
PUCCH.In conjunction with as described in Fig. 7 A, it is being used in the spectrum transmissions screen of D2D reference signaling by UE, one or more can be defined
RB 760。
In another embodiment, specific PUCCH resource index is defined to show instead to be that D2D reference signaling channel reservation can
For which part of normal (such as Rel-8LTE) control channel of PUCCH to be given.Pay attention to other supported by given PUCCH
Normal control channel can be HARQ-ACK channel, SRS channel, SR channel and the channel shape including rank information and precoding feedback
State information channel and channel quality feedback channel.The radio resource control that a part used as system information block is sent
(RRC) message informs (broadcast) index by higher level signaling signal.It can be determined and be used by the field in broadcast scheduling authorization
The PUCCH resource index or which D2D reference signaling channel of D2D reference signaling are executed in UE.These broadcast scheduling authorizations can also
To show that unscheduled/unallocated resource block of which of subframe can be used for arbitrary access or the transmission of D2D data.These broadcast schedulings
Authorization can also be known as competition authorization (contention grant).Based on User ID, (such as such as IMSI, radio net are whole
End indicator) and/or the hash function of subframe, time slot or radio frame index also can determine which D2D reference signaling channel is used
D2D reference signal is given in transmitting.If the PUCCH resource for D2D reference signaling is used only in the specific sub-frame of radio frame
Or in time slot or in particular radio frames, then also signal informs subframe about D2D reference signaling resource, time slot, and/or wireless
Electric frame indicator.It can useValue,Value orIdentify PUCCH resource index.It can also use that " scheduling is asked
Seek (SR) resource " combination of value or SR resource value and said one or multiple values, identification PUCCH resource index is all by net
Network physical signal is informed.Candidate radio resource collection for D2D reference signaling can be considered as one or more UE can be
The common source transmitted simultaneously in resource.
It in some embodiments, can be in the DL in the downlink operation frequency band of frequency division duplex (FDD) mode operating frequency band
In carrier wave, the configuration information in relation to reference signal is received from network entity by UE.It can be in the uplink of fdd mode working band
In UL carrier wave in working band, reference signal (from another UE) is received by UE.Although in the UL carrier wave of fdd mode working band
Middle reception reference signal, but can be received in individual carrier wave and transmit other related data (for example, for physical layer with D2D
The application data of other UE of transmission formatting).These individual carrier waves can be in different operating frequency band.Alternatively, can be
In UL carrier wave in the uplink working band of fdd mode working band, other data are received.It in some cases, can be with
In separate carrier, by UE transmission of reference signals.
After receiving reference signal from another UE (UE2), UE (UE1) can be believed by measuring reference signals and use with reference
Number related configuration information, determines the link-quality between UE1 and UE2.To determine link-quality, UE can be with measuring reference signals
Receive power (RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) or received signal strength indicator symbol (RSSI) or channel state information
(CSI).UE can report measured link-quality to the network entity for having received from it reference signal configuration information.Some
In the case of, UE can give measured Link Quality Reports to heterogeneous networks entity.Join for example, UE can be received from first transmission point
Signal configuration information is examined, and later, give (the D2D link between UE and UE2) Link Quality Reports to another transfer point.
Link Quality Reports are occurred in different subframes to network entity in general, UE receives reference signal and UE.To UE
The situation of reference signal is received in the UL carrier wave of fdd mode working band, only it is expected that UE be not scheduled in identical UL load
Reference signal is received in those of transmission subframe on wave.
Configuration information related with reference signal can include the information for the subframe that identification expectation UE receives reference signal, identification
It is expected that the information of the resource element in the subframe of UE reception reference signal, UE can receive RB index, the UE energy of the RB of reference signal
Receive reference signal RB RB offset (for example, D2D-RB-offset), identification reference signal sequence index information or with ginseng
