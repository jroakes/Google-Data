Definitions
- This invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for providing search results in response to an ambiguous search query provided by a user.
- WAP Wireless Application Protocol
- the WAP user navigates to the search query page, and is presented with a form into which they input their search query.
- the user may be required to press multiple keys to select a particular letter.
- the user would select the letter “b” by pressing the “2” key twice, or would select the letter “s” by pressing the “7” key four times.
- the user would ordinarily need to enter the following string of keypress: 223366077776444844, which map to letters as follows:
- Such a method includes receiving a sequence of ambiguous information components from a user.
- the method obtains mapping information that maps the ambiguous information components to less ambiguous information components.
- This mapping information is used to translate the sequence of ambiguous information components into one or more corresponding sequences of less ambiguous information components.
- One or more of these sequences of less ambiguous information are provided as an input to a search engine.
- the search results are obtained from the search engine and are presented to the user.

- a computer-readable medium may be defined as one or more memory devices and/or carrier waves.
- the software instructions may be read into memory 230 from another computer-readable medium, such as the data storage device 250 , or from another device via the communication interface 280 .
- the software instructions contained in memory 230 causes processor 220 to perform search-related activities described below.
- hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the present invention.
- the present invention is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
- the servers 120 and 130 may include one or more types of computer systems, such as a mainframe, minicomputer, or personal computer, capable of connecting to the network 140 to enable servers 120 and 130 to communicate with the client devices 110 .

- the server 120 may include a search engine 125 usable by the client devices 110 .
- the servers 130 may store documents (or web pages) accessible by the client devices 110 .
- FIG. 3 illustrates a diagram depicting three documents, which may be stored for example on one of the servers 130 .
- a first document contains two entries—“car repair” and “car rental”—and is numbered “3” at its bottom.
- a second document contains the entry “video rental”.
- a third document contains three entries—“wine”, “champagne”, and “bar items”—and includes a link (or reference) to Document 2.
- the documents shown in FIG. 3 only contain alphanumeric strings of information (e.g., “car”, “repair”, “wine”, etc.).
- the documents could contain other types of information, such as phonetic, or audiovisual information.
- FIG. 4 a illustrates a conventional alphanumeric index, based on the documents shown in FIG. 3 .
- the first column of the index contains a list of alphanumeric terms, and the second column contains a list of the documents corresponding to those terms.
- FIG. 4 b illustrates how a conventional search engine, such as search engine 125 , would use the index illustrated in FIG. 4 a to provide search results in response to an alphanumeric search query.
- the alphanumeric query may be generated using any conventional technique. For purposes of illustration, consider two alphanumeric queries: “car” and “wine”. Under a conventional approach, search engine 125 receives an alphanumeric query, such as a “car” (stage 410 ), and uses the alphanumeric index to determine which documents correspond to that query. (stage 420 ). In this example, a conventional search engine 125 would use the index illustrated in FIG.
- FIG. 5 a illustrates a flow diagram, consistent with the invention, of a preferred technique for providing search results in response to a numeric search query, based on the documents and index shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 a , respectively.
- FIG. 5 a describes a particular technique for processing a numeric query based on the mapping of a standard telephone handset; but those skilled in the art will recognize that other techniques consistent with the invention may be used.
- a sequence “227” (consisting of numeric components “2”, “2”, and “7”) is received from a user.
- information is obtained about how the numeric components map to letters. Assuming that the user entered the information from a standard telephone keypad, this mapping information is shown in FIG. 5 b . As shown in FIG. 5 b , the letters “a”, “b”, and “c” each map to the number “1”, the letters “p”, “q”, “r”, and “s” each map to the number “7”, and so forth.
- the sequence “227” is translated into its potential alphanumeric equivalents.
- the sequence “227” is translated into its potential alphanumeric equivalents.
- alphanumeric equivalents may be desirable to generate only those alphanumeric equivalents that appear in a dictionary, search engine log of previous search queries, etc.; or to otherwise limit the alphanumeric equivalents by using known statistical techniques (e.g., the probability of certain words appearing together).
- these alphanumeric equivalents are provided as an input to a conventional search engine, such as that described in reference to FIGS. 4 a and 4 b , using a logical “OR” operation.
- the search query provided to the search engine could be “aap OR bap OR cap OR abp . . . OR bar . . . OR car”.
- all possible alphanumeric equivalents may be provided to the search engine, a subset may instead be used by using conventional techniques to eliminate equivalents that are unlikely to be intended. For example, one could generate a narrower list of possible combinations by using techniques that draw upon probabilistic information about the usage of letters or words: one could ignore combinations that begin with “qt” but include (and favor) combinations that begin with “qu.”
- search results are obtained from the search engine. Because terms such as “aap” and “abp” do not appear in the search engine's index, they are effectively ignored. Indeed, the only terms contained within the index shown in FIG. 4 b are “car” and “bar”, and so the only search results returned are those that reference Documents 1 and 3.
- these search results are presented to the user. The search results may be presented in the same order provided by the search engine, or may be reordered based on considerations such as the language of the user. Assuming that the user was only interested in documents containing the term “bar”, the user would receive an undesired result (Document 3) in addition to the desired result (Document 1). This may be an acceptable price to pay, however, for the benefit of the user only having to press three keys to formulate the search query.
- FIG. 6 illustrates another flow diagram, consistent with the invention, of a preferred technique for providing search results in response to a numeric search query, based on the documents and index shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 a , respectively.
- This flow diagram demonstrates how increasing the size of the received sequence can help limit search results to those desired by the user.
- FIG. 6 again describes a particular technique for processing a numeric query based on the mapping of a standard telephone handset; but those skilled in the art will recognize that other techniques consistent with the invention may be used.
- a sequence “227 48367” (consisting of numeric components “2”, “2”, “7”, “4”, “8”, “3”, “6”, “7”) is received from a user.
- the sequence “227” will be called a “number word” and the entire sequence “227 48367” will be called a “number phrase.”
- the possible alphanumeric equivalents of a number word will be called “letter words” and the possible alphanumeric equivalents of a number phrase will be called “letter phrases.”
- stage 620 information is obtained about how the numeric components map to letters. Assuming the same mapping information is used as shown in FIG. 5 b , at stage 630 , the number phrase “227 48367” is translated into potentially corresponding letter phrases. Based on the information shown in FIG. 5 b , there exist 11664 possible letter phrases that correspond to the sequence “227 48367”.
- these letter phrases are provided as an input to a conventional search engine, such as that described in reference to FIGS. 4 a and 4 b , using a logical “OR” operation.
- the search query provided to the search engine could be “‘aap gtdmp’ OR ‘aap htdmp’ . . . OR ‘bar items’ . . . OR ‘car items’”.
- all possible letter phrases may be provided to the search engine, a subset may instead be used by employing conventional techniques to eliminate letter phrases that are unlikely to be intended.
- search results are obtained from the search engine. Because many search engines are designed to rank highly those documents that contain the exact phrase sought, Document 3 would likely be the highest ranked search result (i.e., because it contains the exact phrase “bar items”). No other document in the example contains one of the other letter phrases generated at stage 620 . Furthermore, many search engines downweight (or eliminate) search results that contain individual parts of a phrase but not the entire phrase. For example, Document 1 would be downweighted or eliminated because it contains the letter word “car”, which corresponds to the first part of the letter phrase, but it does not contain any letter word that corresponds to the second part of the letter phrase. Finally, letter phrases such as “aap htdmp” are effectively ignored because they contain no letter words that appear in the search engine's index.
- the search results are presented to the user.
- the first result shown to the user would be Document 3, which is likely most relevant to the user's query.
- Document 1 may be eliminated altogether, because it does not contain one of the possible letter phrases. In this manner, the user is provided with the most relevant search results.
- the received sequence may consist of the first letters corresponding to the keys pressed by the user.
- the received sequence may be “aap”.
- the equivalents letter sequences generated in stages 530 or 630 could then be other letter sequences (e.g., “bar”) that correspond to “aap.”
- the received sequence may contain phonetic, audiovisual, or any other type of information components.
- the received sequence be translated into a sequence that corresponds to the format in which information is stored in the search engine's index. For example, if the search engine's index is stored in alphanumeric format, the received sequence should be translated into alphanumeric sequences.
- mapping technique that is used to translate the received sequence of information components be the same technique that is employed at the user's device to map the user's input to the information generated by the device. There may, however, be instances where it is preferable to use a different mapping technique than is used for user input.
