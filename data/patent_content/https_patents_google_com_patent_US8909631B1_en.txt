- FIG. 6 is a block diagram of computing devices that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document, as either a client or as a server or plurality of servers.
- a search system may maintain usage information, which may include, for example, a query log which includes queries submitted by users to the search system.
- Each query log entry may include, for example, an indication of the location of the user, one or more query terms, and an indication of a location of interest.
- the location of interest may be determined, for example, based on the query terms or based on a location presented in a map application used to submit the query.
- the usage information can be processed to identify candidate queries which may be used to determine targeting information for a particular location of interest, where a candidate query for the location of interest may be identified based on the candidate query being associated with the location of interest and based on the candidate query being submitted from a location that is different from the location of interest.
- a request for content may be received from a user that is proximate to the location of interest or has expressed an interest in the location of interest. For example, the user may enter one or more query terms which are associated with the location of interest or the user may view the location of interest using a map application.
- content may be provided to the user based at least in part on the targeting information determined from the candidate queries.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to opt in/out of programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location).
- personal information e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of the user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example environment 100 for providing content to a user, for example, based on targeting information determined from queries that each reference a particular location of interest and that were submitted from a location different than the particular location of interest.
- the example environment 100 includes a network 102 , such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof.
- the network 102 connects websites 104 , user devices 106 , content providers 108 , publishers, and a content management system 110 .
- the example environment 100 may include many thousands of websites 104 , user devices 106 , and content providers 108 .
- the content management system 110 may be used for selecting and providing content in response to requests for content.
- the content providers 108 can be, for example, advertisers.
- a website 104 includes one or more resources 105 associated with a domain name and hosted by one or more servers.
- An example website 104 is a collection of web pages formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) that can contain text, images, multimedia content, and programming elements, such as scripts.
- HTML hypertext markup language
- Each website 104 can be maintained by a content publisher, which is an entity that controls, manages and/or owns the website 104 .
- a resource 105 can be any data that can be provided over the network 102 .
- a resource 105 can be identified by a resource address that is associated with the resource 105 .
- Resources 105 include HTML pages, word processing documents, portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and news feed sources, to name only a few.
- the resources 105 can include content, such as words, phrases, images and sounds, that may include embedded information (such as meta-information hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as JavaScript scripts).
- the environment 100 can include a search system 112 that identifies the resources 105 by crawling and indexing the resources 105 provided by the content publishers on the websites 104 .
- Data about the resources 105 can be indexed based on the resource 105 to which the data corresponds.
- the indexed and, optionally, cached copies of the resources 105 can be stored in an indexed cache 114 .
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 105 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones), and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes one or more user applications, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 can request resources 105 from a website 104 .
- data representing the resource 105 can be provided to the user device 106 for presentation by the user device 106 .
- User devices 106 can also submit search queries 116 to the search system 112 over the network 102 .
- Some search queries 116 can be submitted using a map application.
- the search system 112 can, for example, provide a map application which can present a search control along with a viewport for use in presenting location data. A map showing a particular location can be presented in the viewport and the user can enter one or more query terms using the search control.
- the search system 112 can access the indexed cache 114 to identify resources 105 that are relevant to the search query 116 .
- the search system 112 identifies the resources 105 in the form of search results 118 and returns the search results 118 to the user devices 106 in search results pages.
- a search result 118 is data generated by the search system 112 that identifies a resource 105 that is responsive to a particular search query 116 , and includes a link to the resource 105 .
- An example search result 118 can include a web page title, a snippet of text or a portion of an image extracted from the web page, and the URL (Unified Resource Location) of the web page.
- the search system 112 or the content information system 110 can update a query log 124 based on user activities.
- the query log 124 can include, for example, information about past user activities, such as past requests for resources 105 , past search queries 116 , other requests for content, web sites visited, or interactions with content.
- the query log 124 can be derived, for example, from one or more of a search query log, an advertisement log, or requests for content.
- the query log 124 can include, for each entry, a timestamp, an IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with a requesting user device 106 , a type of usage, a location of interest associated with the activity (if any), the location of the user when the activity occurred, and other details associated with the usage.
- IP Internet Protocol
- the query log 124 can be used for various purposes, such as to determine targeting information.
- targeting information can be determined for a particular location, such as to target users who appear to be traveling to the particular location or who have otherwise expressed an interest in the particular location.
- the content management system 110 can determine targeting information for a location based on historical information included in query log entries that match a pattern of users traveling to or planning to travel to the particular location.
- the content management system 110 can process query log entries of the query log 124 to determine a location of interest, if any, for each query log entry.
- search query terms may include or may indicate a location of interest.
- search query terms may include a zip code, a city name, or an address.
- a search query term of “Golden Gate Bridge” may indicate a location of “San Francisco”.
- a location of interest can also be determined based on recorded location information associated with a user's views of locations using a map application.
- the content management system 110 or the search system 112 can determine the location of the user at the time of submission of a query or at the time of some other user activity, based, for example, on an IP address of a user device 106 that submitted a request.
- the user device 106 can determine the location of the user using a location based service (e.g., a GPS (Global Positioning System) service) and can communicate the location to the search system 112 and/or the content management system 110 .
- a location based service e.g., a GPS (Global Positioning System) service
- a user's location can also be determined based on a mode (e.g., home, work, away) of the user.
- the content management system 110 can determine candidate queries that satisfy a candidate query criteria, where the candidate query criteria defines a candidate query as having been submitted from a location that is different from a location of interest associated with the candidate query.
- the content management system 110 can evaluate the determined candidate queries to determine targeting information for a location of interest associated with a given candidate query. For example, the content management system 110 can group the candidate queries by associated location of interest, and for each location of interest, the content management system 110 can identify frequently used search terms entered by users who performed the associated candidate queries. Targeting information can be determined based on the identified frequently used search terms, and, as described below, the targeting information can be used to provide content to a user based on a request for content received from the user.
- a request for content can be received from a user that is proximate to or has expressed interest in the location.
- a user can express interest in a location by, for example, providing one or more search query terms (such as a city name or address) that include or indicate the location.
- a request can indicate the location of the user and the content management system 110 can determine that the location indicated by the request is proximate to a location for which targeting information has been determined.
- a user device 106 can, for example, provide location information determined by a location based service available to the user device 106 .
- the content management system 110 can determine whether the user is traveling to the location, such as by comparing the location of the user to a home location associated with the user.
- the content management system 110 can provide content to the user based at least in part on the particular targeting information determined from the candidate queries associated with the particular location.
- the request for content can be, for example, a request for a resource 105 or a search query 116 from a user device 106 .
- the content management system 110 can select one or more content items that match the targeting information determined from the candidate queries associated with the location.
- the content management system 110 can use other criteria to select content items to provide in response to the request.
- the request for content can include characteristics (e.g., size, supported media types) of one or more content “slots” that are defined for the requested resource 105 or search results page.
- resource keywords associated with a requested resource 105 or a search query 116 can be provided to the content management system 110 .
- Content items selected by the content management system 110 can include content items having characteristics matching the characteristics of content slots and that are identified as relevant to specified resource keywords or search queries 116 .
- content items having targeting keywords that match the resource keywords or the search query 116 can be selected by the content management system 110 .
- the content management system 110 can also select content items at least in part based on the results of an auction.
- FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of an example system 200 for providing content to a user.
- the system 200 includes a query log 202 that includes historical information about queries and other content interactions associated with users of a search system 204 and/or a content management system 206 .
- the query log 202 can include information about search queries submitted to the search system 204 .
- the query log 202 includes information about search queries submitted by a user 208 .
- the user 208 can submit search queries while using the user device 210 while at work in San Diego.
- the user 208 can submit search queries while using the user device 212 while at home in Oceanside.
- the user device 210 may be the same device as the user device 212 or may be a different device.
- the user devices 210 and 212 can communicate with the search system 204 and with the content management system 206 over a network 214 .
- the query log 202 can include query log entries 216 .
- Each query log entry 216 can include an entry identifier 218 .
- Each query log entry 216 can also include a date and time stamp, an IP address associated with a user device used to perform an activity (e.g., submitting a search query), a location of interest, and location information about the user's location. A distance between the location of interest and the user's location can be stored or can be derived.
- the query log entries 216 can include a user identifier (e.g., a cookie) identifying the user who performed the activity. In some implementations, user identifiers are not stored in the query log entries 216 .
- a user's location may be determined based on an IP address of a user device that submitted the query.
- each IP address may be geo-coded, such as to determine an approximate location associated with the IP address.
- query long entries 216 with identifiers two and three, each associated with an “IP 2” IP address may each be associated with the location of Oceanside based on geo-coding the “IP 2” address to an approximate location of Oceanside.
- the query log entries 216 with identifiers two and three may have been submitted, for example, by the user 208 using the user device 212 .
- the Oceanside location may have been derived from a location based service (e.g., a GPS receiver) available to the user device 212 and the user device 212 may have provided location information to the search system 204 determined using the location based service.
- a location based service e.g., a GPS receiver
- the location of the user can be determined based on a mode of the user.
- a mode of a user can be, for example, home, work, or away (e.g., travel).
- a “home IP address” and a “work IP address” can be determined, based on historical information, for each user.
- a query log processor 217 included in the content management system 206 can sort the query log entries 216 by user and can process the query log entries 216 for each user to sort the query log entries 216 into groups based on the mode the user was in when performing the activity referenced in a respective query log entry 216 .
- the query log entries 216 may be evaluated and each entry 216 may be associated with a mode.
- a query log entry 216 may be associated with a particular mode based on the time of request being received during a predetermined time window that is associated with the mode.
- the query log entries 216 with identifiers two and three may each be associated with a home mode for the user 208 based on the associated activity being performed during evening hours rather than during first shift working hours.
- the query log entries 216 with identifiers six, seven, and eight may each be associated with a work mode for the user 208 based on the time of associated activity occurring during a work day.
- the “IP 3” address associated with the query log entries 216 with identifiers six, seven, and eight may be identified as a work IP address for the user 208 , for example, based on the “IP 3” address being associated with more work-mode related entries than any other IP address associated with the user 208 . Subsequent requests from the user 208 that occur during working hours or that occur from the “IP 3” address can be associated with the work mode and with the work location of San Diego. Similarly, the “IP 2” address may be identified as a home IP address for the user 208 , for example, based on the “IP 2” address being associated with more home-mode related entries than any other IP address associated with the user 208 . Subsequent requests from the user 208 that occur during non-working hours or that occur from the “IP 2” address can be associated with the home mode and with the home location of Oceanside.
- the content management system 206 or the search system 204 can determine that an IP address included in a request from the user 208 is greater than a threshold distance (e.g., one hundred miles) from both the work IP address and the home IP address of the user 208 .
- the content management system 206 or the search system 204 can determine that the user 208 is traveling, and a location that is a non-home and non-work location can be associated with the request, such as a location obtained by geo-coding the IP address included in the request.
- the query log processor 217 can determine a location of interest for each query log entry 216 and can determine whether the location of the user when performing the activity associated with the query log entry 216 is different than the location of interest for the query log entry 216 .
- a location of interest may be determined, for example, based on query terms submitted by a user. For example, a location of interest of “San Francisco” can be determined from query terms of “San Francisco transit”, “San Francisco attractions”, and “San Francisco weather” associated with the query log entries 216 with identifiers five, thirteen, and fourteen, respectively.
- a location of interest can also be determined based on a location presented in a map application used to submit a query.
- the query log entry 216 with identifier six is associated with a query submitted by the user 208 using a map application 220 illustrated on a display device 222 .
- the user 208 may have configured a viewport 224 to display an area including San Francisco and may have entered query terms of “historic attractions” using a search control 226 .
- Location information describing the San Francisco area location being presented in the viewport 224 can be provided to the search system 204 along with the “historic attractions” query terms included in the search control 226 .
- the received location information or location information derived from the received location information can be stored in the query log 202 .
- a location of interest can also be determined based on user interactions with content.
- the query log entry 216 with identifier seven corresponds to the user 208 selecting a search result 228 included in a search results area 230 .
- the query long entry 216 with identifier eight corresponds to the user 208 purchasing a tour of Alcatraz, such as by interacting with an advertisement 232 or by responding to information displayed after selecting the search result 228 .
- the query log entry with identifier three corresponds to the user 208 selecting a map marker (not shown) corresponding to a Presidio attraction located in San Francisco.
- Some query log entries 216 may not have a location of interest.
- the query log entry 216 with identifier one corresponds to a search query of “spring training” which has no particular associated location of interest.
- the query log entry 216 with identifier ten corresponding to a search query of “roll over IRA” does not have a particular associated location of interest.
- the query log processor 217 can determine a distance between the location associated with the query log entry 216 and the location of interest associated with the query log entry 216 . For example, for the query log entries 216 with identifiers of two and three, the query log processor 217 can determine a distance of four hundred sixty four miles between the user's home location of Oceanside and the location of interest of San Francisco. As another example, for the query log entries 216 with identifiers of six, seven, and eight, the query log processor 217 can determine a distance of five hundred three miles between the user's work location of San Diego and the location of interest of San Francisco.
- a determined distance may be zero, which may indicate that the user's location was the same as the respective location of interest.
- the distance between the location of interest and the user's location may be less than a threshold distance (e.g., less than one hundred miles).
- the query log entry 216 with identifier four may, for example, correspond to a user located in San Francisco submitting a query for a weather forecast for nearby Oakland.
- the query log processor 217 can determine query log entries 216 for which the location associated with the query log entry 216 is separated by at least the threshold distance from the location of interest associated with the query log entry 216 and can determine that such query log entries 216 qualify as candidate query log entries identified for further evaluation. For example, for the query log entries 216 with identifiers of two, three, six, seven, eight, eleven, twelve, and thirteen, the associated, respective location is greater than one hundred miles from the associated, respective location of interest.
- An evaluation engine 234 included in the content management system 206 can evaluate the candidate query entries to determine targeting information for a particular location of interest. For example, the evaluation engine 234 can group the candidate query entries by location of interest and can determine the most frequently used search terms associated with each location of interest, and can determine other targeting information, such as targeting keywords associated with content items (e.g., ads) frequently interacted with by users in association with the location of interest.
- content items e.g., ads
- the query log entries 216 with identifiers two, three, six, seven, eight, eleven, twelve, and thirteen can be candidate query log entries, with the query log entries 216 with identifiers two, three, six, seven, eight, and thirteen being associated with San Francisco.
- the query log entry 216 with identifier eleven, having a location of Oakland can also be considered relevant to the San Francisco area, depending on a value used for a configurable location area radius setting.
- the evaluation engine 217 can evaluate the candidate query log entries associated with the San Francisco area to determine targeting information, such as keywords “attractions”, “Presidio”, “historic attractions”, “Alcatraz”, “tours”, “Alcatraz tours”, and “San Francisco attractions”.
- the evaluation engine 234 can store determined targeting information, in association with a particular location of interest, in a targeting information database 236 .
- the content management system 206 can receive a request for content from a user that is proximate to the location of interest or has expressed an interest in the location of interest. For example, the content management system 206 can receive a request for content from a user device 238 associated with a user 240 who resides in Yuma, Ariz. The request can include, for example, keywords or other information that indicates a location of interest of San Francisco. As another example, the user 240 can use the map application 220 (or a similar application) to navigate to a location including or representing San Francisco and can submit a search query or other request using the map application 220 .
- a content selector 241 included in the content management system 206 can select one or more content items based at least in part on targeting information determined from the candidate queries associated with the location of San Francisco. For example, the content selector 241 can select one or more content items that have targeting keywords that match the targeting information determined from the candidate queries. The content management system 206 can provide the one or more selected content items to the user device 238 .
- the content management system 206 can determine that the user 240 is traveling in or is proximate to San Francisco (e.g., as illustrated by a user 242 ). For example, the content management system 206 can compare a home location of Yuma associated with the user 240 to a current location of San Francisco associated with a request received from a user device 244 associated with the user 240 .
