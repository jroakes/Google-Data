Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to telecommunications systems and data networks, and more particularly, to systems and methods for establishing direct routing of a signal between communications devices and data networks using a digital loop carrier (“DLC”)
- DLC digital loop carrier
- Telecommunications networks provide for both local calling within defined regions, and long-distance calling throughout the United States and other countries. These networks may be owned and operated by public and private companies, and governments. Some of these telecommunications networks are for the private use of the owning or operating entity. Others are operated by common carriers or by telecommunications service providers for use by the public or for use by a limited group of subscribers.
- Various communications devices may be used to communicate over telephone lines of existing telecommunications networks. Some devices are based on analog technology, such as conventional telephones, since they are designed to support the analog waveforms of human speech. Other devices, such as facsimile (“FAX”) machines and personal computers, are based on digital technology because data processed by these devices is encoded and manipulated in binary strings of data. Personal computers may communicate over telephone lines using modems or other similar devices known to those skilled in the art.
- FAX facsimile
- personal computers may communicate over telephone lines using modems or other similar devices known to those skilled in the art.
- Communications devices such as telephones or modems, are generally connected to a service switching port (“SSP”) of a local telecommunications network through a pair of wires, generally referred to as a “subscriber loop.”
- SSP service switching port
- a voltage is applied across the loop by the SSP to power the communications device, and to provide a mechanism for monitoring activity of the communications device. For example, when a calling party lifts the handset of a telephone to initiate a call, a switch in the telephone closes, enabling current to flow between the SSP and the telephone through the loop.
- the SSP detects current flow in the loop, and recognizes this as an “off-hook” condition.
- the SSP transmits a dial tone to the communications device, thus allowing the calling party to dial the number of a called party, the intended recipient for the call.
- Long-distance calling refers generally to the routing of calls over greater distances than those served by a local telecommunications network.
- a calling party served by an SSP of a first telecommunications network may place a long-distance call to a called party served by an SSP of another telecommunications network over long-distance carriers such as fiber-optic networks. This is typically done by dialing a “1” before dialing the digits of numbers used by the called party.
- Amplifiers have typically been used with circuitry for long-distance communication to compensate for signal attenuation as a call signal traverses long-distance circuitry. Because amplifiers are generally unidirectional, however, signals transmitted long-distance between telecommunications networks are generally separated into two distinct paths, such that signal transmission through each path is powered by a respective amplifier. One path is used for transmitting of call signals, and the other path is used for receiving call signals. Such signal splitting results in the use of a four-wire circuit, which is commonly referred to as a “trunk.”
- Various types of large capacity telecommunications networks have been specifically developed for the transport of data. These data networks typically use frame-relay (“FR”), asynchronous transfer mode (“ATM”), Internet protocol (“IP”) or other packet-based technologies for data transmission.
- FR frame-relay
- ATM asynchronous transfer mode
- IP Internet protocol
- the capacity of a data network is generally such that signals may be communicated through the network with minimal cost.
- data networks may provide relatively cheaper alternatives to conventional telephone networks for local, and particularly long-distance, telecommunications.
- Data networks are generally not designed to interface with existing telecommunications networks. This is because data networks typically communicate signals in the form of discrete packets or clocks of digital data, as explained above.
- telecommunications networks transmit telecommunications signals as continuous analog waveforms.
- the analog signal is desirably converted to digital form and then divided into blocks of appropriate size. These blocks of digital speech data are then communicated through the data network, individually. After the data blocks pass through the network, the blocks are reassembled, preferably in the order in which they were transmitted, to preserve any messages contained in the original analog voice signal. The reassembled digital voice signal is then converted back to an analog voice signal for communication to the called party.
- PSTN publicly-switched telephone network
- Most conventional techniques rely solely on the PSTNs and conventional long-distance publicly-switched telephone lines to establish the long-distance communications path.
- One example of a conventional long-distance communications system involves computers having video and audio capabilities. Each computer is coupled to a modem operating at, for example, V.34 modem speeds of approximately 33 Kbps.
- One of the computers calls from an originating telephone line served by a SSP of a first local telecommunications network, to another computer connected to a terminating phone line, served by the SSP of a second local telecommunications network.
- connection between local telecommunications networks is made over a dedicated PSTN network trunk.
- Another example of a conventional long-distance telecommunications system includes “FAX” machines similarly served by respective telecommunications networks and communicating with one another through only PSTNs. These connections require costly equipment, including computers and FAX machines, and therefore are not universally used. A need therefore remains to provide efficient merger of a local telecommunications network with a data network.
- PBX private branch exchange
- second PBX may be placed in communication with the data network.
- PBXs may then be connected via an analog trunk to various communications devices.
- the equipment responds to dialing, presents a ring voltage when a call is received, and passes caller identification data to a called party for an incoming call.
- the equipment presents each PBX with call progress tones such as ring back and busy tones when outbound calls are made.
- limitations exist with this technique since this technique is private, that is, generally within a single organization and not available to the public.
- Land et al. describes a “System and Method for Establishing a Call Telecommunications Path,” in U.S. Pat. No. 5,751,706.
- the system and method described by Land et al. allow for calls to be placed over packet-based telecommunications networks such as the Internet.
- calls are to be routed from a communications device such as telephone to a packet-based network through the switching equipment of a telecommunications network such as a PSTN.

- Originating DLC 116 is preferably one of the digital loop carrier products made by Alcatel USA, such as the Litespan®-2000 or Litespan®-Broadband DLCS and described in greater detail below.
- Line 120 is identified by originating SSP 110 according to a particular telephone number, and is supported by originating SSP 110 for the routing of calls to and from originating DLC 116 and originating communications device 114 .

- digital loop carrier refers to any such suitable carrier or switch, which may be coupled directly to a data network service provider to provide direct routing of call signals between the data network service provider and the communications device.
- the direct routing of calls to a DSP through the digital loop carrier has a number of significant advantages over the conventional routing of calls through local end office switching equipment.
- One advantage of coupling digital loop carriers directly to DSPs is that the cost per DS 1 or a primary rate interface (“PRI”) per port or per circuit is lower, as opposed to connecting local end office switching equipment to DSPs.
- PRI primary rate interface
- the number of switching elements required to transport call signals is reduced, as well as the cost of links which would be required to couple these network elements to one another.
- coupling digital loop carriers directly to DSPs provides for faster changing of activate direct calling routes.
- the cost otherwise imposed on telephone companies and data network service provider companies for using class 5 equipment for line side and trunk side long duration calls and data calls is reduced.
- originating DSP 122 is in communication with an originating megahub controller 128 .
- Originating megahub controller 128 is connected to originating DSP 122 by a network interface 130 , as shown in FIG. 1 .
- Originating megahub controller 128 communicates with and controls originating DSP 122 through this network interface 130 .
- Network interface 130 enhances call compatibility between originating network 104 and originating megahub controller 128 , and allows call signals to be communicated from originating network 104 to originating DSP 122 , as described in greater detail below.
- Network interface 130 also provides for the exchange of message signals and call connection information, including two-way call connection information, between originating megahub controller 128 and originating DSP 122 .
- originating megahub controller 128 is in communication with originating STP 108 of originating network 104 via an SS7 ‘A’ link 132 , and in communication with originating DLC 116 via a dedicated control link 134 .
- Dedicated control link 134 supports the exchanging of message signals between originating megahub controller 128 and originating DLC 116 for various purposes such as: (i) updating databases maintained in originating megahub controller 128 , (ii) communicating call connection information, including two-way call connection information, between original megahub controller 128 and originating DLC 116 , (iii) sending commands from originating megahub controller 128 to originating DLC to connect line card ports to direct trunk group 124 or other trunk groups connected to DSPN 122 , and (iv) disconnecting DLC 116 connections as may be required for calls to DSP 122 .

- FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of a system 200 sending telephony signals between a conventional telephone system 202 and an IP capable digital computer 204 through a data network, for example, Internet 206 , according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- Digital computer 204 has an internal modem which communicates directly with Internet 206 over a T 1 line 207 .
- the remainder of the devices and connections therebetween shown in FIG. 2 are similar to devices described with reference to FIG. 1, where like reference numerals indicate like parts throughout.
- digital computer 204 establishes a communications path with telephone system 202 to send a call signal, using methods described in greater detail below. Originating megahub controller 128 maintains this link with digital computer 204 , using call management techniques as described below.
- Megahub controllers 128 and 152 exchange information relating to the availability of resources to provide efficient routing of calls. These resources include devices such as SSPs and DLCs with which the respective megahub controllers communicate. For example, in FIG. 1, terminating megahub controller 152 periodically communicates to originating megahub controller 128 the availability of terminating SSP 138 and terminating DLC 144 to receive calls.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an alternative to the associated signaling of FIG. 1, in which direct coupling is used between megahub controllers for exchanging information as to resource availability.
- originating megahub controller 128 is coupled directly to terminating megahub controller 152 over a dedicated control link 302 .
- This direct connection between megahub controllers 128 and 152 represents a modification to system 100 of FIG. 1, in that direct link 302 between megahub controllers 128 and 152 supplements existing communications links between DSPs 122 and 150 through data network 102 . This results in faster call establishment and higher signaling capacity, as more bandwidth between DSPs 122 and 150 is available to carry call signals.
- both the originating DSP 122 and terminating DSP 150 are in communication with data network 102 .
- the originating 122 and terminating 150 DSPs are responsible for managing connections to data network 102 , and the DSPs monitor the quality of data links in data network 102 , particularly for the transportation of voice and other analog signals.
- DSPs 122 and 150 also serve in routing calls to data network 102 by prioritizing call signals to and from data network 102 .
- DSPs 122 and 150 may be in communication with several data networks, in which case the DSPs are configured to select a suitable data network from the several to carry a call signal.
- DSP 122 may be in communication with the Internet, a private intranet, ATM networks, and FR networks, and select one of these networks for transmission of a call signal. This selection may be based, for example, on the time of day, the availability of terminating DSP 150 , QoS requirements, cost, and the amount of traffic in the various data networks.
- each DSP includes a control circuit such as a service provider network circuit (PVC) for sending signals through the data network to other DSPs in the system, and receiving signals from the other DSPs.
- PVC service provider network circuit
- the control circuits preferably have encryption capabilities to ensure secure communications between the DSPs.
- Data signals transmitted through the DSP are desirably processed using packet segmentation and intelligent packet discard to maintain a tolerable quality of service across an otherwise sometimes unreliable data network, like the Internet.
- a terminating DSP receiving incoming calls from the data network is responsible for maintaining the packet sequence and delivering voice signals at the desired pace.
- both originating 128 and terminating 152 megahub controllers may be notified by the respective DSPs. Also, as described in greater detail below, during the call establishment stage of a telephone call, originating 122 and terminating DSPs 150 exchange information identifying the calling number and the called number, as well as the availability of resources such as modems and FAX connections to carry a call to or from a digital computer with modem, or a FAX machine, respectively.
- FIG. 4 is a schematic block diagram of an exemplary DSP 400 constructed according to the present invention, for use as an originating or terminating DSP in communications systems such as those illustrated in FIGS. 1-3.
- DSP 400 is coupled to a local digital switch (“LDS”) 402 , and a DLC 404 .

- Exemplary DSPs constructed according to the present invention may also include databases stored and maintained therein that identify megahub controllers in the communications system, which administer the routing of calls to particular telephone numbers. Preferable, these databases also identify associated routes to other DSPs in the system which are coupled to those megahub controllers. Exemplary DSPs may also manage billing. Billing records may be recorded within the DSP and maintained for individual calling parties. Preferably, any such billing is characterized by the format of the call signal (e.g., voice, FAX, modem).
- originating megahub controller 128 is configured to route call signals over data network 102 through any of various data links.
- Originating megahub controller 128 administers calls using a session protocol, which is recognized by other components in the system.
- the session protocol preferably protects against eavesdropping by parties other than the calling party and called party, and generally includes three stages: (i) call establishment, (ii) data transfer, and (iii) call termination, all of which are described in greater detail below.

- FIG. 5 is a schematic block diagram of an exemplary megahub controller 500 for use with a system such as those illustrated in FIGS. 1-3 for sending telephony signals between local telecommunications networks and devices over a data network, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
- Megahub controller 500 includes a group of control circuits 502 configured to send signals to and receive signals from various devices in a communications system.
- Control circuitry 502 may be linked to devices illustrated in FIGS. 1-3 via interfaces 504 , 506 , and 508 .
- interface 504 may be connected to SS7 ‘A’ link 132 for communications with originating STP 108 .
- interface 506 may be connected to network interface 130 for communications with originating DSP 122
- interface 508 may be connected to dedicated control link 134 for transmitting control signals to originating DLC 116 .
- Megahub controllers constructed in accordance with the present invention are used in communications systems such as system 100 of FIG. 1 to perform call management, that is, to administer the routing of calls through system 100 .
- Control circuitry 502 in originating megahub controller 128 is configured to administer the routing of outbound calls from a calling party to a called party.
- control circuitry 502 in terminating megahub controller 152 is configured to administer the routing of inbound calls from the called party to the calling party.
- Control circuitry 502 is also configured to “redirect” calls from a DLC directly to a DSP, in FIG. 1 for example, to originating DSP 122 through originating DLC 116 . Particular techniques used for establishing call paths for routing calls are described in greater detail below.
- an exemplary megahub controller maintains a network topology of the trunking facilities in a communications system in which it is used, including identifying various resources in the system such as DSPs, DLCs, and SSPs. Originating megahub controller 128 communicates with terminating megahub controller 152 through data network 102 , using an associated signaling arrangement, to administer and monitor usage of these various components of the system.
- the network topology maintained by megahub controller 500 is realized using databases, preferably stored within megahub controller 500 on a recordable medium 510 . These databases may be organized, for example, as routing tables with information identifying devices and components in the system with which the megahub controller communicates.
- databases are maintained by control circuitry 502 in megahub controller 500 , including an SSP database 512 identifying SSPs, such as local digital switches, coupled to and in communication with megahub controller 500 , indexed by telephone numbers of lines served by the respective SSPs.
- Megahub controller 500 further includes a MC database 514 identifying other megahub controllers in the communications system with which megahub controller 500 communicates, whether using associated or non-associated signaling or other signaling techniques known to those skilled in the art.
- megahub controller also includes a DSP database 516 identifying DSPs in communication with megahub controller 500 .
- the DSPs are preferably identified by addresses, for example, in the form of 5-digit carrier codes.
- the addresses which identify DSPs may take various forms, depending on the particular data network 102 used. For example, a DLCI number may be used if data network 102 is a FR network, or an E. 164 address may be used if data network 102 is an ATM network. If data network 102 is the Internet, this address is most likely an IP address.
- the DSP addresses are preferably indexed by codes which identify telephone lines served by the respective DSPs. For example, in FIG. 1, DSP 150 may be indexed by codes corresponding to first and second terminating telephone lines 146 and 156 .
- megahub controller 500 also includes a DLC database 518 identifying each DLC with which megahub controller 500 communicates to provide direct routing of calls to a DSP over, for example, direct trunk group 124 in FIG. 1 .
- the DLCs identified in database 518 are preferably indexed by telephone numbers identifying lines supported by the respective DLCs. For example, in FIG. 1, terminating DLC 144 is indexed by the telephone number corresponding to line 148 .
- the collection of telephone numbers served by respective DLCs is generally updated within each DLCs periodically, for example, on a daily or weekly basis. Thus, it is desirable that these numbers be periodically retrieved by megahub controller 500 from the respective DLCs.
- access identifier (“AID”) information may be used instead of telephone numbers in database 518 to identify telephone lines of the respective DLCs.
- megahub controller 500 includes a trunk group database 520 , which identifies: (i) particular trunk groups which provide routing of calls from SSPs to DSPs for transmission over the data network for each DSP identified in DSP database 516 , and (ii) trunk groups which provide direct routing of calls to DSPs from DLCs which are in communication with megahub controller 500 , for instance, direct trunk group 124 of FIG. 1 .
- the portion of trunk group database 520 dedicated to identifying connections between DLCs and DSPs preferably also inventories circuit members used by the respective DLCs for connection to the DSPs.
- the first stage of the session protocol administered by megahub controllers in communications systems involves establishing a communications channel or “call path” for transmission of a call signal over the data network.
- a calling party activates originating communications device 114 .
- communications device is a telephone
- the telephone is activated by lifting the receiver off of the telephone hook.
- Activation of originating communications device 114 is detected by originating DLC 116 , and recognized as an “off-hook” condition.
- the off-hook condition is then communicated by originating DLC 116 as a signal to originating SSP 110 over line 120 .
- originating SSP 110 Upon receiving the off-hook signal, originating SSP 110 relays a dial tone back through originating DLC 116 to originating communications device 114 .
- the calling party may then select a particular DSP for communicating the call signal to data network 102 , if provided with this option, or proceed directly with placement of a call by dialing the digits of a telephone number identifying a particular telephone line used by the called party, such as line 148 or line 156 .
- the dialed digits are communicated from originating communications device 114 to originating DLC 116 , and then to originating SSP 120 .
- the originating SSP 120 then communicates an initial address message (“IAM”) signal to originating megahub controller 128 through originating STP 108 .
- the IAM signal includes, at least: (1) information identifying the telephone number of originating telephone line 118 used by the calling party, (2) information identifying the telephone number of the called party, for instance, the number corresponding to first terminating telephone line 148 , and (3) a destination point code identifying terminating megahub controller 152 .
- Originating megahub controller 128 has verification circuitry configured to verify the destination point code, such as local number portability (“LNP”) databases which contain numbers identifying various terminating SSPs and terminating DLCs with which communications may be established over the data network, as explained above.
- LNP local number portability
- the destination point code of terminating megahub controller 152 is cross-referenced against the numbers in the MC database 514 to confirm that terminating megahub controller 152 is in communication with originating megahub controller 128 , to establish a call path.
- terminating SSP 138 is identified using the dialed telephone number, in this example, the number corresponding to line 148 .
- originating megahub controller 128 determines whether a data link between originating DSP 122 and terminating DSP 150 over data network 102 is available to carry the call signal, in step 602 . This entails decoding the dialed digits, and conducting a table-lookup in DSP database 516 using the decoded digits as an index. In this way, originating megahub controller 128 attempts to map the called number to terminating DSP 150 , to identify terminating DSP 150 as the DSP which serves terminating telephone line 148 .
- terminating DSP 150 If terminating DSP 150 is not identified, no data link is available between DSPs 128 and 150 , so originating megahub controller 128 signals originating SSP 110 to relay a busy signal back through originating DLC 116 to communications device 114 , in step 603 , and waits for a subsequent IAM signal to return to step 600 . If terminating DSP 150 is identified in the table look-up, the flow progresses to step 604 .
- step 604 involves originating megahub controller 128 determining whether the necessary resources are available, for example, in terminating DSP 150 , terminating network 106 , and terminating DLC 144 , to carry the call from data network 102 to the called party. This determination is discussed in greater detail below, with reference to FIG. 7 . Step 604 also involves determining whether the call can be routed from terminating DSP 150 to terminating communications device 142 directly through terminating DLC 144 , thereby bypassing terminating network 106 , which is discussed in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 8 .
- step 604 of FIG. 6 if the needed resources are unavailable, the flow progresses to step 603 , or originating megahub controller 128 may repeat step 604 one or more times at predetermined time intervals. If steps 602 and 604 are satisfied, originating megahub controller 128 lastly determines, in step 606 , whether the call signal can be routed directly to originating DSP 122 from originating DLC 116 along direct trunk 124 , bypassing originating network 104 . This determination is made by signaling between originating megahub controller 128 and originating DLC 116 over control link 134 .
- an SS7 bit is assigned a logical “1” in a signal passed from originating DLC 116 to originating megahub controller 128 if originating SSP 110 has any features activated on line 120 which do not support direct communication between originating DLC 116 and DSP 124 , as described in greater detail below with reference FIG. 8 .
- the call path is established between originating communications device 114 and the particular terminating communications device identified by the calling party through originating SSP 110 , using trunks 120 and 126 to define a link between originating DLC 116 and originating DSP 122 . If direct routing of the call from originating DLC 116 to originating DSP 122 over direct trunk 124 is possible, in step 610 , the call path is established between the communications devices over the data network similar to step 608 , however, the portion of the call path between originating DLC 116 and originating DSP 122 is established using direct trunk 124 .
- FIG. 7 is a flow diagram showing an exemplary method for determining whether resources are available in a communications system, such as system 100 of FIG. 1, to carry a call signal from a data network to a called party.
- the method of FIG. 7 is implemented using associated signaling, so communications between megahub controllers are relayed through DSPs over data network 102 .
- non-associated signaling arrangement as shown in FIG. 3 may be used, in which communications between megahub controllers are carried via dedicated control link 302 .
- originating megahub controller 128 then sends a call setup signal to originating DSP 122 .
- originating DSP 122 sends a connection request signal over data network 102 to terminating DSP 150 and terminating megahub controller 152 .
- the connection request signal is sent by originating DSP 122 using information conveyed from originating megahub controller 128 in the call setup signal, specifically: (i) the number of the calling party, (ii) the originating point code identifying originating megahub controller 128 , (iii) the destination point code identifying terminating megahub controller 152 , and (iv) the number of the called party.
- terminating megahub controller 152 Upon receiving the connection request signal, in step 701 , terminating megahub controller 152 indexes the trunk group database using the called party's telephone number to ensure that an SS7 trunk group exists to carry the call from terminating DSP 150 to determining SSP 138 . In step 702 , terminating megahub controller 152 sends SS7 messages to terminating SSP 138 through terminating DSP 150 , including trunk group and member number information. Call information for the calling party number used for CLASS calls is updated into the terminating number line memory of terminating SSP 138 . In step 704 , terminating SSP 138 then determines whether the call signal can be relayed there through to terminating communications device 142 .
- step 706 the terminating SSP communicates a misroute signal back to terminating DSP 150 , from which the misroute signal is relayed back through data network 102 to originating DSP 122 and originating megahub controller 128 .
- originating megahub controller 128 can then either reattempt to establish communications with the called party, or “tear down” communications with originating DSP 122 and data network 102 , in step 708 .
- “Tearing down” communications involves sending a release complete message (“RLC”) signal through originating STP 108 to originating SSP 110 to stop communications therewith.
- RLC release complete message
- originating megahub controller 128 signals originating DLC 116 to terminate the direct call path established between originating DLC 116 and originating DSP 122 . Originating megahub controller 128 may also forward the misroute signal to a megahub controller maintenance terminal (not shown).
- terminating DSP 150 sends a signal to terminating SSP 138 , over the SS7 trunk coupled therebetween, to determine which routing option should be used.
- This signal is preferably in TCAP message format.
- Terminating SSP 138 determines whether the call can be transmitted from terminating DSP 150 to terminating communications device 142 directly through terminating DLC 144 or, alternatively, if the call should be directed to terminating communications device 142 through terminating network 106 .
- FIG. 8 is a flow diagram showing an exemplary method terminating SSP 138 may use for establishing a direct communications path between a DLC and a DSP.
- This method is used to determine whether calls may be transmitted directly, from originating communications device 114 to originating DSP 122 over direct trunk 124 , and from terminating communications device 142 to terminating DSP 150 through terminating DLC 144 .
- the principles of this method apply to calls placed from originating communications device 114 to terminating communications devices 142 or 154 , and from terminating communications devices 142 or 154 to originating communications device 114 .
- the method of FIG. 8 is described below, however, only with respect to establishing a direct path between terminating DSP 150 and terminating DLC 144 , for simplicity.
- terminating megahub controller 152 sends a transactional capabilities application part (“TCAP”) message signal, which includes calling and called number information, to terminating SSP 138 .
- TCAP transactional capabilities application part
- terminating megahub controller 152 requests whether circuitry within terminating SSP 138 which serves terminating communications device 142 through terminating DLC 144 has any calling features activated for the dialed telephone number which are generally incompatible with DLCs. These features include call forwarding in step 800 , call waiting in step 802 , three way calling in step 804 , wire taps for eavesdropping by third parties in step 806 , or other features known to those skilled in the art which would not support a direct connection between terminating DSP 150 and terminating communications device 142 through a terminating DLC 144 .
- terminating SSP 138 sends to terminating DSP 150 , over the SS7 trunk therebetween, a response signal indicating that routing of the call through originating DLC 116 is not possible.
- This response signal is preferably in TCAP message format.
- Terminating DSP 150 receives and interprets the TCAP response signal, and establishes a portion of the call path between terminating DSP 150 and terminating DLC 144 through terminating SSP 138 , the default selection for the portion of the call path between terminating DSP 150 and terminating DLC 144 .
- terminating SSP 138 sends to terminating DSP 150 a response signal indicating that routing of the call through terminating DLC 144 is possible, in step 810 .
- terminating DSP 150 establishes a portion of the call path directly between terminating DSP 150 and terminating DLC 144 to communicate the call signal to terminating communications device 142 , bypassing terminating network 106 .
- DLC 144 sends an embedded operations channel (“EOC”) message to terminating SSP 138 over line 148 to indicate that line 148 is call “busy.”
- EOC embedded operations channel
- Terminating SSP 138 uses the TCAP calling number and called number information to update the line history block with called number information.
- terminating SSP 138 determines whether and any wire tap or call trace features are activated for line 148 .
- terminating SSP 138 After the call path is determined between terminating DSP 150 and terminating communications device 142 , terminating SSP 138 sends a “ring” signal through DLC 144 to communications device 142 . Immediately after the ring signal is transmitted, terminating SSP 138 sends terminating DSP 150 an address complete message (“ACM”) signal Upon receiving the ACM signal, terminating DSP 150 sends a call processing signal, as described above, back through data network 102 to originating DSP 122 and originating megahub controller 128 , along with a trunk identifier and call reference, so that communications may be established.
- ACM address complete message
- originating megahub controller 128 determines whether the call signal can be routed directly to originating DSP 122 from originating DLC 116 along direct trunk 124 , bypassing originating network 104 using the general method described above in FIG. 8 .
- originating megahub controller 128 conducts a table lookup in DLC database 518 using the number of the calling party to determine the appropriate trunk, for instance, direct trunk group 124 .
- Originating megahub controller 128 then signals originating DLC 116 to determine whether direct trunk group 124 is available. If direct trunk 124 is not available, then originating DLC 116 sends a “failed with cause” signal to originating megahub controller 128 .
- originating megahub controller 128 may wait a predetermined amount of time and reattempt to verify availability of direct trunk group 124 , before signaling originating DLC 116 , in step 608 , to transmit the call signal to originating SSP 110 over line 120 for transmission to originating DSP 122 , using conventional telephone switching in originating network 104 .
- originating SSP 110 has no features active which do not support direct routing of calls from originating DLC 116 to originating DSP 122 , and if direct trunk 124 is available, originating megahub controller 128 signals originating DLC 116 over dedicated control link 134 , in step 610 , to use direct trunk group 124 for routing of the call from originating DLC 116 to originating DSP 122 .
- This information may be in the form, for example, of a telephone number identifying direct trunk group 124 , possibly retrieved from trunk group database 520 , in FIG. 5 .
- megahub controller 128 also sends specific trunk group and line identification and circuit number information to originating DLC 122 , over dedicated control link 134 , to establish the connection between originating DLC 116 and originating DSP 122 .
- the call path is then complete, at which time originating DLC 116 sends a signal over line 120 to originating SSP 110 to indicate that line 120 is busy.
- a ring signal is applied to communications device 142 , as explained above.
- terminating DLC 144 Once the called party answers the call, e.g., lifts the telephone receiver off of the hook, an off-hook condition is recognized by terminating DLC 144 and terminating SSP 138 .
- Terminating SSP 138 then sends an answer message (“ANM”) signal to terminating DSP 150 , which may be relayed to terminating megahub controller 152 .
- Terminating megahub controller 152 or terminating DSP 150 may then send a connect signal, as described above, over data network 102 to originating DSP 122 . Thereafter, data may be transferred between the calling party and the called party over the established call path.
- NAM answer message
- originating DSP 122 receives a FAX transmission from either originating SSP 110 or originating DLC 116 , and typically stores the transmitted FAX data onto a local disk. Originating DSP 122 then sends the FAX signal to terminating DSP 150 , generally using either secure e-mail or FTP. Upon receiving the FAX signal, terminating DSP 150 then schedules delivery of the FAX signal to the called party via terminating DLC 144 and terminating telephone line 146 , assuming terminating DSP 150 and terminating DLC 144 support the FAX format of the signal.
- either party may terminate the call by opening the connection between the communications device used by that party and the DLC to which the communications device is coupled.
- the called party terminates the call by placing the receiver on the hook of the telephone.
- the terminating DLC 144 recognizes this as an “on-hook” condition, and communicates this condition as a signal to terminating SSP 138 .
- terminating SSP 138 sends a release message (“REL”) signal to terminating DSP 150 , from which the REL signal is relayed to terminating megahub controller 152 .
- REL release message
- terminating megahub controller 152 Upon receiving the REL signal, terminating megahub controller 152 sends a release signal (described in greater detail above) over data network 102 to originating DSP 122 , which forwards the signal to originating megahub controller 128 . Originating megahub controller 128 may then terminate communications with terminating megahub controller 152 .
- a user of any of the communications systems described above may act as the calling party or called party. If acting as the calling party, the user desirably is provided with the ability to select a communications path for the call signal he intends to send over the data network.
- Various systems and methods enable the user to make this selection, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention. For example, if DSPs in the communications system are programmed with carrier codes (e.g., 5 digit codes such as ‘10322’), a user may select a particular DSP for sending the call over the data network by dialing the carrier code of that DSP before the dialing the called number. This type of selection would override the default call routing through and between local telecommunications networks only such as PSTNs (without using data networks such as the Internet).
- carrier codes e.g., 5 digit codes such as ‘10322’
- the user may select a particular DSP as a carrier by dialing 800 or 900 numbers (e.g., dialing 1-800-xxx-xxxx, or 1-900-xxx-xxxx, where “xxx-xxxx” represents the number of the called party).
- the carrier selection may be programmed into a local SSP when the user orders telephone service from a corresponding local telecommunications networks, such that all calls would be routed through the data network by the particular DSP identified in the SSP programming.
- NXX number routing e.g., dialing xxx-xxxx or NPA-xxx-xxxx
- local 7 digit calls with conventional 6/10 digit routing e.g., dialing nxx-xxxx
- local toll or long distance calls e.g., dialing NPA-Nxx-xxxx.
