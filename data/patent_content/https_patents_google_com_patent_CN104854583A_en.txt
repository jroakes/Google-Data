Below explanation and accompanying drawing 8 to 10 describe the exemplary knowledge graph that can be used by realizations more of the present disclosure.To understand, knowledge graph is only the example of the data structure that can be used by search system, and can use any appropriate data structure.
In some implementations, any one or multiple data structured technology can be used, by Organization of Data in a database.Such as, data can be organized in the figure comprising the node connected by limit.In some implementations, data can comprise the statement about the relation between things and concept, and those statements can be represented as node and the limit of figure.Each node comprises one or more snippets data, and limit represents the relation between the data that are included in node that limit is connected to.In some implementations, figure comprises the one or more pairs of nodes connected by limit.Limit and thus figure can be directed, that is, unidirectional, can be nondirectional, namely two-way, or both, namely one or more limit can be nondirectional, and one or more limit can be directed in identical figure.Node can comprise any suitable data or data representation.Limit can any appropriate relation between data of description.In some implementations, while be labeled or annotate, it is made to comprise the connection between node and the descriptive information about this connection.Specific node can by different edge be connected to other nodes one or more or itself, make formed expansion figure.For purposes of clarity, the figure based on immediately structure described above is referred to herein as knowledge graph.In some implementations, knowledge graph is for expression information with provide information to come in handy in the search.
Fig. 8 illustrates the exemplary knowledge graph 800 comprising node and limit.Exemplary knowledge graph 800 comprises node 802,804,806 and 808.Knowledge graph 800 comprises the limit 810 of connected node 802 and 804.Knowledge graph 800 comprises the limit 812 of connected node 802 and node 806.Knowledge graph 800 comprises the limit 814 of connected node 804 and node 808.Knowledge graph 800 comprises limit 816 and the limit 818 of connected node 802 and node 808.Knowledge graph 800 comprises the limit 820 node 808 being connected to itself.Each above-mentioned group of limit node different from one or two can be called as triplets or tlv triple.As shown, node 802 is connected directly to three other nodes by limit, but node 804 and 808 is connected directly to two other nodes by limit.Node 806 is connected to only other nodes by limit, and in some implementations, node 806 is called as terminal node.As shown, node 802 is connected by two limits with 808, and the relation between instructs node is limited by more than one characteristic.As shown, node 808 is connected to itself by limit 820, and instructs node may relate to itself.Although exemplary knowledge graph 800 comprises be not marked as directed limit, will understand, each limit can be nondirectional or two-way.To understand, this example of figure is only example, and any suitable dimension on node and limit or layout can be used.
Usually, the node in knowledge graph can be grouped into multiple kind.Node can the model of relation between the organising data of presentation-entity, such as entity type and characteristic, literal value and other nodes.
The node of knowledge graph can presentation-entity.Entity is things or concept, its be single, unique, good limit with differentiable.Such as, entity can be people, place, article, idea, abstract concept, concrete element, other suitable things or its any combination.Entity typically refers to the concept of entity.To understand, in some implementations, knowledge graph comprises entity reference, and is not that the physics tool of entity resembles.Such as, entity can be that the physics tool of George Washington resembles, and entity reference is the abstract concept quoted George Washington.In another example, entity " New York " refers to physical metropolitan, and knowledge graph uses the concept as the physical metropolitan represented by the title of the element in such as data structure, entity, any other suitable element or its any combination.When appropriate, based on context, will understand term entity as used herein can correspond to entity reference, and term entity reference can correspond to entity as used herein.
Node is unique, this is because do not have two nodes to refer to identical things or concept.Usually, entity is included in things or concept that language is represented by noun.Such as color " blueness ", city " San Francisco " and imaginary animal " unicorn " are each can be entity.
Represent that the node of organising data can be included in knowledge graph.These can be called as entity type node at this.As used herein, entity type node can refer to the node in knowledge graph, and simultaneously entity type can refer to the concept that represented by entity type node.Entity type can be the restriction feature of entity.Such as, entity type node Y can be connected to entity node X by "Yes" limit or link, as discussed further below, makes figure represent information " entity X is type Y ".Such as, entity node " George Washington " can be connected to entity type node " president ".Entity node can be connected to multiple entity type node, and such as, " GeorgeWashington " can also be connected to entity type node " people " and entity type node " officer ".In another example, entity type node " city " can be connected to entity node " New York " and " San Francisco ".In another example, concept " high people " (but do not limit completely, that is, it must not comprise the definition of " height ") can exist as entity type.In some implementations, the existence of entity type node " high people " and other entity type nodes can based on user interactions.
In some implementations, entity type node can comprise or be connected to about following data: the list of the characteristic be associated with this entity type node, the territory belonging to entity type node, description, value, any other appropriate information or its any combination.Territory refers to the set of related entities type.Such as, territory " film " can comprise such as entity type " performer ", " director ", " camera site ", " film ", any other suitable entities type or its any combination.In some implementations, entity is associated with the type in more than one territory.Such as, entity node " Benjamin Franklin " can be associated with the entity type node " statesman " in territory " government " and the entity type node " inventor " in territory " business ".
In some implementations, the characteristic be associated with entity node or entity type node also can be represented as node.Such as, the node of characterization " population " or " position " can be connected to entity type node " city ".The combination of entity type and characteristic thereof and/or layout are called as pattern (schema).In some implementations, pattern is stored in the table or other appropriate data structure be associated with entity type node.In some implementations, knowledge graph can be from limiting or bootstrapping, it is comprised limit node, the specific node of concept of limit and figure itself and limit.Such as, knowledge graph can comprise entity node " knowledge graph ", and " knowledge graph " is connected to description and such as " has node " and the property node of the characteristic of the knowledge graph of " having limit ".
The particular value being called as word in some implementations can be associated with special entity in terminal node on the limit by qualified relation.Word can refer to value and/or bit string.Such as, word can comprise date, title and/or quantity.In one example, entity node " San Francisco " can pass through the limit that utilization level " has population " and annotate and is connected to the terminal node comprising word " 815,000 ".In some implementations, terminal node can comprise other information pointed in the one or more documents quoting or link and be stored in outside knowledge graph of long text string.In some implementations, word is stored in knowledge graph as node.In some implementations, word is stored in knowledge graph, but not being assigned with unique identification described below quotes, and can not be associated with multiple entity.In some implementations, literal type node can limit the type of word, such as " date/time ", " quantity " or " gps coordinate ".
In some implementations, the grouping of limit and two nodes is called as tlv triple.Tlv triple represents the relation between node, or in some implementations, represents node and the relation between itself.In some implementations, to comparatively high-level relationships modeling, such as four-tuple and n-ary relation, wherein, n be greater than 2 integer.In some implementations, be stored in node to the information of relationship modeling, it can be called intermediary node.In one example, information " artifact Y donates to museum Z by people X " is stored in the intermediary node being connected to entity node X, Y and Z, and wherein each limit identifies the role of each respective connection entity node.
In some implementations, knowledge graph can comprise for item and/or the differentiation of entity and the information of disambiguation.As used herein, distinguish and refer to many-one situation, wherein, multiple title is associated with single entity.As used herein, disambiguation refers to one-to-many situation, and wherein, same names is associated with multiple entity.In some implementations, node can be assigned with unique identification and quotes.In some implementations, unique identification is quoted can be alpha-numeric string, title, numeral, binary code, any other appropriate identification symbol or its any combination.Unique identification is quoted and search system can be allowed will uniquely to quote the node distributed to and have identical or similar textual identifier.In some implementations, unique identifier and other technologies differentiation, disambiguation or both in use.
In some differentiation realize, node or can be distinguished another name and is associated with multiple item, and wherein, item is associated with identical entity.Such as, item " Geogre Washington ", " Geo.Washington ", " presidential Washington " and " presidential George Wahsington " can all be associated with the single entity (i.e. node) in knowledge graph.This can provide differentiation in knowledge graph and simplification.
In some of disambiguation realize, multiple nodes with identical or similar title are quoted by their unique identification, by the associated nodes in knowledge graph, limited by any other appropriate information or its any combination.Such as, the entity node be associated about city " Philadelphia ", the entity node be associated with film " Philadelphia " and the entity node about cream cheese trade mark " Philadelphia " can be there is.Each in these nodes can have unique identification and quote, such as, be stored as numeral, for the disambiguation in knowledge graph.In some implementations, the disambiguation in knowledge graph is provided by the connection between multiple node and relation.Such as, can by city " New York " and state " New York " disambiguation, this is because city is connected to entity type " city ", and state is connected to entity type " state ".To understand, more complex relationship can also limit and disambiguation node.Such as, node can by associated type, by be connected to by particular characteristics its other entities, by its title, be defined by any other appropriate information or its any combination.It is useful when these are connected to disambiguation, such as, the node " Georgia (Georgia) " being connected to node " U.S. " can be understood to represent the U.S., and the node " Georgia " being connected to node " Asia " and " Eastern Europe " can be understood to the country representing Eastern Europe.
In some implementations, node can comprise or be connected to the data limiting one or more attribute.Attribute can limit the special characteristic of node.The particular community of node can depend on what node represents.In some implementations, entity node can comprise or be connected to: unique identify quote, the list of the entity type that is associated with node, the list called for the differentiation of node, the data be associated with entity, entity textual description, refer to the linking of stereotropic textual description, other appropriate information or its any combination.As mentioned above, node can comprise and points to long text-string and be stored in outside knowledge graph quoting or linking of other information in one or more documents.In some implementations, memory technology can depend on customizing messages.Such as, unique identification is quoted and can be stored in node, and short message character string can be stored in terminal node as word, and the long of entity describes in the outside document that can be stored in by the Reference-links in knowledge graph.
Limit in knowledge graph can represent that the semanteme of the relation between restriction two nodes connects.Limit can represent preposition statement, such as "Yes", " having A ", " for category-A type ", " having characteristic ", " having value ", any other suitable statements or its any combination.Such as, the entity node of particular person can be connected to the terminal node of the word comprising the his or her specific birthday by " birthday " limit.In some implementations, connect by the limit of entity the node that the characteristic limited can relate to the type being connected to this entity.Such as, entity type node " film " can be connected to entity node " performer " and " director ", and particular film " can have performer " and be connected to by limit characteristic the entity node representing specific actors.
In some implementations, node and margin determine the relation between entity type node and characteristic thereof, thus definition mode.Such as, entity type node can be connected to the node be associated with characteristic by limit, and it can be called property node.The entity of the type can be connected to the node of the particular value limiting those characteristics.Such as, entity type node " people " can be connected to property node " birthday " and node " highly ".And node " birthday " can be connected to literal type node " date/time ", the word be associated with " birthday " is indicated to comprise date/time information.The entity node " George Washington " being connected to entity type node " people " by "Yes" limit can also pass through limit " to be had the birthday " and is connected to word " on February 22nd, 1732 ".In some implementations, entity node " George Washington " is connected to " birthday " property node.To understand, in some implementations, pattern and data use and are constructedly modeled and are stored in knowledge graph.In this way, pattern and data can by same search technology accesses.In some implementations, pattern is stored in independent table, figure, list, other data structures or its any combination.Also will understand, characteristic can be modeled by node, limit, word, any other suitable data or its any combination.
Such as, entity node " George Washington " can be connected to the entity type node of expression " people " by "Yes" limit, thus the entity type of instruction entity, and limit can be passed through " there is the birthday " and be connected to word " on February 22nd, 1732 ", thus limit the characteristic of entity.In this way, knowledge graph is defined through and is connected to other nodes, the entity type be associated with special entity and characteristic.In some implementations, " on February 22nd, 1732 " can be node, makes it be connected to other events occurred on this date.In some implementations, the date can be connected to further a year node, the moon node and day node.To understand, this information can be stored in any appropriate combination of word, node, terminal node, interconnection entities, any other suitably-arranged or its any combination.

In frame 1240, search system is by corresponding to the modifier of modifier 1222, the root node 1242 that annotate query is set.Search box comprises limit 1244, and it can comprise the information identical with the limit 1236 of frame 1230, and child node 1246 can comprise the information identical with the child node 1234 of frame 1230.In some implementations, rule, be such as up to minimum direction and other sequencing informations can be included in the annotation of root node 1242.Be in an example of " the oldest " at modifier 1222, root node 1242 " can be sorted by the age, the most experienced the youngest " annotation by information, makes tree representation information " city in Continental Europe, by from the most experienced minimus age sequence ".
Figure 13 to Figure 16 describes the technology be included in the query tree of the query tree of the frame 1230 generating such as Figure 12.To understand, query tree can be generated by any appropriate technology.Will be further understood that, when not using query tree, Search Results can by rank.In some implementations, generated query tree partly can depend on the information in the knowledge graph being stored in the knowledge graph described in such as Fig. 8 to Figure 10.
Figure 13 illustrates according to exemplary natural language processing Figure 130 0 realized more of the present disclosure.In some implementations, search system uses natural language processing, to resolve search inquiry.Parsing can comprise the relation between a part, meaning and the word in inquiring about identifying word, voice.
View 1300 illustrates the natural language processing of search inquiry " the Tom Hanks films of 2010 ".In some implementations, search system by query division be search unit " Tom Hanks " 1304, " film " 1302, " ... in " 1306 and " 2010 " 1308.In some implementations, search system, based on phrasal lexicon, search history, user preference, preset parameter, default, any other suitable parameters or its any combination, divides search inquiry.In some implementations, search system determines the part of the voice of each search unit.Such as, search system can determine that " film " 1302 is common nouns, and " Tom Hanks " 1304 is proper nouns, " ... in " 1306 are prepositions, and " 2010 " 1308 are quantity.To understand, this specific part of phonic symbol is only example, and can use any suitable identification and/or symbol.In some implementations, search system determination semantic function, or depend on the search unit in search inquiry.Such as, search system can determine that " film " 1302 is roots of inquiry, and " Tom Hanks " 1304 is noun attributes, and namely it modifies root, " ... in " 1306 are prepositions, and " 2010 " 1308 are objects of preposition.In some implementations, the oriented relation between the search unit of search system distribution as shown in view 1300.Such as, " ... in " 1306 and " Tom Hanks " 1304 are child nodes of root " film " 1302, and 2010 be " ... in " son of 1306.In some implementations, natural language processing is used to identify the associated nodes in knowledge graph, uses the information from knowledge graph, relates to the data structure of such as knowledge graph in any way as suitable, or its any combination.Also will understand, search system when not relying on knowledge graph, can perform natural language processing.
Figure 14 illustrates according to exemplary trees of phrases 1400 realized more of the present disclosure.In some implementations, tree of phrases generates by word and phrase are distributed to tree topology from search inquiry.In some implementations, tree topology comprises node and limit.In the example shown, the search inquiry received is " the Tom Hanks films of 2010 ".Received query division is multiple search unit by search system, and it comprises one or more word.Search unit " film " is assigned to root node 1402.Search unit " Tom Hanks " is assigned to child node 1404.Search unit " ... in " be assigned to limit 1406.Search unit " 2010 " is assigned to grandchild node 1408.To understand, in some implementations, the node of tree topology can be associated with the limit in tree of phrases or node, such as limit 1406.In some implementations, the structure of tree of phrases is related to by the dependence of natural language processing identification.To understand, this is only example, and in some implementations, can use other technologies.
To understand, tree of phrases 1400 is only example, and based on any suitable search inquiry, can generate any suitable tree or the inquiry of other pattern handling.Also will understand, in some implementations, query tree is a kind of theoretical construct, and while relying on the relation described by tree of phrases, search system does not use figure as shown in Figure 14 to represent.
Figure 15 illustrates according to exemplary query trees realized more of the present disclosure.In some implementations, search system, based on one or more tree of phrases, generates one or more query tree.In some implementations, query tree will have the topology identical with corresponding tree of phrases.In some implementations, the data in the data structure of search system identification such as knowledge graph, wherein, data are associated with each search unit distributing to tree of phrases.Search system is by by data structure data or quote the position be placed on the data query corresponding with the position of the relevant search unit on tree of phrases, generated query data to data.
Query tree 1500 comprises the query tree of the tree of phrases 1500 relating to Figure 15.Query tree 1500 comprises " type: film " root node 1502.In some implementations, root node 1502 corresponds to the search query term of " film " root node 1402 of Figure 14.In some implementations, search system can identify the data in the data structure of such as knowledge graph, and Search Results " film " relates to entity type node " film ".Search system can construct query tree, and wherein, root node is associated with " film " node of knowledge graph.In some implementations, query tree can also comprise the unique identification be associated with related data structures node, character string, value, node relationships information, any other appropriate information or its any combination and quotes.
Query tree 1500 comprises " entity: the Tom Hanks " node 1506 being connected to root node 1502 by " characteristic: by ... the film of protagonist " limit 1504.Be similar to root node, node 1506 can be assigned with based on the data structure data identified be associated with the tree of phrases node 1404 of Figure 14.Query tree 1500 comprises " value: the 2010 " node 1510 being connected to root node 1502 by " characteristic: date issued " limit 1508.Node 1510 can be such as associated being worth the terminal node that " 2010 " be included in data structure.To understand, query tree 1500 is only example, and any suitable query tree can be generated based on any suitable search inquiry.
In some implementations, search system can based on popularity, Operation system setting, user preference, preset parameter, ranked list, with the relation of other search units, any other appropriate information or its any combination, identify related data structures data.Such as, famous actor " Tom Hanks " can be distributed to node 1506 by search system, instead of seismologist " TomHanks ", this is because the global popularity of performer.In some implementations, due to the word " film " in search inquiry, cause selecting performer " Tom Hanks ".In some implementations, the search inquiry for " Tom Hanks earthquake " can cause search unit " Tom Hanks " to be associated with the seismologist " Tom Hanks " in data structure.That in another example of unique search unit, search system can rely on popularity score value at " Tom Hanks ".
In some implementations, search system can based on the relation in the data structure between the node about query tree node, by information distribution to the limit of query tree.Such as, search system can " Tom Hanks " entity reference in identification data structure and " film " entity type in data structure.Search system can determine that the relation between data structure node is " by ... the film of protagonist "." by ... the film of protagonist " can be distributed to the limit 1504 of query tree by search system.In some implementations, the limit of query tree can be assigned with based on data relation, data structure characteristics, search unit, related search queries, user's input, user preference, default, preset parameter, any other appropriate information or its any combination.
In some implementations, multiple queries tree can be generated based on multiple tree of phrases.In some implementations, query tree can be generated for multiple tree topology.In some implementations, topology can be selected based on the relation identified between the node of data structure.Thus if the topology of query tree requires the relation of will distribute between uncorrelated in data structure or weak two relevant nodes, it is favourable that search system can consider that tree topology is not so good as the topology of uncorrelated node in the individual branches of tree.In some implementations, score value is distributed to the query tree of each generation by search system, and selects tree by the score value expected most.In some implementations, score value is based on the relation in the data structure between associated nodes, user preference, global popularity, Operation system setting, preset parameter, any other appropriate information or its any combination.Such as, can be assigned to the query tree comprised with following characteristic compared with high score: compared with accessed with not too common or not too welcome characteristic, described limit characteristic is more commonly accessed or more welcome in data structure.In another example, limit characteristic comprises the rank of the score value contributing to query tree.
Figure 16 illustrates the process flow diagram 1600 according to the illustrative steps for generated query tree realized more of the present disclosure.In some implementations, the step of process flow diagram 1600 relates to by the step shown in Figure 13 to Figure 15.In some implementations, the step of process flow diagram 1600 comprises data structure, such as knowledge graph, database, index, any other suitable construction or its any combination.The knowledge graph below further described comprises node and limit, and wherein, information is by the data representation in the annotation limit of the relation be stored between node and description node.
In step 1602, search system resolves the first search inquiry, to identify search unit.In some implementations, search inquiry is resolved as one or more search unit.In some implementations, search unit comprises one or more word.Such as, search unit can be single word, such as " film ", or phrase, such as " Tom Hanks ".In some implementations, the searching request received is divided into multiple search inquiry.Such as, search inquiry can be resolved as shown in the frame 1220 of Figure 12.In some implementations, resolve the natural language that can comprise as shown in Figure 130 0 of Figure 13 to resolve.In some implementations, search unit is identified with the node matching in knowledge graph by making the part of search inquiry.In one example, search inquiry " best purchase " can be identified as relating to e-shop's " best purchase ", individual data structure node, or can be identified as relating to two independent knowledge graph nodes for " the best " and " purchase ".Search system can be determined to divide based on global popularity, user preference, user's input, Operation system setting, any other appropriate information or its any combination.In some implementations, search system can present multiple possibility search unit, for refining and/or selecting to user.In some implementations, search system uses the later step of multiple combination flowchart 1600 of search unit, and selects search unit combination based on such as query tree or Search Results.In some implementations, resolve search inquiry and comprise natural language processing.
In step 1604, search system identification corresponds to the element of the data structure of the such as knowledge graph of search unit.In one example, search system identification is corresponding to the node in the knowledge graph of the search unit identified in step 1602 or limit.In some implementations, identify corresponding node or limit comprise recognition category like or matched text, similar or coupling correlation properties, any other appropriate technology or its any combination.Such as, search inquiry " film " can be identified as corresponding to knowledge graph node " film ".In some implementations, multiple possibility corresponding node can be identified, and node can be selected based on the interdependent node in the degree of being associated of global popularity, coupling, knowledge graph, other search units, user's input, preset parameter, user preference, Operation system setting, any other appropriate information or its any combination.
In step 1606, search system generates topology.In some implementations, topology comprises the layout on node and limit.In some implementations, the quantity of node is identical with the quantity of search unit.In some implementations, search system generates multiple topology.In some implementations, search system selects one in multiple topology in post-processing step, such as after each tree topology generated query tree.In some implementations, the specific arrangements of topology is based in part on natural language processing and/or any other appropriate technology for identifying dependence between search unit and relation.In some implementations, the quantity of node can be identical with the quantity of search unit.In some implementations, can based on the content of those unit, from the quantity of the quantity regulating node of search unit.Such as, such as the article of " (a) " and " being somebody's turn to do (the) " can be omitted when determining the quantity of node.
In step 1608, search system generates tree of phrases.In some implementations, the tree of phrases 1400 of Figure 14 is the example of the tree of phrases generated in step 1608.In some implementations, the tree of phrases of step 1608 can comprise the tree topology generated in step 1606.In some implementations, the search unit identified in step 1602 is distributed to the node of the tree topology generated in step 1606 by search system.In some implementations, the node of tree topology is assigned to the limit of tree of phrases.Such as, as shown in the tree of phrases 1400 of Figure 14, search unit " ... in " be assigned to limit.In some implementations, the node that multiple tree of phrases distributes to tree topology by search unit difference arranged is generated.Similarly, multiple tree of phrases is generated based on multiple tree topology.In some implementations, based on the further process of the tree of phrases of the generation of the data in the data structure of such as knowledge graph, natural language processing, user's input, Operation system setting, such as query tree, preset parameter, any other appropriate information or its any combination, select tree of phrases from multiple tree of phrases.
In step 1610, search system generated query is set.In some implementations, be based in part on the element of the tree of phrases generated in step 1608 and the data structure corresponding to the search unit identified in step 1604, generated query is set.In some implementations, the query tree 1500 of Figure 15 is the example of the query tree generated in step 1510.In some implementations, the query tree generated in step 1610 can have the topology identical with the tree of phrases generated in step 1608.In some implementations, the data from data structure can be distributed to the node of query tree by search system.In some implementations, from the data of data structure be the search unit of the node be identified as corresponding to the tree of phrases be assigned in same position.Thus generated query tree can be counted as the search unit replacing distributing to the node of tree of phrases with their respective data structures element.
In some implementations, information is assigned to the limit as the query tree described for the query tree 1500 of Figure 15.In some implementations, the relation between the node of query tree can be identified based on the relation between the respective nodes in data structure.Such as, if the node corresponding to two nodes in query tree is connected by the particular characteristics in data structure, the query tree node connecting those nodes can be assigned with this characteristic.In some implementations, query tree limit can be assigned with based on data structure data, search unit, search inquiry, user's input, Operation system setting, global search history, user preference, any other suitable preference or its any combination.In some implementations, the node of query tree is associated with any suitable data from data structure, such as entity node, entity type node, word, character string or its any combination.In some implementations, multiple queries tree is generated based on multiple tree topology of step 1606 and/or multiple trees of phrases of step 1608.Query tree based on above-mentioned score value, based on user's input, by any other appropriate technology or its any combination, can be selected from multiple queries tree.
In step 1612, search system uses query tree search result.In some implementations, search system can use query tree, from the data structure of such as knowledge graph, and search result.Such as, search system can from having the data structure with the relation of the relationship match described by query tree, retrieval entity reference.In some implementations, search system can use query tree from internet, from database, from the list of information, from any other suitable data or data structure, or its any combined retrieval Search Results.In one example, search system by being similar to those the relation mapped by query tree, a part for identification data structure, and can identify the entity reference about the entity reference be included in mapped relation.In the example of the query tree 1500 of Figure 15, search system can be identified and be connected to entity reference " Tom Hanks " with by characteristic " film is performed " and the entity reference of the data structure be associated by the entity type " film " that characteristic is connected to value 2010 date issued.To understand, and map and compare and performed by any appropriate technology with any proper order.Also will understand, in some implementations, the data in query tree may relate to MDL inquiry, Dgraph inquiry, for any other suitable inquiry of search result or its any combination.
To understand, the step of process flow diagram is only example, and in some implementations, step can be added, omits, copies, records or revise in addition.
Figure 17 illustrates according to process flow diagrams comprising the illustrative steps for placement search result realized more of the present disclosure.
In step 1702, search system receives search inquiry.In some implementations, search system receives the Search Results in the text box of the search query box 102 of such as Fig. 1.In some implementations, search inquiry can comprise the search query box as described for the search query box 202 of Fig. 2.In one example, search system receives the character string of one or more words of indicative of desired search.In some implementations, search inquiry comprises text, image, audio frequency, any other appropriate content or its any combination.
In step 1704, the modification concept in search system identification search inquiry.In some implementations, the search inquiry received in step 1702 can be resolved or be processed in addition to search system, to identify modifier.In one example, search system uses natural language processing to identify the explicit search inquiry of such as description in Figure 130 0 of Figure 13.In some implementations, search system uses the data structure of such as knowledge graph, identifies that the implicit expression be associated with the one or more words in search inquiry modifies concept.In some implementations, the entity type that is associated with search inquiry of search system identification.Such as, search system can determine that date issued modifies concept to the implicit expression of the search of movie title.In another example, search system can determine that depth of building is that the implicit expression be associated with to the search of skyscraper modifies concept.In some implementations, search system determines more than one implicit expression, explicit or implicit expression and explicit modification concept, and selects one or more modification concept based on popularity, user preference, Operation system setting, user's history, global search history, the degree of correlation, any other suitable parameters or its any combination.
