Abstract
Temporary modifications of media content metadata are disclosed. An easy-to-use metadata modification system is described for obscuring video metadata to encourage recipients to view video when sharing video between different client devices. A content item is received at a first client device associated with a first user account. The content item may include metadata associated with the content item and metadata associated with a sender of the content item. The content item may be displayed on the client device, the content item having at least some metadata obscured from view. In response to input to the client device, previously obscured metadata may be provided for display on the client device.
Description
Description of the division
The present application belongs to the divisional application of Chinese patent application No.201880022011.6 whose application date is 2018, 1 and 23.
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates generally to modifying metadata of content, and more particularly to modifying metadata of content when sharing content between users.
Background
With the support of many websites, video content sharing on websites has evolved into a phenomenon. Thousands of media are distributed every day, and this number is increasing, as the devices and opportunities for capturing video become easier to use and more prevalent. As this phenomenon increases, the media can also "infect" and spread to millions of viewers within a few hours.
A media item such as a video contains metadata describing the characteristics of the content item, for example metadata related to the creation of the content item (such as the date and/or time of its creation, the creator) or its content (such as the title, detailed information of the performer that is present in the media item, etc.). Sometimes, metadata (e.g., title, creator, etc.) shared with the video is found to be unsuitable for the new recipient, as the video is widely shared. For example, a title may have a particular meaning to the creator of a media item, but that meaning is lost when the media item is widely shared. One use of metadata for media items is to retrieve media items in response to search queries, and the efficiency with which searches can be performed depends on how accurately the metadata for a media item reflects its content and/or other attributes.
Disclosure of Invention
The creator client device, sharer client device, viewer client device, and media hosting service participate in a content sharing interaction, i.e., a modified sharing interaction, in which metadata of content is modified and shared between devices. The media hosting service provides a platform for devices to host and share content and to modify metadata associated with the content. At various points during the modified shared interaction, a user interacting with the client device may modify the metadata. In one example, the creator client device may upload the video to the media hosting service using metadata associated with the video (such as author and title). The sharer client device shares the video with the viewer client device using an indication of metadata of the video to be modified using the media hosting service. If the metadata associated with the media item is incorrect, the metadata may be modified to more accurately reflect the content and/or other attributes of the media item so that a resource efficient search and retrieval process may be performed. The media hosting service may monitor the metadata modified during the modified sharing interactions to affect future modified sharing interactions.
In one embodiment, a first client device associated with a first user account receives a content item for display. The content item includes content item metadata associated with the content item and sender metadata associated with the second user account and with the content item. The content item is displayed on the first client device such that a modified portion of the content item metadata is displayed. In response to receiving input from a user of the first device, an unmodified portion of the content item metadata is displayed. The displayed unmodified portion of the content item metadata was previously displayed as a modified portion of the metadata. ( That is, the display of unmodified portions of content item metadata has been previously suppressed to facilitate the display of modified portions of metadata. As a result, a portion of the content item metadata has been displayed in a modified form (e.g., an unmodified portion of the content item metadata has been previously obscured from view on the first client device) )
In one embodiment, the content item is transmitted to the first client device in response to a transmission action initiated by the second user account on the second client device. In yet another embodiment, the sender metadata may include a flag indicating that metadata of the content item for display is to be modified. The flag may be created in response to input from the second user account.
In one embodiment, the content item is created by a third user account on a third client device that is different from the first client device (i.e., is a different client device than the first client device). The modified portion of the display content item metadata may also be based on creator metadata generated by the third user account. The creator metadata may include a flag indicating that metadata of the content item for display is to be modified.
In one embodiment, a computer program product for modifying shared metadata includes a computer-readable storage medium containing computer program code for performing a method comprising according to any embodiment or implementation described herein. In one embodiment, the computer-readable medium may be a non-transitory computer-readable medium, but the embodiment is not limited thereto, the computer-readable medium storing instructions for modified shared interactions. The instructions are executed by a processor and cause the processor to implement a method according to any embodiment or implementation described herein.
In one embodiment, a system includes at least one processor and a computer-readable medium, which may be a non-transitory computer-readable medium, but the embodiment is not limited thereto. The computer-readable medium stores instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising a method according to any embodiment or implementation described herein. In one embodiment, a system includes a media hosting service, a sharer client device, a viewer client device, and a creator client device to share content with modified metadata. The system participates in the modified shared interactions using methods according to any embodiment or implementation of the disclosure.

Detailed Description
Modified sharing interactions in the described environment facilitate users sharing content with modified metadata. The modified sharing interactions may be one or any number of interactions between the client device and the media hosting service that facilitate uploading the content to the media hosting service, manipulating and adding metadata associated with the content, searching the content on the media hosting service, sharing the content between users, modifying and exposing metadata associated with the content, and collecting usage information of the metadata associated with the content throughout the modified sharing interactions. As described above, this may allow for more resource efficient searching and retrieval by ensuring that the metadata correctly reflects the content of the media item. In addition, the modified shared interactions may have other applications. For example, a first user may wish to share a video item (or other media item) for training or education with a second user, but wish to retain some information about the video after the second user views the video. Conventionally, this would require the second user to notify the first user after the first and second users once viewing the video, and then the first user would send the reservation information to the second user. Rather, in the modified sharing interactions, some or all of the metadata, such as the title and/or author of the video, may be obscured from view on the viewer client device. After (or possibly concurrently with) viewing the video, the viewing client device may not modify the modified metadata. In this example, the viewer client device may choose to reveal previously obscured authors of titles and videos. This avoids the need for the first user to send this information in a separate message.
FIG. 1 illustrates an example computing environment 100 for modified shared interactions using modification modules, according to some embodiments. For example, a client device 110 user may share content between client devices 110a-110c without revealing metadata associated with the content, e.g., sending media without revealing titles. Devices 110a-110d may include an application 112 that provides the ability to share media and metadata associated with the media. The associated metadata may be modified (e.g., obscured, removed, or replaced) during the modified sharing interaction. The obscured metadata is used as one example of modified metadata throughout the document. The application 104 can interact with the front-end interface 132 of the video hosting service 130 (i.e., a presentation layer such as a web page) and with other applications within the environment 100 to facilitate sharing content with modified metadata.
Each client device 110 is a computer or other electronic device used by one or more users to perform activities including uploading media, engaging in modified shared interactions, and viewing media content (e.g., video, audio, text, links, documents, etc.) received from the media hosting service 130. For example, client device 110 may be a personal computer executing a web browser or dedicated software application that allows a user to browse and search for media available on the media hosting service 130 website through front-end interface 132. In other embodiments, client device 110 is a network enabled device other than a computer, such as a mobile phone, personal Digital Assistant (PDA), tablet, laptop, wearable device, web television or "smart television," and the like.
The client devices 110 include software applications, such as application 112, that execute on the processors of the respective client devices 110 to communicate with each other (e.g., during modified sharing interactions) and with the media hosting service 130. Applications executing on the client device 110 perform various functions for interacting with other applications and modules of the client device and for participating in modified shared interactions between the client device 110 and the media hosting service 130. Examples of such applications may be web browsers, social networking applications, messaging applications, gaming applications, and media consumption applications. Each application 112 may be linked to a user account on the media hosting service 130 associated with the client device 102 or a client device user or a group of client device users. In some embodiments, the user account may be accessed via the front-end interface 132 of the media hosting service 130.
The settings data store 114 contains metadata and information associated with device users, client devices 110, user accounts, and the like. During the modified sharing interactions, the environment 100 may use the metadata and information to facilitate sharing of the modified metadata among devices within the environment 100. In one embodiment, the information and metadata may be used to customize the modified shared interactions for a particular device, user account, group of devices, and group of user accounts (e.g., how metadata is masked, how long the metadata is masked, which users in the modified shared interactions may modify the metadata, etc.). The metadata and associated information may include: inter-device security metrics, intra-device security metrics, network security metrics, authentication protocols, user account information and preferences, client device information and preferences, device user information and preferences, records of preferences and changes, and location-based information. For example, the settings data store 114 may contain metadata regarding a history of modified shared interactions between two devices, and the modification module 140 may modify the metadata based on previously modified shared interactions of the devices.
The user interface 116 includes an input device for data input and an output device for display. The output device may display content provided by the client device 110, the media hosting service 130, or a user of the client device. The input device may enable a user to take action (e.g., input) to interact with the application 112 or the media hosting service 130 via the front-end interface 132. These actions may include: typing, speaking, tapping, clicking, sliding, or any other input interaction. For example, a content creator using creator client device 110a may upload content to media hosting service 130. A sharer using sharer client device 110b may search for content using a front-end interface and video search module and send the content to a viewer using viewer client device 110c via network 120. In some embodiments, the interaction between the two client devices 110 and the interaction between the client device 110 and the media hosting service 130 may include information or metadata associated with the media or with the modified shared interaction.
The user interface 116 (e.g., fig. 2A-2D) is a display that allows a user to interact with the client device 110 during a modified sharing interaction. The user interface may process the input that may affect the modified shared interaction in various ways, such as: the new information is displayed on the user interface, resulting in a modified shared interaction, media or metadata is displayed during the modified shared interaction, metadata associated with the content is manipulated, or any other interaction, process, or event described within environment 100 during the modified shared interaction.
Content store 118 is a storage system in which content files sent to media hosting service 130 and received from media hosting service 130 are stored.
Network 120 represents a communication path between client device 110 and media hosting service 130. In one embodiment, network 120 is the Internet, but may be any network including, but not limited to, LAN, MAN, WAN, mobile, wired or wireless networks, cloud computing networks, private networks, or virtual private networks, and any combination thereof. In addition, all or some of the links may be encrypted using conventional encryption techniques such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), secure HTTP, and/or Virtual Private Network (VPN). In another embodiment, entities may use custom and/or dedicated data communication techniques instead of or in addition to those described above.
The media hosting service 130 provides media (e.g., video) to the client device 110 via the network 120. The media hosting service 130 includes a media library 144 storing media and a front end interface 132 for interacting with the client device 110. The media hosting service 130 receives requests for media in the media repository 144 from the client device 110 and provides the media in response. In addition, media hosting service 130 may receive, store, process, and provide media uploaded by users of client devices 110 and other entities. Media in the media hosting service 130 may be obtained from a variety of sources. For example, media may be obtained from a user, e.g., media submitted by uploading video from content store 118 on client device 110 to media library 144 on media hosting service 130 via network 120 using upload server 138.
The media hosting service 130 includes a plurality of "modules," which refer to hardware components and/or computing logic for providing specified functionality. A module may be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software (e.g., a hardware server including computing logic). It should be understood that the components mentioned represent one embodiment of the disclosed method, and other embodiments may include other components. In addition, other embodiments may lack the components described herein and/or distribute the described functionality among the components in a different manner. In addition, functionality attributed to multiple components may be combined into a single component. Where the modules described herein are implemented as software, the modules may be implemented as separate programs, but may also be implemented in other ways, e.g., as part of a larger program, as multiple separate programs, or as one or more statically or dynamically linked libraries. In any of these software implementations, the modules are stored on a computer-readable persistent storage device of the media hosting service 130, loaded into memory, and executed by one or more processors of the system computer.
The front-end interface 132 may be a presentation layer of the media hosting service 130 that allows users to interact with a back-end data manipulation module of the media hosting service 130. The front-end interface 132 receives requests from client devices and communicates with other aspects of the media hosting service 130 to process the requests. The front-end interface 132 may be accessed via a web browser or via an application 112 installed on a client device. In particular, for example, the front-end interface 132 allows a user of the client device 110 to interact with the media hosting service 130 to participate in modified sharing interactions. The front-end interface 132 may also provide elements of the user interface 116 to the client device 110, particularly in web-based implementations in which the user interface is provided as part of a web page rather than as part of a dedicated software application. The front-end interface 132 is also configured to collect user interactions with the media hosting service 130. For example, if the user chooses to modify (e.g., mask or reveal) metadata associated with the shared media, the front-end interface 132 gathers these interactions. (the front-end interface may also collect other user interactions, such as when a user clicks on a web page, views a video, makes a purchase, opens a document, fills in a web-based form, etc.). In addition, interactions between different items presented by the media hosting service 130 are collected by the front-end interface 132 and recorded in modules, servers, and storage units of the media hosting service.
The media service module 134 receives a request from a client device to view (or playback) a particular media item from the media hosting service 130. From the perspective of the client device, the device may perform the request by: browsing different categories within the media hosting service 130, receiving input from a search results web page indicating a click on a link to a video, or accessing information and metadata associated with a modified shared interaction (e.g., click interaction history). The request sent by the client device may include an identifier of the content that the user wishes to access (which may be automatically included when the user clicks on a link to the video). The media service module 134 uses the identifier to search and locate where in the media library 144 the video is stored. The media service module 134 provides media requested from the media hosting service 130 to the client device 110 for display on the user interface 116. In some embodiments, the media service module may use the identifier to provide media with modified metadata.
The video search module 136 processes any search queries received by the media hosting service 130 from users via the client device 110. The search query sent by client device 110 to media hosting service 130 includes search criteria, such as keywords, that may identify media that the user is interested in viewing. The video search module 130 uses the search criteria to query the metadata of the video files stored in the media library 144. Search results from the query are sent to the client device 110 via the network 120 so that the search results may be presented to the user through the user interface 116.
Any content received from a client device via network 124 for publication to media hosting service 130 is passed from content store 118 on the client device via network 120 to upload server 138 for processing. The processing of the content file includes assigning an identifier to the newly received content. The processing medium may also include formatting (e.g., transcoding), compression, metadata tagging, content analysis, and/or other data processing methods. Client device 110 sends information and video files to media hosting service 130. The information may describe the video (e.g., title, description, and tag information). The information may also include an indication of the media type, which may be a "video" type for the uploaded media. The upload server 138 stores the processed content in the media library 144 and stores the information as metadata of the content.
The modification module 140 may modify (e.g., mask and expose) metadata of the shared content during the modified sharing interactions. The modification module 140 may receive a request from the sharer client device 110b to modify metadata of media stored in the media library 144 when shared with the viewer client device 110 c. When the viewer client device 110b accesses media via the front-end interface or the media is provided to the viewer client device with the media service module 134, the modification module 140 provides modified metadata associated with the video to the viewer client device. The media hosting service may also receive a request from the viewer client device to modify metadata associated with the video, and the modification module may provide the modified metadata to the viewer client device.
Alternatively, rather than retaining the original metadata and providing modified metadata upon request, the modification module 140 may instead provide metadata associated with the video to the viewer client device with an indicator that the application 112c operating on the viewer client device should obscure at least some of the metadata. The viewer client device may then request that metadata associated with the video be exposed, and an application operating on the viewer client device exposes metadata previously marked as obscured.
Modifying metadata associated with media during a modified sharing interaction may be accomplished in several different ways: making the text of the metadata illegible (e.g., blurry, blackened, etc.), removing obscured metadata from view (e.g., not displaying metadata), providing an image to be displayed in front of the metadata, providing alternative text to be displayed in front of the metadata, providing alternative metadata to replace obscured metadata display, or any other method or combination of methods for modifying metadata information associated with the video. Further modifications to the metadata may reverse any of these modification techniques (e.g., exposing the obscured metadata or obscuring the revealed metadata).
Throughout the shared interaction event, the client device may request (or determine) to modify (e.g., obscure or reveal metadata) the media. The request may be made using a variety of methods including: clicking on an icon on the user interface of the client device 110, reading or sending a flag that metadata should be modified, attaching new metadata to the video, typing input in the client device 110, changing a URL associated with the video location in the media hosting service (e.g., from a URL of the video with unmodified metadata to a URL of the video with modified metadata), modifying or changing an identifier of the video (e.g., from an identifier of the video with unmodified metadata to an identifier of the video with modified metadata), or any other similar method in the environment 100. In some embodiments, the modification or exposure of metadata may be accomplished automatically using a variety of methods, including the following: accessing settings stored in the settings data store 114 of the client device, accessing information or metadata stored in the user database 142, or interacting with the media usage module 146.
The user database 142 stores information and metadata that can be presented to the user or used by other modules in the media hosting service to facilitate functionality during the modified sharing interactions. The user database 142 may include metadata associated with a user, user account, media, or client device. The metadata may include geographic location, preferences, device information, device settings, or any other information associated with the user or user interaction within the environment 100, particularly information that may be useful for modified shared interactions.
The media library 144 is a storage system in which content files received from the client device 110 and sent to the client device 110 are stored. Media library 144 may be a computer-readable persistent storage device (e.g., RAM, hard drive, etc.) of media hosting service 130.
The media usage module 146 collects, stores, and updates metadata associated with content stored by the media hosting service 130. The content may be accompanied by associated metadata, such as: identification number, title, author, tag, description, icon, thumbnail view, comment, number of views, and rating. The metadata may be updated based on interactions between the user and the client device, between the client device and the media hosting service, between the client device and the network, or any other interactions in the environment 100. The video usage module 146 may also contain information about previous similar interactions, for example, if one user has sent video to another user. The video usage module 140 may interact with the modification module 140 to mask metadata during the modification interaction to collect usage of the masked media or to mask the media based on the usage information metadata.
For example, a first client device transmits video to a second client device. The first client device indicates that the video should have its metadata obscured during the modified sharing interaction. The video usage module 146 identifies that the second client device previously received video from the individual client device in the individual modified sharing interactions. The video usage module may inform the first or second client device that the video has been previously viewed, previously obscured, previously shared, etc. In a similar example, the second client device has not yet viewed the video shared during the modified sharing interaction. The second client device views the video with obscured metadata that is revealed after viewing. The video usage module 146 may update and store metadata associated with the video and interactions (e.g., increment a view count, mark media as viewed, mark media as shared, etc.).
For purposes of simplifying and clarifying this description, content received and shared by media hosting service 130 may be referred to as videos, video files, or video items, but it should be understood that media hosting service 130 may receive and share content of any media type. The content may be referred to as media, media items, or items. Thus, the operations of the modification module described herein for modifying media in a modification sharing interaction may be applied to any type of media item, not just video; other suitable types of content items include audio files (e.g., music, podcasts, and audio books, etc.), documents, multimedia presentations, digital purchases of goods and services, and the like. The metadata for each item includes an indication of the media type of the item, such as video, audio, document, purchase, or presentation.
To further simplify and clarify the present description, the following example modified shared interactions will be used: kris (first client device user 110 a) creates a video and uploads the video to media hosting service 130. John (second client device 110b user) accesses the video via the media hosting service. John chooses to send video with obscured metadata to Anni (third client device 110c user). Annie accesses video to be viewed via the media hosting service 130 with the obscured metadata and may choose to reveal the obscured metadata. Throughout the modified sharing interaction, the metadata will be updated and the server may notify kris, john, and ani.
FIG. 2A is an illustrative example user interface displayed on a client device engaged in a shared interaction in which metadata is not obscured. John sends video to Annie, where the metadata of the video reveals important aspects of the media storyline, e.g., "women flee from shark-! So close to-! "Annie may choose not to view the video because the metadata related to the video presented to her during the sharing interaction provides too much background, for example: "I will see later". She sounds to live away from the shark. In another example, one friend sent a video with the heading "little lizard escaped a large group of snakes" to a second friend. The second friend may choose not to view the video because the title of the video will display the end of the video. In these traditional types of sharing interactions, the viewing user may choose not to view the content that restricts the spread (availability) and propagation of the shared content. As noted above, this may be undesirable in some situations, for example, where video is shared for training purposes.
The user interface 202 may include a visual representation of any of a user interacting in a obscured sharing event, a User Interface (UI) element 204 that allows connection with other applications or devices within the environment, or a UI element 206 that allows access to and manipulation of settings in the settings module.
The user interface includes an area 208 for viewing content associated with the modified shared interaction. The region 208 may include one or more icons that will stop or start playback of content, indicators of metadata associated with the video (i.e., video length, video quality, subtitles, etc.). The region 208 may also be expanded or reduced via interaction with the interface icon 210 or by settings within the settings module. The user interface also includes an area 220 for displaying metadata associated with the video and may be obscured during the modified sharing interaction. The user interface includes a region 214 that will display interactions between participants in the modified shared interaction. The region is configured to display text, video, or any other information or metadata associated with the obscured sharing event. The user interface includes one or more icons 212 for interacting with metadata. These icons, when selected, may indicate emotions regarding the metadata, modify (e.g., obscure or reveal) the metadata, transmit or receive the metadata, or any other interactions described therein. The user interface includes an area 216 that allows input from the client device. Accessing the area may generate an input interface such as keyboard 218, or the keyboard may be permanently displayed. The region may also include UI elements 222 for entering other types of data, such as video, links, pictures, etc. In some embodiments, during the modified sharing interactions, the information or metadata displayed within region 214 may also be obscured.
FIG. 2B is an illustrative example of a user interface of a device participating in a modified shared interaction in which metadata associated with a video is obscured. John sends video to Anni and metadata is obscured, e.g., the video title is rendered illegible, and there is a description that John obscures the information. Click to undo the superposition. Annie may send a message to John indicating that she is interested in viewing the video and may continue to view the video because she does not know the result or topic, e.g. "Buddha-! This appears interesting. The impending want to see what happens. I now see. Annie views videos, metadata may be revealed via several methods as described by the process described below. She notifies john that she has watched the video, has a profound impression of the video, and will share with her siblings, e.g. "java-! Is very cool. She is happy and can escape from the life without death. I would send this to my brothers). The modified sharing interactions may increase the audience share of the online media and encourage the diffusion of the media.
Fig. 2C is an illustrative example of a user interface of a client device participating in a modified shared interaction accessing a front end interface of a media hosting service, wherein metadata of a video is obscured. At least some metadata associated with the video is obscured from viewing by the user, including titles and related suggested videos.
The user interface may include an area 222 for displaying content that may be expanded or contracted, one or more icons that will stop or start playback of the content, and indicators of metadata associated with the video (i.e., video length, video quality, subtitles, etc.). The user interface includes an area 220 for displaying metadata associated with the video and may be obscured during the modified sharing interaction. The user interface includes an icon 228 that allows subscription to content from the content creator. The user interface includes an area 226 that displays content and metadata stored within an environment associated with content shared in the shared modification interactions. In the example shown, the content in the region has been obscured during the modified sharing interaction. The user interface may include an icon 230 for interacting with other content and metadata stored within the environment associated with the content shared in the modified shared interaction.
FIG. 2D is an illustrative example of a user interface of a client device participating in a modified sharing interaction of a user interface accessing a media hosting service, wherein metadata associated with a video is exposed. At least some metadata associated with the video, including titles and associated suggested media, has been revealed to the viewing user. Using the examples of fig. 2C and 2D, the metadata of the video (e.g., title 232 a) and associated metadata (e.g., next video 234 a) are obscured in fig. 2C. After the user of the client device selects to reveal the obscured metadata (e.g., title 232 b) of the video, the associated metadata (e.g., next video 234 b) is revealed. The elements of the user interface described above may alternatively be oriented within the interface. The user interface may also include elements not described above, but still allow for modified shared interactions. In some embodiments, elements of the user interface may be displayed within other applications of the client device (e.g., aspects of the user interface displayed in a web browser).
FIG. 3 illustrates a process occurring on a creator client device during a modified sharing interaction 300, according to one embodiment. Creator client device 110a may upload 310 video to media hosting service 130 from content store 118a on the client device over network 120. Creator client device 110a may interact with front-end interface 132 and video upload server 138 to store the video in media library 144 and create a set of metadata associated with the video. Creator client device 110a may interact with modification module 140 and send 312 the modification settings of the video to a video hosting service, for example: the length of time for modification, whether the media can be modified during the modified sharing interaction (e.g., modification media is prohibited/allowed/mandatory), which types of metadata can be obscured (e.g., title, device information, etc.), which portions of the metadata can be obscured (e.g., only a portion of the title, not the entire title), etc.
For example, kris has digitally re-mastered the logo music video "never disappointed you-nikk pa-t" and stored it in the content store 118a on his creator client device 110 a. The creator client device receives input via 130 network 120 to upload the video to the media hosting service via user interface 116a of application 112 a. Creator device 110a interacts with front-end interface 132 and upload server 138 to add metadata to the video so that the video can be searched using video search module 138. Kris is not intended to encourage the diffusion of his video. Creator client device 110a instructs the modification module that, by default, modification module 140 does not obscure metadata associated with the video when shared between users. When sharer client device 110b indicates in the modified sharing interactions, creator client device 110a determines that certain aspects of the metadata are allowed to be obscured when sharing between device users.
Creator client device 110a may receive 314 updated metadata associated with the video. The creator client device 110a may receive this metadata from the video usage module 146 of the media hosting service 130 or directly from applications of other client devices 110 in the operating environment 100. The received metadata may include: a notification that the device has shared/received video, a notification that the user of the device has selected to reveal/mask shared video and metadata, a notification that masked metadata is automatically revealed, etc. The received metadata may be used for other aspects of the modified shared interaction.
Fig. 4 illustrates a process occurring on the sharer client device 110b during a modified sharing interaction 300. During the modified sharing interaction 300, the sharer device 110b may access 410 the video through the media hosting service 130 via the network 120 using the user interface 116b of the application 112 b. The sharer device may interact with the front-end interface 132 of the media hosting service 130 (e.g., via user input) to share video from the media library 144 during the modified sharing interaction 300. The media hosting service 130 may provide the video to the sharer client device 110b for playback on the user interface 116b using the media service module 134 when accessing the video. In other embodiments, accessing the video can only provide metadata associated with the video to the sharer client device 110 b.
For example, john's sharer device may access video on the media hosting service 130 by searching for the term "nikk pa-tei" and clicking "never let you disappoint-nikk pa-tei", which is the first item provided by the user interface 132 media hosting service 130 on his device's 110b user interface. The media hosting service 130 provides the video and its metadata to john's sharer device via the network, and the sharer device may choose (e.g., via user input) to view the metadata of the video without playback. In one embodiment, the setup module 114 of john's sharer device authenticates his device to the media hosting service 130, and the media hosting service provides the video to his device 110b, which is configured to be displayed on john's device.
After accessing the video, the sharer client device 110b may determine 412 (e.g., via user input or information stored in the settings data store 114 b) to obscure metadata associated with the video during the modified sharing interactions 300. The determination of metadata that masks the video in the modified shared interaction 300 may add a new type (e.g., notification that the metadata has been masked) or additional metadata (e.g., masked version of media metadata, etc.) associated with the video. During the modified sharing interaction 300, when determining the shading metadata, the sharer client device 110b may select (e.g., via user input) which metadata and/or portions of metadata associated with the video are to be shaded or exposed. In other embodiments, the sharer client device 110b may change, replace, or insert new metadata (e.g., from user input, modification module 140, settings data store 114, etc.) to display as obscured or revealed during the modified sharing interaction, such as entering a replacement title for the video or a tag indicating who obscured the metadata. Metadata that is changed, replaced, or inserted during the modified shared interaction may be shared as notifications between devices that engage in the modified shared interaction, or displayed on any available area of the user interface 116 of the participating client device 110, where the original data may otherwise be displayed. The sharer device may also determine (e.g., from user input, modification module 140, settings data store 114, etc.) to provide video playback offset metadata to indicate where video playback is to begin. The offset metadata may be provided to avoid displaying the embedded title or the show to the viewer client device at the beginning of video playback. The modification module 140 modifies the appropriate metadata based on the determination.
For example, after accessing 310 the video "never you are disappointed-nicpatril", john's client device may determine the occluded video metadata by receiving user input provided by a user selecting a UI element (e.g., john), which is marked "occluded video metadata" in the user interface of the sharer client device. In one embodiment, john's sharer device, which determines to mask video metadata, provides John's sharer device with an option of which metadata to mask; i.e. "title", "artist", "view", "related media", etc. John's sharer device modifies by receiving user input representing the selected option to select "title" and "artist". In another embodiment, john's device automatically selects "title" and "artist" as video metadata to be obscured based on settings stored in the settings data store 114 of John's device 110 b. John's sharer device selects (e.g., via user input) to insert representative metadata associated with the video for display with the obscured metadata, e.g., "View this confusing cat video-! ". John's sharer device also selects (e.g., via user input) to replace the artist of the video from "nikkactrii" to "john's milk. In another embodiment, the settings in the setting module of John's sharer device automatically insert the representative metadata "John has selected to mask the video title and artist. Click undo. "
After selecting to mask the metadata during the modified sharing interaction 300, the sharer client device 110b may share 414 the video and masked metadata with a different viewer client device 110c via the network 120. Sharing the video may include sharing any metadata associated with the video that identifies the video, including: an identifier of the video stored in the media library, a URL of the video, a short link to the video, a title of the video, a clickable icon representing the location of the video in the media library, an interactive location on the user interface, or the like. Sharing video and metadata may occur using several different communication protocols or combinations of communication protocols configured to interact with the network in environment 100 as described below; i.e., SMS messages, messages using applications on the client device, email messages, or any other communication method that may be used for device-to-device interaction. The video usage module 146 may store and update any metadata associated with the metadata of the shared video and media mask.
For example, john's sharer device may send a video "never let you disappoint-nicpatril" and metadata associated with the video (e.g., obscured metadata, instructions to obscure metadata, inserted metadata, etc.). John's sharing device sends the video using an SMS message that contains a short link representing an identifier of the video's location in the media library 144 of the media hosting service 130. The short link may include metadata associated with the modified shared interaction, e.g., a flag of the media hosting service that the metadata of the video should be obscured when the short link is clicked.
After sharing the video (or the location of the video in the video hosting service) in the modified sharing interaction 300, the sharing device may receive 416 updated metadata associated with the video or metadata associated with the modified sharing interaction. The sharing device 110b may receive the metadata from the video usage module 146 of the media hosting service 130 or directly from the application 104 operating on another client device 110 in the environment 100. The received metadata may include: a notification that the viewer client device 110b has received a video, a notification that the viewer client device 110b has selected to reveal obscured metadata, or a notification that the obscured metadata is automatically revealed, etc.
For example, john's sharer device may receive the following notifications from video usage module 146 on his device 110 b: anni's viewer device receives the video with the obscured metadata, accesses the video for playback using the media hosting service 130, and the obscured metadata is automatically revealed.
Fig. 5 illustrates a process occurring on viewer client device 110c during a modified sharing interaction 300. Viewer client device 110c may receive 510 the shared video (or the location of the video in media hosting service 130) and the video metadata from sharer client device 110 b. The video metadata received from the sharer may be at least partially obscured by the modification module 140 of the media hosting service 130. Receiving video may occur in several ways using any combination of sharing methods and communication protocols within environment 100 as previously described. The video usage module 146 may store and update any metadata associated with the modified shared interaction.
For example, an Monte's viewer device may receive an SMS from John that contains a short link to an identifier representing the location of the video in the media library 144 of the media hosting service 130. The message and short link may also include the following information: metadata associated with the video will be obscured by modification module 140 (see fig. 1) when accessed on viewer client device 110 c. For example, when an Annie's viewer device selects a link, the media hosting service does not modify the metadata stored within the media hosting service, but rather provides obscured metadata to her viewer device.
Viewing client device 110c may access 512 the video and obscured metadata using an identifier provided by the sharer client device. The viewer client device 110c may access video and metadata through the media hosting service 130 via the network 120 using the user interface 116c of the application 112c running on the viewer client device 110 c. The viewer client device may input an identifier of the media location in the media library 144 using the user interface 132 of the media hosting service 130. At least some metadata associated with the video accessed by the viewer client device is displayed on the viewer client, obscured by modification module 140 (see fig. 1). In one embodiment, the media hosting service 130 may provide video to the viewer client device 110b for automatic playback on the user interface 116b using the media service module 134 when accessing the video. In other embodiments, accessing the video can only provide exposed metadata associated with the video to the viewer client device and does not provide obscured metadata associated with the video. Access to the video via the media hosting service 130 may be determined by settings stored in the settings module 114c of the client device or the user database 142 of the media hosting service 130.
For example, an's viewer device may access video that john's sharer device sent to her on media hosting service 130 by clicking on a short link that john's sharer device sent to her viewer device via an SMS message. The media hosting service 130 provides videos, such as "never let you disappoint-nice parri," for an Anni's viewer device to view on her device 110 c's application 112 c. Instead of displaying the original metadata associated with the video on the viewer device, the obscured metadata (e.g., the obscured view count of the video) and john's sharer device-modified metadata (e.g., a title that is different from the original title of the video) are provided for viewing by an Anni's viewer device, e.g., "view this popular cat video-! "and obscured video title and artist details. See description of modification module 140 using fig. 1. The setting module 114c of the Annie device may contain preferences that allow the media hosting service 130 to provide masked metadata to her device.
After accessing the video, the Annie's viewer device may select 514 to reveal 516 the obscured metadata of the video or to play back 518 the video. The viewer client device 110c may select 514 to reveal the obscured metadata by interacting (e.g., through user input) with the front end interface 132 and modification module 140 of the media hosting service 130 using the user interface 116c of the application 112 c. The viewer client device 110c sends a request to expose metadata to the media hosting service 130 and the modification module 140, and the media hosting service 130 and the modification module 140 expose the obscured metadata. In an alternative embodiment, the exposed metadata need not be requested from the media hosting service, and the exposure occurs locally on the application 112c of the viewer client device 110 c.
Alternatively, the viewer client device may select 518 the video for playback by interacting with the user interface 132 and the media service module 134 of the media hosting service 130 using the user interface 116c of the application 112 c. The media hosting service 130 provides the video to the viewer client device 110c for playback on the user interface 116c using the media service module 134. The selection of the mask, the revealing of the masked metadata, and the playback of the video may be determined by settings stored in the client device's settings data store 114c or the user database 142 of the media hosting service 130.
For example, annie selects to reveal obscured metadata on the client device before starting playback by clicking on an icon presented to her on the user interface of her device. John selects the metadata to mask is revealed and the displayed metadata becomes metadata originally associated with the video, e.g., "see this funny cat video-! "become" never lets you disappoint-nicpatril "and does not obscure any metadata. In another embodiment, annie initiates playback by pressing a play icon on the user interface without revealing obscured metadata, and the video "never lets you disappoint-Nippy Pasty" start playing.
Similar to the previous description, at any point during playback 518 of the video, if the metadata has not been exposed, the viewer client device may choose 520 to expose 522 the obscured metadata.
Video playback may end 524 and if the metadata has not been exposed, the viewer client device may again select to expose 426 the obscured metadata, similar to the previous description. In some embodiments, upon ending video playback, the obscured metadata is automatically exposed using the modification module 140 of the media hosting service 130. See description of the use of the modification module 140 of fig. 1. The auto-exposure metadata may also be determined by settings stored in the settings data store 114c of the client device or the user database 142 of the media hosting service 130.
Subsequently, the video usage module 146 of the media hosting service 130 (automatically or via user input) updates 528 the metadata associated with the interaction (e.g., an indication that the video has been viewed) and the metadata associated with the video (e.g., a view count). In some embodiments, metadata associated with interactions or with videos may be updated during any step of the process of fig. 4 and/or 5.
Fig. 6 illustrates a process that occurs on the media hosting service 130 during a modified sharing interaction 600. The media hosting service 130 receives 610 video content from the creator client device 110a interacting with the user interface 132 and the upload server 138 to upload to the media library. The media hosting service receives 612 an access request for video in the media library from a sharer client device interacting with the user interface and the video search module. The media hosting service provides 614 the video and associated video metadata to the sharer client device using the media service module. The media hosting service receives 616, from a sharer client device interacting with the user interface, an instruction to use the modification module to mask the metadata. The media hosting service modifies the metadata using a modification module. The media hosting service receives 618 a request from a viewer client device to access a video in a media library. The access request may include instructions that metadata associated with the video is to be obscured on the viewer client device (e.g., metadata associated with the video or user input), or the media hosting service may store information (e.g., user settings) that the viewer client device is to receive the obscured metadata during this modified sharing interaction.
The video hosting service provides 620 the video and metadata associated with the video to the viewer client device, wherein at least some of the metadata is obscured by the modification module. In some embodiments, the media hosting service receives 622 from the viewer client device an instruction to reveal the obscured metadata using the modification module 140. The media hosting service may then provide 624 the requested exposed metadata to the viewer client device. See description of modification module 140 in fig. 1. At any point during the above process, the media hosting service may use the video usage module 146 to update 628 and/or store metadata associated with the video (or metadata associated with the modified shared interaction) to the creator client device, the sharer client device, or any device associated with the interaction in the environment 100. At any point during the above process, the media hosting service may use the video usage module to send 628 metadata associated with the video or metadata associated with the obscured sharing event to the creator client device, the sharer client device, or any device associated with the event in the environment 100.
FIG. 7 is an interaction diagram of a modified sharing interaction 300 between a creator client device 110a, a sharer client device 110b, a viewer client device 110c, and a media hosting service 130, according to one embodiment. The creator client device uses the user interface 116a of the application 116a to upload 710 video from the content store 118a on the client device 110a to the media hosting service 130 via the network 120. During upload, the creator may interact with the front-end interface 132 of the media hosting service 130 to access the upload server 138 to upload the video and assign metadata to the video when uploading the video.
Sharer client device 110b accesses 712 the video, for example, by searching the video using video search module 136 on media hosting service 130. The sharer client device accesses the front-end interface 132 of the media hosting service 130 via the network 120 using the user interface 116b of the application 112 b. Access to the video may occur by entering (e.g., to the user interface 116) an identifier that identifies the location of the video stored in the media library 144.
The media hosting service 130 provides 714 the video and metadata associated with the video to the sharer client device 110b using the media service module 134. The video and video metadata may be provided to the sharer client device 110b interacting with the front end interface 132 of the media hosting service 130 using the application 110b and the user interface 116b on the sharer client device 110b. In some embodiments, the video is provided to the sharer device 110b to configure the video for playback on the user interface 116b of the sharer client device 110b. In other embodiments, providing video to the sharer client device 110b provides only video and video metadata to the sharer client device.
The sharer client device uses the modification module 140 of the media hosting service 130 to mask 716 some or all of the video metadata for further use in the modified sharing interactions 300. The sharer client device accesses the front-end interface 132 of the media hosting service 130 via the network 120 using the user interface 116b of the application 112b to interact with metadata associated with the video via the modification module 140.
Sharer client device 110b shares 718 video with viewer client device 110c. Sharing video may be accomplished via any communication method using any communication protocol within environment 100 that may provide an identifier associated with the location of video within media hosting service 130 to another client device. The identifier may contain metadata indicating that the video should obscure its metadata during the modified sharing interaction 300.
Viewer client device 110c accesses 720 the video on media hosting service 130 using the identifier provided by sharer client device 110 b. The metadata of the video is obscured by the modification module 140 of the media hosting service 130. The viewer client device uses the user interface 116b of the application 112b to access video via the network 120 using the front-end interface 132 of the media hosting service 130.
The media hosting service 130 provides 722 metadata associated with the video and video to the viewer client device 110c using the media service module 134, wherein the metadata is obscured by the modification module 140. The video and video metadata may be provided to the client device 110c interacting with the front end interface 132 of the media hosting service 130 using the application 110c and the user interface 116bc on the viewer client device 110 b. The user may choose to reveal obscured metadata when providing the video. In some embodiments, the video configuration video is provided to the viewer device 110c for playback on the user interface 116c of the viewer client device 110c. The user may choose to reveal obscured metadata when playing back the video on viewer device 110c, or may automatically reveal video metadata after playing back the video.
After the viewer client device selects to expose the video metadata, the viewer client device 110c may access 724 the exposed metadata from the media hosting service 130 using the modification module 140. The viewer client device uses the user interface 116b of the application 112b to access the exposed metadata via the network 120 using the front-end interface 132 of the media hosting service 130. In some embodiments, exposing metadata on viewer client device 110c does not require communication with media hosting service 130 and occurs locally within application 112 c.
The media hosting service 130 provides 726 the exposed metadata associated with the video to the viewer client device 110b using the modification module 140. The exposed metadata may be provided to the client device 110c interacting with the user interface 132 of the media hosting service 130 using the application 110c and the user interface 116 bc.
At any point during the modified sharing interaction 300, the video usage module 146 of the media hosting service or any other module that interacts with metadata in the environment 100 may be used to update 728 and store metadata associated with the video. Further, metadata associated with any of the client devices, user accounts, or users in the environment 100 may be updated and stored during the modified sharing interactions 300. In some embodiments, the metadata may be updated using the application 112c and the user interface 116 through the client device 110 interacting with the user interface 132 and the video usage module 146 of the media hosting service 130.
At any point during the modified sharing interaction 300, the server may notify 730 the sharer client device 110b or notify 732 the creator client device 110c of the change to the metadata associated with the video or the metadata associated with her modified sharing interaction 300. The notification creator client device and sharer client device may occur by interacting with the front-end interface 132 and video usage module 146 of the media hosting service 130 using the application 112c and user interface 116c of the viewer client device 110 c. In other embodiments, the creator client device 110a and the sharer client device 110b are automatically notified of the change in metadata using the video usage module 146.
In some configurations of the client device 110 and the media hosting service 130, the media hosting service is not involved in modifying metadata and only shares video content during the modified sharing interactions 300. In these configurations, the client device 110 participating in the modified shared interaction 300 may receive a video identifier associated with the obscured video that includes obscured metadata associated with the modified shared interaction 300 that indicates metadata to be obscured on the participating device 110. Client device 110 may interpret the identifier, parse the identifier into separate video identifiers, and use the separate video identifiers to access the unmasked video from media hosting service 130. Client device 110 may internally mask metadata associated with the video indicated by the previously received mask metadata. The intra-application modification may be implemented by modifying the client device 110d with a modification module 140 within the application 112d or by built-in functionality of the application 112 on the client device 110.
At any point during the modified shared interaction 300, interactions between the modules, applications, devices, servers, and memory may be constrained by settings and preferences stored in the settings of the client device settings module 114, the user database 142, and the video usage module 146. Settings and preferences may include: playback settings, metadata that can be accessed, user account settings, security and authentication protocols, user preferences, client device settings and configurations, or any other metadata associated with environment 100.
In shared interactions where the system discussed herein gathers personal information about a user or may utilize modifications to the personal information, the user may be provided with the following opportunities: whether the control program or feature gathers user information (e.g., information about the user's social network, social actions or activities, professions, user preferences, or the user's current location), or whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be processed in one or more ways prior to storage or use to remove personally identifiable information. For example, the identity of the user may be processed so that personal identity information cannot be determined for the user, or the geographic location of the user may be upscaled when obtaining location information (e.g., city, zip code, or state level) so that a specific location of the user cannot be determined. Thus, the user can control how information about the user is collected and used by the content server.
