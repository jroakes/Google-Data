Fig. 3 shows to show and worked together according to the various assemblies of the hazard detection system 300 of various embodiments to provide
Multi-standard is alarmed and the illustrative block diagram of warning function.As illustrated, system 300 can include sensing data 302, Jing Yin inspection
Survey event 304, switch condition 306, adjusting thresholds parameter 307, multi-standard state machine 310, clock 312, other states 320, report
Alert state 330, alert status 340, alarm 350, display 352, loudspeaker 354 and radio-circuit 380.It also show several
Communication link 370, each in these communication links can have unidirectional or bi-directional data and/or signal communication capability.It is more
Standard state machine 310 can be based on sensing data 302, Jing Yin detecting event 304, switch condition 306, clock 312 and other
Standard controls alarm condition 330, alert status 340 and all other state machine state 320, and alarms and alert status
330 and 340 can control the output of alarm 350, display 352 and loudspeaker 354.Alarm condition 330 can include multiple
Alarm condition (for example, every kind of harm one, such as smog alarm state 331, CO alarm conditions 332 and thermal warning state 333),
And alert status 340 can include multiple alert status (for example, every kind of endanger one or more, such as smog alert status
341 and CO alert status 342).Other states can include, for example, idle condition, monitored state, alarm quiet state, early warning
State, hold mode and alarm monitored state after halted state, alarm.
Alarm condition 330 can control alarm 350 and display in response to the determination made of multi-standard state machine 310
352 activation and deactivation.Alarm 350 can provide the audible prompting of dangerous situation (for example, the shape with buzzer bleep
Formula).Display 352 can provide the visual cues of dangerous situation (for example, such as flash of light or color change).If need
Will, alarm condition 330 can combine the playback for the message that the control of audible and/or visual cues passes through loudspeaker 354.For example, report
Alert device 350 and being applied in combination for loudspeaker 354 can repeat following sequence：" serge, serge, serge-smog-serge is detected in bedroom
Serge serge ", wherein " bleep " is sent from alarm 350 and " smog is detected in bedroom " sends from loudspeaker 354.As
Another example, the use of alarm 350 and loudspeaker 354 can repeat following sequence：" serge, serge, serge-wave make alarm quiet-
Serge serge serge ", wherein loudspeaker 354 are used to provide alarm quiet instruction.Alarm condition 330 is (for example, smog alarm state 331, CO
Alarm condition 332 and thermal warning state 333) in any one can independently control alarm 350 and/or display 352
And/or loudspeaker 354.In certain embodiments, alarm condition 330 can cause alarm 350 or display 352 or loudspeaker
354 are active based on which particular alarm state and send different promptings.For example, if smog alarm state is active
, then alarm 350 can send the sound with the first characteristic, but if CO alarm conditions are active, then alarm 350
The sound with the second characteristic can be sent.In other embodiments, alarm condition 330 can make alarm 350 and display 352
And loudspeaker 354 sends identical prompting, which particular alarm state to be active but regardless of.
In response to the determination made of multi-standard state machine 310, alert status 340 can be with controlling loudspeaker 354 and display
352 activation and deactivation.Early warning can be used as unsafe condition may imminent warning.Loudspeaker 354 can be used for resetting language
Sound alerts：Unsafe condition may be at hand., can be on loudspeaker 354 for each type of early warning event detected
Reset different warning information.For example, if smog alert status are active, smog related news can be in loudspeaker
Reset on 354.If CO alert status are active, CO related news can be reset.Furthermore, it is possible to it is directed to and each harm
Different message is reset in each early warning in (for example, smog and CO) associated multiple early warning.For example, smog injury can have
There are two associated early warning, one associated with the first smog alert status (for example, prompting alarm condition may be medium urgent
Degree), another (for example, prompting very urgent alarm condition) associated with the second smog alert status.Early warning information is also
It can include on how to make the Jing Yin phonetic order of early warning information.Display 352 can also be used for providing in a similar way
The visual cues of extremely urgent alarm condition.In certain embodiments, early warning information can specify the position of early warning situation.Example
Such as, if harm system 300 knows that it is located in bedroom, the position can be included in early warning information by it：" in bedroom
Detect smog ".
Hazard detection system 300 can enforce alarm and early warning priority according to which situation be present.For example, such as
The elevated smog of fruit and CO situations exist simultaneously, then smog alarm state and/or early warning smoke condition may alarm prior to CO
State and/or CO alert status.If user makes smoke alarm or smog early warning silent, and CO alarm conditions or CO early warning
State is still active, then system 300 can provide CO alarms or early warning also (such as voice has led to by the instruction of silence
Know).If smoke condition terminates, and CO alarms or early warning are still active events, then CO alarms or early warning may be by
It is presented to user.
When multi-standard state machine 310 determine exist it is relatively small or be safe from danger situation when, may switch to idle condition.
Idle condition can perform the hazard detection system action of relatively low level.For example, in an idle state, can be with relatively
The data sampling rate of the slow one or more sensors of interval setting.When multi-standard state machine 310 has determined sensor data values
Through bringing up to the level for needing more to go through, rather than when being transformed into the level of early warning or alarm condition, multi-standard state machine
310 may switch to monitored state.Monitored state might mean that relatively high-caliber hazard detection system action.For example,
In the monitor state, the data sampling rate of one or more sensors may be much larger than idle condition.In addition, for alarm condition
330th, alert status 340 or both, the data sampling rate of one or more sensors can be with comparatively faster interval setting.
Alarm quiet and early warning mute state can refer to the deactivation of alarm or the early warning of user instruction lasting predetermined time
Amount.For example, in one embodiment, user can press button (not shown) to make alarm or early warning silent.In another reality
Apply in example, user can perform Jing Yin gesture in the case where hazard detection system be present.Jing Yin gesture can be user's initiation
Action, wherein he or she gesture (for example, waving motion) is performed near system 300, it is intended that close sounding alarm or
Person makes the alarm of sounding silent.The hand can be detected using one or more sonacs, pir sensor or its combination
Gesture.In another scheme, radio-circuit 370 can receive instruction to make alarm Jing Yin.For example, user can use he or
Her phone sends mute command via wireless protocols (for example, Bluetooth Low Energy) to system 300, and then radio-circuit 380 can
The order is forwarded to trigger Jing Yin detecting event 304.
State, which can refer to multi-standard state machine 310, after alarm to be in one of alarm condition 330 or early warning shape
The state being transformed into after one of state 340.After an alarm in state, hazard detection system 300 can provide " all clear
Except " message, no longer exist with instruction alarm or early-warning conditions.This is probably particularly useful, such as CO, because the mankind are not
CO can be detected.State can be to maintain state after another alarm, and it may be used as the anti-bounce-back state of system.The state can be to prevent
Only hazard detection system 300 converts back alert status 340 immediately just after the conversion of alarm condition 330.
Multi-standard state machine 310 can include several different state machines：Sensor states machine and system mode machine.Each
State machine can with it is specific endanger (such as smog injury, carbon monoxide harm or heat harm) it is associated, and multi-standard state
Machine can utilize the data obtained by one or more sensors to be detected come management of hazard.In certain embodiments, can be directed to
Sensor states machine is implemented in every kind of harm.In other embodiments, for every kind of harm or subset can be endangered to implement system
State machine.Sensor states machine can be responsible for controlling relatively basic hazard detection systemic-function, and system mode machine can be responsible for control
Relatively advanced hazard detection systemic-function.In the detection of management of hazard, each sensor states machine and each system shape
State machine can be turned based on sensing data 302, mute event 304 and switch condition 306 in any one of its state
Change.One mute event can be Client-initiated order, for example, making the instruction of sounding alarm or early warning voice Jing Yin.
Switch condition 306 can include a large amount of different conditions, and it can be with definition status machine how from a State Transferring
To another state.Each state machine can have the switch condition of their own.Condition can define can with following input
Any one or more threshold values being compared：Sensor data values, clock and user mutual event (for example, mute event).
State change conversion can be by relatively simple condition (for example, single standard conditions) or relative complex condition (for example, multi-standard
Condition) manipulate.Single standard conditions can be by an input compared with a threshold value.For example, simple condition can be passed
Comparison between sensor data value and threshold value.If sensor data values equal or exceed threshold value, state change can be performed
Conversion.On the contrary, multi-standard condition can be one or more inputs and the comparison of one or more threshold values.For example, multi-standard bar
Part can be the comparison between comparison and second sensor value and Second Threshold between first sensor value and first threshold.
In certain embodiments, in order to realize state change conversion, it is necessary to meet two comparisons.In other embodiments, in order to realize
State change is changed, it is only necessary to one in meeting relatively.As another example, multi-standard condition can be clock and time threshold
The comparison between comparison and sensor values and threshold value between value.
In certain embodiments, the threshold value of particular conversion condition can be adjusted.Such threshold value is referred to herein as adjustable
Threshold value (for example, the part as switch condition 306 is shown).Adjustable threshold can be changed in response to adjusting thresholds parameter 307
Value, adjusting thresholds parameter 307 can be provided for example by the alarm threshold value setup module according to embodiment.Can be from least two
Adjustable threshold is selected in one in different selectable thresholds, and can select to fit using any suitable selection standard
When threshold value is used for adjustable thresholds.In one embodiment, selection standard can include several single standard conditions or multi-standard bar
Part.In another embodiment, if adjustable threshold is compared with the sensor values of first sensor, selection standard can be with
Include the analysis of at least one sensor in addition to first sensor.In another embodiment, adjustable threshold can be cigarette
The threshold value used in mist alarm switch condition, and adjustable threshold can select one from three different threshold values.
In certain embodiments, the threshold value of particular conversion condition can be condition for study threshold value (not shown).Condition for study
Threshold value can be the result of difference function, and it can subtract constant from initial threshold.If desired, can be based on any suitable
The standard of quantity changes constant, including for example heuristic, account on the spot data, software upgrading, user preference, equipment are set
Deng.The mechanism of the switch condition for changing one or more states (for example, alert status) can be provided by changing constant.Can be with
The constant is supplied to switch condition 306 to be adjusted to condition for study threshold value.In one embodiment, harm can be based on
The installation and setting of detecting system 300 carry out selectivity constant.For example, house-owner can indicate that hazard detection system 300 is already installed on
In the particular room of enveloping field.System 300 can select suitable constant according to being which room.For example, if room is sleeping
Room, then first constant can be selected, if room is kitchen, second constant can be selected.First constant can make harm
The value more more sensitive than second constant to potential hazard of detecting system 300 because bedroom positioned at generally separate out the farther position of mouth and/
Or generally it is not easy to the factor for causing false-alarm occur.By contrast, for example, kitchen generally than bedroom closer to outlet, and can
Can produce can cause the situation (for example, steam or smog in culinary art) of false-alarm.When selecting appropriate constant, it is also contemplated that
Other installation factors.For example, house-owner can be adjacent with bathroom with designated room.Because the humidity from bathroom may cause false-alarm,
Harm system 300 is it is considered that this point carrys out selectivity constant.As another example, house-owner can include a wall with designated room
Stove.Similarly, harm system 300 is it is considered that the factor carrys out the constant of selection.
In another embodiment, hazard detection system 300 can apply it is heuristic come self-adjusting constant.For example, situation
Triggering early warning may be continued, but situation will not rise to warning level.Triggered in response to this lasting early warning, hazard detection
System 300 can change constant so that early warning less easily triggers.In another embodiment, in response to software upgrading
Constant can be changed.For example, remote server can analyze the data obtained from other several hazard detection systems, and correspondingly
Constant is adjusted, and new constant is pushed to by hazard detection system 300 by software upgrading.In addition, remote server can be with base
Set in user or user preference will be pushed to hazard detection system 300 under constant.For example, house-owner can by with hazard detection system
300 direct interactions unite to define the setting of limited quantity.But house-owner can by with for example by the base of remote server trustship
Interact to define an infinite number of setting in web program.According to these setting, remote server following can push away one or
Multiple corresponding constants.

Mist sensor states machine 314 can control smog alarm state 331, and CO sensor states machine 316 can control CO alarm conditions
332, and heat sensor state machine 318 can control thermal warning state 333.For example, Smoke Sensor state machine 314 can be grasped
Make to send alarm 350 in response to the smog episode detected.As another example, CO sensor states machine 316 can ring
CO events that Ying Yu is detected and send alarm 350.As another example, heat sensor state machine 318 can be in response to detection
To incident heat and send alarm 350.In certain embodiments, sensor states machine can be to one or more alarm conditions
330 carry out exclusiveness control.
System mode machine can control one or more of alert status 340 and other states 320.Especially, smog
System mode machine 315 can control smog alert status 341, and CO system modes machine 317 can control CO alert status
342.In certain embodiments, each system mode machine can manage multiple alert status.For example, the first alert status can be to
There are abnormal conditions in user's warning, and the second alert status can alert abnormality to user and exist.It is in addition, each
System mode machine can manage the other states that can not be managed by sensor states machine.For example, these other states can include
State after the alarm of monitored state, early warning mute state and the monitored state that such as keeps and alarm.
System mode machine can manage one or more states jointly with sensor states machine.These common controlled states are (" altogether
Enjoy state ") can exist as the state that specific harm is directed in system and sensor states machine.For example, smog system mode
Machine 315 can share one or more states with Smoke Sensor state machine 314, and CO system modes machine 317 can be with CO
Sensor states machine 316 shares one or more states.For specific harm, system and sensing are shown with communication link 370
Integration and cooperation between device state machine, communication link 370 connect two state machines.In certain embodiments, can be by sensor
State machine controls any state change of shared state to change.For example, alarm condition can be shared state, and passing
Sensor state machine is transformed into any time of alarm condition, the system mode machine with the common controlled state of sensor states machine
Alarm condition may be transformed into.In certain embodiments, shared state can include idle condition, alarm condition and alarm quiet
State.
Fig. 4 A show according to an embodiment can be by the illustrative signal for the alarm process that hazard detection system is implemented

Fig. 7 shows the loudspeaker being merged into according to the logic that room is spoken of embodiment by the first hazard detection system
Illustrative process 700 in the audible messages of playback.First hazard detection system can be several harm being present in structure
One of detecting system., can be from least one reception state situation in multiple hazard detection systems in step 710.For example, shape
State situation can be by the state machine (for example, local state machine 520) of local operation in system and the system (example away from system
Such as, remote status machine 530) provide.
In step 720, it may be determined that provide the quantity of multiple hazard detection systems of its state condition.In a kind of scheme
In, the quantity can be associated with the system of experience equal state (such as smog or CO).In another scheme, the quantity can
The system operated in the state of must being reminded with currency is associated.In step 730, it may be determined that provide its state condition extremely
The location status of a few hazard detection system.For example, if user is previously related to room title by specific harm system
Connection, then the position is known.
In step 740, audible messages can be compiled based on one group of rule, these rules are made using numeral and location status
To limit the factor for the room information that will be included in audible messages.For example, logic engine 510 of speaking can be used for based on being
The quantity of system and the known location of these systems determine the appropriate voice example to be used., can be by raising one's voice in step 750
Think highly of and put audible messages.
It should be appreciated that the step figure shown in Fig. 7 is merely illustrative, and additional step can be added or omit, or
Person can rearrange the order of step.For example, can add step additional text being merged into audible messages.As spy
Determine example, additional text can the state condition based on reception.If the state condition instruction received has smog, this disappears
Breath can include word " smog " (for example, " having [in bedroom] [smog] " in audible messages.In fact, state condition can
To be the alarm condition voice example that can be used for intelligently being inserted into type of alarm in audible messages by logic engine 510 of speaking
A part.
The mode that audible messages are reset can be in circular state, alarm condition according to harm system or remove state
It is and different.In the state of circular and removing, loud alarm is not sent, it is thus possible to need not be with loud sounding alarm one
Rise and coordinate speech playback.In an alarm state, there is loud sounding alarm, any voice may all need to be assisted with alarm
Adjust, it is any overlapping to avoid.Referring now to Figure 8, show the different audible messages of can resetting according to one embodiment
Illustrative circular process 800.
Since step 802, process 800 may be at circular state.In step 804, it is determined that the circular being muted whether
Expire.Circular may be muted previously in step 830 or step 832.If be muted, timer can be started,
It postpones the declaration of any follow-up loudspeaker message, until it expires or existence changes (for example, from circular 1-HU1- to logical
Report 2-HU2).If step 804 be defined as it is no, process 800 can step 806 recover its state be Jing Yin circular.
If determined as "Yes", then process 800 may proceed to step 808, wherein determining to whether there is multiple equipment in structure.If
It is yes to determine step 810, then remote system (step 812) can be reminded when system changes into circular state.If it is not, then mistake
Journey 800 may proceed to step 814.
Loudspeaker in step 814, system can send stroke, to remind occupant to reset message.In step
816, reset audible messages.This audible messages can merge alarm example and room example, as discussed above, lead to occupant
Know current alarm condition.For example, audible messages may be said " circular, have [in basement] [smog] ".Or if one
1 event of individual circular, and in a room, message may state that " circular, [basement] has [carbon monoxide]." in addition,
If 1 event of circular, and in two rooms, then message may state that " circular, has [in basement and kitchen]
[carbon monoxide] ".
In step 818, it is determined that with the presence or absence of 2 events of smog episode and at least one circular in system in structure.Such as
Fruit is determined as, then can reset the message of explanation " form smoke into smother ", and the process can revert to and keep step 824, its
Middle speech information is repeated once per x minutes.If determined as no, then process 800 may proceed to step 824.
If user attempts to make circular Jing Yin, he or she can be in the button in step 830 pressing system, or in step
Rapid 832 press the button in application program.If pressing button in step 830, process proceeds to step 836, and its determination is pressed
Whether button pressing is implemented in starter system.If in the "Yes" that is defined as of step 836, " [in basement] smog is stated
Alarm is muted " (such as step 840).If being defined as no in step 836, circular message, and process 800 can be repeated
Step 822 is may proceed to, step 822 is defined on the latent period before another message is uttered.After the stage 840,
Determine whether that any other equipment is undergoing circular event in step 842.If it is, process 800 may proceed to step
Rapid 822.If it is not, then process 800 can step 844 by circulate a notice of state change be Jing Yin circular state.
, can be in step 834 if pressing the button in (on the mobile apparatus) application program in step 822 user
Determine whether the mobile device can be communicated with (alarm) starter system.If it is, process 800 proceeds to step
836.If it is not, then process 800 ignores the order.
If harm system proceeds to such as alarm condition of CO alarm conditions or smog alarm state, process 800 can
To proceed to step 860.If system proceeds to removing state, process 800 may proceed to step 850, and (wherein system is neglected
Slightly circulate a notice of state), 852 (circular is ignored in the application wherein on mobile device) and 854 (wherein system returns to idle condition).Such as
Fruit needs, and system may say a piece of news, indicate that all are all eliminated.
In an alarm state, loud sounding alarm be present, and any voice may all need to coordinate with alarm, to keep away
Exempt from any overlapping.Smoke alarm and CO alarms may send loud buzzer according to respective scheduled time table.This
A little timetables may be defined by Underwriter Laboratories (UL).Embodiment described herein show speech text

Message may include condition and room example, to compile the message for briefly informing the situation in structure to occupant.
When system enters removing state, it can provide disappearing for identification alarm end using condition and room example
Breath.For example, compiler may produce a piece of news, " [smog] alarm is over for statement." according to condition example, [smog]
It can be swapped out with [carbon monoxide].
The speech logic of quantity in room for specifying particular room or undergo certain problem can be in non-alarm background
Lower use.For example, each in system can carry out multiple self-test to assess the operation of several components.If in these components
Any one do not operated according to the specification of definition, then can compile and present one or more audible messages to remind
The occupant of structure.In addition, audible messages can update self-test progress status to occupant, and inform occupant " in [z] room
Test has been completed ", wherein [z] is obtained by room example, and it may indicate which harm system (is led to using room example
Cross room title identification) it is not carried out or completes its self-test.
If the multiple non-alert events of monitoring, system can be by interacting (for example, pressing button in response to active users
Or press using upper button) scrappy information is provided and intelligently avoids making the cognitive load of user from overloading.For example, it can do
Go out " circular " announce inform the individual room of occupant [n] or [many] rooms be noted that and can ask user press by
Button hears more information.When user presses button to hear more information, and multiple problems be present, fixed qty
Problem can be prioritized (for example, the problem of three limit priorities), and be announced via loudspeaker.
