Abstract
An information retrieval system uses phrases to index, retrieve, organize and describe documents. Phrases are identified that predict the presence of other phrases in documents. Documents are the indexed according to their included phrases. The document index is partitioned into multiple indexes, including a primary index and a secondary index. The primary index stores phrase posting lists with relevance rank ordered documents. The secondary index stores excess documents from the posting lists in document order.

Technical field
The present invention relates to a kind of information retrieval system that the document such as the large-scale data bank of the Internet is carried out index, search and classification of being used for.
Background technology
Current, information retrieval system (being commonly referred to search engine) is the indispensable instrument that is used in large-scale, dispersion and ever-increasing data bank (such as the Internet) searching information.Usually, search engine is created index, and wherein this index connects document (perhaps " page or leaf ") and each speech that appears in each document.In response to the inquiry that comprises a plurality of query words, typically, come search file based on the query word that appears at some quantity in the document.Then, according to other statistical methods,, come the document of retrieval is sorted such as the frequency of occurrences of query word, main territory (host domain), link analysis or the like.Then, the document of retrieval typically is presented to the user according to the order that they are arranged, and without any the level of further dividing into groups or forcing.In some cases, present the selection part of document text, offer the user with general view with document content.
Direct " boolean " coupling of query word has well-known restriction, and especially, can not discern the document that does not have query word but have related term.For example, in typical Boolean system, will can not return document about other shepherd dogs (such as Border Collie) with definite query word to the search of " Australian shepherd dog ".On the contrary, such system also retrieval and sorting to heavens probably usually about Australian document (irrelevant) and about the document of " shepherd dog " with dog.
The problem here is: legacy system comes document is carried out index (index) based on each word rather than according to notion.Notion is often explained with the form of phrase, such as " Australian shepherd dog ", " US President " or " Sundance Film Festival ".At most, some existing system carries out index at predetermined and very limited ' known ' phrase book is incompatible to document, and this is normally selected by human operator who.Since be used to discern all three, four or five or more words possible phrase appreciable calculating and store needs, so avoid usually phrase is carried out index.For example, suppose that any five words can form a phrase, and big data bank will have 200,000 unique speech at least, then have general 3.2 * 10
26Individual possible phrase surpasses any existing system significantly and can be stored in the storer or the quantity of programmable operations.Further problem is: dictionary is imported and left to phrase constantly according to their use, can invent new word more continually.To always generate new phrase from source such as technology, art, world's incident and law.Other phrases will will reduce in the use along with the time.
Some existing information retrieval systems attempt to provide conceptual retrieval by the same existing pattern of using each word.In these systems, have frequent other words that occur to will also retrieving, such as the document of " white (white) " and " palace (house) " with " president (president) " such as the search of the word of " president ".Though the method can produce the Search Results with document of conceptual dependency on each word level, typically, it can not be caught with the intrinsic thematic relation that shows between phrase.
Thereby, needing a kind of information retrieval system and method, it can synthetically discern phrase in the large-scale data bank according to phrase, searches for and ranking documents according to the phrase of document, and additional packet and descriptor about document are provided.
Another problem of conventional ir system is: they only can index in one of document available on the Internet relatively little part.According to current estimation, on the Internet of today, exist to surpass 2,000 hundred million webpages.Yet, even best search engine index 60 to 8,000,000,000 webpages only, thereby miss most available webpages.The reason that has several restriction existing system index abilities.Most importantly, canonical system relies on the modification of reverse indexing, the wherein reverse indexing tabulation of positional information that maintenance each webpage of this speech occurs and discerns the definite position of each appearance of this speech on webpage at each speech (discussing as top discussion).The combination of each speech of index and index position information needs very large storage system.
Many further problems that are used to search for the information retrieval system of the Internet are: they do not have ability that time dependent webpage is filed.Traditionally, most of internet search engine is only stored the correlation information at the current example (or version) of given webpage, and is upgrading this information again during this webpage of index at every turn.As a result of, the current version that satisfies the webpage of inquiring about is only returned in given search.Like this, the existing first example that the user can not search and webpage perhaps has specific date nearest webpage at interval.And when assessing search inquiry or presenting Search Results, search engine does not use the correlation information relevant with version or date equally.
Thereby, being desirable to provide a kind of information retrieval system, index is tens billion of and actually surpass 1,000 hundred million web page contents effectively for they, and does not have a large amount of storage needs of existing system.
Summary of the invention
A kind of information retrieval system and method are used the document in phrase index, search, ordering and the description collection of document.This system is fit to be identified in the phrase that has enough frequent and/or obvious use in the collection of document, is " effectively " or " good " phrases to represent them.In this way, can discern how holophrastic, the phrase of for example four, five or a plurality of speech.This avoid terrific nonrecognition and index by the given number word might sequence produce each may phrase problem.
This system also is suitable for the ability according to phrase prediction appearance of other phrases in document, discerns the phrase that is relative to each other.More specifically, can use such Forecasting Methodology, promptly this Forecasting Methodology connects with the expectation of rate and two phrases now the reality of two phrases with showing rate.Information gain is such Forecasting Methodology, and wherein information gain is that actual rate and expectation now together is with the ratio that shows rate.Forecasting Methodology surpasses predetermined threshold value, and then two phrases are correlated with.In such a case, second phrase is directed to first phrase and has tangible information gain.Semantically, relevant phrases will be those phrases that are generally used for discussing or describing given theme or notion, such as " US President " and " White House ".For given phrase, can be based on they Forecasting Methodologies separately, according to their correlativity or importance, relevant phrases sorts.
A kind of information retrieval system is come document in the index file set by effective or good phrase.For each phrase, insert the document that tabulation identification comprises phrase.In addition, for the phrase that provides, second tabulation, vector or other structures are used to store data, and which relevant phrases of the given phrase of this data representation also appears in each document that comprises given phrase.In this way, system not only can easily discern the document that comprises in response to the phrase of search inquiry, and can discern the document that also comprises the phrase relevant, and therefore more may be clear and definite about being expressed in theme or the notion in the query phrase with query phrase.
When inquiring about searching documents, this information retrieval system also is suitable for using phrase.Inquire about, to discern any phrase that appears in the inquiry, so that the relevant of retrieval and inquisition phrase inserted tabulation, and relevant phrases information.In addition, in some cases, the user can import imperfect phrase in search inquiry, such as " president (President ofthe) ".Incomplete phrase can be discerned, and the imperfect phrase that (such as " president of the U.S. (President of United States ") replace can be expanded by phrase such as these.This helps to guarantee the most probable search of actual execution user.
Another aspect of the present invention is to use many index structures to come the large volume document of index 1,000 hundred million or greater number level.In one embodiment, provide the main and secondary index.The index data at phrase stored in master index, wherein for each phrase, and a limited number of document of index.For particular phrase, the index data of document is stored according to the sort order of the correlativity of document and phrase.Preferably, this storage arrange to be logic and physics (that is, how with data storage on main storage device).The situation that comprises particular phrase at document more than limited quantity, the index datastore that is used for these residue documents is at secondary index, but replace relevance ranking to sort by number of documents here, and for example use the scatter-gather type method, retrieve.
For example, master index can be configured to for each term storage 32k document entry, and secondary index can be configured to store at comprising any other document entry that phrase also surpasses other documents of 32k.In order to obtain document entry, document is marked for the correlativity of phrase, and come they are sorted by their relevance score for master index.Alternatively, document can be by sorting at the useful various file characteristics of correlation analysis.The ordering that is used for document entry is used to divide clauses and subclauses between master index and secondary index.Be less than in existence under the situation of the document that comprises phrase of limited quantity, then according to relevance ranking all clauses and subclauses be stored in master index once more.The index arrangement and use can increase by ten to 15 times in the storage capacity of index, and because optimized index information, it is long that server performance produces ten multiplications.
Another aspect of the present invention is a plurality of versions and the example of the document that can index is used to file.This ability makes the user can search for document in the specific date scope, can make the relevant correlation information of date or version be used in response to search inquiry assessment document and organizes Search Results.In one embodiment, document is relevant with one or more date ranges.Each date range is associated with correlation data, and this correlation data is considered as effectively at the document from document and during date range.The current date scope is associated with the current example of document, from the date of nearest index file.When during index carries out, running into document, it is compared with previous version, to determine whether document changes.If document does not change, the correlation data that reserves index so.If document change, the current date scope of document is closed so, and heavy index file, and sets up new current date scope, and is associated with current correlation data.
At system and software architecture, computer program and computer implemented method and computing machine generation user interface with in presenting, the present invention has further embodiment.
The front is just based on the information retrieval system of phrase and some features of method.Those technician of field of information retrieval systems will be understood that the general dirigibility of phrase information allows to use in a large number and use in the other field of index, document note, search, ordering and document analysis and processing.

Embodiment
I. system overview
With reference now to Fig. 1,, shows the software architecture of the embodiment of search system 100 according to an embodiment of the invention.In this embodiment, this system comprises directory system 110, search system 120, presents system 130 and front-end server 140.
Directory system 110 is responsible for by the phrases in various websites 190 of visit and the incompatible identification document of other document sets, and comes index file according to their phrase.Front-end server 140 receives the user's who comes from client 170 inquiry, and provides these inquiries to search system 120.Search system 120 is responsible for the search document (Search Results) relevant with search inquiry, comprises any phrase of discerning in the search inquiry, and uses the appearance of phrase to influence to put in order then the document in the Search Results is arranged.Search system 120 provides Search Results to presenting system 130.Present system 130 and be responsible for revising Search Results, comprise removing the subject description that duplicates document recently and generate document, and the Search Results of revising provided return to front-end server 140, front-end server 140 provides the result to client 170.System 100 also comprises the master index 150 and the secondary index 152 of the index information that storage is relevant with document, and the phrase data-carrier store 160 of storage phrase and ASSOCIATE STATISTICS information.Master index 150 is distributed on a plurality of master server 1...M1, and secondary index 152 is distributed in server 1...M2 equally a plurality of times.
In the application's the context, " document " should be understood that and can comprise web document, image, multimedia file, text document, PDF or other picture format documents or the like by any medium type of search engine index and retrieval.Document can have one or multipage, subregion, segmentation or other ingredients, as being fit to its content and type.Similarly, document can be called as " page or leaf ", as is commonly used to refer to " page or leaf " for the document on the Internet.Use the not implicit restriction of generic term " document " for scope of the present invention.Search system 100 operates on the large-scale document information storehouse, such as the Internet and WWW, but can be used to equally in the set of more restrictions, such as the collection of document at library or private business.In arbitrary context, it should be understood that document typically is distributed in a lot of different departments of computer science place that unifies.Be without loss of generality so, no matter form and position (for example, which website or database), document collectively is known as data bank or collection of document usually.Each document has the identifier that is associated, and is used for unique identification document; Preferably, this identifier is URL, but the identifier of other types (for example, number of documents) also can use.In this is open, suppose to use URL identification document.
II.
Directory system
In one embodiment, directory system 110 provides three main feature operations: 1) identification phrase and relevant phrases; 2) come index file about phrase; And 3) generation and maintenance are based on the ordering of phrase.It will be understood by those skilled in the art that directory system 110 will carry out other functions and support traditional index function, therefore no longer describe these other operations here.The data warehouse 160 of 110 pairs of master indexs 150 of directory system and secondary index 152 and phrase data is operated.Will be further described below these data warehouses.
1.
Phrase identification
" good " and " bad " phrase in the phrase identifying operation identification collection of document of directory system 110, wherein phrase is useful for index and searching documents.In one aspect, good phrase is that trend occurs with the special ratios greater than document in collection of document, and/or be expressed as the phrase that significantly appears in the described document, such such as what define by markup tags or other forms, form or grammatical markers.Another aspect of good phrase is their measurable other good phrases, and is not only the sequence that appears at the word in the dictionary.For example, phrase " US President " is the phrase of other phrases of prediction such as " George Bush " and " bielke Islington ".Yet, other phrases are not useable for predicting, such as " fell down stairs (falling stair) ", " top of the morning (trump pitcher) " or " out of the blue (suddenly) ", this is because similar these idiom and spoken trending towards occurs together with a lot of other phrases different and that have nothing to do.Therefore, the phrase cognitive phase determines which phrase is that good phrase and which are bad (that is, lacking predictive ability).
With reference now to Fig. 2,, the phrase identifying has following function phases:
200: collect possible and good phrase, together with the frequency of these phrases with existing statistics.
202: possible phrase classification is well or bad phrase based on frequency statistics.
204: based on being derived from the list of phrases of putting in order with the Forecasting Methodology of existing statistics.
Each of these stages will be described now in more detail.
Phase one 200 is such processes, and promptly by this process, directory system 110 gets over one group of document in the collection of document, the subregion of repetitive file set in time.Every one way (pass) is handled a subregion.The number of documents that every one way gets over can change, and preferably, and the chances are in the per minute district 1,000,000.Preferably, the document that does not get over before only handling in each subregion up to treated all documents, perhaps meets some other termination criteria.In practice, when new document is continued to add collection of document, continue described getting over.Each document at being got over, carry out the following step by directory system 110:
Use length to travel through the word of (traverse) document as the phrase window of n, wherein n is the maximum phrase length of wishing.Typically, the length of window will be 2 at least, and be preferably 4 or 5 speech (word).Preferably, phrase comprises all words in the phrase window, comprises being characterized by those words that stop word, such as " a ", " the " or the like.Can represent to stop the phrase window by other of end of line, section carriage return, markup tags or interior perhaps format change.
Fig. 3 illustrated and traveled through the part of document 300 therebetween, shows to start from word " stock " and extend 5 word windows 302 to the right.First word in the window 302 is candidate's phrase i, and each i+1, i+2, i+3, i+4 and the i+5 of sequence are candidate's phrase equally.Therefore, in this example, candidate's phrase is: " stock ", " stock dogs ", " stockdogs for ", " stock dogsfor the ", " stock dogsfor the Basque " and " stockdogsfor the Basque shepherds ".
In each phrase window 302, each candidate's phrase checked successively, to determine whether in list of phrases 208 that it has appeared at or the possible list of phrases 206.If also do not appear in the possible list of phrases 206 in the list of phrases 208 that candidate's phrase had not both appeared at, candidate's phrase is confirmed as " bad " and is left in the basket so.
If candidate's phrase is in good list of phrases 208, as clauses and subclauses g
j, phrase g so
jIndex 150 clauses and subclauses be updated, to comprise the document (for example, its URL or other document identifier), to represent this candidate's phrase g
jAppear in the current document.At phrase g
jClauses and subclauses in the index 150 of (or speech) are known as phrase g
jInsert (posting) tabulation.This insert tabulation comprise document d tabulation (by their document identifier, number of documents for example, perhaps alternatively, URL), wherein phrase appears among these documents d.In one embodiment, use for example MD5, the uni-directional hash by URL produces number of documents.
In addition, as following further explanation, upgrade with showing matrix 212.In one way at first, good and bad tabulation will be empty, and therefore, most of phrase will trend towards adding possible list of phrases 206.
If candidate's phrase is not in good list of phrases 208, it is added into possible list of phrases 206 so, unless it appears at wherein.Each clauses and subclauses p on the possible list of phrases 206 has three relevant countings:
P (p): the number that the document of possible phrase occurs;
S (p): the number of all examples of possible phrase; And
M (p): the number of the example interested of possible phrase.May phrase can be by grammer or form mark (for example by boldface type or underscore or as the anchor text in the hyperlink, perhaps quotation marks) with document under the adjacent content regions situation about branching away, the example of possible phrase is " interested ".Represent these (and other) difference performances (appearance) by various HTML markup language tags and grammatical markers.When list of phrases 208 that phrase is placed, keep these statistics at phrase.
In addition, the various tabulations of the phrase that is kept for are promptly with showing matrix 212 (G).Matrix G has m * m dimension, and wherein m is the number of phrase well.Each clauses and subclauses G in the matrix (j, k) a pair of good phrase (g of representative
j, g
k).With matrix 212 now logically (though not needing physically) for each of good phrase to (g
j, g
k) keep three countings that separate with respect to inferior window 304, wherein time window 304 be centrally located in current word i, and extend+/-a h word.In one embodiment, described such as Fig. 3, inferior window 304 is 30 words.Therefore keep with showing matrix 212:
R (j, k): naturally with existing counting.Phrase g
jWith phrase g
kAppear at the number of times in time window 304 together;
D (j, k): separate counting interested.Phrase g
jPerhaps phrase g
kNumber of times as remarkable text appears in inferior window; And
C (j, k): unite counting interested.Phrase g
jWith phrase g
kNumber of times as remarkable text appears in inferior window.For avoiding phrase (for example, copyright remind) frequently to appear in tool bar, footer or the header and be not the situation of the actual prediction of other texts therefore, it is useful using the counting interested of associating.
Example with reference to figure 3, suppose " stock dogs (stoke dog) " on good list of phrases 208, phrase " Australian Shepherd (Australian shepherd dog) " and " AustralianShepherd Club of America (U.S. Australian shepherd dog club) " are also on good list of phrases 208.Latter two phrase is around appearing in time window 304 when before phrase " stock dogs ".Yet phrase " Australian Shepherd Club of America " occurs as the anchor text that is used for the hyperlink (being represented by underscore) to the website.Therefore increase and be used for { " stock dogs ", " Australian Shepherd " } naturally with existing counting, and increase simultaneously and be used for { " stock dogs ", " Australian Shepherd Club of America " } Lock-in counting and separate counting interested because the latter occurs as remarkable text.
Each document that is used for subregion uses the process of window sequence 302 and time window 304 each document of traversal to be repeated.
In case traveled through the document in the subregion, the next stage of index operation is to upgrade 202 good list of phrases 208 from possible list of phrases 206.If the number that frequency that phrase occurs and phrase appear at document wherein represents that its has enough uses, the list of phrases 208 that the possible phrase p on the then possible list of phrases 206 is moved to as significant phrase semantically.
In one embodiment, this is carried out following test.If:
A) P (p)〉10 and S (p) 20 (number of files that comprises phrase p greater than 10 and the appearance number of phrase p greater than 20); Perhaps
B) M (p)〉5 (the example number interested of phrase p is greater than 5), then on the list of phrases 208 that possibility phrase p is removed and is placed in from possible list of phrases 206.
These threshold values are transferred segmentation by the number of document in the subregion; For example, if 2,000,000 document is got in subregion, that the chances are is double for threshold value so.Certainly, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the particular value of threshold value, the logic of perhaps testing them can change as hope.
If phrase p does not have the qualification of good list of phrases 208, check its qualification so as bad phrase.If:
A) comprise the number of the document of phrase, P (p)＜2; And
B) the example number interested of phrase, M (p)=0, then phrase p is bad phrase.
These conditions represent that this phrase is not frequent, do not use as the expression of important content again, and these threshold values are once more according to the number of documents adjustment in the subregion.
As mentioned above, the list of phrases 208 that should be noted that will comprise each word naturally as phrase, and how holophrastic.This is because each the first word candidate's phrase always in the phrase window 302, and suitable example counting will be accumulated.Therefore, directory system 110 each word of index (that is the phrase that, has word) and how holophrastic automatically.Good list of phrases 208 also will significantly be shorter than based on m phrase the theoretical maximum that might make up.In typical embodiment, good list of phrases 208 will comprise general 6.5 * 10
5Individual phrase.When system only needed to follow the tracks of the phrase that may become reconciled, bad list of phrases did not need storage.
In the end one way is by before the collection of document, because the expectation that phrase uses in the big data bank distributes, the tabulation of possible phrase will be short relatively.Therefore, if hypothesis phrase in the tenth one way (for example, 10,000,000 document) occurs at first, then this moment, phrase can not be good phrase.It may be the new phrase that has just entered use, and therefore becomes common gradually during getting over subsequently.In this case, its individual count will increase and can finally satisfy threshold value as good phrase.
The phase III of index operation is to use the Forecasting Methodology that stems from showing matrix 212 to put 204 good list of phrases 208 in order.If do not put in order, though comprising probably, good list of phrases 208 much appears at reasonably that they oneself are not enough to predict the appearance of other phrases in the dictionary, perhaps they oneself are the phrases of the length word sequence of speaking more.Remove the very robust of the phrase that these weak good phrases make probably.For the phrase of discerning, use this Forecasting Methodology, this Forecasting Methodology is expressed a phrase appears at the increase in the document with respect to another phrase possibility.In one embodiment, this finishes in the following manner:
As above mentioning, is m * m matrixes of storing the data that are associated with good phrase with showing matrix 212.The phrase g that every capable j represents in the matrix
jAnd the phrase g that every row k represents
kFor each good phrase g
j, calculation expectation value E (g
j).Expectation value E is that expectation contains g in the set
jThe number percent of document.Calculate this number percent, for example, for comprising g
jNumber of documents and the set that got in the ratio of total number of documents order T: P (j)/T.
As above mention, at each g
jWhen appearing in the document, renewal comprises g
jNumber of documents.Can be at each g
jCounting when increasing, perhaps during this phase III, upgrade E (g
j) value.
Next, other good phrase g for each
k(for example, matrix column) determines whether g
jPrediction g
kg
jForecasting Methodology determine as follows:
I) calculation expectation value E (g
k).If g
jAnd g
kBe uncorrelated phrase, g so
jAnd g
kExpectation (j k) is E (g with rate E now
j) * E (g
k);
Ii) calculate g
jAnd g
kReality with rate A now (j, k).This is a nature, and (j is k) divided by the total number T of document with now counting R;
Iii) reality with rate A now (j, k) surpass expectation with rate E now (j, k) under the situation of a threshold value total amount, g
jBe considered to predict g
k
In one embodiment, Forecasting Methodology is an information gain.Therefore, when at g
jAppearance the time g
kInformation gain I when surpassing threshold value, phrase g
jPredict another phrase g
kIn one embodiment, be calculated as follows:
I(j，k)＝A(j，k)/E(j，k)
And I (j, k)〉under the situation of information gain threshold,
Good phrase g
jThe phrase g that prediction is good
k
In one embodiment, information gain threshold is 1.5, but preferably between 1.1 and 1.7.Improve threshold value and surpass 1.0 as reducing by two uncorrelated phrases with the possibility that now surpasses stochastic prediction.
As what emphasized, about given capable j, at every row k of matrix G, double counting information gain.In case finished row, if there is not good phrase g
kInformation gain surpass information gain threshold, this means phrase g so
jDo not predict the phrase that any other is good.In this situation, from good list of phrases 208, remove g
j, become bad phrase in essence.Attention: when this phrase oneself can be predicted by other good phrases, do not remove this phrase g
jRow j.
When having assessed all row that show matrix 212 together, this step finishes.
The final step in this stage is the list of phrases of putting in order 208, to remove imperfect phrase.Imperfect phrase is a phrase of only predicting the phrase expansion of oneself, and it starts from the leftmost side (that is the beginning of phrase) of phrase.Phrase p " phrase expansion " is the super preface that starts from phrase p.For example, phrase " President of " prediction " President of the UnitedStates ", " President of Mexico ", " President of AT﹠amp; T " etc.Because these phrases start from " President of " and are its super prefaces, back all they is phrase expansions of phrase " President of ".
Thereby, based on information gain threshold previously discussed, each the phrase g on the list of phrases 208 that remains on
jOther phrases with some numbers of prediction.Now, for each phrase g
j, searching system 110 is carried out and each prediction phrase g
kString coupling.Whether each predicts phrase g to the string matching test
kBe phrase g
jExpansion.If all prediction phrase g
kBe phrase g
jPhrase expansion, phrase g so
jBe incomplete, and from good list of phrases 208, remove, and be added into imperfect list of phrases 216.Therefore, not g if there is at least one
jThe phrase g of expansion
k, g is complete so, and in the list of phrases 208 that is retained in.For example, " President of the United " is imperfect phrase, and this is because unique other phrases of its prediction are its expansions " President of the United States ".
216 of imperfect list of phrases are very useful during actual search.When receiving enemy's search inquiry, at imperfect list of phrases 216, relatively this search inquiry.If should inquire about clauses and subclauses in (perhaps its part) list of matches, search system 120 can be searched the most probable phrase expansion (having the phrase expansion of high information gain with respect to imperfect phrase) of imperfect phrase so, and give the user with this phrase extended hints, perhaps automatically phrase is expanded and searched for.For example, if search inquiry is " President of the United ", search system 120 can be from trend user prompt " President of the United States " as search inquiry.
After the final stage of index process is finished, good list of phrases 208 will comprise the good phrase of having found in a large number in data bank.Each of the phrase that these are good will predict that at least one is not other phrases of its phrase expansion.That is, use each good phrase to be illustrated in significant notion or the thought of expressing in the data bank with enough frequencies and independence.Unlike the existing system that uses predetermined or picking phrase, the actual phrase that is used in the good list of phrases reflection data bank.And owing to periodically repeat above-mentioned getting over and the index process when new document is added into collection of document, when new phrase entered dictionary, directory system 110 detected new phrase automatically.
2.
The identification of relevant phrases and the cluster of relevant phrases
With reference to figure 4, the relevant phrases identifying comprises following feature operation.
400: identification has the relevant phrases of high information gain value.
402: the cluster of identification relevant phrases.
404: storage cluster bit vectors and cluster number.
Now, describe each of these operations in detail.
At first, recalling together now, matrix 212 comprises good phrase g
j, wherein each use information gain of being higher than information gain threshold is predicted at least one other good phrase g
kIn order to discern 400 relevant phrases, so, for every couple of good phrase (g
j, g
k), information gain and relevant phrases threshold value (for example, 100) are compared.That is, at I (g
j, g
k) under 100 the situation, g
jAnd g
kIt is relevant phrases.
This high threshold is used to discern the same existing of the fine good phrase that surmounts the statistical expection rate.Statistics ground, it means phrase g
jAnd g
kExisting together surpassing expected with showing 100 times of rates.For example, the phrase " monica Lewinsky (Mo Nika Lewinsky) " of consideration in document, phrase " BillClinton (Clinton) " occurs 100 times in same document probably, and phrase " Clinton " appears on any document of selecting at random probably so.Explain that this another mode is: because show rate together is 100: 1, and then Yu Ce accuracy rate is 99.999%.
Thereby, any clauses and subclauses (g less than the relevant phrases threshold value
j, g
k) be cleared expression phrase g
j, g
kUncorrelated.Represent all relevant phrases now with any reservation clauses and subclauses that show in the matrix 212.
Then by information gain value I (g
j, g
k) sort with the every capable g that shows matrix 212
jIn row g
k, make to have the relevant phrases g of high information gain
kListed at first.Therefore, at given phrase g
j, it is relevant which other phrase most probable this ordering identification discerns according to information gain.
Next step is the cluster definite 402 which relevant phrases are formed relevant phrases together.Cluster is wherein each phrase set of having the relevant phrases of high information gain about at least one other phrase.In one embodiment, cluster is by following identification.
Every capable g at matrix
jIn, one or more phrase g that are relevant to will be arranged
jOther phrases.This set is relevant phrases set R
j, R={g wherein
k, g
l... g
m.
For R
jIn each relevant phrases m, directory system 110 determines whether that each other relevant phrases among the R also are relevant to g
jTherefore, if I is (g
k, g
l) also be non-zero, g so
j, g
kAnd g
lIt is the part of cluster.At every couple among the R (g
l, g
m), repeat this cluster test.
For example, suppose that good phrase " bielke Islington " is relevant to phrase " president ", " Mo Nika Lewinsky ", because each of these phrases has surpassed the relevant phrases threshold value about the information gain of " bielke Islington ".Further hypothesis phrase " Mo Nika Lewinsky " is relevant to phrase " suitcase designer ".So, set R formed in these phrases.In order to determine this cluster, each information gain that directory system 110 gains and assesses these phrases by the corresponding information of determining them to other phrases.Therefore, right among the R all, directory system 110 is determined information gain I (" president ", " Mo Nika Lewinsky "), I (" president ", " suitcase designer ") or the like.In this example, " bielke Islington ", " president " and " Mo Nika Lewinsky " are formed a cluster, " bielke Islington " and " president " forms second cluster, and " Mo Nika Lewinsky " and " suitcase designer " forms the 3rd cluster, and " Mo Nika Lewinsky ", " bielke Islington " and " suitcase designer " composition the 4th cluster.Though this is that " Mo Nika Lewinsky " predicted this two phrases because " bielke Islington " do not use enough information gain predictions " suitcase designer ".
In order to write down 404 cluster informations, distribute to the unique cluster of each cluster number (cluster ID).Then, write down this information together with each good phrase g
j
In one embodiment, cluster number is determined by the cluster bit vectors of also representing orthogonality relation between phrase.The cluster bit vectors is that length is the bit sequence of n, the number of good phrase in the good list of phrases 208.For given good phrase g
j, the bit position is corresponding to g
jOrdering relevant phrases R.If the relevant phrases g among the R
kWith phrase g
jIn identical cluster, then bit is set.More generally, if at g
jAnd g
kBetween either direction have information gain, this means that the corresponding bits in the cluster bit vectors is set.
So, cluster number is the value of the Bit String that produced.This realization has the character of the relevant phrases that occurs having multichannel or single path information gain in same cluster.
The example of cluster bit vectors is as follows, the phrase above using:
The bielke Islington | President | The Mo Nika Lewinsky | The suitcase designer | Cluster ID | |
The bielke Islington | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 14 |
President | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 12 |
The Mo Nika Lewinsky | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 11 |
The suitcase designer | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 3 |
In a word, after this process, for each good phrase g
j, identification relevant phrases R set, wherein according to information gain I (g
j, g
k) relevant phrases that sorts from high to low R.In addition, for each good phrase g
j, there are cluster bit vectors and quadrature value, wherein the value of cluster bit vectors is identification phrase R
jBe the cluster number of member's main cluster, and which relevant phrases and the R of quadrature value (be used for each bit position 1 or 0) expression R
jIn common cluster.Therefore in the above example, based on the bit value in the row of phrase " bielke Islington ", " bielke Islington ", " president " and " Mo Nika Lewinsky " are arranged in cluster 14.
In order to store this information, two basic representations are available.The first, as implied above, information can be stored in showing in the matrix 212, wherein:
Clauses and subclauses G[rowj, col.k]=(I (j, k), cluster number, cluster bit vectors).
Alternatively, can avoid matrix representation, and all information stores are in good list of phrases 208, the good phrase g of wherein every row representative
j:
Phrase row
j=tabulation [phrase g
k(I (j, k), cluster number, cluster bit vectors)].
The method provides the tissue of usefulness for cluster.At first, not strict and often be the level that limits theme and notion arbitrarily, the method is recognized: form complicated graph of a relation by the theme that relevant phrases is represented, the some of them phrase is relevant with a lot of other phrases, and some phrases have more limited scope, and wherein relation can be mutual (other phrases predicted in each phrase) or unidirectional (other predicted in a phrase, but be not that vice versa).The result is that cluster can be endowed feature " part " for each good phrase, and some clusters will be overlapping by having one or more total relevant phrases.
Then, for given good phrase g
j, the ordering of passing through information gain of relevant phrases is provided for naming the classification of the cluster of this phrase: the cluster name is to have the title of the relevant phrases of high information gain in cluster.
Top process provides a kind of method that identifies the very robust of important phrases in the present collection of document, and valuably, provides a kind of these relevant phrases in practice to be used in method in the nature " cluster " together.As a result, the data-driven cluster of this relevant phrases has been avoided intrinsic deviation in any artificial directly " editor " selection of related term and notion, as deviation common in many systems.
3.
Use phrase and relevant phrases index file
The list of phrases 208 that thinks about, comprise information about relevant phrases and cluster, the next feature operation of directory system 110 is about the document in good phrase and the set of cluster index file, and storage is stored in lastest imformation in master index 150 and the secondary index 152.Fig. 5 has illustrated this process, wherein has the following function phases that is used for index file:
500: the tabulation of inserting of document being inserted the good phrase that in document, finds.
502:, upgrade example counting and relevant phrases bit vectors at relevant phrases and correlations phrase.
504: rearrange directory entry according to inserting list size.
506: each directory entry of inserting in the tabulation is sorted by information retrieval score or eigenwert.
508: between master server 150 and inferior server 152, divide each and insert tabulation.
Describe these stages now in detail.
As preceding, the collection of document that travels through or get over; This can be identical or different collection of document.For given document d, use length to travel through 500 documents in word ground from position i one by one in above-mentioned this mode as the window sequence 302 of n.
In given phrase window 302, from position i, all good phrases in the identification window.Each good phrase is with g
jRepresentative.Therefore, g1 is first good phrase, and g2 will be second good phrase, by that analogy.
For each good phrase g
l(for example g1 " President " and g4 " PresidentofATT ") (for example, URL) inserts phrase g good in the index 150 with document identifier
jInsert tabulation.This renewal identifies the good phrase g in present this particular document
j
In one embodiment, phrase g
jThe tabulation of inserting adopt following logical form:
Phrase g
j: tabulation (document d, [tabulation: relevant phrases counting] [relevant phrases information])
For each phrase g
jExist phrase the tabulation of superincumbent document d to occur.For each document, there is the phrase g that also appears among the document d
jThe count list of occurrence number of relevant phrases R.
In one embodiment, relevant phrases information is the relevant phrases bit vectors.This bit vectors can be endowed feature as " dibit " vector, wherein for each relevant phrases g
k, have two bit positions, g
k-1, g
k-2.Whether first bit position storage representation relevant phrases g
kAppear at mark (that is g among the document d, among the document d
kCounting greater than 0).Whether the second bit position storage representation g
kRelevant phrases g
lAlso appear among the document d.Phrase g
jRelevant phrases g
kRelevant phrases g
lHere be called " g
jThe correlations phrase ".Counting and bit position are corresponding to model's order (with the information gain rank order of successively decreasing) of phrase among the R.This clooating sequence has the relevant phrases of making g
kBe the g that is associated by the highest significant bit with the relevant phrases bit vectors
jThe prediction of topnotch ground, and relevant phrases g
lBe the g that is associated by with minimum effective bit
lThe effect of minimum prediction.
Notice that for given phrase g, about comprising all documents of g, the length of relevant phrases bit vectors and relevant phrases are identical to the correlativity of each bit of this vector.This realization has the permission system comprises easily relatively the document of g at any (perhaps all) the character of relevant phrases bit vectors, has given relevant phrases to find which document.To discern document in response to search inquiry be useful for being convenient to search procedure for this.Thereby given document will appear at inserting in the tabulation of a lot of different phrases, and in each such inserting in the tabulation, the relevant phrases vector of the document will be specific for having this phrase of inserting tabulation.This respect has kept the position about the relevant phrases bit vectors of independent phrase and document.
Thereby, next stage 502 be included in the document the current index position of traversal inferior window 304 (as preceding+/-the inferior window of a K speech, for example, 30 speech), for example from i-K to i+K.For the relevant phrases g that appears at each gl in time window 304
k, directory system 110 increases the g about document d in the relevant phrases counting
kCounting.If g
iAppear in the document after a while, and in the inferior window of back, find relevant phrases once more, then increase counting once more.
As mentioned, based on counting, the corresponding first bit g in the relevant phrases bit map is set
k-1, if g
kCounting greater than 0, then bit is set to 1, if perhaps the counting equal 0, then be set to 0.
Next, by searching the relevant phrases g in the index 150
kThe second bit g is set
k-2, at g
kThe clauses and subclauses of inserting in the tabulation identification document d, then, and at g
kAny relevant phrases, check g
k kCorrelations phrase counting (or bit).If any of these correlations phrase counting/bit is set up, this represents g so
jThe correlations phrase also appear among the document d.
When document d has been handled out-of-dately in this way fully, directory system 110 has been discerned following:
I) each good phrase g among the document d
j
Ii) for each good phrase g
lIts which relevant phrases g
kAppear among the document d;
Iii) for each the relevant phrases g that appears among the document d
k, its which relevant phrases g
l(g
lThe correlations phrase) also appear among the document d.
A) index of Hua Fening
Based on the frequency of occurrences of phrase in data bank, each phrase in the index 150 is endowed phrase number.Common more phrase, the phrase that its receives in index is number low more.Then, directory system 110 is inserted tabulation 213 according to all of listing in that each inserts in number of documents descending sort 504 master indexs 150 in the tabulation, so that the phrase of frequent appearance has minimum phrase number and at first lists in master index 150.See that as top master index 150 is distributed on the M1 master server.In order to reduce the disk competition, by hash function, for example phase_number MOD M1 is distributed in phrase on these machines.
Can be in order to increase significantly by the number of documents of system index, master index 150 is further processed optionally to divide each and inserts tabulation 214.See that as top the tabulation of inserting of each phrase comprises the tabulation of document.Each document of inserting in the tabulation is presented the 506 information retrieval type score values about phrase.Yet, calculating this score value, the document of inserting then in the tabulation is sorted with descending by this score value, and the document of highest score lists in first in inserting tabulation.When in response to the query and search document, this document presort is useful especially for improving performance.
The branch value-based algorithm of document presort can be and make the identical basic relevant value-based algorithm that divides that is used for generating relevant score value in search system 120.In one embodiment, the IR score value is based on the webpage sort algorithm, as U.S. Patent number 6,285,999 descriptions.Alternatively or extraly, also can store and be used alone or in combination the statistics of a plurality of IR association attributeses of document, such as the number of internal chaining, outer link, document length, so that ranking documents.For example, according to the internal chaining number, document can be sorted with descending.In order further to be convenient to carry out may retrieving the soonest of information, each clauses and subclauses of inserting in the tabulation 214 physically is stored on the suitable master server by IR type score value ordering from master index 150.
Consider that the most high minute document for given phrase is positioned at the beginning of inserting tabulation now, insert tabulation 214 and be divided out at master index 150 and 152 of secondary indexs.For inserting list entry stores on master server 150 up to a K reserving document.In one embodiment, K is set to 32,768 (32K), but can use the higher or lower value of K.Have the phrase of inserting tabulation that between the main and secondary index, demarcates and be known as ' jointly ' phrase, yet the phrase that does not demarcate is known as ' rare ' phrase.Be stored in the part of inserting tabulation in the master index 150 and be known as and mainly insert tabulation, and comprise main clauses and subclauses, and be stored in the part of inserting tabulation in the secondary index 152 and be known as and time insert tabulation, and comprise time clauses and subclauses.Breathe out assorted function for given tabulation 214 inferior clauses and subclauses of inserting according to another of phrase number, for example, phrase MOD M2 is assigned to inferior server.Inferior server ID is stored in inserting in the tabulation on the master server, to allow the suitable inferior server that search system 120 is easily visited to be needed.Be stored in one phrase on the server for each and insert tabulation, inferior clauses and subclauses are physically stored to the highest (ining contrast to the relevance ranking the master index 150) from minimum number of documents with the order of their number of documents.Preferably, there is not correlation information to be stored in time clauses and subclauses, so that clauses and subclauses comprise minimum data amount, such as number of documents and document finger URL (for example URL).Ordering and partiting step can be carried out in proper order for each phrase; Alternatively, all (perhaps a plurality of) phrases can be sorted earlier, divide then; Algorithm design is that a design alternative and above-mentioned variation can be considered on an equal basis.Any phrase that is updated with new document, sorts and partiting step by during the collection of document at each index, so that can reorder and heavily division during the index one way.Other optimizations and operation also are possible.
In one embodiment, the selection of the document properties of storage is variable in the master index 150 of each phrase for inserting in the tabulation 214, and reduces towards the mid-end of going into tabulation 214 of master index especially.In other words, will have all or major part and be stored in document properties in the document entry of inserting tabulation based on their relevance score (perhaps other are based on the attribute of correlativity) the more preceding document that in inserting tabulation, sorts.Inserting near tabulation 214 documents terminal and will only have the set of this attribute of more limited storage in the master index.
In one embodiment, in the master index 150 each inserted tabulation 214 and had three segmentations (perhaps grade), length is m, 3m, 5m, wherein m is the number of document entry here, in this embodiment, wish that each segmentation has length K, as above describe, be m=K, and the clauses and subclauses master index have 9K clauses and subclauses; So, time clauses and subclauses, wherein n will be stored in secondary index〉9K.
In first segmentation (m clauses and subclauses),, store following correlation properties at each document entry in the tabulation inserted of given phrase:
1. document relevance score value (for example, webpage ordering);
2. the appearance total number of this phrase in the document;
3. also comprise the nearly tabulation of the ordering of 10,000 anchor documents of this phrase and sensing the document, and for each anchor document, its relevance score (for example, the webpage ordering), and anchor text itself; And
4. the position appears in each phrase, and for a group echo of each appearance, whether described label table illustrates now is exercise question, runic, title, be arranged in URL, be arranged in main body, be arranged in tool bar, be arranged in footer, be arranged in advertisement, HTML mark capitalization or that be arranged in some type.
(an ensuing 3m clauses and subclauses), only memory stick 1-3 in second segmentation.
In the 3rd segmentation (last 5m clauses and subclauses), only memory stick 1.
Reduce systematically that to be stored in each document properties of inserting the aft section of tabulation 214 be acceptable, be determined seldom relevant with particular phrase (low correlation score value) because insert near the terminal document of tabulation, and therefore do not needed all to store their all Correlation properties.
Aforementioned storage arrangement makes it possible to the remarkable clauses and subclauses more than conventional art of storage under the situation of given hard disc storage capacity.The first, provide reduction for the elimination of the speech positional information of each phrase in each document, thereby effectively doubled to store the number of document for the required memory capacity 50% of given collection of document.The second, between master index and secondary index, divide insert tabulation and only in master index memory dependency information provide the segmentation of further essence to economize.A lot of phrases have in the tabulation above 100,000 their inserting, even 1,000,000 document.Only the correlation information of memory limited quantity clauses and subclauses has been eliminated the storage needs of the document that unlikely is returned in search in master index.Number of documents can be stored in this aspect has increased about 10 times.At last, come optionally storage correlation information still less in master index 150, realized that further segmentation economizes (probably cutting down the required memory capacity of 25%-50%) by seldom relevant (the low ordering) document of inserting at each in the tabulation 214.
B) determine the theme of document
By phrase institute quoted passage shelves and realize that cluster information provides another advantage of directory system 110, it can determine theme about document based on relevant phrases information.
Suppose the phrase g reserve for giving
jAnd given document d, it is as follows to insert list of entries:
g
j: document d: relevant phrases counting :=3,4,3,0,0,2,1,1,0}
Relevant phrases bit vectors :={ 111110000010101001}
Wherein, the relevant phrases bit vectors is illustrated in bit-bit centering.
From the relevant phrases bit vectors, can determine the main and secondary theme of document d.Theme is represented (1,1) by bit, and inferior theme is represented (1,0) by bit.The relevant phrases bit is represented at the right relevant phrases g of bit (1,1)
jAppear among the document d correlations phrase g
lAlso be like this.This author that can be interpreted as document d uses several relevant phrases g together in writing document
j, g
kAnd g
lBit is to (1,0) expression g
jAnd g
kAll occur, but not from g
kOther correlations phrases occur, and therefore this is little important theme.
C) come the index file example at file retrieval
An alternative embodiment of the invention is supported in the index storage and keeps the ability of history archive, and thereby supports the file retrieval of the particular instance a few days ago (version) of each document or webpage.This ability has different useful purposes, comprise and make the user can search for document in the specific date scope, make search system 120 when assessing document in response to search inquiry and organizing Search Results, use the relevant correlation information of date or version.
In this embodiment, document identifier is at date space coding document identification.When directory system 110 got over document for the first time, document identifier was stored the hash as the dater of document URL and document, for example, and MD5 (URL, first date).The date range field is associated with the particular instance of document, and it comprises for the date range that is considered to effective document examples.Date range can be designated right as the date, comprises that document is considered to effective first date (index date) and document is considered to effectively last date (for example, 11-01-04; 12-15-04).Alternatively, date range can be designated as first date, and the number (for example, 11-01-04,45) that is illustrated in the fate after first date.Date can be designated as any effective form, comprises date literal or fate.During document was current effective document cycle, second value was the status indication or the token (comprising the NULL value) of this state of expression; This is known as works as space before.For example, (11-01-04, " opening ") represent document current be effective.This expression document will satisfy the search of the date restriction that comprises after date on the firstth.No matter specific realization at can being known as " opening the date " for first date at interval of fixing the date, and can be known as " closing the date " at the last date at given interval.
During by directory system 110 index one way subsequently, directory system 110 determines whether that document changes.If there is not change in the document, directory system 110 is not taked further action to document so.If document changes (the new example or the version of document), directory system 110 weighs index files so.When weighing index, directory system 110 is labeled as current date by the change open mode and subtracts one day, closes and works as space before.For example, if directory system 110 changes at 12/16/04 index file and definite document, close so when space before as follows: (11-01-04 12-15-04), and creates the new space before of working as, for example, (12-16-04, " opening ").Directory system 110 keeps each date range of document, together with the respective index correlation data (for example, phrase, correlativity statistics, intra-document link or the like) of date range.Therefore, the set of each date range and correlation data is associated with the particular instance or the version of document.For each day period interval that is used for given document, directory system keeps unique document identifier, and MD5 (URL, first date) for example is so that can retrieve the document examples of suitable buffer memory.In the embodiment that uses the main and secondary index, when finishing the index one way, the tabulation 214 of inserting in the master index is heavily marked, is reordered and heavily divided.
Whether given document is determined and can be made by any way from what last time, the index one way changed, comprise the use statistical rules, syntax rule or similar heuristic rule.In one embodiment, directory system 110 uses the document phrase to determine whether that document changes.When index file, the top n theme is identified and keeps as the tabulation that is associated with date range information, for example, and date range (11-04-04, preceding 20 themes 12-15-04).Indexed example topic list compares with the topic list (preferably closing date range recently) of existing document examples then.Change (for example, 5%) if surpass the theme of M%, document is considered to change so, and weighs index at genitive phrase.Be noted that and determine that the additive method whether document has changed also can use, and use optional based on the index of phrase.For example, can use the statistical rules set based on the change of document length, change, the change of word frequency, the change of HTML type quantity or the additive method of file structure and content of frequent speech.
III. search system
Search system 120 operations are with the reception inquiry and search for document associated with the query, and the tabulation of these documents (using the link of document) is provided in search result set.Fig. 6 has illustrated the major function operation of search system 120:
600: the phrase in the identification inquiry.
602: retrieve the document relevant with query phrase.
604: the document in the Search Results is sorted according to phrase.
The segmentation section of each of these stages is as follows.
1. discern the phrase in inquiry and the query expansion
The phase one 600 of search system 120 is to be identified in any phrase that occurs in the inquiry, to imitate the ground search index, has used following term in this part:
Q: as input and the inquiry that receives by search system 120.
Qp: the phrase that occurs in the inquiry.
The relevant phrases of Qr:Qp.
The phrase expansion of Qe:Qp.
The associating of Q:Qp and Qr.
Receive inquiry q from client 190, have the nearly character or the word of certain maximum amount.
Use the phrase window that is of a size of N (for example, 5) by search system 120, with the speech of traversal queries q.N speech expanded to the right in first speech that the phrase window starts from inquiring about.Then, this window moves right M-N time, and wherein M is the number of speech in the inquiry.
At each the window's position, there be N speech (or still less) in the window.Possible query phrase formed in these speech.Whether search possible phrase in good list of phrases 208, be good phrase to determine it.If possible in the list of phrases 208 that phrase appears at, return so at the phrase of phrase number; Possible phrase is candidate's phrase now.
In each window might phrase be verified with after determining that whether they be good candidate's phrase, search system 120 will have the phrase number set at corresponding phrase in the inquiry.Then, right mouthful to these phrases number sort (descending).
Start from the highest phrase number as first candidate's phrase, search system 120 determines whether there is another candidate's phrase in the stationary digital distance in the sorted lists, that is, the difference between phrase number in threshold quantity, for example, 20,000.If the phrase of high order end is selected as effective query phrase Qp in the inquiry like this, so.This query phrase and all its subphrases are removed from candidate list, and tabulation is rearranged preface and re-treatment.This handles the result is the set of effective query phrase Qp.
For example, suppose that search inquiry is " Hillary Rodham Clinton Bill on the SenateFloor ".Search system 120 will be discerned following candidate's phrase, " Hillary Rodham ClintonBill on ", " Hillary Rodham Clinton Bill " and " Hillary Rodham Clinton ".Abandoned for preceding two, and last is retained as effective query phrase.Next search system 120 will be discerned " Bill on the Senate Floor " and subphrase " Bill on theSenate ", " Bill on the ", " Bill on ", Bill " " and will select " Bill " as effective query phrase Qp.At last, search system 120 will be resolved phrase " on the senate floor " and be determined that " Senate Floor " is as effective query phrase.
Next, the effective phrase Qp of search system 120 adjustment is used for initial caps.When resolving this inquiry, search system 120 is discerned potential initial caps in each effective phrase.Using known initial caps table, is " the united states " of " United States " such as initial caps, perhaps by using the initial caps algorithm based on grammer, can finish this.This has just generated the query phrase set of suitable initial caps.
Then, search system 120 makes the capitalization phrase of second one way by initial, and only selects the phrase of high order end and initial caps, and wherein phrase and its subphrase appear in the set.For example, will be made " President of the United States " by initial caps about the search of " president of the united states ".
In the next stage, search system 120 is discerned 602 documents relevant with query phrase Q.Search system 120 then retrieval and inquisition phrase Q insert tabulation, and if desired, common factor (intersect) is got in these tabulations, insert in the tabulation to determine which document appears at query phrase all (or some).If the phrase Q in the inquiry has phrase expansion Qe set (below further describe), search system 120 being inserted before tabulation gets common factor opposing so, at first forms the associating that tabulation is inserted in the phrase expansion.As mentioned above, search system 120 is discerned the phrase expansion by search each query phrase Q in imperfect list of phrases 216.
Use master index 150 and secondary index 152, search system 120 can further be optimized and gets intersection operation.Whether based on query phrase is common or rare, four kinds of common factor analysis situations of getting commonly used that exist search system 120 to have to handle.
First kind of situation is at single query phrase, its both can be common also can be rare.In this case, search system 120 will come from the inserting of phrase of master index 150 and select (for example, 100 or 1000) first entry of quantity to be delivered to phase sorting 604 in the tabulation, be used for final ordering.Because document is according to sort order, phase sorting can the optimization sorting operation.Alternatively and since the correlativity by they and phrase presort these, so can directly collection of document be provided as Search Results, provide instantaneous result basically to the user.
Second kind of situation is wherein to have two common query phrases.Here, each phrase inserts tabulation 214 and common factor is got in these tabulations in the search system 120 visit master indexs 150, to form final lists of documents, this final lists of documents is sent to phase sorting 604 then, is used for carrying out relevance score based on the correlation properties set that is associated with document.Have K document at least in the tabulation because insert at each, thus have the high possibility of the document of the sufficient amount that comprises two phrases, and therefore inferior clauses and subclauses in the secondary index 152 to get common factor optional.This has further reduced retrieves required time quantum.
The third situation is wherein to have two rare query phrases.This situation is handled in the mode identical with second kind of situation, because here whole list storage of inserting of each phrase are in master index.
Last a kind of situation is that wherein effective query phrase comprises common phrase and rare phrase.In this case, search system 120 is at first got common factor to the tabulation 214 of inserting that comes from the master index 150 that is used for two phrases, to form first set or the common document.Next, the tabulation of inserting of 120 pairs of rare phrases of search system is got common factor with the inferior clauses and subclauses (it is with the number of documents rank order) of common phrase, to form second set of common document.With two set in conjunction with and be delivered to phase sorting then.
Wherein can be by one that uses said method continuous all examples that occur simultaneously and handle to have three or more query phrases of getting.

Ordering
A) based on the phrase that comprises to document ordering
Search system 120 provides phase sorting 604, wherein uses correlation information and document properties together with the phrase information in the relevant phrases bit vectors of each document, and the cluster bit vectors that is used for query phrase, to the document ordering in the Search Results.The method is according to the phrase that is included in the document, and " main body index entry (body hits) " comes ranking documents perhaps off the record.
As mentioned above, for any given phrase g
j, g
jEach the document d in the tabulation of inserting have related relevant phrases bit vectors, which relevant phrases g it discerns
kAnd which correlations phrase g
lAppear among the document d.The relevant phrases and the correlations phrase that appear in the given document are many more, and the bit that will be provided with in the relevant phrases bit vectors at the document of given phrase is many more.The bit that is set up is many more, and the numerical value of relevant phrases bit vectors is big more.
Thereby, in one embodiment, search system 120 according to their relevant phrases bit vectors value to the document ordering in the Search Results.Comprise the relevant phrases bit vectors that will have mxm. with the document of the relevant phrases of query phrase Q, and these documents will become the highest document of ordering in the Search Results.
The method wishes that this is because semantically these documents are all the most relevant on theme with query phrase.Note that because relevant phrases information is used to discern relevant documentation and then to these document orderings, so although document does not comprise the high-frequency of input inquiry speech q, the method also provides the document of height correlation.Therefore the low-frequency document that has the input inquiry speech still can have a large amount of phrases relevant with query word and phrase, and the high-frequency of query word and phrase does not still have the document of relevant phrases more relevant than only having.
In a second embodiment, the relevant phrases of the query phrase Q that comprises according to document, each document scores in 120 pairs of results sets of search system.Following this process of finishing:
Given each query phrase Q is with there being n the phrase relevant with query phrase, as discerning during the phrase identifying.As mentioned above, relevant inquiring phrase Qr is sorted according to their information gain that comes from query phrase Q.Then, these relevant phrases are assigned with counts, start from (promptly at N the point of the first relevant phrases Qr1, has the relevant phrases Qr of high information gain that comes from Q), being N-1 point at next relevant phrases Qr2 then, then, is N-2 point for Qr3, by that analogy, so that distribute a point for last relevant phrases QrN.
Then, in the following manner, give each document scores in the Search Results, promptly occur, and will distribute to counting of each such relevant phrases Qr and offer document by that relevant phrases Qr that determines query phrase Q.Document is sorted to minimum branch from best result then.
When further refinement, search system 120 can be selected particular document from results set.In some cases, document can be relevant with a lot of different themes; Be especially so particularly for longer document.In a lot of situations, compare with document about many different themes, the user prefers the document at the single theme of expressing in inquiry.
For selected these back Doctypes, the cluster information in the cluster bit vectors of search system 120 use query phrases, and remove any document that wherein exists above cluster threshold number in the document.For example, search system 120 can remove any document that comprises more than two clusters.This cluster threshold value can be scheduled to, and is perhaps set as search parameter by the user.
B) based on the anchor phrase to document ordering
Except the main body index entry based on query phrase Q sorts to the document in the Search Results, in one embodiment, the also appearance in arriving the anchor point (anchor) of other documents based on query phrase Q and relevant inquiring phrase Qr of search system 120 is to document ordering.In one embodiment, search system 120 is for each document calculations score value, and it is the function of two score values, body items index score value and anchor index entry score value.
For example, the document score value for given document can be calculated as follows:
Score value=.30* (main body index entry score value)+.70 (anchor index entry score value).
.30 can be with the weight of .70 according to the hope adjustment.In the manner described above, consider query phrase Q, the main body index entry score value of document is the numerical value of the mxm. relevant phrases bit vectors of document.Alternatively, this value can be by search system 120 by searching each query phrase Q in index 150, from the access document the tabulation of inserting of query phrase Q, and visits the relevant phrases bit vectors then and directly obtain.
The anchor index entry score value of document d is the function of the relevant phrases bit vectors of query phrase Q, and wherein Q is the anchor item in the document of reference documents d.When the document in the set of directory system 110 index files, it keeps a lists of documents for each phrase, wherein in described document phrase be outside anchor text in the link, and also tabulate for each document keeps the internal chaining (and related anchor text) from other documents.The internal chaining of document is the reference (for example, hyperlink) from other documents (reference documents) to given document.
In order to determine the anchor index entry score value of given document, repeatedly by the set of the reference documents R (i=1 is to the number of reference documents) that lists in the index, disease draws following achievement to search system 12 by anchor phrase Q:
R.Q. relevant phrases bit vectors * D.Q. relevant phrases bit vectors.
The product value here is the theme anchor phrase Q score value relevant with document D.This score value is called as " inbound (inbound) score value component " here.This product has been weighed the related bits vector of current document D effectively by the related bits vector of the anchor phrase among the reference documents R.If reference documents R oneself relevant with query phrase Q (and therefore, having the relevant phrases bit vectors of higher value), this will increase the importance of current document D score value so.As mentioned above, main body index entry score value and anchor index entry score value are combined to create the document score value.
Next, for each reference documents R, obtain the relevant phrases bit vectors of each anchor phrase Q.This is the anchor phrase Q method relevant with document R.Here take advantage of this value to be departures (outbound) score value component.
Then, at anchor phrase Q, it is right to extract all (reference documents are by reference documents) from index 150.Then, these are sorted association (departures score value component, the inbound score value component) value by them.Depend on realization, any one of these components can be main sort key, and other can make the minor sort key word.Then, ranking results is presented to the user.According to departures score value component document being sorted makes that the inquiry as the anchor index entry is had a document ordering of many relevant phrases is the highest, therefore represents these documents as " expert " document.According to inbound score value component document is sorted and to make document ordering the highest by the frequent reference of anchor item.
C) based on the date range correlativity to document ordering
During search and the sorting operation, search system 120 can be used date range information in some kinds of modes.The first, search system 120 can use date range as clear and definite search delimiter.For example, can comprise speech or phrase and date, such as " United States Patent and Trademark Office 12/04/04 ".Search system 120 can the Identification Date item, and selects to have the phrase of hope then and by at the document that comprises the date range index of date field in the inquiry.Then, from the document of selecting, search system 120 can be used the correlation data with the date range associated index, obtains the relevance score at each document.In this way, replace current example, can the older or former example of search file, wherein more relevant with search inquiry.This document and page for frequent change is particularly useful, such as the homepage of the new website that comprises frequent change information and other websites.
Second, in search inquiry, do not comprise under the situation of date field, search system 120 can make the date and time information in the index of reference in the following manner during relevance ranking, promptly how old the document relevance score value is weighted, so that older document makes their relevance score weights descend (perhaps newer document weight is higher) by having according to them.Alternatively, in some cases, maximally related with theme is the older version of document, rather than the current version of document.For example, the news portal site of creating simultaneously constantly in historic incident is more relevant with ad hoc inquiry about incident than the current example of new inlet probably.In this case, search system 120 can promote the weight of older document examples, wherein for example, divide binarization mode to show, following decline at the relevance score of the how current example of the document around the increase on some historical dates at the document relevance of all document examples.
In one or more date field is included in situation in the search inquiry, as mentioned above, document can make their weight descend with date speech and document date range between gap proportional so that older or make their relevance score weight decline than the document that the date field of wishing is upgraded than scope (weighing) a few days ago from opening or close the date.On the contrary, under the situation on date of the more close hope of date range of document, the relevance score weight increases, rather than weight descends.
The 3rd, search system 120 can use date range information as the main or secondary cause that is used for the Search Results ordering.For example, document can be with sequential packet between the inverse time (for example, month grouping), and in every group, document can be from being related to most least relevant listing with search inquiry.
Another use of data area information is: the renewal frequency based on document is come ranking documents.Search system 120 can be determined the example number (for example, the number of discontinuous date range) above the given document in a time interval (can keep this counting during the index).Then, the example number is used to improve those weights of the document of frequent updating more.
