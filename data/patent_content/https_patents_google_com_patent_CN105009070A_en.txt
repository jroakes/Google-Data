Such as and referring now to Figure 1A, the concept map of the first example system 100 for promoting the use to local machine application is shown.Generally speaking, system 100 provides following mechanism, and by these mechanism, can inform the user the existence of the machine application based on the web-browsing activity of user, the movable indicating user of this web-browsing may be interested in obtain the application of specific the machine.Such as user can visit the website of having issued association the machine application (such as more effectively consuming the application of the content otherwise issued on website).Alternatively, advertiser can to website publisher payment using " manifesting " as from advertiser can the machine apply.Such as software developer can develop recipe application and the offer (offer) can applied for downloading the machine from the application shop operated by third party to culinary art Website Payments with " manifesting ", and this third party is separated with advertiser with publisher.
In the example of Figure 1A, system 100 comprises publisher's server 102, marketplace server 104 and equipment 106.Publisher's server 102 and marketplace server 104 comprise at least one server computing device separately.Publisher's server 102 is the operation systems implementing to have the website of one or more webpage.Webpage be may have access to by network (not shown), such as the Internet and comprise can as following further specifically described with equipment 106 access alternately various/nonreciprocal resource (such as text, audio/video file etc.).Publisher's server 102 such as can be to provide the server of the marker code for playing up (render) American Newspaper website (this website comprises a large amount of webpage be separated).In contrast, marketplace server 104 implements the operation system of online software store, and this online software store allows user to browse and is applied to compatible computing equipment, such as equipment 106 and other operation with downloading computer.Marketplace server 104 can be such as the server system for implementing the GOOGLE PLAY market for computer utility.
Equipment 106 can be handheld computing device (such as smart phone, flat computer etc.) and at least comprise the browser 108 installed thereon.(alternatively, equipment 106 can be the computing equipment of " net book ", laptop computer, desktop computer or other form.) in the example present, browser 108 is configured such that user can access the resource associated with the website by publisher's server 102 master control and the software provided by marketplace server 104.But browser 108 may not be the optimum software application for reading American Newspaper.In fact, the machine provided to user as the Quality of experience of the raising compared with browser 108 being applied can be available.
Such as and run through the online newspaper Web sites of this example assumes publisher server 102 master control as American Newspaper, user's webpage " http://example.com " that can be managed by publisher's server 102 with request access alternately with browser 108 in state (A).Responsively, publisher's server 102 can return and the content of Webpage correlation " HTML/JScript/ etc. " to browser 108 in state (B).Then browser 108 can be explained and carry out rendering content by the human readable format such as comprising news article 110a, advertisement 112a and prompting 114.
In the example present, remind and 114 provide notice to user, this notice be " reader application " the machine application 116 be used in access by publisher's server 102 master control online newspaper Web sites and mutual with this online newspaper Web sites time use.Remind 114 can be generated by JavaScript code, this code is the part of the webpage played up, and can perform inspection to determine that user there is no the copy of the related news reader application loaded on equipment 106.If have been found that such application, then remind 114 alternatively whether can want reading page in the machine application instead of in browser 108 to user's query he or she.If or identified the machine application, would then remind 114 can replace (and can allow user determine independently to call the machine application loaded) with alternative notice, such as conventional advertisement.
User can read the article of display and can select prompting 114 (such as via the display of the prompting 114 on " rapping " touch-screen display) alternatively, and browser 108 (JavaScript such as by performing with webpage) then can ask to apply the 116 descriptive information associated from marketplace server 104 with the machine at state (C).Responsively, marketplace server 104 can return descriptive information at state (D) to browser 108.Alternatively, marketplace server 104 can provide data to have asked so descriptive information (such as thus the publisher of association can identify total interest level to application) to its notice to publisher's server 102.Then browser 108 can play up window 118, and this window and cancellation control 124 comprise descriptive information, as such as review information 120 and rating information 122 with downloading together with control 126.In some implementations, the selection (part of such as review information 120 and/or rating information 122 can be linked to resource and by user " clicks " with access resources) of user to the information of the description of display can generate " ejection window ", and this ejection window is expanded and illustrated that some texts and/or figure (such as comment on, grade text and/or figure) are to show the additional detail about descriptive information.
One or more screenshot capture that other descriptive information that can be provided by marketplace server 104 comprises pricing information, applies corresponding icon with the machine, the text of application describes, apply, apply released date, the application copy number downloaded from application market server 104 and analog information.
Some element of descriptive information can be obtained by application market server 104 by the mode being not easy can be used for publisher's server 102.The difference that such as application market can be issued by access newspaper and sometimes larger user's group visit.In addition, the delivery system of publisher may not supported for user to applying the feature of grading, thus grading and review information will be the information categories that publisher can not easily collect voluntarily and provide.In addition, some information in information may not be only from have and used application user can form (such as comment on), and such information as more easily collected (such as by just operationally provide in application can select control to allow comment apply from the machine directly deliver to application market) by sending the application market that the machine applies compared with publisher.
Cancel control 124 and download control 126 is mainly provided for installing alternatively to equipment 106 mechanism from the machine application 116 to user.Such as user can select to download control 124, and then browser 108 can ask instantiation to install from marketplace server 104 to equipment 106 process that the machine applies 116 at state (E).In response to installation request, the machine application 116 can be downloaded and installed equipment 106 at state (F) from marketplace server 104.The machine application of such as, separation on equipment 106 can manage installs those files in an organized manner to device downloads application binary file with on equipment.
In another example, application can be supplied by publisher's server 112.Such as after the user of equipment 106 has selected to download control 126, such selection can be indicated to publisher's server 102, and then this publisher's server can supply application by predetermined and standardized mode (such as via the API that the operator of marketplace server 104 issues) to equipment 106.Alternatively, marketplace server 104 can notified to download control 126 selection and publisher's server 102 down load application can be made, as by a suitable manner the browser 108 on equipment 106 being redirected to publisher's server 102.
After the installation of instantiation the machine application 116 in the example of Figure 1A and on equipment 106, the machine application 116 can provide as the feature of enhancing compared with the feature of being supplied by browser 108 or the ability of raising.Such as news article 110a can apply 116 by the machine respectively by the more patterned and/or personalized mode such as with browser 108 compared with playing up their mode with advertisement 112a and play up as news article 110b and advertisement 112b.The machine application 116 can additionally provide touch space 128 can come mutual more completely with the resource being applied 102 supplies by publisher together with the feature with equipment 106 to make user.In this way, the machine application 116 can give the Consumer's Experience that is abundanter and more immersion when comparing with browser 108.
Other technology likely for notifying that before equipment user the machine application can be used for using with taking the photograph.Such as and referring now to Figure 1B, the concept map of the second example system 130 for promoting the use to local machine application is shown.Generally speaking, system 130 provides the application of association the machine and the particular search result shown in the search result list of the inquiry for being submitted to by user.Can show together with such Search Results and control can be selected to associate with Search Results to indicate the machine to apply, and user can select control with obtain about the machine application more information, then download and install the machine application.
Such as expand the example of Figure 1A, American Newspaper can comprise code on its homepage, and this associated codes homepage and specific the machine are applied and the copy allowing user to be easily redirected to application market to apply to download (and purchase).Crawl device (crawler) for search engine can be programmed to identify such association in the text of American Newspaper webpage and can write down such information at crawl time.More then this can be returned to inquiry at American Newspaper (or any page in American Newspaper territory) and be used as during Search Results, thus for obtaining the icon of the information (with downloading the application of this machine) about the application of AmericanNewspaper Reader the machine.Like this to the machine application notice concordantly with organized Search Results itself can provide or be provided to the part of sidepiece as advertising listing.
