Abstract
The present disclosure describes methods and compositions for protein and peptide sequencing.
Description
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates generally to methods and compositions for protein and peptide sequencing.
Background
Over the past decade, rapid improvements in DNA sequencing technology have yielded a wealth of molecular information. And although the ability to read the genome has revolutionized biological research, a vast amount of phenotypic and disease status information cannot be inferred from the genome. RNA sequencing provides a deeper understanding of the functional elements of the genome and their expression levels. However, significant challenges remain around the effort to correlate proteins with mRNA expression levels (de Sousa, Abreu, Penalva, Marcotte, & Vogel,2009) (Vogel & Marcotte,2012), leading to difficulties in understanding the precise protein quantification, modification or even sequence, leading to loss of cell status information. In assessing proteins in serum, RNA analysis cannot predict the presence of proteins, as proteins may be excreted from the cells and circulate throughout the blood system, resulting in loss of spatial connectivity between the RNA sequence and its translated target. In addition, protein sequencing can reveal many unknown proteins, i.e., proteins from other organisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, etc.) that are present in the bloodstream of the host and affect the host organism.
RNA and DNA sequencing have limited knowledge of antibody sequences because the diversity of antibody libraries results from somatic hypermutation events. In order to capture information that occurs after DNA processing and secretion, such as post-translational protein modification, translational fidelity, protein folding integrity, etc., scientists must be able to sequence proteins directly from the sample of interest (i.e., read their amino acid sequences) to infer the correlation between protein levels and their enzymatic actions. De novo protein sequencing can result in the discovery of rare and new proteins from any organism (e.g., various tissues, pathogens, mutated cancer cells) or from any protein-containing sample (e.g., blood, skin, cerebrospinal fluid, feces). Protein sequencing may also serve as a measure of therapeutic efficacy by allowing extensive physiological monitoring during disease treatment. However, there is currently no cost and time efficient strategy for large-scale, high-throughput sequencing of proteins and proteomes across the entire dynamic range of protein expression. Nor has there been a reliable method for sequencing non-target under-expressed proteins. Thus, sequencing of antibodies and underexpressed proteins using current techniques remains an obstacle and is virtually inaccessible except for the most specialized research efforts.
Disclosure of Invention
The present disclosure describes a series of methods and compositions that form a pipeline for the development and use of protein sequencing platforms that utilize aptamers that specifically bind to the N-terminal amino acid (fig. 1). Amino acid-specific aptamers can be generated using the novel methods described herein (RCHT-SELEX and NTAA-SELEX). Such amino acid-specific aptamers can be used to recognize, identify and convert each amino acid of a protein or peptide into a DNA sequence (prose), or such amino acid-specific aptamers can be used to recognize or identify each amino acid of a protein or peptide based on a visual signal (prose-VIS). Furthermore, many different target-specific aptamers can be produced simultaneously, and they can be used to generate and screen large numbers of binders (MULTIPLEX). Simultaneous and specific aptamer selection relies on reliable identification of the target. The generation of nucleic acid barcoded targets can be achieved in vivo by using non-covalent bonds between peptides or proteins of RNA-binding proteins and their corresponding recognition sequences (turdcken). Finally, a successful SELEX experiment requires that 10 be only a small fraction of all possible DNA sequences14-1015Aptamers with certain specific binding preferences and affinities for molecular targets are included in the original pool of candidate sequences. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) can optimize experimental seed binders, so unlike conventional SELEX experiments, optimal binders do not have to be present in the original starting library, but can be generated from experimentally found characteristics of the binders. Construction of a computationally derived, The ability to customize DNA libraries to perform SELEX screening using a controlled input pool can significantly increase the exploration space by systematically analyzing aptamer candidates that contain sequences with known binding properties (LEGO).
In one aspect, methods of obtaining aptamers having affinity and specificity for a target are provided. Such methods generally include: (a) providing a plurality of aptamers; (b) optionally negative selecting the plurality of aptamers; (c) optionally incorporating a control oligonucleotide into the plurality of aptamers prior to PCR amplification; (d) optionally amplifying the plurality of aptamers; (e) incubating the plurality of aptamers with a plurality of potential targets under conditions that allow the plurality of aptamers to bind to the plurality of potential targets; (f) optionally for parallel experiments, incubating the plurality of amplified aptamers with a plurality of potential targets or ineffective targets in different reactions under conditions that allow the plurality of amplified aptamers to bind to the plurality of potential targets; (g) removing unbound aptamer; (h) sequencing the target-bound aptamer; and (i) repeating steps (a) - (h) a plurality of times, thereby obtaining an aptamer having affinity and specificity for said target.
In certain embodiments, the potential target is a polypeptide, amino acid, nucleic acid, small molecule, intact protein, or protein complex or cell.
In certain embodiments, the method further comprises amplifying a plurality of aptamer candidates in an initial random library or ML-designed library in a single-or dual-incubation amplification step to generate an input pool of SELEX containing multiple copies of the aptamer candidates.
In certain embodiments, the same incubation is assayed for multiple targets, in parallel experiments, or a combination thereof.
In certain embodiments, the method optionally further comprises introducing a known amount of a known oligonucleotide in the sample prior to the step of amplifying the plurality of aptamers.
In certain embodiments, the method optionally further comprises introducing a known amount of a known oligonucleotide in the sample prior to the sequencing step.
In certain embodiments, sequencing data of the incorporated known oligonucleotides is observed to detect experimental error.
In certain embodiments, the method further comprises amplifying a normalized amount of target-bound aptamer from each sample at each repetition of the steps.
In certain embodiments, the method further comprises amplifying the plurality of aptamers under conditions optimized for the particular primers used to obtain maximum amplification and minimum bias.
In certain embodiments, the method further comprises digesting the PCR-post-dsDNA into ssDNA so that the desired strand is retained.
In certain embodiments, the method further comprises amplifying the plurality of aptamers in the presence of abundant primers that produce the desired ssDNA.
In certain embodiments, the method further comprises performing a unit test prior to each dsDNA digestion to determine optimal digestion conditions for each sample.
In certain embodiments, the method further comprises altering the primer sequence associated with each member of the plurality of aptamers to identify strong binders independent of the primer region before the step of incubating the plurality of aptamers with potential targets is repeated multiple times.
In certain embodiments, for experiments in which the desired aptamer is an aptamer that specifically binds to a small portion of a molecule, rather than the entire molecule, the method further comprises alternating targets having different local environmental binding regions between each repetition of steps (a) - (h).
In certain embodiments, the method further comprises performing the same PCR reaction on a small sample of the aptamer pool prior to step (e) of method 1 but without analysis against beads or targets to assess the effect of SELEX using a selected selection component.
In certain embodiments, the method further comprises: (a) incubating the plurality of aptamers in the same reaction with a plurality of different targets under conditions that allow the plurality of aptamers to bind to the plurality of potential targets; (b) removing unbound aptamer; (c) amplifying the target-bound aptamer; (d) sequencing the target-bound aptamer; (e) repeating steps (a) - (d) a plurality of times; (f) incubating the plurality of aptamers with a plurality of single targets in each experiment for each different target; (g) repeating steps (b) - (d); thereby identifying aptamer binders that bind to the plurality of targets.
In certain embodiments, step (e) of claim 1 is repeated multiple times in separate reactions, each reaction containing a potential target.
The SELEX method, referred to herein as RCHT SELEX, described herein, is designed to have a flow that is ideal for integrating Machine Learning (ML) into the SELEX flow (e.g., prioritizing computational requirements). Additional SELEX methods are also described, which are referred to herein as N-terminal SELEX (or N-terminal amino acid (NTAA) SELEX), and are designed to have a flow scheme that is ideal for small and/or difficult targets (e.g., to prioritize experimental requirements).
Although both SELEX methods may be modified as desired, the differences between the two methods may include:
(a) incubation in a method called SELEX-RCHT is typically performed before the SELEX portion of the method begins, thereby reducing the initial input pool to 10 < 12 > molecules. On the other hand, incubation is not generally included in the method called SELEX-NTAA, and no incubation will work better in some cases. Thus, the SELEX-NTAA method typically starts with a pool of 10^14-10^15 random aptamers.
(b) Reactions using the SELEX-RCHT method typically use parallel samples that are run in parallel (e.g., 2 to 3 parallel reactions); parallel reactions are generally not necessary when using the SELEX-NTAA method, so that as many experiments as possible can be performed in parallel.
(c) Control reactions using the SELEX-RCHT method are typically performed in parallel reactions, which take up 3 out of 12 possible incubation inputs; parallel samples of control reactions are not necessary when using the SELEX-NTAA method, although it is recommended to run one target in each experiment to determine overall experimental failure or contamination. (4) RCHT requires some noise measurements (e.g., false SELEX) to determine the PCR bias of the model; NTAA does not need to separate background truth values from noise measurements, but the signal is determined from the enrichment curve and the top candidate tested.
(d) The SELEX-NTAA method uses a target switching step, which allows for the pursuit of small or difficult targets (or sub-regions of larger targets); the SELEX-RCHT method does not generally use this additional step.
(e) The SELEX-NTAA method incorporates an additional step of counter-selection, particularly when tracking down targeted sub-regions, to isolate the best experimental binders. The SELEX-RCHT method does not include a counter-selection step, however, a counter-selection step can be used with the SELEX-RCHT method, provided that such counter-selection step is used with care, alone or in combination with other steps of the method, to avoid biasing the results.
In one aspect, a method of sequencing a protein or peptide is provided. Such methods generally include: (a) incubating the protein or peptide with a library of DNA aptamers that exhibit binding specificity for at least one N-terminal amino acid under conditions in which one or more aptamers specifically bind to at least one N-terminal amino acid of the protein or peptide, wherein each aptamer within the library comprises a peptide-binding ssDNA region and a unique barcode sequence indicative of the first sequencing round and associated peptide-binding ssDNA region; (b) ligating said DNA aptamer bound to the N-terminus of the protein or peptide to a DNA barcode construct proximal thereto; (c) removing the peptide binding sequence from the DNA aptamer, leaving only the barcode of the DNA aptamer and a short consensus sequence for subsequent ligation covalently attached to the DNA barcode construct, in order to record the identity of the conjugate and thus the identity of the putative amino acid of the N-terminus of the peptide; (d) removing the N-terminal amino acid from the protein or peptide to produce an N-terminal amino acid shortened protein or peptide; (e) incubating the N-terminal amino acid shortened protein or peptide with a library of aptamers exhibiting binding specificity for at least one amino acid under conditions wherein one or more aptamers specifically bind to at least one N-terminal amino acid of the N-terminal amino acid shortened protein or peptide, wherein each aptamer within the library comprises a peptide-binding ssDNA region and a unique barcode sequence indicative of the second sequencing round and related peptide-binding ssDNA regions; (f) ligating said DNA aptamer bound to the N-terminus of the protein or peptide to a DNA barcode construct proximal thereto; (g) removing the peptide binding sequence from the DNA aptamer, leaving only the barcode of the DNA aptamer and a short consensus sequence for subsequent ligation covalently attached to the DNA barcode construct, in order to record the identity of the conjugate and thus the identity of the putative amino acid of the N-terminus of the peptide; (h) removing the N-terminal amino acid from the N-terminal amino acid shortened protein or peptide; (i) repeating steps (a) - (d) a plurality of times to construct a chain that barcodes positions corresponding to consecutive N-terminal amino acids in the protein or peptide; and (j) sequencing the strand of the positional barcode, thereby obtaining the sequence of the protein or peptide.
In certain embodiments, the protein or peptide is from a synthetic sample, a biological sample, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the biological sample is selected from the group consisting of blood, urine, saliva, tissue biopsy, sputum, stool, single cell, environmental sample, bacterial swab, or any sample containing a peptide or protein.
In certain embodiments, the protein or peptide is a full-length protein, a peptide fragment, or a protein or peptide contained within a complex. In certain embodiments, the method further comprises fragmenting the protein or peptide prior to step (a). In certain embodiments, the fragmenting step comprises fragmenting the protein or peptide with trypsin, Lys-C, another fragmenting enzyme, an optional protein fragmentation or degradation method, or a combination thereof.
In certain embodiments, the C-terminal end of the protein or peptide is attached to a solid support. In certain embodiments, the C-terminal end of the protein or peptide is attached to an oligonucleotide tail. In certain embodiments, removing the aptamer comprises cleaving the aptamer at a restriction site using a restriction enzyme. In certain embodiments, the aptamer is attached to the barcode using a hydrostatic method, and removal of the peptide binding sequence is mediated by hydrogen bond disruption (rather than by DNA cleavage by a restriction enzyme).
In certain embodiments, the step of removing the N-terminal amino acid comprises Edman degradation of the protein or peptide, cleavage of the protein or peptide with one or more aminopeptidases, heat, pH, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the sequencing step uses a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform. In certain embodiments, the number of sequencing reads associated with the amino acid sequence of a known protein is analyzed to determine the relative amount of protein in a sample.
In certain instances, methods of identifying novel biomarkers are provided. Such methods generally include: (a) providing a protein sample from a biological sample of interest and a control or comparison biological sample according to the methods described herein; (b) optionally removing very high concentrations of known proteins; (c) performing steps (a) - (j) of the methods described herein; (d) removing high concentrations of DNA barcode construct sequences associated with proteins or contaminants that are normally highly expressed, so as to increase the ratio of DNA barcode constructs associated with low expression proteins compared to high expression proteins, thereby generating ratio-adjusted DNA barcodes; (e) carrying out PCR amplification on the DNA barcode construct after sup-diff; and (f) comparing the number of sequencing reads associated with each under-expressed protein from the control sample to the sample of interest, thereby identifying putative biomarkers having significantly different relative expression levels between the control sample and the sample of interest.
In certain embodiments, methods of assessing a disease state, assessing a response to a treatment, predicting a response to a treatment, or a combination thereof using the protein sequencing methods described herein are provided, wherein one or more signs of the disease is an aberrant expression level of a known protein biomarker. Such methods generally include: (a) providing a protein sample from a patient sample according to the methods described herein; (b) optionally stripping off a very high concentration of known proteins; (c) performing steps (a) - (j) of the methods described herein; (d) removing high concentrations of DNA barcode construct sequences associated with normally highly expressed proteins or contaminants to increase the ratio of DNA barcode constructs associated with less expressed proteins compared to highly expressed proteins, thereby generating ratio-adjusted DNA barcodes; (e) carrying out PCR amplification on the DNA barcode construct after sup-diff; (f) determining the relative amount of the known biomarker by analyzing the number of sequencing reads associated with the known protein biomarker; and (g) determining the presence or absence of a deviation of the expression level of the known biomarker from a standard value, thereby assessing a disease state, assessing a response to a treatment, predicting a response to a treatment, or a combination thereof.
In certain embodiments, the aptamer library is generated using the RCHT-SELEX method described herein. In certain embodiments, the aptamer exhibits binding specificity for one N-terminal amino acid. In certain embodiments, the aptamer exhibits binding specificity for two or more N-terminal amino acids. In certain embodiments, the associated peptide-binding ssDNA region indicative of an aptamer and the unique barcode sequence of the sequencing round comprise about 6 to about 20 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the BCS-compatible portion of the aptamer construct can comprise one or more complementary DNA sequences that hybridize to the aptamers described herein. In certain embodiments, the proximal DNA barcode substrate contains a unique barcode indicative of the protein or peptide of interest (if known) or the sample from which the protein or peptide is derived.
In another aspect, an article of manufacture for use in protein or peptide sequencing is provided. Such preparations typically include a library of DNA aptamers, wherein each member of the library exhibits binding specificity for at least one N-terminal amino acid.
In certain embodiments, each member of the library comprises a common sequence indicating a cycle number (e.g., first, second, third, etc.) and a unique barcode sequence. In certain embodiments, each member of the library comprises a restriction site. In certain embodiments, each member of the library further comprises at least one sequence for ligation, annealing, or a combination thereof.
The methods described herein can also be used to sequence full-length proteins.
The methods described herein can also be used to sequence proteins within a protein complex.
The methods described herein can also be used to sequence proteins within complex protein pools.
Other methods of overcoming the difficulties arising from the removal of functional P5 linkers on the sequencing chip surface as a result of Edman degradation are also described herein. Loss of functional P5 linkers on the surface of the sequencing chip prevents clustering of DNA barcode constructs and thus prevents the ability to sequence directly on the same chip.
In certain embodiments, after a DNA barcode construct containing a strand of the DNA barcode indicating the aptamer binding order of the peptide is established, the construct may be amplified on a chip or cleaved from the chip and amplified in solution. Amplification methods used may include, but are not limited to, PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, strand displacement amplification, and multiplex displacement amplification. In addition, the original DNA barcode construct can be transcribed on a chip into a large number of RNA constructs, which can then be converted into a cDNA library comprising many copies of the original DNA barcode. The amplification product, which is a copy of the original DNA barcode construct, can be removed from the microfluidic chamber and sequenced using standard DNA sequencing methods including, but not limited to Sanger sequencing, NGS, ion semiconductor sequencing, SOLiD technology, cPAS, and the like. The number of reads can be normalized to the number of PCR cycles for estimating the amount of each protein or peptide sequenced from the initial sample.
In certain embodiments, the methods described herein can utilize empty P7 linkers available on the chip for cluster generation. After the DNA barcode construct is created, a second sequencing primer linker containing at least (a) an antisense restriction site and (b) the reverse complement of the P7 linker on the chip may be ligated to the 3' end of the barcode construct. Following bridge amplification of the barcode construct, the reverse strand can be selectively cleaved to allow accurate base calling in each individual cluster.

Definition of
The nucleic acid may be single-stranded or double-stranded, depending generally on its intended use. As used herein, an "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that does not contain sequences that naturally flank one or both ends of the nucleic acid in the genome of the organism from which the isolated nucleic acid molecule is derived (e.g., a cDNA or genomic DNA fragment produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease digestion). Such isolated nucleic acid molecules are typically introduced into a vector (e.g., a cloning vector or an expression vector) to facilitate manipulation or generation of a fusion nucleic acid molecule, which is discussed in more detail below. In addition, an isolated nucleic acid molecule can be an engineered nucleic acid molecule, such as a recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule.
Aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acid sequences that can be composed of RNA, DNA, XNA such as TNA, modified nucleic acids (e.g., natural DNA nucleotides replaced with alternative functional groups (Chelsea et al, 2019 and Pfeiffer et al, 2017)), or other synthetic nucleic acid analogs. Aptamers are typically identified using the SELEX assay, which relies primarily on the evolution of a diverse pool of sequences amplified using one round of PCR. Aptamer sequences typically have 20-45 base pairs (bp) plus additional flanking primer regions (typically 20 for each of the forward and reverse primers)Length of-23 bp). Capillary electrophoresis SELEX (CE-SELEX) does not rely on the use of aptamers with primer regions, however CE-SELEX is limited to working volumes on the order of nL, thus starting the initial sequence from a pool of 1014-1016Limited to 108-109。
As used herein, a "purified" polypeptide is a polypeptide that has been isolated or purified from cellular components with which it is naturally associated. Generally, a polypeptide is considered "purified" when it is not naturally associated with at least 70% (e.g., at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99%) by dry weight of the polypeptide and naturally occurring molecules. A chemically synthesized polypeptide is "purified" in that it is essentially separated from components with which it is naturally associated.
Nucleic acids can be isolated using techniques conventional in the art. For example, nucleic acids can be isolated using any method including, but not limited to, recombinant nucleic acid techniques and/or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). General PCR techniques are described, for example, in "guide to PCR primers experiment" (PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual), eds. Dieffenbach & Dveksler, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995. Recombinant nucleic acid techniques include, for example, restriction enzyme digestion and ligation, which can be used to isolate nucleic acids. Isolated nucleic acids can also be chemically synthesized as a single nucleic acid molecule or as a series of oligonucleotides by conventional methods such as bead purification, enzymatic digestion, column purification, and the like.
The polypeptide can be purified from a natural source (e.g., a biological sample) by known methods such as DEAE ion exchange, gel filtration, HIS tag bead pull-down method, affinity chromatography, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. The polypeptide may also be purified, for example, by expressing the nucleic acid in an expression vector. In addition, purified polypeptides may be obtained by chemical synthesis. The purity of the polypeptide may be measured using any suitable method, such as column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or HPLC analysis.
Vectors containing nucleic acids (e.g., nucleic acids encoding polypeptides) are also provided. Vectors, including expression vectors, are commercially available or can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques conventional in the art. A vector containing a nucleic acid can have expression elements operably linked to such nucleic acid, and can also include, for example, a sequence encoding a selectable marker (e.g., an antibiotic resistance gene). The vector containing the nucleic acid may encode a chimeric or fusion polypeptide (e.g., a polypeptide operably linked to a heterologous polypeptide, which may be at the N-terminus or C-terminus of the polypeptide). Representative heterologous polypeptides are polypeptides that can be used for purification of the encoded polypeptide (e.g., 6XHis tag, glutathione S-transferase (GST)).
Expression elements include nucleic acid sequences that direct and regulate the expression of a nucleic acid coding sequence. An example of an expression element is a promoter sequence. Expression elements may also include introns, enhancer sequences, response elements or inducible elements that regulate expression of the nucleic acid. The expression elements may be of bacterial, yeast, insect, mammalian or viral origin, and the vector may contain a combination of elements from different sources. As used herein, operably linked means that a promoter or other expression element is placed in a vector relative to a nucleic acid in a manner that directs or regulates expression of the nucleic acid.
The vectors described herein may be introduced into a host cell. As used herein, "host cell" refers to the particular cell into which the nucleic acid is introduced, and also includes progeny of such cells with the vector. The host cell may be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example, the nucleic acid may be expressed in bacterial cells such as E.coli or in insect cells, yeast or mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO) or COS cells. Other suitable host cells are known to those skilled in the art. Many methods for introducing nucleic acids into host cells in vitro and in vivo are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, polyethylene glycol (PEG) transformation, thermal shock, lipofection, microinjection, and virus-mediated nucleic acid transfer.
As used herein, "specific" recognition or "specific" binding refers to molecules that exhibit high substrate specificity for a given target and very low or no substrate specificity for any other target within a known operating concentration range.
As used herein, "semi-specific" recognition or "semi-specific" binding refers to a molecule that exhibits high substrate specificity for a known target and moderate to low binding specificity for a portion of other targets.
As used herein, the "prefix" refers to at least the N-terminal amino acid, and may also include the penultimate N-terminal amino acid at the N-terminus of the protein or peptide.
As used herein, a "suffix" refers to one or more amino acids in a peptide that are C-terminal to the "prefix" amino acid as defined above.
As used herein, a "DNA barcode" refers to an oligonucleotide sequence bearing information indicative of the identity of at least one molecule. Although the barcode is referred to herein throughout as a construct of "DNA," the barcode molecule may actually comprise DNA, RNA, XNA, modified nucleic acids, or combinations thereof.
As used herein, a "DNA barcode construct" refers to a DNA strand comprising at least two DNA barcodes.
As used herein, a "barcode sequencing (BCS) -compatible" aptamer refers to a partially double-stranded aptamer in which one or more regions not involved in target binding can hybridize to a complementary oligonucleotide and may or may not contain a protrusion.
As used herein, a "blocked aptamer" refers to a partially double-stranded aptamer, wherein at least the primer region of the aptamer, but not the aptamer region itself, can hybridize to a protective complementary oligonucleotide.
As used herein, "sup-diff" refers to a method of removing a DNA barcode construct that is highly expressed protein.

Figure 2 is a schematic diagram showing a two-amino acid identity redundancy scheme in which each dipeptide aptamer binding event provides a hypothetical identity of two N-terminal amino acids, while each round of degradation removes only one amino acid to allow exposure of each amino acid, except the original N-terminal amino acid, to two rounds of aptamer binding.
Fig. 3A is a schematic diagram showing steps in a representative conventional SELEX method.
Fig. 3B is a schematic diagram illustrating steps in one embodiment of the ML-SELEX method described herein.
Figure 4A is a schematic diagram showing that the conventional SELEX method can undesirably enrich for aptamers that bind to components of the selection process ("non-specific high-affinity binders") in addition to aptamers that bind to the desired target ("specific high-affinity binders").
Figure 4B is a schematic diagram showing that adding a negative selection step to the SELEX method described herein can reduce the final enrichment of aptamers that bind non-specifically to the selection component by first removing aptamers that bind to beads, biotin, oligonucleotides, or other selection components prior to incubation amplification or import into SELEX.
Figure 5A is a schematic diagram demonstrating the various steps in the RCHT-SELEX procedure (from figure 2) in which single-incubation experiments, double-incubation experiments, and/or intra-experiment parallel samples can be incorporated.
Figure 5B is a schematic diagram demonstrating a single incubation experiment, a dual incubation experiment, an intra-experiment parallel sample, and a whole bead control experiment that can be used in parallel or sequentially during the RCHT-SELEX method described herein.
Figure 6 is a schematic diagram showing a bead-based multiplexed version of RCHT-SELEX that allows for the selection of aptamers against multiple targets in each experiment. Aptamers identified in the bead-based multiplexed version of RCHT-SELEX can be de-multiplexed in the last round by incubating those aptamers with beads conjugated to only one of the original targets, respectively.
FIG. 7 is a schematic representation of a method of identifying aptamers that specifically bind to an N-terminal amino acid prefix independent of the suffix tail composition of the peptide, the method comprising assaying the aptamers in iterative rounds wherein the peptide suffix is altered in different rounds while the desired N-terminal amino acid prefix remains the same. Four types of iterations are shown: dipeptide switching (column 1), where the N-terminal amino acid remains the same, while the suffix is switched; single amino acid switch (column 2); consistent peptide target (column 3); complete switching or null (column 4), where the peptide target is completely different between alternating rounds.
FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram showing how lambda exonuclease can be used to convert double-stranded (ds) DNA to single-stranded (ss) DNA. Lambda exonucleases favor degradation of targets phosphorylated at the 5' end at a ratio of approximately 20: 1. In order to fold and bind to the peptide, the aptamer must be single stranded, so the bound aptamer is PCR amplified with specifically protected/phosphorylated primers, which produces dsDNA, which is then digested with lambda exonuclease to transform the amplified product to allow the forward ssDNA aptamer to survive.
FIGS. 9A-9C are electrophorograms showing the extent of lambda endonuclease digestion of random aptamer libraries monitored using the Small RNA kit on the Agilent Bioanalyzer Chip System. Representative bioanalyzer curves corresponding to (a) dsDNA, (B) partially digested DNA, and (C) ssDNA aptamers are shown. Data are shown in the gel-like image on the right side of each electropherogram, with the green line representing the RNA marker. Confirmation of complete transformation to ssDNA was performed before each aptamer library was introduced into each new round of RCHT-SELEX.
Fig. 10A-10C are schematic diagrams illustrating control and dummy experiments in which oligonucleotides can be incorporated in the SELEX method described herein. The positional inclusions added in specific wells of a 96-well plate can be used to determine local contamination between wells (a). Different spikings were added at different stages of SELEX (i.e., before incubation, before PCR amplification after each round of incubation, and in each NGS sample) to determine the PCR bias step (B) for each step. In pseudo-SELEX, the removed incubations are incubated in the absence of beads and target and PCR amplified (C).

The X and Y axes are for each possible 4mer DNA sequence. The expression intensity comparisons between pools were very similar with a log variance of 0.132.
FIG. 11C is a heatmap reporting the log ratio of the quotient of the expression intensities of each 8mer combination from the sequencing runs of the DNA pools after and before threshold PCR in FIG. 11B. Minimal (black) signal confirms that threshold PCR can reduce the effect of compounding bias.
FIG. 12 is a schematic showing that primer switching can be used to select aptamers with binding affinity that are independent of primer regions.
Fig. 13 is a schematic diagram illustrating a peptide sequencing method described herein. Step 0 comprises creating a substrate consisting of a 5 ' phosphorylated barcode substrate, forward and reverse co-localized linkers, and a protein or Peptide Target (PT) with a C-terminal oligonucleotide sequence tag oriented at the 3 ' end to the protein or peptide and a free phosphorylated 5 ' end; step 1 comprises attaching the peptide-substrate complex to a solid substrate; step 2 comprises incubating the bound protein or peptide with a library of barcoded aptamers under conditions that allow specific binding of the appropriate aptamer to the appropriate N-terminal amino acid; step 3 comprises ligating an aptamer tail to a second oligonucleotide bound to the substrate; and step 4 comprises cutting off the aptamer, leaving a DNA barcode bound to a specific amino acid bound to the second oligonucleotide. After removal of the N-terminal amino acid from the protein or peptide using Edman degradation and/or aminopeptidase, steps 2-5 are repeated, resulting in a strand of DNA barcode that can be used to identify each subsequent N-terminal amino acid.
FIG. 14 is a schematic diagram showing the construction of the aptamer tail and bridge oligonucleotide. FIG. 14A is a schematic depicting a barcode-specific bridge, wherein the bridge is fully complementary to the aptamer tail, including the barcode region, except for the 3' single-stranded overhang region. Figure 14B is a schematic depicting a universal bridge that is complementary only to both the restriction site spacer and the consensus sequence that are conserved among all aptamers and flank the barcode.
Fig. 15A is a schematic diagram illustrating a peptide or protein sequencing method described herein, wherein the peptide or protein sequence is determined on the basis of a DNA sequence. In this embodiment, step 1 comprises attaching the C-terminal end of the protein or peptide to a DNA primer oligonucleotide that binds to the substrate; step 2 comprises incubating the bound protein or peptide with a library of barcoded aptamers under conditions that allow specific binding of the appropriate aptamer to the appropriate N-terminal amino acid; step 3 comprises ligating the aptamer tail to a second oligonucleotide that is bound to a substrate; and step 4 comprises cutting off the aptamer, leaving a DNA barcode bound to a specific amino acid bound to the second oligonucleotide. After removal of the N-terminal amino acid from the protein or peptide using Edman degradation and/or aminopeptidase, steps 1-4 are repeated, resulting in a strand of DNA barcode that can be used to identify each subsequent N-terminal amino acid.
Figure 15B is a schematic diagram showing an example of the correlation between a single amino acid and the corresponding aptamer barcode.
FIG. 16 is a schematic showing prior and non-prior sup-diff strategies for removing DNA constructs that bind to known targets or unknown but high concentrations of DNA constructs.
Fig. 17 shows an example of a variation of the steps in the prosseq platform.
Fig. 18 is a heat map showing estimated percentages of a potentially identifiable human proteome for each binder library having up to 100 binders, each of which binds up to 400 different dipeptides on the ProSeq platform, where digestion of the protein at each lysine results in 12mer or smaller peptides. The details of the simulations to obtain the percentage proteome coverage of the hypothetical binder set are as follows: (a) digesting a protein into fragments with LysC, (b) when one of the fragments of the protein has a matching barcode unique within the proteome, one of its fragments is uniquely identified, at which point the protein is identified, (c) randomly selecting a pool of dipeptides (paired amino acids) to which the binders have affinity, from among 400 possible dipeptides, (d) randomly selecting a pool of 20 binders, (e) given the pool of binders and the dipeptides to which each binder has affinity, determining the barcode read for each protein fragment and determining the number of uniquely identified proteins, (f) performing 12 rounds of Edman degradation, binding and barcode determination for each fragment. The simulation does not simulate noise (binders do not bind when they should bind or bind when they should not). In real systems, some noise can be reduced by redundancy in dipeptide reads and by reading multiple copies of the same protein. Furthermore, only 20 possible pools were evaluated to obtain percent match, and therefore a smoother curve would be expected for the less specific pool of binders.
Fig. 19 is a schematic diagram illustrating a binding confirmation method described herein. Step 0 comprises creating a substrate consisting of a 5 ' phosphorylated barcode substrate, forward and reverse co-localized linkers, and a target with a C-terminal oligonucleotide sequence tag oriented with a 3 ' end attached to a protein or peptide and a free phosphorylated 5 ' end; step 1 comprises attaching the target-substrate complex to a solid substrate; step 2 comprises incubating the target with a barcoded hypothetical library under conditions that allow binding of hypothetical binders to the target; step 3 comprises attaching the oligonucleotide barcode tail to a second proximal base oligonucleotide barcode bound to a substrate; and step 4 includes cutting off the binder barcode tail, leaving the barcode bound to the specific hypothetical binder attached to the base oligonucleotide barcode. Optionally, after removing the putative binders from the ligated targets, steps 2-5 are repeated, generating strands of the DNA barcode that can be used to identify multiple binding events. Note that the binding event is not limited to the N-terminal amino acid or the attached target free end, and can occur at any exposed region of the target.
Fig. 20 is an overview of a peptide sequencing method described herein, wherein the peptide or protein sequence is determined using fluorescence and microscopy. The peptide is attached to a known linker (A) on the chip. A library of fluorochrome-conjugated aptamers selected for specific N-terminal amino acid binding properties is flowed over the peptide, incubated with the target, and unbound aptamers are washed off the chip (B). The optical barcode of the bound aptamer is imaged. For each round, a z-axis multi-slice scan of the image was taken to generate the spectral feature (C) of the N-terminal amino acid. The N-terminal amino acid on the immobilized peptide is removed, the sample is washed, and the same pool of aptamer is run over it to interrogate the newly exposed N-terminal amino acid (D). After repeating this series of steps on the slide, the identity of the consecutive N-terminal amino acids of each round can be computationally derived by comparing the optical barcode of each peptide to the organism's proteome.
FIG. 21 is a schematic diagram illustrating one embodiment of the methods described herein in which a protein is isolated from a cell and processed before the protein is attached to a solid substrate. For example, the cells (A) may be lysed and the proteins (B) isolated, then denatured and digested (C). The side chains and the N-terminus of the peptide may be protected (D), the C-terminal amino acid modified with an oligonucleotide or linker (E) and attached to a solid substrate (F). Optically labeled aptamers may be flowed through the complex (G), images captured, and the process repeated.
FIG. 22 is a schematic diagram showing the construction of aptamers having regions that bind to complementary fluorescently tagged oligonucleotides. The aptamer comprises (a) an effective binding region, (b) an optional spacer, and (c) a barcode tail indicating one or more combinations of number of detection iterations and a fluorescently-tagged barcode unit (BC), wherein each BC is complementary to a fluorescently-tagged oligonucleotide. The bar code tail is designed with two variations: (1) the BC are spatially separated and can anneal to one or up to all of the unique complementary probes simultaneously, and (2) the BC are designed such that the BC sequences overlap and can only anneal to probes complementary to non-overlapping BC simultaneously. Note that since the BC sequence itself contains information on the number of probe iterations, the BC does not have to be spatially oriented in the temporal order of probe incubation iterations (as shown in the figure).
Fig. 23 is a schematic diagram illustrating a peptide sequencing method described herein. Step 1 comprises immobilizing a peptide-oligonucleotide target on a solid substrate; step 2 comprises incubating the bound protein or peptide with a library of barcoded aptamers under conditions that allow specific binding of the appropriate aptamer to the appropriate N-terminal amino acid; step 3 comprises removing the protective complementary oligonucleotide to expose the barcode region for probe annealing; step 4 comprises incubation with a library of probes hybridized to barcode regions indicative of probe iteration 1; step 5 comprises washing away unbound probes and imaging bound probes; step 6 comprises denaturing the bound probe from the aptamer and washing the probe off of the substrate; step 7 comprises iteratively repeating steps 4-6 for all probes required for aptamer identification. After removal of the N-terminal amino acid from the protein or peptide using Edman degradation and/or aminopeptidase, steps 2-8 are repeated, generating a series of optical barcodes that can be used to identify each subsequent N-terminal amino acid.
Fig. 24 is a schematic diagram depicting a method described herein for prog VIS when a library of aptamer probes consists of high-affinity binders that specifically bind to a unique N-terminal amino acid prefix. A single binding event indicative of the putative identity of the probed N-terminal amino acid prefix is observed by detecting aptamers directly conjugated to a unique combination of dyes or a combination of dye-conjugated oligonucleotides hybridized to the aptamers. In step 1, the peptides are mapped to a sequencing platform and incubated with aptamers that recognize specific N-terminal dipeptides. In step 2, each aptamer has multiple binding sites for a dye-conjugated conjugate. These strong binders can hybridize to the aptamer simultaneously and remain bound. The identity of the aptamer was determined by evaluating the combination of colors detected at each position and thus extended to the identity of the N-terminal amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 121). In step 3, the aptamers are washed away and new N-terminal amino acids are exposed by degradation. The cycle was repeated for the remaining amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 122).
Fig. 25 is a schematic diagram depicting a method described herein for prose VIS when a library of aptamer probes consists of medium affinity binders that non-specifically bind to a set of N-terminal amino acid prefixes and have a variable probability distribution for each unique binding pair. Multiple binding events, indicative of the putative identity of the probed N-terminal amino acid prefix, were observed by detecting dye-modified aptamers in multiple cycles per incubation and wash-out. In step 1, peptides are mapped to a sequencing platform and incubated with aptamers that recognize a panel of N-terminal dipeptides. In step 2, dye-conjugated binders hybridize to the single-stranded portion of the aptamer, but because they are "weak" binders, they lack the specificity of the stronger binder. Dye-conjugated conjugates that fluoresce at each peptide position are tracked with cycles to determine the accuracy of the amino acid access rate. May be used with various colors or optical barcodes. In step 3, the identity of the N-terminal amino acid at each round of extrapolation is calculated by comparing the combination of observed fluorescent signals with the probability distribution of the binding event of each aptamer to each N-terminal amino acid prefix (SEQ ID NO: 123).
26A-26C are schematic diagrams illustrating the multiplexing methods described herein. The aptamer library (a) was incubated with unbound DNA barcoded protein or peptide target (fig. 18B). After the aptamer binds to the barcoded target, the 3 ' end of the single-stranded aptamer is ligated to the ssDNA barcode (C) specific for the target identity through an ssDNA bridge that is semi-complementary to the 3 ' end of the aptamer and semi-complementary to the 5 ' end of the ssDNA barcode. The gap between the aptamer and the ssDNA peptide barcode can be ligated and sequenced to obtain the aptamer sequence and peptide barcode, which in turn provide the target to which the aptamer binds.
Fig. 26D is a schematic diagram indicating the steps of the SELEX procedure (from fig. 3) into which multiplexing techniques can be incorporated.
FIG. 27 is a schematic representation of a peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate (POC) comprising a single stranded (ss) DNA tail (a) covalently linked at its 3' end to the C-terminus of a peptide or protein target (b). The ssDNA tail (a) includes a 3 'primer region (c), a unique DNA barcode (d), and a 5' bridge binding sequence (e). Aptamers (f) include 3' bridge binding sequences (g). Short oligonucleotide bridges (h) half of which are complementary to the 3 ' bridge binding sequence (g) at the 3 ' end of the aptamer (f) and the other half of which are complementary to the 5 ' bridge binding sequence (e) of the ssDNA tail (a) can be used to link the aptamer (f) to the peptide (b).
FIG. 28 is a schematic of a nested PCR technique in multiplexing.
Fig. 29 is a graph showing a barcoded (D) protein of interest (POI) (a) complex generated in vivo in the turgucken method described herein. This method utilizes non-covalent interactions between the RNA binding protein (B) and its corresponding binding site (C).
Figures 30A-30C are schematic diagrams illustrating one embodiment of the TURDUCKEN method described herein. Pools of plasmids containing various protein of interest (POI) -RNA Binding Protein (RBP) fusion genes expressed and bound to their corresponding RNA barcodes (B) and their corresponding RNA barcode sequences were transformed into cells at an approximate dilution rate of 1 plasmid per cell (a) and then purified (C).

FIGS. 31A-31B are schematic diagrams illustrating embodiments of the LEGO method described herein for dsDNA (A) ligation and ssDNA and RNA ligation (B).
FIGS. 32A-32C are schematic diagrams illustrating one embodiment of a LEGO process described herein. Pools of first, second, third, etc. LEGO blocks (A) were sequentially joined (B) and PCR amplified to generate replicates. The resulting dsDNA is then digested into ssDNA to form a library of folded aptamers (C).
Fig. 32D is a schematic diagram indicating the steps of the SELEX procedure (from fig. 3) into which the LEGO method can be incorporated.
FIG. 33 is a schematic diagram of a general workflow of all SELEX (RCHT-SELEX and NTAA-SELEX) experiments.
Fig. 34A is a schematic diagram depicting 400 possible amino acid prefixes used by the SELEX method described herein to find aptamers to prose and prose VIS.
Figure 34B is a schematic diagram depicting how the 400 possible amino acid prefixes are organized into 16 chunks.
FIG. 34C is a schematic depicting how suffixes paired with 2-mer prefixes alternate between odd and even rounds, with only the 2-mer prefixes having constant peptide composition in all 4 rounds.
FIG. 34D is a specific example of how suffixes ("backbones") are switched in alternating rounds when the prefixes remain the same to find aptamers specific to the DD and DC prefixes regardless of the suffixes (DD/DD, SEQ ID NO: 124-127; DC/DC, SEQ ID NO: 128-131; DD/DC, SEQ ID NO: 132-135). The same culture was also used to assay targets with alternating backbones and prefixes similar to the picked aptamers that are not specific for DD and DX.
Figure 35 is a comparison of embodiments of three variations (variants 1-3) of SELEX aptamer incubation with peptide to BCS Conditions (BCS).
FIG. 36 is a graph showing the log of the ratio of the expression level of each 12-mer combination from a sequencing run of a post-incubation DNA pool divided by the expression level before incubation for 96 conditions, two of which failed (lower right panels). The X and Y axes of each plot are each of the possible 6-mer DNA sequences. The high proportion of red or blue shows an increased variance from the gaussian distribution, indicating that the experimental conditions perturb the pool of random inputs further away from the input situation.
FIG. 37 is a two-sheet table showing the sequence and read counts of the top 20 common sequences from a random sampling of 100,000 reads in the aptamer pool after one round of false SELEX and SELEX. The sequences derived from pseudo-SELEX (SEQ ID NO: 136-155) all differed from the sequence derived from SELEX (SEQ ID NO: 156-175), indicating that aptamers pulled down through peptide targets exhibit higher affinity than random sequences.
Figure 38 is a table showing the counts of replicate sequences between 9 experiments (3 replicates of each of the 3 targets) performed using the same incubation pool. All replicates of each round were pooled together and non-specific aptamers were filtered off by a bead-control subtraction method. The counts highlighted in red are the counts of identical sequences found in experiments with different targets. Bradykinin 1r5 means that the target is bradykinin, position 1, parallel 1 and SELEX round 5. GNRH4r5 means that the target is GNRH, position 4, parallel 1 and SELEX round 5. Sequence contamination occurred between the closest replicates indicated with red areas, which was significantly reduced after changing the automated procedure and the position of the target on the plate.
FIG. 39 is two examples of aptamers selected for small peptides using the RCHT-SELEX method herein: one against vasopressin (SEQ ID NO: 176-179) and the other against bradykinin (SEQ ID NO: 180-183). Aptamer structure is the lowest gibbs free energy structure obtained by the proprietary unaflod software of IDT.
FIG. 40 reports the aptamer sequences of top 5 ranked specifically and successively enriched in the presence of peptides having N-terminal lysine (SEQ ID NO: 184-188) or N-terminal cysteine (SEQ ID NO: 189-193) prefixes identified in the peptide switching ML-SELEX experiment. These results illustrate the ability of ML-SELEX to discover unique aptamers to individual amino acids.
Fig. 41A is a schematic diagram of the experimental strategy for N-terminal amino acid SELEX of example 2. 12 selections of the replicates containing each target mixture were run in parallel for 5 rounds. The workflow begins with negative selection of an initial pool of ssDNA against streptavidin beads and splitting into 12 random pools. 2 parallel selections were made for each control reference target and 3 parallel selections were made for the target (proline-proline) with and without backbone switching (C and D backbones) in alternating rounds. Representative pools of ssDNA from each round of selection were sequenced and sequence enrichment for different rounds was analyzed.
FIG. 41B reports the target composition and amino acid sequence in non-switching and switching SELEX (SEQ ID NO: 194-203).
Figure 42 reports the sequencing count of the top 10 most enriched sequences for each round. The X-axis is the round of SELEX and the Y-axis is the number of counts seen during sequencing of the 10 sequences. The 10 sequences displayed were selected for their calculated enrichment value.
Fig. 43A is a boxplot summarizing the enrichment of top-ranked aptamers for each target. Specifically, enrichment was calculated from round 2 to round 5. Each box plot shows a summary of the top ten ranked aptamers (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum) from each selection made for a given target. (20 total sequences for backbone, bradykinin, beads, 30 total sequences for PP-C and PPCD). The X-axis is in logarithmic scale and shows enrichment. The Y-axis is for each selected target. The median enrichment for PPCD switching was higher than the negative control (beads) but lower than the positive control (bradykinin).
Figure 43B is a classification scatter plot reporting enrichment differences between each selected highest ranked enrichment sequence per target. Each of the scaffolds, beads and bradykinin were subjected to 2 selections. PPC and PPCD were selected for 3. (total number of sequences 20 for backbone, bradykinin, beads and 30 for PPC and PPCD). The Y-axis is the target and the x-axis is enrichment (penalized growth). For some select/replicates, higher enrichment was observed for the same target. For example, high enrichment (>3, equivalent to 1000 fold) was observed for 3 unique sequences in parallel 2, while in the selection of the target backbone high enrichment was observed for only 1 unique sequence in parallel 1.
FIG. 44 is a confusion matrix of top 10-ranked enriched sequences for each replicate of each target (backbone, beads, bradykinin, PP-C, PP-CD). 0 means no sequence overlap between the two choices, 1 means one sequence overlap, etc. -1 represents the same choice. In these selections, some sequence overlap was observed (1-2 sequences). This information may be incorporated into the final candidate selection. Candidate aptamers to PP-CD can be selected without overlap with other control targets (backbone, beads, bradykinin), but allow selection of candidates that can recognize PP-C and PP-CD switches, as they can recognize PP on the N-terminus.
FIG. 45 is the results of a single point binding assay for 10 potential aptamer candidates. Binding indicated by fluorescence signal (y-axis) was measured for 10 aptamers at 100 nM. Aptamer 4 showed higher binding to the target PP-C than the controls (non-aptamer and buffer). Aptamer 1, aptamer 2, aptamer 3, aptamer 4, aptamer 7, aptamer 8, aptamer 9 showed higher binding to PP-D than the control. Data were normalized to the positive control (FAM directly coupled to beads).
FIGS. 46A and 46B are binding curves for aptamer 1 and aptamer 4, respectively. Aptamer 1 (FIG. A) showed an increased signal for PP-D, much higher than for PP-C. It appears saturated with PP-C and unsaturated with PP-D, indicating non-specific binding. Aptamer 4 (FIG. B) showed saturating binding to PP-D and no binding to PP-C.
FIG. 47 is an example of an electropherogram from an Agilent bioanalyzer assay with the desired peak shape at 60 seconds, indicating that the PCR product was properly digested to ssDNA.
FIG. 48 is an example of an electropherogram from an Agilent bioanalyzer assay, with a desired peak shape indicating that most of the products have the desired length (86 nt for the examples described herein).
FIG. 49 is a schematic of a BCS core sequencing unit.
FIG. 50A is a heat map reporting the read counts of barcodes added in each cycle at each position of a barcode construct, each barcode having an expected position on the barcode construct, for 12 barcode ligation cycles. Ideally, the barcode added in the nth cycle should be at the nth position on the barcode construct. In the case of x failed ligations or no aptamer binding events, a barcode will be observed in the (n-x) th position. The results confirmed that it was possible to achieve a serial connection of 12 barcodes in the desired location. Note that the barcodes used in cycles 1-6 are repeated in cycles 7-12 in the same order, and the results are not de-multiplexed; thus, a small fraction of the counts per boxed number from the expected 1-6 th cycles may be due to the five-grid lattice (marked with a x) on its right, meaning that for these sequences, at least after the 6 th cycle, no bar code is unconnected.
Fig. 50B is an arrow diagram depicting the 3 barcodes successfully concatenated into a row in a 3-round concatenation mediated by a universal bridge design, confirming that a tandem concatenation is possible using a universal bridge.
Fig. 51 is a heat map reporting the sequencing of each target substrate using aptamer barcodes attached thereto. FIG. 51A reports the total counts (SEQ ID NO: 204-243) and FIG. 51B reports the normalized percentages (SEQ ID NO: 244-279). Arginine vasopressin aptamers identified by RCTH-SELEX (highlighted in red) showed specificity for arginine vasopressin over bradykinin targets and peptide targets with DD N-terminus (DD targets) because their barcodes were attached to all types of arginine vasopressin substrates, but little or no attachment to empty control, bradykinin and DD target substrates.
Figure 52 is a fluorescence image of a flow cell with bradykinin attached to the surface before and after two cycles of Edman degradation. The flow cell was probed with fluorescent bradykinin antibody and imaged through the 555 channel. A reduced but undiscovered signal indicates reduced antibody binding, which may indicate that the peptide is partially degraded but remains attached to the flow cell surface.
Fig. 53A is a 100% stacked bar graph depicting the distribution of RNA decoys complementary to 5 different sequences (9, 13, 11, 12, 19) produced from 0.000125% sequence 9, 0.01% sequence 13, 0.1 % sequence 11, 10% sequence 12, and 89% sequence 10 raw pools and various concentrations of In Vitro Transcriptase (IVT) by weight. The frequency of change in RNA decoy sequences indicates that treatment with different concentrations of IVT can produce different ratios of RNA decoy sequences.
Fig. 53B is a table reporting the percent count of each RNA decoy sequence generated using various concentrations of IVT.
FIG. 54 is an image of an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) gel, confirming that the Spot-tag nanoantibody is coupled to an oligonucleotide (VHH-oligonucleotide). The first 4 gel lanes show the electrophoretic mobility of the unconjugated Spot-tag nanobody itself. In the subsequent lanes, multiple higher molecular weight bands were observed on the gel, presumably corresponding to multiple oligonucleotides coupled to a single nanobody.
FIG. 55 is a schematic representation of the complete core sequencing unit constructs for each target and their corresponding structures attached to the sequencing chip after ligation and formamide wash. The DNA target served as a positive control. The 5' phos.o1 control was used for noise associated with the intact oligonucleotide tails ligated to all peptide targets, while the clr.null.block.br control was used for noise associated with sequencing chip components.
FIG. 56 is a thermal map reporting the situation of each target substrate being barcoded with binders attached to the substrate when the Spot-tag nanobodies are coupled to oligonucleotides. Control runs triplicate samples, each with a different associated barcode, and DNA and Spot-tag experiments were run using 6 experimental replicates. DNA controls (Kd pM) bind and label complementary oligonucleotides with high fidelity (in sequencing counts) and Spot-tag nanobodies bind and label Spot-tag peptides (Kd 6nM) with strong fidelity. Differences in sequencing counts between experimental replicates were thought to be caused by differences in barcodes used for each replicate. The effect of the barcode sequence was screened and analyzed to derive a set of barcodes for use in downstream experiments. Outside of the target type (DNA versus nanobody, etc.), no known variables (GC content, sequential base pairs, etc.) were found to correlate with the effect of the barcode on sequencing noise. The experiment was repeated and confirmed, confirming that this protocol can be used for DNA: DNA binding system and peptides: nanobody binding systems.
Fig. 57 is a heat map reporting the situation for each target substrate that was barcoded with binders attached to the substrate when the Spot-tag nanobodies were not coupled to oligonucleotides. The experiment was run in triplicate, each replicate with a different associated barcode. Differences in sequencing counts between experimental replicates were thought to be caused by differences in barcodes used for each replicate. The effect of the barcode sequence was screened and analyzed to derive a set of barcodes for use in downstream experiments. Outside of the target type (DNA versus nanobody, etc.), no known variables (GC content, sequential base pairs, etc.) were found to correlate with the effect of the barcode on sequencing noise. For this experiment, only the DNA binder av.b4.u2.sa4.2 and its corresponding target (SP9) had a high sequencing count. The experiment was repeated and confirmed, confirming that this protocol can be used for DNA: DNA binding system and peptides: nanobody binding systems.
Fig. 58 is an embodiment of the results from imaging to peptide identification and the computational deconvolution process for a single molecule peptide. FIG. 58A is an embodiment of a series of images generated by 4 iterations of probe incubation for a single peptide molecule at position (X, Y) on the chip. Fig. 58B is a table reporting the fluorescence signals observed through each channel (350, 433, 532, 555, 647), which reflects the results of fig. 58A. The colored regions indicate signals above the noise threshold, which together make up the optical characteristics of the bound aptamer. Figure 58C is an embodiment of a look-up table matching each aptamer identity to the optical characteristics observed over multiple iterations. FIG. 58D is an embodiment of a series of aptamers observed at positions (X, Y) on the chip calculated from 8 rounds of aptamer incubation. Overlapping N-terminal amino acid calls from the two-amino acid identity redundancy scheme are indicated in black, while silent calls are indicated in red. Fig. 58E is a schematic of a sequence calling strategy in which calculated sequences generated by the peptide sequencing methods described herein are matched to a database of known peptides or a reference proteome.
FIG. 59 is a 20, 60, and 100 Xmagnification image of fluorescent bead-streptavidin conjugates on glass slides (single molecule control) and single oligonucleotides bound to a sequencing chip. The similarity in spot size observed between fluorescent beads on the chip and the sequencing chip indicates that the spots observed on the sequencing chip are single molecules.

FIG. 60B is the thresholded intensity distribution of all of the fluorescent spots in FIG. 60A.
Figure 61 is a heatmap reporting the selectivity performance of multiplexing. In a 5 target (GNRH, NC2, NC3, T1, vasopressin) assay, aptamers are first abundance filtered (at least 12 reads) and the top 5-ranked sequences for each target are ranked on the basis of selectivity (number of reads for desired target/number of reads for all targets). Off-target hits are shown and selectivity is emphasized with a color gradient from red (low specificity) to blue (greater specificity). For each target, the top 5 ranked target-specific aptamers exhibited a selectivity of 0.500 to 0.923, indicating that at least half of the reads of each aptamer bound to its target of interest. In comparison, no more than 25.0% of the reads of the same aptamer bound to any single non-target of interest.
FIG. 62 shows the peptide target sequence (SEQ ID NO: 280-285) used in the multiplexing experiments.

Detailed Description
The present disclosure describes methods and compositions to form a pipeline to develop and use protein sequencing platforms that utilize aptamers that specifically bind to N-terminal amino acids (fig. 1). The protein sequencing methods described herein rely primarily on aptamers having a variety of different characteristics depending on the particular application. For example, amino acid-specific aptamers can be produced using the novel methods described herein (RCHT-SELEX or NTAA-SELEX). Such amino acid-specific aptamers can be used to identify, identify and convert 1-2 amino acid residues of a protein or peptide into a DNA sequence (prose) via a nucleic acid-barcoded region, or such amino acid-specific aptamers can be generated and used to identify and identify each amino acid of a protein or peptide on the basis of a visual signal (prose-VIS). In addition, many target-specific aptamers can be produced simultaneously and used to generate and screen large numbers of binders (multiplexing). Simultaneous and specific aptamer selection relies on reliable identification of the target. The generation of nucleic acid barcoded targets can be achieved in vivo by using non-covalent bonds between peptides or proteins of RNA-binding proteins and their corresponding recognition sequences (turdcken). Finally, successful SELEX experiments are claimed in 10 being only a small part of all possible DNA sequences14-1015The original pool of candidate sequences includes aptamers that have a certain specific binding preference and affinity for a molecular target. Machine Learning (ML) can help optimize experimental seed binders, so unlike conventional SELEX experiments, optimal binders do not necessarily exist in the experimental dataset. The ability to construct computationally-derived, customizable DNA libraries for SELEX screening using controlled input pools can dramatically tailor the exploration space by systematically analyzing aptamer candidates containing sequences with known effective binding properties (LEGO).
Aptamer
Aptamers are short single-stranded nucleic acid strands, which can be composed of RNA, DNA, modified nucleic acids, or other synthetic nucleic acid analogs, that fold into a unique configuration, allowing binding specificity to biological targets such as proteins and peptides to be obtained (Mckeague & Derosa, 2012). Aptamers are used to examine binding interactions involving molecular targets in a large number of research areas including drug development, diagnostics, imaging and basic science. In particular, aptamers bind to targets with high specificity and affinity, can be produced and modified more rapidly and at lower cost than antibodies, have a wider range of potential targets than antibodies (Zhou & Rossi,2016), and are less likely to cause immunological side effects than antibodies (Bouchard, hutabaat, & Thompson, 2010). However, aptamers have not been widely successful in clinical or industrial use, mainly due to the difficulty of finding and identifying aptamers with desirable binding properties (Zhou & Rossi, 2016). Furthermore, aptamers found in an isolated environment (i.e., selected against a purified target) exhibit high binding affinity under experimental conditions, but are unable to bind to its target of interest under in vivo conditions (Chen et al, 2016). The present disclosure provides methods of making and using aptamers with very specific binding properties to amino acid residues at the N-terminal end of the peptide chain.
Aptamers with high peptide binding affinity have higher binding and the opportunity to generate a record of binding events than aptamers with lower binding affinity. Specific aptamers are only combined withThe amount of possible peptide binding and thus a record of which molecules are present. Therefore, has high affinity (K)ds<30nM) and specificity (having a 10x binding preference for a desired target as compared to other targets) are desirable for protein sequencing technology herein, however, groups of aptamers having various affinities can be used to retrieve "bits" of information about a protein sequence (i.e., PROSEQ and PROSEQ-VIZ). In end-to-end simulations, the results show only moderate binding affinity (K)ds.gtoreq.30 nM) and selective aptamers enable us to accurately quantify mixtures of known proteins relatively easily. For non-de novo applications, the prose and prose-VIZ techniques can use proteomic maps to resolve any resolution gap in the data. In addition, subsequent cycles can be repeated before the amino acids are removed to allow additional information bits to be obtained prior to cleavage. Finally, if PROSEQ and PROSEQ-VIZ are limited to aptamers that selectively bind to N-terminal dipeptide prefixes, high specificity aptamers are not necessary even for de novo sequencing. The noise from the reduced specificity is compensated by the additional observed binding events generated by the two amino acid identity redundancy scheme, as it allows the observation of two binding events per amino acid (in addition to the first N-terminal amino acid) to confirm its identity (figure 2). Each dipeptide aptamer binding event provides a reading of the identity of the two N-terminal amino acids, while each round of degradation removes only one amino acid, allowing each amino acid except the original N-and C-terminal amino acids (which are read only once) to be exposed to two rounds of aptamer binding. In the case of amino acid identification errors, an inaccurate reading result can be corrected or detected with a certain level of confidence using downstream computational algorithms.
Robust and compact high throughput-ligand phylogeny by exponential enrichment (RCHT-SELEX) and N-terminal ammonia
Amino acid SELEX (NTAA-SELEX)
Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a known High Throughput Screening (HTS) process that has been used to identify aptamers that bind to specific target ligands in vitro selections (Tuerk & Gold, 1990). Conventional SELEX protocols typically involve screening diverse and random oligonucleotide libraries for a single peptide or protein target, which involves flowing aptamers over a bead-bound target and eliminating weakly bound aptamers through multiple rounds of selection in which weakly bound aptamers and non-bound aptamers are washed out (bland & Blank, 2015).
The conventional SELEX method begins with synthesis of about 10 for an oligonucleotide library14-1015Unique sequences, followed by 10-20 iterative rounds: a) incubating a single target with a random pool of candidate aptamer sequences to promote aptamer/target binding; b) separating the target-bound oligonucleotide from unbound sequence; and c) amplification and characterization of the bound aptamers (FIG. 3A). Several variations of the original SELEX method, such as capillary electrophoresis SELEX (CE-SELEX), microfluidic SELEX, and CELL SELEX, have been developed to meet different research requirements.
The purpose of the conventional SELEX method is to improve the binding affinity of aptamers identified by experimental screening. The conventional SELEX method for identifying aptamers has two major problems that hinder large-scale screening:
the conventional SELEX method relies on a repeated screening process, where experimental errors can be compounded in each subsequent round of screening. For example, in each round, aptamers undergo PCR amplification, DNA clean-up and conversion from double stranded to single stranded DNA by separation or enzymatic digestion. Variability in one or more of these processes between runs and/or experiments may facilitate biased selection of aptamer pools engineered to withstand the selection process of a particular experimental setup.
The lack of parallel selection for control and parallel samples using the same input library prevents (a) separate inter-and intra-experimental comparisons, (b) signal-to-noise analysis, and (c) background truth measurements, all of which complicate the application of downstream computational analysis, data cleaning, and predictive modeling, such as ML. The model is attracted to the strongest signal, regardless of source. In the case of biological experiments, there is typically operator error/noise, instrument noise, biological process noise, and noise caused by the manipulation of physical reagents (i.e., contamination), and the combination of all of these different noise elements can often overwhelm the experimental signal. Therefore, models are typically predicted based on very noisy signals unless they are trained beforehand for different noise elements. To this end, several different features (incubations, replicates, spiking controls, false SELEX, etc.) were designed to calculate and remove noise during pre-model data processing, or to train the model for the noise elements in the prediction phase. Furthermore, there are several classes of models that have limited predictive power outside the linear range, and in biology, the process is often non-linear (e.g., PCR). Linear models have the advantage that they are well studied, computationally inexpensive and generally provide reliable predictions. However, linear models often give incorrect predictions when applied to non-linear datasets. On the other hand, non-linear modeling methods may be more computationally expensive and also prone to overfitting (e.g., polynomial modeling of sparse data), but are often needed when linear models cannot accurately describe a data set. Therefore, a number of unit tests are run to calculate the area of linear and non-linear processes to best determine which type of modeling method can be applied.
The conventional SELEX method allows the pool of aptamers to be screened against only one peptide or protein target at a time. That is, each protein or peptide target must be screened in isolation to be able to identify the target. Thus, screening for 1,000 peptide targets using conventional SELEX methods would require 1,000 independent SELEX experiments, each involving multiple rounds of screening.
Furthermore, for example, a 40-mer ssDNA oligonucleotide, 10 can be generated24A possible oligonucleotide, and 1012-15The exploration of the total possible experimental space may lead to difficulties in finding unique aptamers to the target. Currently, there are a number of obstacles to efficiently screening such a large number of candidates:
low hit rate: successful SELEX experiments were required at 1014-1015The original pool of candidate sequences contains aptamers with high affinity for molecular targets. For 1014For each sample, the experimental space for possible DNA sequences was only 8.27X 10-11% is exploredSo that in practice even the most optimized experiments have a high probability of failure.
Excessive time consumption: it usually takes more than 6 months to one year to identify specific aptamer candidates.
Nonspecific: traditional SELEX experiments incubate candidates with one target at a time, which only demonstrates the relative affinity of candidate aptamers and not their specificity in a competitive environment.
Cannot be used for direct comparison: since most experiments start with a new random pool of input oligonucleotides, direct comparisons across experiments are not possible.
Difficult to transform to an environment different from the discovery conditions: discovered aptamers may also be fraught with difficulties with their transformation due to their sensitive structural properties associated with the discovery environment. Because of the structure determining function, aptamers selected in a particular environment may not fold and bind to their target in the same way when the conditions are different from the experimental conditions.
There are two significant omissions in the current SELEX scheme. None of the existing methods is tailored to accommodate large scale computational analysis of multiple targets between each round, with the objective of supplementing the computational aptamer with experimental data. If a workable scenario exists, the empirical data set can be successfully integrated with a machine learning analysis and prediction pipeline, allowing the use of computers to predict aptamers to a target. Computing predicted aptamers allows for the exploration of a wider range of sequences to obtain optimal aptamer targets, and also saves resources and time in aptamer search queries. Furthermore, the SELEX protocol lacks the precision and resolution of finding binders at high resolution for aptamer candidates that bind to a small fraction of a larger target and can be used as N-terminal amino acid binders. The methods developed to address these two omissions are described in detail below. In section a new SELEX method (referred to herein as RCHT-SELEX) is provided that optimizes the selection of high affinity and specific aptamers in a time efficient manner through an inventive combination of existing and new technologies in an effort to address the lack of omission in the development of ML compatibility empirical data sets. Furthermore, another novel SELEX method is provided in section B, which was developed for preferential discovery of N-terminal amino acid specific binders (referred to herein as NTAA-SELEX).
Part A: RCHT-SELEX
Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram showing how a conventional SELEX method (fig. 3A) is modified to produce RCHT-SELEX (fig. 3B). The main differences between the two techniques are highlighted as follows:
Omicron the incubation pools were divided into triplicate runs in many experiments of several targets (including 3 experiments with bead-only controls), and
the aptamers are assayed in different rounds for a target with alternating regions, so that regardless of the proximity of the target, only the constant region that drives the selection process is the region where the user wishes to find its specific binders.
Since several experiments are run in parallel in RCHT-SELEX and the goal is to reduce the experimental variation between each experiment, several additional steps are added to the RCHT-SELEX protocol to support the simultaneous running of >36 experiments. RCHT-SELEX may include techniques such as the following:
thresholding the same amount of DNA as input for subsequent runs to reduce PCR bias ("threshold PCR")
Optimization of PCR conditions for specific candidate pools ("PCR optimization")
Unit tests were performed prior to each digestion to determine the optimal digestion conditions for each sample ("dsDNA digestion").
Other changes to RCHT-SELEX can include:
the same pool of aptamer candidates was assayed in an early round using multiple targets pooled together and de-multiplexed by incubating the aptamer independently for each target in the last round ("bead-based multiplexing-SELEX")
For experiments in which the desired aptamer is one that specifically binds to a smaller portion of the molecule rather than the entire molecule, target with a variable local environmental binding region is used alternately between alternate rounds of RCHT-SELEX ("switch")
Switching primers in the middle of the experiment to identify aptamers as strong binders independent of primer regions ("primer switching").
Negative SELEX:
one technique that can be used to reduce the enrichment of aptamers against unwanted targets is to screen initial pools of aptamer candidates for aptamers that bind to the selection components (e.g., beads, streptavidin) used in SELEX experiments. Aptamers that exhibit binding affinity for the selection component are non-specific for the target and can be removed from the candidate pool such that only aptamers that do not bind to the selection component will be part of the pool of aptamer candidates for analysis against the target. See, for example, fig. 4. Single incubation, double incubation and parallel samples within the experiment:
e.g. from 1015Is selected 10 from the original pool12A pool of DNA aptamers, and amplified by 13 cycles of PCR using unmodified primers, produced approximately 2000 copies of each aptamer. Amplification depends on primer sequences and PCR conditions, and the incubation PCR protocol can be adjusted for each individual library. The object is Such that there are at least 100 copies of most sequences and at least 30 copies of each aptamer sequence present in each experiment. The library is sequenced in the protocol optimization stage to help achieve approximately uniform amplification copy number between sequences.
After amplification, approximately 2000 copies of each aptamer were distributed into 12 samples, resulting in approximately 166 copies of each aptamer in each initial starting library pool. The process of obtaining multiple copies of the same aptamer present before starting selection allows the results of the same initial culture to be directly compared to each other. Computationally, this feature allows for direct experimental replicates to be performed in parallel, and also provides the ability to train the model to go to a particular target and away from another target. Due to the determination 1012Accurate amplification of individual sequences would take many sequencing runs, so a single NextSeq run of 4 billion reads can be performed as an approximation of the library amplification characteristics across the entire pool. A single incubation ends with this step.
For the double incubation, the second incubation was performed by taking about 75 copies of each aptamer from the first incubation and amplifying it through 6 cycles using protected phosphorylated primers, which allowed comparison of results from the same initial incubation between about 300 experiments (about 2000 copies of each aptamer from a single incubation, 75 aptamers selected for 26 possible aspirates; each group of 75 aptamers would create a total double incubation pool for 12 experiments, thus 12 × 26 — 312 experiments; note that there may be some loss during purification, digestion and others, and that the amplification yield is highly related to the nature of the components of the primer and PCR master mix). Amplification of aptamer candidates from each incubation also increases the likelihood that strong and moderate binders will pass through early rounds. See, e.g., fig. 5B, which schematically demonstrates single and double incubation and experimental replicates described herein, and fig. 5A, which schematically demonstrates that single and double incubation and experimental replicates can be used in the RCHT-SELEX method.
Bead-based multiplexing-SELEX
After four rounds of RCHT-SELEX, e.g., using multiple bead-bound targets pooled together, aptamers can be de-multiplexed in round 5 by separately incubating pools of amplified aptamers with beads coupled to only one initial target (see, e.g., FIG. 6). Bead-based multiplexing-SELEX adds a competitive target environment and changes the number of targets that can be explored in the same experiment.
Peptide switching
In designing binders for protein sequencing, 4 goals must be achieved: (1) targeting a specific amino acid, (2) targeting a specific amino acid in the N-terminal position, (3) not binding to the same amino acid in a non-N-terminal position, and (4) binding robustly to the targeted N-terminal amino acid regardless of neighboring amino acids. The rationale behind goal # 4 is that the local biochemical environment (e.g. adjacent amino acids) can affect the binding activity of aptamers, reducing their effective Kd. Since the goal of protein sequencing is to create binders that can be utilized in peptide strings across the entire proteome, the binder design must take into account the effects of the local environment. To achieve goal # 4, constantly changing local environmental changes were introduced during binder selection to develop binders independent of adjacent amino acids. This is done by fixing 1-2 amino acids in the exact position within the peptide chain (usually the N-terminal position) and changing the contiguous or surrounding amino acids in different rounds. Figure 7 shows a method of identifying aptamers that specifically bind to the N-terminal amino acid prefix independent of the composition of the postfix tail of the peptide. This technique, labeled "peptide switching", evolves aptamers in iterative rounds where only the peptide suffix is changed while the required N-terminal amino acid prefix remains the same, removing the negative binders. Peptide switching experiments may also include empty, scrambled or "false" targets to define promiscuous binders to eliminate false positives.
PCR optimization
PCR conditions can be optimized to maximize DNA output while minimizing unwanted products such as concatemers. PCR optimization must be performed for each library. In SELEX experiments, the initial library primers must be replaced frequently between experiments,to prevent PCR contamination during the experiment. For each library, a master mix and PCR optimization unit test was performed after each change of library primers, which included adjusting as many parameters as possible (buffer conditions, cycle number, enzymes, primer concentration, number of protected base pairs, etc.), and then the SELEX library could be used for the experiment. The results were analyzed using sequencing, Qubit, TapeStation, bioanalyzer and digestion unit tests to select the desired optimal settings for each library. For example, amplification can be performed in a 50. mu.L reaction volume consisting of 38.49. mu.L nuclease-free water, 0.30. mu.L of 1mM forward primer complementary to the first 6 nucleotides (referred to as 6XP), 0.30. mu.L of 1mM phosphorylated reverse primer (referred to as RP04), 0.50. mu.L
digestion of dsDNA
Lambda exonuclease is a highly active exodeoxyribonuclease that preferentially digests the 5-phosphorylated strand of dsDNA and has significantly lower activity on ssDNA and non-phosphorylated DNA (Little,1967) (Mitsis & kwangh, 1999). Lambda exonuclease can be used to efficiently digest PCR-amplified dsDNA into ssDNA in three steps: a) unit tests to obtain optimal digestion conditions, b) dividing the pre-digested library into triplicates, and c) bioanalyzer Quality Control (QC) assays to test the amount of ssDNA compared to dsDNA. Single-stranded PCR products can be generated as follows: PCR is first performed using two different primers (e.g., a 3 '-phosphorothioate-protected primer complementary to the unwanted reverse strand and a 5' -phosphorylated primer complementary to the desired forward strand), followed by PCR amplification, where the phosphorylated strand of the PCR product can then be removed by digestion with lambda exonuclease. The RNA kit of the bioanalyzer system may be reused to quantify ssDNA because the dye in the RNA kit also binds ssDNA. Although the measurement output was not calibrated against ssDNA, inferences can be made from bands and peaks. See, for example, fig. 8. The RNA kit of the bioanalyzer system may be modified to quantify the amount of ssDNA relative to dsDNA in the sample because the dye in the RNA kit binds to both ssDNA and dsDNA. When samples containing both ssDNA and dsDNA are processed by capillary electrophoresis on a bioanalyzer, unique non-overlapping peaks are produced for ssDNA and dsDNA, with the relative area under each curve depicting the percentage of the sample attributable to ssDNA and dsDNA. The purpose of analysis in the digestion assay using the RNA bioanalyzer kit was to confirm that all dsDNA had been converted to ssDNA without over-digestion of the ssDNA library. Although the measurement output was not calibrated against ssDNA, inferences can be made from the bands and peaks regarding the nature of the DNA mixture.
During the experiment, the data indicate that the quality and quantity of PCR output affects the ability to predict digestion behavior of lambda exonuclease. Libraries containing additional concatemer products are digested very slowly or very rapidly, depending on the fraction of protected or phosphorylated base pairs present in the concatemer sequence. Thus, unit tests may be performed when evaluating new libraries to prevent complete digestion of the sample. Before digestion of all PCR products, unit tests can be performed to determine the optimal reaction time for efficient ssDNA production for each sample. Lambda exonuclease digestion is performed by incubating a small sample of the purified PCR product at 37 ℃ for, e.g., 2, 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes, at 75 ℃ for 10 minutes, and after holding at 4 ℃. An RNA bioanalyzer may be run on each sample to evaluate digestion and determine optimal digestion conditions to apply to the remaining PCR product samples.
Lambda exonuclease digestion of the entire sample can be performed as follows: incubation at 37 ℃ for an optimal time determined by time course analysis, then the enzyme was heat inactivated at 75 ℃ for 10min and maintained at 4 ℃.
A representative sample of the final lambda exonuclease digestion mixture can be run on another RNA bioanalyzer chip to ensure that the PCR products are sufficiently digested to ssDNA prior to the next round of RCHT-SELEX (fig. 9). If the digestion is incomplete, more lambda nuclease and ATP can be incorporated.
Additional controls: bead controls, inclusions and pseudo-SELEX
The inclusion oligonucleotide: small additions of known aptamer mimetics can be added as controls throughout the various steps of RCHT-SELEX to detect experimental errors. For example, a mixture of 9 oligonucleotides (i.e., a "9-oligonucleotide mixture") with known sequences having 3 representative sequences and 3 different GC content levels (e.g., 40%, 50%, 60%) can be added prior to PCR to provide information about sample variability associated with PCR differences. See, e.g., fig. 10A. Alternatively or additionally, known sequences (e.g., positional inclusions) can be added to each well to provide information about spatial position on, for example, a 96-well plate. See, e.g., fig. 10B.
Full bead control: the full bead control included parallel and sequential controls. See, e.g., fig. 10B. For parallel experiments, triplicate full bead controls (e.g., a sample of beads unconjugated with peptide) can be run with the experiment to determine the number of aptamers from the incubation pool that bind only to the beads. In addition, these controls can be used to determine the level of inter-well contamination or noise from each experiment. Sequential bead controls may be used after each round of RCHT-SELEX, where aptamers bound to peptide-coupled beads are incubated with beads that are not coupled to peptides. Aptamers bound to empty beads can be sequenced, if desired, to identify common sequences in aptamers bound to empty beads.
False SELEX: before each round of RCHT-SELEX, a small sample of the original input can be removed and kept at room temperature as a control to determine the effect of PCR bias, since no target is present. See, e.g., fig. 10C.
Threshold PCR
Bound aptamers from bead-based RCHT-SELEX assays can be amplified directly on magnetic beads. Thus, the aptamer need not be denatured from the bead prior to running the PCR, limiting the number of handling, manipulation, and potential library loss steps in the sensitive phase of the SELEX assay (Hoon, Zhou, Janda, Brenner, & Scolnick, 2011). However, PCR reactions can reach a saturation point where the reagents become limited or the concentration becomes too high for uniform replication to proceed. Since the concentration of the bound aptamer prior to PCR amplification is unknown and can only be estimated, it is not possible to determine exactly how many amplification cycles are required before saturation of amplification occurs. In addition, PCR amplification may be affected by some magnetic beads coated with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), where if the concentration of BSA is too high, the total product produced by PCR is reduced. Furthermore, internal experiments confirm that there is a heterogeneous distribution of aptamers between beads, such that if the aptamer library on beads is physically resolved into separate solutions prior to amplification, different end-point amounts and variances of unwanted PCR products will be observed between the resolvers, leading to unknown introduced inter-sample variances. To (a) address the complexity of introducing non-quantifiable sample-to-sample bias, (b) amplify each library to the same concentration endpoint and (c) alleviate the problems caused by PCR saturation and the presence of BSA, PCR amplification is performed in two stages: (1) PCR on beads and (2) threshold PCR. If problems occur with digestion, PCR amplification in two stages provides the benefit of library redundancy.
When running many experiments in parallel from the same incubation pool, the PCR reaction can produce a mixture of aptamers with different end-point concentrations (e.g., low, medium, and high) depending on the amount of DNA pulled down in each experiment (fig. 11). To make a computational comparison between many experiments, and to balance the experimental requirements of a minimum amount of material that can be automated (e.g., minimum transfer volume for magnetic beads), the amount of input library is normalized prior to the second amplification step. Differences in the amount of input DNA template can affect the effect of PCR bias. The DNA concentration of each library can be measured after PCR on the beads, and the PCR post-library with the lowest DNA concentration or standard amount can be used as the threshold amount of standard. The remaining samples were then adjusted to the threshold amount and subjected to subsequent rounds of PCR before generating inputs for subsequent rounds of RCHT-SELEX. See, e.g., fig. 11A. Numerous control experiments demonstrated that the shape of the sequence distribution did not change using this threshold PCR method (fig. 11B and 11C).
Primer switching
The construct of aptamer candidates can include a) random sequences of DNA that participate in or facilitate binding to the target, and b) one or more regions to which DNA primers can hybridize so that the aptamer sequences can be PCR amplified. The primer region may contribute to the structure of the aptamer and the binding affinity to the target molecule. The primer regions may be alternated with different primer sequences or removed completely and the aptamers may be assayed again to isolate aptamers with high affinity for the target molecule independent of the primer regions. See, for example, fig. 12.
Sequencing aptamer pools after each round
Representative extracts of dsDNA from each selected round were sequenced prior to threshold PCR, and the enrichment of the rounds with the sequence round was analyzed. Unit tests sequenced before and after threshold PCR confirmed that the distribution of sequences did not change during threshold PCR. Since the sequence distribution does not change and a direct point of comparison at each stage of SELEX is ideal for computational analysis, the stages before the threshold PCR are chosen to: (1) reduces the extra steps at the end of the SELEX experiment and (2) allows the storage of DNA samples at higher concentrations and reduced volumes without additional manipulations (i.e., SpeedVac, etc.).
As discussed herein, the RCHT-SELEX method incorporates several new improvements: (1) screening up to 300 different targets simultaneously, (2) maintaining high DNA concentrations and reduced PCR bias between selection rounds, (3) additional features for advanced post hoc computational analysis including comparisons between each possible experiment performed no matter what day, and (4) improving binding specificity to small molecule targets such as small peptide or amino acid targets. These capabilities can accelerate the large-scale identification of aptamers to biological targets, with potential uses in diagnostics, therapeutics, and basic science research. Novel features of the RCHT-SELEX method described herein include, but are not limited to:
Single or double incubations allow direct comparison of results between targets, experiments and/or replicates from the same initial incubation;
analysis of the intra-experimental replicates enhanced positive signals and saved time and money for testing unwanted aptamer candidates;
threshold PCR yields robust aptamer library input for multiple parallel experiments with minimized PCR bias, provides an early recovery point if there are experimental problems associated with converting post-PCR dsDNA libraries to ssDNA libraries, and reduces library loss by concatemers;
switching allows detection of aptamers specific for a desired sequence (e.g., a small fragment of a larger molecule) at a specific location of the target;
bead-based multiplexing of SELEX increased the target within the same experiment and revealed the binding ability of aptamers in a competitive environment;
the inclusion concentration can be used to detect experimental error and PCR bias;
the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) performed at each round in combination with the sensitivity analysis can: (a) locating the binder earlier, and (b) generating input data for a Machine Learning (ML) model. The ML model can predict high specificity new aptamers with fewer SELEX rounds and explore a larger DNA input space than is possible experimentally. The use of ML in aptamer prediction can improve the efficacy of the SELEX method described herein while saving valuable research expenditures and time.
The RCHT-SELEX methods described herein reduce labor and reagent costs, while more importantly improving data quality, downstream analysis, and broadening screening capabilities. Furthermore, the multiplexing methods described herein can produce aptamers that specifically bind to targets in an environment with multiple available targets (e.g., cell surfaces, human blood), thus greatly increasing the discovery of application pipelines for aptamers.
The RCHT-SELEX method described herein can be used to examine DNA: substances other than peptide interactions bind. For example, binding between a large number of biological targets can be examined, as long as both targets comprise oligonucleotides that can be linked to each other. For example, similar techniques can be used to screen for RNA aptamers that bind to small molecule targets or protein complexes.
In addition, many procedural modifications may be made to adapt the method to different applications. For example, but not limited to, other "import" nucleic acids, such as RNA or modified nucleobases, can be screened for binding affinity to a molecular target of interest, or for aptamers that bind to targets other than proteins or peptides (e.g., small molecules, intact proteins, other nucleic acids, particular cell lines). Another example of a modification is to replace lambda exonuclease dsDNA digestion with asymmetric PCR to generate ssDNA that is input into the SELEX of subsequent rounds.
The RCHT-SELEX methods described herein can be used to screen for aptamers that selectively bind to a particular peptide target in a competitive, diverse peptide environment. Like selective antibodies, the resulting aptamers can be used alone or in combination with two or more aptamers to produce complexes that exhibit a multi-target binding profile. For example, two aptamers, each with high selectivity for a different target, can be used sequentially, in tandem, or linked together to produce a single construct that binds to two separate targets. Alternatively, two aptamers with the same primary target but different off-target binding profiles can be conjugated together to increase selectivity of binding to their common target by avidity while reducing off-target effects.
In addition to being used to measure binding between aptamers and targets, the RCHT-SELEX method described herein can also be used to measure binding between different mixtures of any of the previously described molecular classes (e.g., by replacing aptamers with molecules bearing DNA barcodes and having 3' C-protruding arms), enabling two-way multiplexed competitive measurements of any one of a combination of molecular classes including, but not limited to, peptide-to-protein, protein-protein, antibody-protein, small molecule-protein, peptide-cell surface markers, antibody-cell surface markers, and the like. In certain embodiments, two binding molecules (e.g., binder and target) can be drawn from a mixture of molecules from any of the above categories, allowing measurement of cross-binding in complex competitive environments.
And part B: NTAA-SELEX
We developed a new SELEX method through the inventive combination of existing and new technologies to optimize the selection of high affinity and specific aptamers in a time efficient manner:
1) negative selection
One common technique to reduce the enrichment of aptamers to unwanted targets (e.g., magnetic beads, PEG, reagents in binding buffers (e.g., BSA, etc.)) is to screen the initial pool of aptamer candidates for aptamers bound to the selection component used in the SELEX assay, which in our case is SELEX buffer (1 XPBS, 0.025% Tween-20, 0.1mg/mL BSA, 1mM MgCl, etc.)2) The streptavidin beads of (1). Aptamers that exhibit binding affinity for the selection component are non-specific for the target and are removed from the pool of candidates such that only aptamers that do not bind the selection component become part of the pool of aptamer candidates for assay against the target. The library may be subjected to a single or multiple negative selection rounds prior to starting the SELEX round. In selecting target library sizes (e.g., 10)14Individual molecules), a larger library needs to be used for negative selection to ensure that the supernatant contains enough molecules for downstream SELEX experiments.
2) Peptide backbone switching
During each parallel selection, peptide switching can be performed for each parallel sample of the target of interest. In particular, "switch" targets can be developed with different backbone sequences, e.g., the amino acid sequence of the peptide target differs except for, e.g., the two amino acids at the N-terminus. By switching between at least two different backbones in a round of rotation, the chance of enriching for aptamers that bind to any substance that is not the dipeptide of interest is reduced.
3) Screening of multiple parallel targets
In this technique, parallel selection of DNA aptamers can be used for closely related as well as unrelated targets. The following criteria can be used between targets: 1) the counts of each aptamer in each round determined by NGS sequencing, 2) enrichment of each aptamer round for the round, and 3) enrichment from the first round of sequencing to the last round of sequencing. By comparing these indices between different target selections, one can determine what the binding signal will look like for "true binders" that bind to known targets that have previously been shown to be "aptogenic" and what the binding signal will look like for "non-specific binders" that bind non-specifically to the surface of the immobilized target (e.g., beads). These indices between parallel target screens allow tracking of aptamer specificity and prevent unknown contaminating effects.
4) Parallel sample target screening
In this technique, parallel selection of DNA aptamers can be used for the same target. Unique random DNA libraries can be used to perform SELEX 2 or 3 times on the same target simultaneously. This allows the experimenter to build confidence in the indicators for each of the aptamers described above, especially if they are of the same order of magnitude. Furthermore, it allows the experimenter to observe whether outliers are present in the pool of aptamers. For example, if one random library has a significantly lower enrichment than another random library when looking for a final aptamer candidate, the experimenter may choose to work with only the lead aptamer candidate from the library that shows the higher enrichment.
5) anti-SELEX
anti-SELEX is a technique similar to negative selection, except that a library of aptamers is incubated with molecules on beads that are similar to the desired target, the beads are pulled down with a magnet, and the resulting supernatant contains a library of aptamers that do not bind to the similar target. The supernatant can then be used in downstream experiments to help enrich for N-terminal complexes. anti-SELEX can be performed in parallel or sequentially with negative selection at the start of the experiment and can be run in a single or multiple cycles. anti-SELEX can be run between conventional SELEX rounds or after the last round of SELEX to enhance the signal of the N-terminal aptamer conjugate in the reservoir.
Many types of molecules can be used during desex. anti-SELEX can be used on targets that are similar in nature but with slight modifications (e.g., to distinguish post-translationally modified N-terminal amino acids from unmodified N-terminal amino acids), on peptide backbones (or suffixes) used during peptide switching, or on large pools of targets representing proteomes to ensure specific N-terminal aptamer conjugates to unique targets of interest.
If multiple backbones are used in the peptide switching experiments, multiple peptide suffixes can be used sequentially during the anti-SELEX experiments. For example, if two different backbones are used for peptide switching, parallel anti-SELEX can be run on a mixture of targets between SELEX rounds, where the "target" pool for anti-SELEX consists of one half of one backbone bound to a bead and one half of the other backbone bound to a bead. Other embodiments may vary the stringency and/or introduce other combinations of molecules such as random peptide libraries, various different backbone designs, backbones with other N-terminal dipeptide suffixes.
6) PCR and digestion techniques
PCR optimization, threshold PCR and dsDNA digestion techniques can be used for NTAA-SELEX and are described in section a: RCHT-SELEX.
Novel features of the NTAA-SELEX method described herein include, but are not limited to:
1) this protocol provides a way to discover aptamer binders to the N-terminal amino acid, which can revolutionize the approach to enable high resolution identification of protein sequences and high throughput protein sequencing analysis. The stability and flexibility of nucleic acids make aptamers a versatile tool for a variety of methods for protein sequencing and quantification techniques, including imaging and the DNA barcode methods described herein;
2) multiple parallel SELEX experiments can allow for scale-up aptamer discovery and removal of aptamers that are non-specific binders to multiple peptide targets;
3) sequencing of the anti-SELEX experiment can facilitate the discovery of N-terminal binders and removal of aptamer binders to other regions along the target;
4) control targets can be run in each SELEX experiment to allow for assessment of inter-experiment comparisons;
5) peptide backbone switching allows detection of aptamers specific for the N-terminal amino acid of larger peptides or, if desired, generation of aptamers directed to amino acid sequences or modified amino acids within a peptide string.
Protein or peptide sequencing (PROSEQ)
The progseq method described herein uses barcoded amino acid-specific aptamers to convert protein sequences into DNA signals that are readable on the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform. Mass Spectrometry (MS) is one of the tools commonly used in the identification and quantification of proteins, however, said techniques lack the ability to cover a wide dynamic range required for the detection of low-expressed proteins in complex samples (Schiess, Wollscheid, &Aebersold, 2008). Other existing quantitative assays for specific proteins include antibody or aptamer binding assays, in which a detectable antibody, aptamer, or other small molecule binding agent binds specifically to a known protein, and thus, is not able to de novo sequence or measure proteins for which no specific binding agent has been found. The method for sequencing pro seq proteins described herein can be used for small sample inputs (including single cells or small volumes of blood) to identify entire proteomes, including under-expressed proteins and single amino acid mutations, to better understand diseases caused by abnormal or denatured proteins. Furthermore, the PROSEQ method described herein enables parallel sequencing of heterogeneous samples or multiple samples, as proteins can be barcoded with unique DNA tags, which can be incorporated into DNA sequences encoding protein sequence information. Furthermore, the methods described herein enable significantly deeper sequencing than existing methods, such as mass spectrometry, because the DNA sequence is derived from a single peptide, amplified, and read from the sequencer (DR 100-10)9) That do not suffer from the same dynamic range limitations (DR) as mass spectrometry>105)(Yates,Ruse,&Nakorchevsky, 2009). In addition, the sample can be processed to remove reads associated with high abundance proteins in the sample by: 1) removing the high abundance proteins in the raw input pool into prosern, or 2) isolating DNA barcodes associated with the high abundance proteins to increase NGS read counts of DNA sequences associated with low abundance proteins.
The prosseq methods described herein can be used in a clinical setting to quantify protein expression levels or to identify new protein fusions or disease-associated mutations from individual patient samples to aid in patient diagnosis and disease onset. Furthermore, the methods described herein can be widely used in the research fields of molecular and cell biology and protein engineering, for example: sequencing proteins, finding new biomarkers, analyzing entire proteomes or macroproteins, assessing mechanisms related to protein abundance, and the like.
1) Aptamers provide the ability to perform de novo sequencing.
The methods described herein rely on libraries of aptamers specific for unique combinations of one or two N-terminal amino acids, where each residue or residue pair has at least one or more possible aptamer binders. ssDNA aptamers are designed to contain a 5' phosphate for ligation, a unique DNA barcode (which indicates the identity of the particular aptamer and the corresponding cycle number), a spacer/consensus for subsequent barcode ligation (e.g., a ligation consensus sequence), a restriction enzyme site with a spacer, and an amino acid recognition sequence (e.g., a single-stranded DNA aptamer sequence). See, for example, fig. 13. These aptamers can be incubated with peptide targets with or without complementary DNA strands covering some or all of the barcode sequences, the joining consensus sequences, and the restriction enzyme sites with spacers. In case these areas are uncovered, the DNA complementary to the ligation and restriction sites can be hybridized after incubation to facilitate ligation and restriction, respectively.
Aptamers described herein can be used to sequence proteins or peptides in any of the following ways:
(A) peptide fragments from proteins processed in solution or on solid substrates
Proteins can be obtained from a sample (e.g., a blood sample, cell lysate, or single cells), denatured, coupled to oligonucleotides, and digested into peptide fragments. It will be appreciated that there are a variety of methods available to obtain and digest proteins and to couple peptide fragments to oligonucleotides prior to a sequencing step. One such strategy involves denaturing the protein using mild surfactants and reducing and alkylating the denatured protein to protect the cysteine side chains. For example, the amino group on the side chain of a lysine amino acid is reacted with an aldehyde-modified oligonucleotide by a reductive amination reaction using sodium cyanoborohydride. The protein can be digested with Lys-C, which cleaves the protein on the C-terminal side of lysine. By using this method, each digested peptide has a lysine residue attached to the tail of the oligonucleotide. Reductive amination reactions can also occur between the side chain of lysine and an alkyne bearing an aldehyde functional group, which is prepared for click chemistry reactions with azide-modified DNA oligonucleotides. In another approach, the side chains of the protein may be protected, modified with oligonucleotides or click chemistry linkers, and then cleaved into peptide fragments, for example using conventional trypsin methods that cleave at lysine and arginine and/or other fragmenting enzymes that cleave at random amino acid sites (fig. 13, step 2), or they may be processed in solution (see modifications below). At this point, the DNA-coupled protein fragments may be ligated to DNA oligonucleotides on the surface of the sequencing substrate where they will remain ligated throughout the DNA barcode encoding process and removed prior to DNA sequencing.
Aptamers can be taken directly from the SELEX experiment and applied to the BCS assay by generation of a BCS compatible aptamer pool in which one of the SELEX primer regions is converted to a BCS handle. The aptamer region of the binder is sequenced and treated as a "barcode" of the binder. To generate a BCS-compatible aptamer pool, prior to incubating the peptide target with the aptamer, the single-stranded aptamer pool was incubated with a bridge oligonucleotide partially complementary to the aptamer tail and partially complementary to a linker region (single-stranded overhang shown in fig. 14) on a barcode sequence on a barcode substrate (BF) to (a) promote binding of the aptamer tail to the barcode sequence, and (b) block ssDNA regions of aptamers not involved in target binding from affecting proper aptamer folding. A DNA barcoded library of BCS-compatible aptamers hybridized to the bridge can be flowed over the peptides and incubated, allowing the appropriate aptamers to bind specifically to the N-terminal amino acid residues (fig. 13, step 3).
After aptamer binding, unbound aptamer is washed away and the tail of the bound aptamer can be ligated to a second glass-immobilized DNA oligonucleotide that is co-localized with the peptide (fig. 13, step 4). The restriction enzyme site contained at the distal end of the aptamer barcode can be used to cleave the remainder of the aptamer, leaving the DNA barcode attached to the adjacent oligonucleotide (fig. 13, step 5). The N-terminal amino acid can then be removed from the immobilized peptide using Edman degradation and/or aminopeptidase. In Edman degradation, once the new N-terminal amino acid is exposed, another pool of aptamers with unique DNA barcodes indicating the target recognition sequence and cycle number can be introduced and another cycle of DNA barcode ligation can be performed. After repeating this series of steps multiple times, strands of DNA barcodes can be established, which indicate the aptamer binding order of the peptides, which can be read using conventional NGS techniques. Using this information, the amino acid sequence of the bound peptide can be obtained. In the case of aminopeptidases, more than one N-terminal amino acid can be cleaved at a time in a less controllable manner, which, although not conducive to de novo sequencing, may reveal information for use in non de novo sequencing methods.
(B) Full-length proteins processed in solution
For the full-length protein, the protocol is similar to that described above, but there are some important differences. The following steps may be performed: (a) lysing the cells (if the protein is obtained from the cells), isolating or purifying, denaturing and protecting the protein, (b) protecting the reactive side chains of the amino acid residues (e.g., sulfhydryl, carboxyl and amine groups), (C) coupling a ssDNA oligonucleotide to the C-terminus of the protein, wherein the ssDNA oligonucleotide contains a primer region, a unique barcode and an initial linker region, (d) deprotecting all side chain protecting groups, (e) incubating the protein with a pool of aptamers, wherein the aptamers may contain a tail comprising a 5' phosphate for ligation, a unique DNA barcode (which provides information on the aptamer binding sequence plus the sequencing round), a spacer/consensus region for subsequent barcode ligation (e.g., a ligation consensus sequence), a restriction enzyme site with a spacer, and an N-terminal amino acid recognition sequence (e.g., a single-stranded DNA aptamer sequence), (f) ligating the bound aptamer to the DNA tail of the protein, (g) pulling down the protein/aptamer complex using a biotinylated reagent complementary to the primer region of the protein/DNA conjugate molecule, (h) washing away the pool of unbound aptamer, (i) cutting away the binding region of the aptamer, leaving its DNA barcode attached to the DNA tail of the protein, (j) cleaving off the N-terminal amino acid, (k) denaturing the protein from its biotinylated oligonucleotide, (l) collecting the supernatant of the DNA-barcoded protein, (m) repeating steps (c) - (l) until the entire protein has been converted to a DNA strand, then performing PCR amplification and sequencing the DNA barcode. Step (g) may also be performed [ binding, pulldown, washing, ligation ] (step f) before the binding aptamer is ligated to the DNA tail of the protein if the binding agent remains bound and breaks during pulldown of the protein-aptamer complex at this point. It will also be appreciated that a biotinylated reagent complementary to the primer region of the protein/DNA conjugate molecule may be added during the aptamer incubation (step e) to prevent the aptamer from binding to the DNA region of the peptide target rather than the N-terminal prefix.
The barcode, including the overhang, can be about 8 to about 26 nucleotides (nt) in length (e.g., about 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 26nt in length). NGS technology is currently optimized for short read sequences or up to about 300-600 cycles. For many proteins, long sequencing experiments can be performed (e.g., by PacBio), or DNA strands can be fragmented into smaller regions and realigned after sequencing.
(C) Protein complex processing in solution and subsequent solid substrate step
For protein complexes, proteins within the protein complex may be tagged with DNA oligonucleotides via amino acid side chains, and proximal side chains may be ligated together, followed by denaturation of the protein, followed by the protocol outlined above (e.g., under section (B)) in the absence of fragmentation. The protocol can be optimized such that only immediately adjacent proteins (e.g., bound complexes) carry oligonucleotide tags that can be ligated to each other. The protein complex may be pulled down and attached to a solid substrate, which may have a specifically placed DNA linker so that the protein complex may be processed locally. The DNA linkers on the chip may have unique DNA start barcodes that, when isolated and sequenced, may reveal information about the identity of the adjacent sequenced peptide fragments and thus the protein complex.
The PROSEQ method described herein does not rely on prior knowledge of the protein or protein complex (as required when using, for example, mass spectrometry) and provides a route for de novo sequencing. Once the protein or peptide molecules are converted to DNA molecules, the sequences can be amplified, enhanced and modified using conventional tools such as PCR amplification, biotin pulldown and/or digestion to allow for pooling of many samples or to determine low expressing molecules in a sample. Many non-de novo applications using PROSEQ can also obtain many new biological information, such as high resolution protein quantification, which is not currently possible using conventional protein sequencing techniques.
Figure 15A is another schematic diagram showing an example of an aptamer-based peptide sequencing method described herein, in which the C-terminal end of a peptide is coupled to an amine-modified oligonucleotide that is bound to a substrate, or the peptide is covalently bound to an oligonucleotide using other strategies such as click chemistry or SMCC linker (4- (N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester) (1), the bound peptide is incubated with a library of DNA-barcoded aptamers (2), the aptamer bound to the peptide is linked to a second oligonucleotide immobilized on a solid substrate (3), and the aptamer is cleaved, leaving the DNA barcode attached to the second oligonucleotide (4). Figure 15B is a schematic diagram showing representative aptamers to different amino acids and corresponding aptamer barcodes whose sequences identify the specific amino acid at that position.
2) The protein sequencing methods described herein overcome the processivity limitations of Edman degradation
The methods described herein overcome the processability limitations of Edman degradation. For example, Liquid Chromatography (LC) is commonly used to identify the terminal amino acids after cleavage by Edman degradation. The hypothetical disadvantage in standard Edman degradation is that physically, there is a maximum number of cycles (-10 cycles) for accurate degradation and detection of the N-terminal amino acid. Since the method of the present invention does not measure the amino acid cleaved, the limitation of detection of the cleaved amino acid is not an obstacle. Furthermore, any processing limitations in the PROSEQ method described herein can be overcome by alternating between using Edman degradation and aminopeptidase (e.g., trypsin and pepsin) cleavage of the terminal amino acids. After, for example, about 30 cycles, the methods described herein can cleave the peptide at a particular amino acid site using an exopeptidase, which allows sequencing to begin again from a new region of the peptide.
3) The protein sequencing methods described herein allow sequencing of heterogeneous protein pools
One of the important features of the PROSEQ method described herein is the ability to sequence a large pool of proteins in which one or more proteins of interest (e.g., target proteins) are expressed at low or very low levels (e.g., proteins present in parts per billion; perhaps even lower when using the "Sup-Diff" method described herein). This is particularly useful in processing samples such as plasma that (1) is readily available from a patient, (b) allows longitudinal studies, and (c) can provide information for difficult to study diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases due to the presence of biomarkers in the blood stream. In plasma, 13 proteins plus albumin make up 96% of the protein sample, and some of the most interesting molecules such as tissue leakage products and cytokines make up the last 4% of the sample, and were found to be well below the instrumental detection resolution limit of MS (Schiess, Wollscheid, & Aebersold, 2008). Therefore, identification of biomarkers or new proteins in plasma samples using MS can be extremely difficult. Unlike HPLC and MS, the identification of amino acids on the basis of aptamer binding is not limited by the detection limit of high concentrations of individual proteins in the sample. Since the end product of actual sequencing is DNA rather than protein, there are well-developed tools for amplifying, annealing and pulling down specific DNA populations of interest. After DNA barcode strand formation, the DNA sequencer platform can clonally amplify the sequence (e.g., using bridge amplification). Thousands of clusters of each DNA sequence produce a readable signal that is greater than its initial input signal from an under-expressed protein, bypassing single molecule technology. This ability to sequence large heterogeneous pools allows for the sequencing of thousands of antigens across the entire proteome of an organism.
For samples with a large dynamic range, a method called "sup-diff" may be used to remove the high expressing protein DNA barcode construct, resulting in an increased proportion of low expressing peptide or protein clusters of DNA barcode constructs remaining in the pool of oligonucleotides to be sequenced. For example, there are two methods for increasing the proportion of desired or underexpressed peptide: a priori and a non-a priori methods. The overall strategy was to develop a ssDNA decoy pool containing biotinylated RNA sequences complementary to certain sequences in the initial diversified pool of ssDNA (Diatchenko et al, 1996) (Gnirke et al, 2009). The RNA bait pool was used to capture ssDNA targets by in-solution hybridization and subsequent pull-down on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads.
The main difference between the a priori and non a priori methods is that the a priori method only pulls out known sequences, not the a priori method pulls out high abundance sequences in pools whose distribution and composition are unknown. In the a priori approach, a diverse pool of ssDNA is first sequenced, and then the user can design a bait specific to the sequence that the user wants to pull from the pool, which can include very high concentrations of sequences that can be contaminants. A priori methods enrich for sequences that are not pulled down by the designed bait, thus reducing NGS sequencing reads for targets that are initially desired to be pulled from the pool. In a non-a priori approach, an initial diversified pool of ssDNA is used directly to generate a pool of RNA decoy. The RNA decoy pool can have the same fraction distribution as the original target pool or a distribution that is slightly biased towards the original high abundance sequence. Given that higher abundance target sequences are more likely to find their RNA decoy partners under conditions of optimized time, temperature and overall decoy to target ratio, high concentration sequences are more likely to be pulled out when hybridizing the RNA decoy to an initial variegated pool of ssDNA. See, for example, fig. 16.
4) The protein sequencing methods described herein allow for sequencing of DNA barcodes using a variety of DNA sequencing techniques
The methods described herein for sequencing proteins can be performed in conjunction with any existing DNA sequencing technology. Using a custom flow cell and automated fluidic system with DNA printed on glass in a specified manner, barcodes can be created as described in the previous section without reprogramming or changing the use of existing DNA sequencing platforms. These DNA barcodes representing the protein/peptide sequence can then be sequenced on any existing DNA sequencing platform or technique.
5) The protein sequencing methods described herein include strategies to ensure robust protein and DNA sequencing capabilities, although Edman degradation requires harsh chemistry
The ProSeq method described herein uses barcoded amino acid-specific aptamers to convert protein sequences into DNA signals that are readable on the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform. The methods described herein overcome the distortion of protein sequencing platform components caused by Edman degradation that prevents clustering of DNA barcode constructs and thus prevents sequencing directly on the same chip. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and the pH fluctuations that occur during Edman degradation cause two major problems: (1) loss of DNA cluster generation through removal or modification of the P5 and P7 DNA linkers on the chip, (2) modification of the constructed DNA barcodes, resulting in loss of sequence information and amplification capability.
(A) Off-chip sequencing of DNA barcodes
After the DNA barcode construct containing the strands of the DNA barcode indicating the aptamer binding order of the peptide is established, the construct is amplified on the chip or excised from the chip and amplified in solution. Amplification methods used include, but are not limited to, PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, strand displacement amplification, and multiplex displacement amplification. In addition, the original DNA barcode construct can be transcribed on a chip into a large number of RNA constructs, which can then be converted into a cDNA library consisting of many copies of the original DNA barcode. The amplification product, i.e., a copy of the original DNA barcode construct, can be removed from the microfluidic chamber and sequenced using standard DNA sequencing methods including, but not limited to Sanger sequencing, NGS, ion semiconductor sequencing, SOLiD technology, cPAS, and the like. The number of reads was normalized to the number of PCR cycles used to estimate the amount of each protein or peptide sequenced from the initial sample.
(B) XNA or modified DNA/RNA linkers, substrates and barcodes
The method described herein is a single chip strategy to overcome the degradation of DNA components on the BCS platform by using XNA or modified DNA/RNA with the following properties: (a) resistance to transformation by Edman degradation or highly acidic conditions, (b) can be made as a chimera with conventional DNA nucleotides, and (c) is compatible with existing polymerases that can amplify these non-native nucleic acids or convert modified sequences into conventional DNA bp. Such modified nucleic acids may include modifications to the 2' carbon of the ribose or modifications to the purine base itself that enhance its hydrolytic stability (Watt et al, 2009). Examples include, but are not limited to, 2' -O-methylated RNA, 2' -fluorodeoxyadenosine, 7-deaza-2 ' -deoxyadenosine, and 7-deaza-8-aza-deoxyguanosine.
Addition of XNA or modified DNA/RNA linker to degraded P7: the methods herein can utilize degraded P7 linkers available on the chip as the basis for customizing XNA or modified DNA/RNA linkers. After subjecting the P7 and P5 linkers to acidic conditions, the P5 linker is at least partially removed and the P7 is degraded. Two methods of adding new linkers for ligation and barcode generation handles after barcode cluster generation are:
method 1: several rounds of Edman degradation can be performed to remove P5 and depurinate P7, and the XNA or modified DNA/RNA linker can be ligated to the remaining region of P7. One method of XNA linker ligation is to ligate an XNA or modified DNA/RNA linker with a phosphorylated 5 'terminus to the 3' terminus of P7. If the modified nucleic acid analog reduces ligase efficiency, the linker sequence may be a chimeric XNA or a modified DNA/RNA molecule having one or more standard cytosine or thymine nucleotides at its 5' terminus.
Method 2: several rounds of Edman degradation were performed to remove P5 and depurinate P7, and attach XNA or modified DNA/RNA linker to the remaining region of P7 using click chemistry. Another strategy to add an XNA linker is to attach an XNA or modified DNA/RNA linker to P7 by attaching an oligonucleotide linker with a reactive group at the 3 'end on the 3' end of P7. The chemical reaction may attach a functional XNA or modified DNA/RNA linker, optionally containing a cleavage site and having a corresponding reactive group at its 5' end attached to the oligonucleotide linker, to P7. Examples of paired reactive groups include, but are not limited to, NHS esters with amines (azide reaction), azides with alkynes (triazole reaction), maleimides with thiols (thioether reaction), and tetrazines with alkenes. P7 and the linker may be blocked from unwanted annealing with oligonucleotides partially complementary to both the P7 and the extender oligonucleotide during aptamer incubation.
XNA or modified DNA/RNA substrates and barcodes: the substrate fragment, binding region of the aptamer, BCS cassette component, aptamer barcode region, or a combination thereof of the methods herein can comprise XNA or modified DNA/RNA.
Once the P5 linker is no longer detected, the Illumina sequencing protocol ends the sequencing run, so in embodiments where P5 is removed from the sequencing platform, additional steps may be required to prevent premature sequencing stops. These steps may include, alone or in combination:
addition of multiple P5 to the chip by enzymatic or chemical methods after the last round of Edman degradation
Adapt sequencing instrument protocol code to continue sequencing runs in the absence of P5
Attaching a custom primer sequence to the cleavage site of the altered P7 strand by enzymatic or chemical means and adapting the sequencing protocol code to detect the custom primer sequence instead of P5 to determine whether to terminate the sequencing run.
6) Exemplary variations of the protein sequencing methods described herein include, but are not limited to (fig. 17):
multiple aptamer binding rounds: in some cases (e.g., if there is aptamer specific binding problem), several rounds of aptamer binding/DNA barcoding/aptamer denaturation can be performed for error correction before proceeding with N-terminal amino acid degradation. The additional data acquisition allows downstream computational analysis to reduce noise for each measurement.
Aptamers against two amino acids: in certain cases (e.g., if aptamers to a single amino acid do not have sufficiently high affinity or are not sufficiently specific to the method), aptamers to two or more consecutive amino acids may be generated (fig. 18). An additional benefit of aptamers that bind and encode two amino acids is that the signal-to-noise ratio is improved because each amino acid (except the N-and C-termini) is read twice.
Substrate: this barcode sequencing method can also be performed on glass or quartz substrates with DNA oligonucleotides printed or chemically linked in random or patterned events. Such chips may be custom made or purchased; for example, academic laboratories fabricated chips using clean rooms and DNA spotting machines, Agilent printed microarrays with known oligonucleotide sequences in a spotted pattern on glass, and Illumina's next generation sequencing chip was a glass slide with randomly distributed DNA linkers for P5 and P7 sequence binding sites attached to a solid surface. In the case of a custom glass slide or substrate, the DNA oligonucleotides may have a specific pattern to reduce off-target ligation noise.
Different oligonucleotide orientations: the protein sequencing methods described herein orient the DNA barcode sequence such that the 5' end is attached to a DNA linker on the chip. Using an optional or custom chip, the 3' end of the barcode sequence may instead be attached to the chip surface.
In solution: by attaching the DNA barcode directly to the C-terminus of the peptide, the need for a solid substrate can be eliminated altogether. The C-terminus of the peptide may initially contain a short oligonucleotide sequence, allowing for ligation between the end of the aptamer and the peptide tail, for example, bridged by a 5-mer oligonucleotide. Following Edman degradation, subsequent DNA barcodes can be attached to the free end of the peptide tail. The resulting barcode sequence can then be PCR amplified and sequenced using standard NGS techniques.
Beads in solution: peptides and oligonucleotides can be attached to beads (magnetic, glass-coated magnetic beads, or other beads coated with acid-resistant materials), and successive peptide sequencing steps (e.g., aptamer binding, barcode incorporation, and peptide degradation) can be performed by soaking and separating the beads in solution. After the desired number of sequencing cycles, the DNA barcode providing the sequence of the peptide can be PCR amplified directly on the bead and sequenced using standard NGS techniques (Hoon, Zhou, Janda, Brenner, & Scolnick, 2011).
Different binders: besides aptamers, barcoded conjugates such as RNA, peptides, proteins, nanobodies or other small molecules may also be used to recognize amino acids.
Different proteases: in processing protein samples, different proteases, such as Lys-C, trypsin or a combination of proteases as described above, may be used. In addition, the sample may be divided into multiple samples and processed with multiple proteolytic strategies to establish different proteomic profiles.
Separation of a single platform compared to steps: the Edman degradation of peptides and DNA barcode generation can be performed outside the sequencer platform or a complete end-to-end automated single platform is established. The DNA barcode strand may be immobilized and sequenced in separate steps.
Bridge design: the bridge is an oligonucleotide complementary to the aptamer tail portion with a 3' single-stranded overhang that anneals to the restriction site spacer and barcode (fig. 14). The bridges can be designed such that they can be (a) barcode specific bridges, where the bridges are fully complementary to the aptamer tails, including the barcode region, except for the 3' single stranded overhang region, such that each unique aptamer has a unique bridge associated with it (fig. 14A), or (B) universal bridges, where the bridges are complementary only to restriction site spacers and consensus sequences, both of which are conserved among all aptamers, and flank the barcode on the aptamer tail, such that all unique aptamers share the same bridge oligonucleotide (fig. 14B). For a universal bridge, the region that forms a duplex with the barcode on the aptamer tail may consist of the following sequence: (a) a universal base analog such as a sequence of 5-nitroindole, 3-nitropyrrole, 4-nitrobenzimidazole, and the like, or (b) no gap in bases such that the universal bridge consists of two separate oligonucleotides that anneal to regions on both sides of the barcode.
The connection method: DNA barcodes may be chemically linked rather than enzymatically linked together.
Different reads: instead of using DNA barcodes, one can use fluorescent dyes, beads, nanoparticles, etc. for the identification of amino acid conjugates (see also the proser-VIS method described herein).
Sequential amino acid degradation: cleavage of individual amino acids between rounds may be carried out enzymatically or chemically, for example by Edman degradation.
Sequencing directionality: single amino acids can be cleaved from either the N-terminal or C-terminal ends (Casagranda and Wilshire, 1994) (Cederlund et al, 2001). Protein sequencing from the N-terminal end is described in detail herein. Based on the present disclosure, it should be recognized that similar methods can be applied to protein sequencing starting from the C-terminal end in conjunction with aptamers designed to specifically recognize and bind to one or more C-terminal amino acids. For C-terminal sequencing, Methods of removing C-terminal amino acids and producing C-terminal amino acid shortened proteins or peptides (instead of using, for example, Edman degradation to produce N-terminal amino acid shortened proteins or peptides) are known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, Bergman et al (2001, anal. biochem.,290(1):74-82) and Casagrandan and Wilshire (1994, Methods mol. biol.,32: 335-49).
It will be appreciated that the prosseq method described herein can also serve as a large-scale high-throughput binding specificity assay to characterize interactions in different substance binding scenarios (BCS binding assays). A key advantage of this assay is that it allows one or more binding events between many putative binders and many targets to be recorded in one experiment. Once the desired target is coupled to the co-located substrate, the substrate can be affixed to a glass substrate or processed in solution. The diversified DNA barcoded hypothetical binder library (PBL) is then incubated with the desired target and non-target of interest, allowing binding to occur. Each DNA barcoded hypothetical binder comprises a binder molecule conjugated to a DNA sequence containing at least a) a restriction site, b) a linking site (e.g., a first linking site), c) a unique DNA barcode indicating the identity and binding cycle of the hypothetical binder, and d) another linking site (e.g., a second linking site). When the hypothetical binder binds to the immobilized target, its DNA barcode tail is attached to the proximal target-barcoded DNA substrate co-localized with the target. The ligated barcode was cut with restriction enzymes, exposing the DNA barcode construct, which was ligated to another binder barcode in the next round. After repeating this series of steps on the chip, the strands of the DNA barcode containing information about the identity of the binders and targets and the sequence of binding events can be read using conventional DNA NGS technology (fig. 19). Using this information, the probability distribution of hypothetical binders that bind to the desired target and non-target targets in a variety of different environments can be derived.
The prosseq method described herein yields numerous advantages, including but not limited to the ability to:
in a mixture, the probability distribution of the binding events is generated by interrogating the same target a number of times;
separation of the binding events from unbound binder molecules by a washing step for solid state methods. The separation of the binding and ligation events reduces off-target ligation events.
Large libraries of hypothetical binders are assayed in a variety of different environments (e.g., in the presence of non-targets of interest, other targets of interest, etc.). This is particularly important for binders identified by a selection process in which the binder is selected in the context of sequestering other hypothetical targets, but will be used in applications where there are a variety of different targets;
detection of rare binding events in a high noise environment (due to high resolution data in NGS);
determining the dynamic range of functional buffer conditions for the conjugate;
the process of separating bound and unbound ligand is simplified by simply flowing a wash buffer if the reaction is not carried out in solution.
Peptide or protein sequencing with visualization (PROSEQ-VIS)
The prose-VIS method described herein converts amino acid sequences into optical barcodes. In the pro-VIS method described herein, the amino acid sequence can be deconvoluted using fluorophore-conjugated aptamers, allowing de novo protein sequencing. The pro-VIS method described herein enables sequencing of a wide variety of samples, particularly samples in which one or more proteins of interest (e.g., target proteins) are present at low or very low concentrations (e.g., proteins present in parts per billion). The PROSEQ-VIS method described herein also provides a computational tool to determine the identity of the N-terminal amino acid based on the unique spectral signature of the observed binding event.
The prosseq-VIS method described herein uses amino acid-specific aptamer binding to convert a protein sequence into a series of fluorescent images or "optical barcodes" that can be read by microscopic imaging. The optical fluorophores can be assigned to their aptamers, revealing the underlying protein sequence. See, for example, fig. 20. This protein sequencing method can be used on small samples (including single cells or small volumes of blood) to identify entire expressed proteomes, underexpressed proteins, and single amino acid mutations to better understand complex disease phenotypes. Furthermore, the prose-VIS method described herein can be performed on intact cells and tissues to visualize not only the sequence of the protein, but also the location in the sample. See, e.g., table 1.
TABLE 1
The PROSEQ-VIS method described herein can be used in a clinical setting for identifying novel protein fusions or disease-associated mutations from individual patient samples, developing a diagnosis or prognosis, assessing a patient's response to treatment, or predicting the likelihood of a likely response to certain treatments. Furthermore, the methods described herein can be used broadly to characterize proteins, discover new biomarkers, analyze whole or macro proteomes, establish cell lines and assess mechanisms related to protein abundance, sequence or function.
1) Aptamers provide the ability to perform de novo sequencing
The prosseq-VIS method described herein uses a library of aptamers specific for a unique combination of one or two N-terminal amino acids described herein, wherein each residue pair has at least one (e.g., more than one, e.g., a plurality) aptamer binder. The ssDNA aptamers are designed to contain regions that include fluorophores or regions for annealing short dye-conjugated ssDNA probes so that the N-terminal amino acid can be identified by the unique spectral signature of the binding event between the N-terminal amino acid and its corresponding aptamer.
Proteins can be obtained from a sample (e.g., a blood sample, cell lysis, or single cell), denatured, blocked, and cleaved into peptide fragments. Although denatured intact proteins can be analyzed without cleavage, proteins that cleave into smaller peptide fragments are optimal because: (1) the Edman's round increases the noise floor in imaging, so fewer sequencing rounds can be used to determine the sequence of peptide fragments, and (2) certain imaging modes (such as TIRF) have narrow focusing windows (10s-100s nms), and signal detection is highly dependent on the sample being adequately contained within the optimal imaging window. Proteins can be cleaved into peptide fragments using, for example, conventional trypsin methods that cleave at lysine and arginine and/or other fragmenting enzymes that cleave at random amino acid sites. The combination of the two methods can help reduce errors in the post-sequencing computational alignment. Once the protein is converted to a short peptide, the free and unblocked C-terminal end can be coupled to a DNA primer oligonucleotide on a glass substrate or directly to glass (fig. 21). The aptamer library can then be run through peptides for incubation, allowing the aptamers to bind specifically to the N-terminal amino acid residue. There are many ways to fluorescently label the aptamer tail. Two possible imaging options are that the aptamer tail can have: (a) a tail with an optical barcode for imaging, or (b) wherein one or more short fluorescently labeled DNA probes can anneal to an aptamer: a region of an amino acid complex.
1.1 direct aptamer-dye conjugation
After the aptamer binds to the N-terminal prefix, the optical characteristics of the aptamer (a) can be imaged by a multichannel single-molecule epifluorescence or Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) imaging setup. For each N-terminal prefix read out ("round"), unbound aptamers are washed away and a z-axis multi-slice scan of the image can be obtained during incubation in order to confirm the spectral characteristics of the N-terminal amino acids. The next round is then started by removing the N-terminal amino acid on the immobilized peptide by using Edman degradation and/or aminopeptidase. The newly exposed N-terminal amino acids can then be interrogated using the same pool of aptamers (FIGS. 20A-20D). After repeating this series of steps, the identity of each N-terminal amino acid can be computationally derived at each round by comparing the probability distributions of binding events observed for each peptide for each aptamer-amino acid complex. Using this information, the amino acid sequence of each peptide can be deduced on the basis of a series of amino acid features obtained in successive rounds of imaging and degradation. See, e.g., fig. 20E.
1.2 hybridization of oligonucleotide-conjugated dyes with aptamers
In the case of using aptamers with regions that bind to complementary fluorescently-tagged oligonucleotides, each "round" of N-terminal prefix readout of the assay involves multiple "iterations" of probe incubation and imaging. The aptamer comprises 3 regions: (a) an effective binding region, (b) an optional spacer, and (c) a barcode tail having one or more combinations of barcode units indicating the number of detection iterations and a fluorescent label, wherein each barcode is complementary to a fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotide (fig. 22). To prevent the barcode region from affecting the folding of the binding region of the aptamer, the region of the oligonucleotide not associated with binding of the N-terminal prefix may be partially or fully protected by hybridization with a complementary oligonucleotide to form an aptamer with a partial double strand as the aptamer library flows through. The aptamer may be: the amino acid complex is incubated with a library of probes hybridized to the barcode region indicating probe iteration 1. The number of unique fluorescent labels that can be used per iteration depends on the number of channels in the imaging device, the nature of the fluorescent dye and the sensitivity of the emission filter and detector. During each iteration, each aptamer may be hybridized to one or more oligonucleotide-bound probes for multiplexing, as long as the complementary barcode units on the aptamer do not overlap for that iteration. Unbound probes may then be washed away and the bound probes may be imaged to obtain a first segment of the optical barcode. Subsequently, the bound aptamer can be incubated with the next set of probes hybridized to the barcode region indicating probe iteration 2. Iterations of probe incubation, imaging, and washing may be repeated until a complete optical barcode is obtained. Finally, Edman degradation can be performed to remove the N-terminal amino acid and the aptamer bound thereto to expose the next N-terminal amino acid for the next round of sequencing (fig. 23).
It will be appreciated that procedural modifications can be made to the imaging and downstream signal deconvolution strategies, in particular, to account for the affinity and specificity of aptamers used to detect the N-terminal amino acid. In the case of using highly specific binders, specificity will be directed to the unique N-terminal amino acid prefix and with a low KdThe library of (tightly bound) aptamers was flowed through, unbound aptamers were washed away, and the optical barcodes were observed as described above (fig. 24). In the case of aptamers with medium to low specificity, a library of fluorophore-conjugated aptamers can be run through the peptide for incubation, allowing the aptamers to bind semi-specifically to a set of N-terminal amino acid residues. Such aptamers preferentially bind to a given target and may also bind to a subset of known N-terminal amino acids, with each binding pair having a known probability distribution. For each round of sequencing, one can either precede (obtain background), follow (obtain specific binding), or follow (K) the cycle of aptamer incubationon、KoffAssay) to generate a spectral signature of an N-terminal amino acid prefix consisting of multiple binding events, and then removing the N-terminal amino acid to expose the next amino acid to be detected. Several rounds of incubation and detection may be performed before removal of the N-terminal amino acid by Edman to improve the confidence of the detected signal. After repeated rounds of aptamer binding, the identity of the N-terminal amino acid can be computationally deduced at each round by comparing the known probability distributions of binding events observed for each peptide for each aptamer amino acid prefix, since for a given moderate-intensity binder Pool-wise, each unique N-terminal amino acid was expected to have its own unique binding characteristics (fig. 25). Furthermore, in addition to or as an alternative to aptamers, conjugates such as RNA or small molecules may be used to recognize amino acids.
The methods described herein do not rely on prior knowledge of the protein (e.g., the peptide database required in mass spectrometry) and provide a route for de novo sequencing. However, if a database of proteins is available, only a portion of the amino acids may need to be identified in order to accurately map peptide fragments back to a full-length protein. Furthermore, if a protein is purified or selected (e.g., by molecular weight, charge, or affinity for a known molecule) prior to sequencing, it will further focus the list of candidates on the basis of a portion of the amino acid sequence of the full-length protein identified.
The prosseq-VIS method described herein has a number of advantages and applications, including but not limited to the ability to:
1) sequencing the peptide regardless of peptide concentration;
2) converting the protein sequence into an optical sequence, which allows the isolation of signals of underexpressed proteins;
3) performing de novo protein sequencing (to, e.g., allow direct discovery of sequences in molecules such as cytokines);
4) Processing small volume samples, as small as single cell protein sequencing; and
5) peptides were sequenced in situ to obtain localization data of proteins in intact tissues.
Instead of using fluorophore-conjugated aptamers or oligonucleotide probes to identify amino acids, other optical methods such as quantum dots, dye-conjugated nanoparticles, etc. may also be used. Instead of TIRF, other microscopy means can be used for imaging, with different degrees of resolution quality. Finally, replacing the aptamer with another type of N-terminal amino acid binding small molecule barcoded with an optical barcode in the prose-VIS method described herein also allows protein sequencing on the prose-VIS platform.
Simultaneous screening of multiple targets (multiplexing)
Attempts by others to screen for multiple targets using SELEX have successfully multiplexed up to 30 biologically similar targets in one SELEX experiment (e.g., VENN multiplexed SELEX by BasePair). Although the specific method to achieve this is not known, it is possible to bind the target to beads with different spectral content and incubate with aptamer candidates, followed by sorting by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). This approach limits the number of targets one can multiplex at a time due to the optical limitations of the machine.
The multiplexing methods described herein allow for the screening of multiple binders of peptide or protein targets at one time. In addition, the multiplexing methods described herein allow for the detection of rare binding events in high noise environments, improve target specificity, and perform specific assays for multi-target cross-validation matrix analysis and machine learning analysis. The multiplexing methods described herein can be used to identify interactions between essentially any two biological molecules (e.g., two DNA or RNA barcoded molecules such as oligonucleotides and molecular targets, proteins and antibodies, small molecules, and barcoded proteins) so long as both targets can be coupled to oligonucleotides that can then be linked to each other.
The multiplexing method described herein involves incubating aptamer candidates (fig. 26A) with a diverse pool of unbound DNA barcoded peptide targets (fig. 26B). After aptamer binding, the 3' end of the single-stranded aptamer was ligated to the ssDNA barcode of the peptide (fig. 26C), and the DNA portion was amplified by PCR. Sequencing the aptamer and its covalently attached DNA barcode provides the aptamer sequence and a unique identifier that indicates the target to which the aptamer binds, thereby eliminating the hurdle of identifying which aptamers are bound to which targets. Fig. 26D is a schematic diagram indicating the steps (from fig. 3) in which a multiplexed SELEX procedure can be incorporated.
The multiplexing methods described herein can reduce labor and reagent costs while improving data quality and broadening screening capabilities. Furthermore, the multiplexing methods described herein can produce aptamers that specifically bind to their unique targets in environments with a large number of available targets (e.g., cell surfaces, human blood), thereby greatly increasing the pipeline of aptamer discovery to applications.
1) Identification of peptide or protein targets using DNA barcodes
As mentioned above, in the multiplexing methods described herein, the targets are peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates (POC), which are single-stranded (ss) DNA tails (a) covalently linked at the 3' end to the C-terminus of peptide or protein targets (b), see fig. 27. The ssDNA tail (a) includes a 3 'primer region (c), a unique DNA barcode (d), and a 5' bridge binding sequence (e). Aptamers (f) include 3' bridge binding sequences (g). After binding of the POC-aptamers in solution, a short oligonucleotide bridge (h) can be introduced, wherein half of the short oligonucleotide bridge (h) is complementary to the 3 ' bridge binding sequence (g) at the 3 ' end of the aptamer (f) and the other half is complementary to the 5 ' bridge binding sequence (e) of the ss DNA tail (a). After the bridge oligonucleotide binds to both the aptamer and the peptide tail, ligase may be added to close the gap, unused bridge oligonucleotide may be degraded and/or removed, and ligase is inactivated. This results in a covalent linkage of aptamer (f) to peptide (b).
After ligation, the bead-bound POC target can be obtained (e.g., using a complementary pull-down with a biotinylated oligonucleotide), and then unbound aptamer removed (e.g., washed away). PCR can be performed on the beads via the ssDNA tails and aptamers, and the resulting DNA construct sequenced to obtain the barcode identifier of the aptamer sequence and its protein binding partner (boxed region in fig. 27).
2) Identification of local aptamer binding events from global noise using proximity-dependent DNA ligation
One difficulty encountered in the multiplexing methods disclosed herein is that the assay is constrained in a way that facilitates ligation of binding partners beyond that of randomly available substances in solution, since peptide tails and aptamers that are physically close together are more likely to ligate to each other than free-floating DNA. Thus, ligation reaction conditions can be developed and optimized to maximize local signal by optimizing parameters of several experimental tests including, but not limited to, reaction time, substrate concentration, temperature, and reaction solution. Furthermore, tails of different lengths and bridge regions of different lengths may be designed and characterized to optimize local interactions in a high noise environment.
3) Additional rounds of nested PCR for multiplexing-SELEX
To achieve multiple rounds in the multiplexing methods described herein, aptamer segments of ligated aptamer-barcode products can be reamplified (e.g., nested PCR of ligated complexes using primers flanking the aptamer sequence) and processed (e.g., purified by automated electrophoretic gel separation) and then converted to ssDNA (e.g., using enzymatic digestion). See fig. 28.
4) Alternatives and variations of the multiplexing method
Many procedural modifications may be made to adapt the multiplexing methods described herein to different applications.
The multiplexing methods described herein can be used to examine interactions in different substance binding scenarios; such as but not limited to: a) DNA-peptide binding, wherein the interaction region comprises an aptamer that binds to a peptide target; b) DNA-DNA binding, in which the region of interaction comprises a region of base complementarity between two DNA strands. For DNA-DNA interactions, the ability to identify local signals has been demonstrated with binding partners accounting for as little as 0.001% of the total pool in a solution at a concentration of 500nM, confirming the sensitivity of the multiplexing method described herein
In addition, the multiplexing methods described herein can be used to examine substance binding outside of DNA-DNA or DNA-peptide interactions. For example, the multiplexing methods described herein can be used to examine binding between any number of biological targets, so long as two targets can bind to each other (e.g., via ligation of oligonucleotides). For example, multiplexing methods similar to those described herein can be used to screen for RNA aptamers that bind to small molecule targets or protein complexes.
The ssDNA tail can be attached to the C-terminus of the peptide or protein using any of a variety of techniques, including but not limited to chemical linkers (e.g., click chemistry, SMCC linkers, EMCS linkers, etc.), biological linkers (e.g., biotin-streptavidin system), cross-linking (e.g., using formaldehyde or UV), and the like.
Furthermore, it is recognized that ssDNA tails may be attached to different regions of a protein or peptide (i.e., beyond the C-terminus). For example, the ssDNA tails may be attached to the N-terminus, a specific functional group, an amino acid side chain, and the like. Additionally or alternatively, multiple ssDNA tails can be attached to a single peptide or protein.
Ligation between DNA ends can occur in a variety of ways. Enzymatic ligation in aqueous solution can be used, but chemical ligation of the DNA ends is also possible. In some embodiments, an optional end of the bridge may be used for the connection. The projections and/or bridges may also be modified to include base pair mismatches to introduce a gradient of binding interactions such that the binding interaction between the binder and the target takes precedence over the binding interaction of the bridge.
It is to be understood that the multiplexing methods described herein can be performed in aqueous solution, or they can be tailored for use in different systems, e.g., on an immobilized surface, on beads, in vivo, in a gel, etc.
The multiplexing methods described herein have been used to identify aptamers that have selective binding to peptide targets in a competitive variety of peptide environments. Similar to selective antibodies, the resulting aptamers are suitable for use alone or in combination of two or more to generate constructs that control their multi-target binding profiles. For example, two aptamers, each with high selectivity for a different target, can be joined together to produce a construct that binds two separate targets; alternatively, two aptamers with the same primary target but different off-target binding profiles can be added to the pool in parallel or sequentially to improve the binding read with their common target by analysis of overlapping distribution regions.
Substituting DNA-barcoded molecules with 3' C-protruding arms for aptamers in the multiplexing methods described herein allows for the measurement of binding between different mixtures of any of the aforementioned molecular classes, enabling two-way multiplexed competitive measurements of combinations of any of the molecular classes, including peptide-to-protein, protein-protein, antibody-protein, small molecule-protein, peptide-cell surface markers, antibody-cell surface markers, and the like. In certain embodiments, both the binder and target molecules can be extracted from any mixture of molecules of any of the above classes, allowing cross-binding to be measured in a complex competitive environment.
The multiplexing methods described herein provide a highly sensitive tool for detecting low levels of binding events in large material pools. The multiplexing methods described herein reduce the need for numerous SELEX rounds (e.g., 8 to 20 rounds) and at the same time allow multiplexing of several peptide targets in one solution. As a result of the reduction in rounds, the multiplexing methods described herein minimize the number of PCR amplifications that must be performed on the aptamer pool, and thus minimize the bias introduced by each round of amplification. Increased specificity and reduced off-target binding are additional benefits in the multiplexing methods described herein. For example, if a unique aptamer that binds to peptide target No. 1 in a mixture containing target nos. 1-10 is isolated, it is also known that the aptamer does not bind to target nos. 2-10 (under those same conditions) in addition to binding to target No. 1. This reduces the likelihood of selecting non-specific aptamers that may bind other targets in addition to the target of interest.
Target protein and RNA binding protein fusions (TURDCUCKEN)
The classification of binding interactions is highly desirable in a number of research areas including drug development, diagnostics and basic research. Protein and peptide libraries contain libraries of biological targets of interest against which binders (e.g., aptamers, small molecules, antibodies, etc.) can be screened. At present, screening is usually performed in a single reaction in which the identity of the protein or peptide target is known, making the cost and labor of large scale screening of especially unknown targets prohibitive. Combining and screening several targets at a time allows for scaling and higher binding specificity, however, no currently available method is capable of generating a target library that can easily deduce the identity of each target in the pool.
Biological methods for generating protein or peptide libraries rely on cloning each protein individually into a model system such as yeast or E.coli and purifying (Jia & Jeon, 2016). To generate a library of 1,000 unique proteins, researchers must perform 1,000 independent transformation reactions, protein purification, and QC procedures, and finally combine the proteins together. Chemical synthesis can reliably produce pools of peptides and can quickly become cost prohibitive and technically challenging for larger proteins and protein complexes.
Importantly, existing methods for generating libraries do not allow scientists to easily identify individual elements after the components are combined. Common techniques for identifying proteins include mass spectrometry, antibody binding assays, and affinity tag binding assays (Miteva, budayova, & cristrea, 2012). The use of mass spectrometry to identify low-expression individual proteins from large pools is limited by the concentration threshold of unique elements in the protein pool; for new targets, antibodies are often inconsistent, absent, or cost prohibitive; and the affinity tag approach limits the diversity of the pool to the number of unique affinity tags available.
The TURDUCKEN method described herein allows the production of a mixture of thousands of unique proteins, to which tags are added, screened and identified in one pool. The turdcucken method described herein allows the generation of pools of diverse proteins and the screening of such diverse protein pools.
1) Protein expression
An in vivo system in saccharomyces cerevisiae (s. cerevisiae) and escherichia coli (e. coli) is described, wherein each transformed cell is engineered to produce a different protein of interest (POI) that can be non-covalently linked to an RNA barcode whose sequence can be used to identify the POI; the non-covalent linkage relies on the natural interaction between the RNA binding site and its corresponding RNA Binding Protein (RBP). See, for example, fig. 29. Representative RNA binding sites and their corresponding RBPs that can be used in such constructs include, but are not limited to, the MS2 RNA hairpin bound by the MS2 phage coat protein and the boxB sequence bound by the phage anti-stop protein N (. lamda.N). Each POI (fig. 29A) can be expressed as a fusion protein with an RNA-binding protein (part B of fig. 29), wherein the POI can be non-covalently linked to a specific RNA-binding site recognized by the RNA-binding protein (part C of fig. 29) and a unique barcode (part D of fig. 29). Each construct in the pool typically contains a POI fused to an RBP, a DNA sequence encoding an RNA sequence recognized by the RBP, a unique RNA barcode, and a promoter for driving expression. Representative promoters include, for example, the Gal 1,10 bidirectional promoter, ADH1, GDS, TEF, CMV, EF1a, SV40, T7, lac, or any other promoter and promoter combination compatible with the host organism. Pools of plasmids containing various POI-RBP fusion genes and their corresponding RNA barcode sequences can be transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae at approximate dilutions of 1 plasmid per cell (FIG. 30A). POI fusions made in vivo then bind their corresponding RNA barcodes intracellularly (fig. 30B), which can then be purified (fig. 30C). Fig. 30D is a schematic diagram demonstrating where the products of turdcken described herein may be used relative to the SELEX process (fig. 3).
2) Protein purification
The POI-RNA complex can be obtained using any of a variety of methods, resulting in the collection of only complexes containing both the POI fusion protein and the RNA barcode. For example, the complex can be pulled down from the cell lysate by a His tag or other purification tag that can be included in the protein fusion component of the POI. The POI can then be washed and released from the anti-His beads or other pull-down method compatible with the purification tag used and further purified using streptavidin coated beads and biotinylated oligonucleotides reverse complementary to the sequence in the RNA barcode. After this pull down step, a mixture of biotinylated oligonucleotides or unbound beads that bind to the POI-RNA complex, anneal to random RNA sequences is obtained. The POI-RNA complex can be released and purified from streptavidin coated beads by heating and washing the mixture to denature RNA and biotinylated oligonucleotides or by releasing the complex using restriction endonucleases.
3) Protein pool for aptamer binding assays
The end product from this process is a diverse pool of proteins, each of which can be identified by an attached RNA barcode. This design allows the use of this protein pool in multiplex aptamer screening assays. For example, a pool of potential aptamers that also contain their own unique nucleic acid barcodes may be incubated with the pool of proteins and the aptamers from the pool of potential aptamers allowed to bind their targets. The barcode of the non-covalently bound aptamer can be linked (e.g., covalently) to the POI-RNA complex barcode by controlled enzymatic ligation (e.g., see the multiplexing methods described herein). By sequencing the ligated product, an aptamer sequence can be obtained that provides the identity of its target.
The TURDUCKEN method described herein allows for:
a) labeling proteins in vivo using nucleic acid barcodes;
b) generating large, diverse protein pools in a single conversion reaction;
c) identifying each component of the protein pool using NGS sequencing; and is
d) Screening was performed for multiple targets in one pooled reaction.
Other methods of producing DNA-barcoded proteins, such as chemical synthesis, cannot be operated on a large scale and must be performed in a single sample or well. The turdcken method described herein provides the ability to express thousands to millions of different proteins in the same pool and add barcodes to them with low protein mislabeling rates in vivo. This approach saves significant time and money. Furthermore, the turdcucken method described herein provides the advantage of being able to screen many targets simultaneously at once.
It should be understood that procedural modifications may be made to adapt the turdcucken method described herein to different applications. For example:
any organism other than yeast (e.g., E.coli, mammalian CHO cells) can be engineered to produce a protein and nucleic acid of interest (POI-NA) complex.
The nucleic acids used in the turdrucken method described herein may be expressed from a variety of different constructs or vectors (e.g., circular plasmids, linear inserts, or chromosomally integrated DNA).
Alternative strategies for linking two substances in vivo to generate a POI-NA complex (e.g. different RNA binding proteins such as MS2 or the BoxB/λ N system, HUH-endonuclease domains, CRISPR-associated proteins).
Using a linker system such as Spycatcher/Spytag, TALE, etc., a DNA barcode may be used instead of an RNA barcode.
There are many potential uses for the in vivo protein labeling provided by the turdcucken method described herein. For example, the turdcucken method described herein can be used to study interactions between molecular targets (e.g., aptamers, small molecules, etc.), for basic or transformation studies. For example, fluorescent probes that hybridize to POI-DNA complexes can be used to visualize proteins in vivo as a screening tool for drug discovery applications. For example, the turdcucken method described herein may be used to mine aptamers that can then be used as a substitute for antibodies (e.g., as molecular probes, for targeted drug delivery, etc.).
Generation of large, diverse and controlled DNA Libraries (LEGO) by ligation
Exponential enrichment ligand systematic evolution (SELEX), a biomolecular technique traditionally used to identify aptamers, was designed to isolate strong binders from large pools of random aptamer candidates, since synthesizing such large pools of specific sequences is extremely difficult and expensive. However, if one were able to generate their own initial SELEX starting aptamer pool, the scenario of the SELEX experiment may allow for specialized adaptations, such as using sequences predicted by ML as targets as the starting aptamer pool. To achieve such large, diverse and still controlled or known library generation, a protocol called LEGO was developed. For a 40-mer ssDNA oligonucleotide, there is 10 24The possible oligonucleotides that can be explored, but each SELEX experiment only determines 10 of the total possible experimental space8-1014And (4) seed preparation. This represents only a small fraction of all possible DNA sequences, so that in practice even optimization is possibleAlso has a low probability of finding the best aptamer for a particular target. Studies have demonstrated the presence of specific two-dimensional or secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes (Tucker, Shum,&tanner,2012) and it is hypothesized that these secondary structures increase the binding capacity of aptamers. The ability to generate an initial input library rather than being limited to using a random library that favors epidemic secondary structures over unstructured aptamers would speed binder discovery. Furthermore, since artificial intelligence prediction algorithms such as ML improve their prediction capabilities, ML-directed input libraries for aptamer experiments will significantly increase the relative proportions of potential aptamer candidates to non-candidates in the starting pool and potentially reduce the number of rounds of finding equally high affinity aptamers. As a result, aptamer candidates can be found faster using fewer rounds of SELEX, lower cost of discovery is required, and the discovered candidates are less affected by experimental noise such as PCR bias. In other words, fewer downstream quality control assays need to be performed in order to confirm that the top ranked aptamer candidates are true binders and not aptamer candidates whose PCR is performed extremely well without specifically favoring the target of interest. Furthermore, one can consider iterating the method in which several rounds of SELEX are performed from a random library, sequencing the library, and inputting the resulting data into an ML model that predicts what the next initial starting pool should look like (characteristics such as secondary structure or GC content or direct sequence), then generating a new library, and starting a new, more directed SELEX experiment.
Although random libraries can be inexpensively synthesized, there is currently no cost-effective method for generating large pools whose parameters (e.g., GC content, recurring motifs, fixed regions, length, etc.) can be readily determined and manipulated. Current methods for synthesizing short (>200bp) DNA pools provide:
a) high diversity but little control over sequence content: random DNA libraries with customizable primer regions can be chemically synthesized at low cost (e.g., under $300, TriLink Biotech). However, production of 10 by conventional microarray synthesis14Individual assigned sequences are prohibitively expensive (e.g., expensive)Such as Integrated DNA Technologies: 1 thousand 200bp long sequences $ 2000; agilent: 24.4 ten thousand sequences of maximum 90-bp $13,000; twist Biosciences: 1 million sequences $46 k).
b) High control over sequence content but limited sequence diversity: the research group developed a method of constructing DNA libraries by splicing together building blocks in a one-pot reaction using a 12 base fragment (Fujishima et al, 2015) or a 8 base fragment sequentially on an immobilization system (Horspool et al, 2010). Both of these approaches have limitations that limit their use for aptamer library construction.
The LEGO method described herein allows the construction of computationally derived, customizable DNA libraries, allowing scientists to perform SELEX screening at a reasonable cost using a controlled input pool. It utilizes commercially available ligase to assemble random 40-mer libraries from sequential ligation of 5-mer or longer DNA LEGO blocks. This can be done in at least two ways: template-independent single-stranded ligation by using dsDNA ligase such as T4 DNA ligase (fig. 31A), or by using ssDNA or ssRNA ligase such as RNA ligase RtcB (fig. 31B). In both strategies, the ligation starts with the forward PCR primer being ligated to the first LEGO block and continues by adding one LEGO block at a time. The final ligation reaction occurred between the last LEGO block and the reverse PCR primers (FIGS. 32A-32B). After the primed 40-mer is generated, an amplification method, such as PCR using a protected forward primer and a phosphorylated reverse primer, can be performed. The PCR products can be cleaned using any preferred method and size selection methods such as the automated PippinHT program are used to select products with the correct base pair length. The library can then be converted from double stranded to single stranded DNA, for example using lambda exonuclease digestion, and the single stranded products can be cleaned and concentrated (fig. 32C). Fig. 32D is a schematic diagram demonstrating where the products of LEGO described herein can be used relative to the SELEX process (fig. 3).
The method described herein has several unique features that make it most suitable for generating aptamer libraries:
1) unique protrusion design allows for positional control of dsDNA ligation
Successful ligation between two double-stranded DNA fragments requires the presence of complementary single-base overhangs on both fragments. A pair of DNA blocks with compatible projections (e.g., A and T, G and C) are preferably linked together. Blocks with incompatible protrusions (e.g., a and C, G and T, etc.) are significantly less connected together. By using tiles with different combinations of A, T, C and G tabs, tile positioning can be controlled. For example, by designing the blocks such that the protrusions of blocks 1 and 2 are compatible and the protrusions of blocks 1 and 3 are incompatible, assembly of the blocks in the order of 1-2-3 instead of 2-1-3, 3-1-2, etc. may be facilitated.
2) Short building blocks allow exploration of the entire DNA space including sequences that are difficult to synthesize
The use of shorter LEGO blocks can produce libraries with several orders of magnitude higher diversity than those produced by other ligation methods. Using a 1,024 library of 5-mers, the entire space of a 40-mer DNA library can be generated (10)24Unique sequences). Any 40-mer aptamer or feature interval library required for the experiment can be assembled using a single 1536 well plate. In addition, certain sequences (e.g., long chains of G) are difficult to synthesize accurately by conventional methods. Splicing together many shorter chunks provides a useful way to obtain these sequences.
It should be understood that many modifications can be made to the methods described herein. For example:
library design: although the methods described herein use 5-mers to construct 40-mers, libraries of different lengths/lengths can be constructed from building blocks of different lengths/lengths. During DNA synthesis, the 5' phosphorylation rate of short (i.e., <6nt) oligonucleotides is low due to steric interactions from the glass substrate. Increasing the length of construct used will increase the percentage of phosphorylated oligonucleotide reagent. However, increasing the length of the oligonucleotide blocks requires the use of a larger number of different oligonucleotide blocks to assemble a library having the desired statistical distribution of sequences.
Building a chunk design: the methods described herein using dsDNA use blocks with phosphate group modifications on the 5' ends of both strands to facilitate ligation of the block to the growing strand and to the next block in the sequence. Conversely, a block with only one 5' phosphorylation thereon may be used to reduce the likelihood that the inverted DNA block will be integrated/ligated into the growing sequence. Alternatively, modifications to inhibit ligation may be added to the 5 'or 3' strands to prevent ligation of the inverted blocks. For ssDNA ligation, the methods described herein use blocks with the 3' phosphorylation modifications required for the RtcB enzyme to facilitate this reaction.
The starting materials: XNA, RNA, modified RNA, single-stranded DNA, or modified DNA, rather than unmodified double-stranded DNA, can be used to construct libraries using compatible ligases.
The connection method: there are a variety of ways in which strands of DNA can be joined together. The methods described herein use T4 DNA ligase or RtcB ssRNA ligase to enzymatically ligate DNA building blocks together. The building blocks may be ligated using different ligases (e.g.E.coli DNA ligase, CircLigase, thermostable ligase etc.) or by chemical methods (e.g.click chemistry).
The connection method: instead of performing a one-pot sequential ligation reaction, several smaller ligation reactions can be performed to produce large chunks, which are then combined to join the large chunks together. This may improve control over the position of the tiles.
The medium: instead of performing the library construction in solution, the reaction can be performed on beads, on a solid support, on a gel, or the like.
Size selection: in ligating these small DNA pieces together, the ligation products are generally not of the desired length. For purification of full-length products, manual and automated size selection methods such as the PippinHT automated DNA size selection system can be used.
Furthermore, although the methods described herein can be used to generate random libraries for SELEX aptamer screening, the methods described herein can also be used to generate DNA libraries for different applications, such as:
establishment of an ML-derived DNA library for the production of peptides/proteins by translation. The priority in the SELEX aptamer screens described herein is the discovery of aptamers specific for their amino acid targets. To this end, the same pool of random aptamers may be incubated with peptides of different sequences. Given the many different variations that typically require testing of the same sequence, it can be quite expensive to obtain all of the different peptide sequences that may be required from a vendor. To expand the space available for random peptides of SELEX, it would be helpful to be able to produce these peptides internally. The random DNA library generation methods described herein can generate these peptide libraries by cell-free translation kits or conventional DNA plasmid transformation experiments in cells. Promoter sequences may be included in the design of linker region blocks, or linked after library production, and peptides may be produced from these sequences in vivo or in vitro.
Sequence of the amplified DNA barcode. The key to performing protein sequencing is the ability to encode and subsequently read the amino acid sequence. In many of the protein sequencing methods described herein, DNA barcodes can be used to encode the identified regions of an amino acid sequence. In these methods, when an aptamer binds to a sequenced portion of a protein or peptide, the DNA barcode region on the aptamer is attached to the growing barcode strand by any suitable linking method. The enzymatic ligation methods described herein can be used to ligate barcodes together to form a barcode strand, or to attach barcodes to a universal linker.
Modification of PROSEQ reagents. In many of the protein sequencing methods described herein, functional aptamers and processed peptides contain DNA regions such as spacers, barcodes and junction consensus regions. For peptides to be sequenced, a shorter oligonucleotide linker (e.g.. gtoreq.6 nt) can be coupled to the amino acid residues to increase the reaction rate, followed by ligation of the remaining DNA elements in a LEGO-like manner. For aptamers found in SELEX, a DNA tail comprising a unique barcode indicating the identity, cycle number, restriction site, and the like of the aptamer can be directly ligated to the 5' end of the aptamer using a single stranded ligase such as RtcB. Furthermore, the binders found in SELEX can be modified using asymmetric PCR to be used directly on the proser platform.
The LEGO method described herein allows for the generation of oligonucleotide libraries that can be tailored to have certain properties (e.g., GC content, recurring motifs, etc.). The diversity of these libraries is several orders of magnitude higher than those generated by other ligation methods and can be assembled at reasonable cost.
According to the present invention, conventional molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry and recombinant DNA techniques within the skill of the art may be used. These techniques are explained fully in the literature. The present invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the subject methods and compositions described in the claims.

Reagent
Aptamer libraries were purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies and IDT, and all other oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT or via K&A
Libraries
The single-stranded N40 aptamer library consisted of 40 random bases flanked by custom primer regions. To mitigate contamination of the over-enriched aptamers from past experiments, the primers on the N40 library were switched every 2-3 months. The initial N40 library (TAGGGAAGAGAAGGACATATGATNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGA (SEQ ID NO: 1)) was ordered directly from TriLink Technologies. Subsequent custom primers were designed using a random sequence generator tool to generate hypothesized sequences, cross-validated against the inner primer set to avoid excessively similar sequences, and then examined for melting temperature and self-dimers and heterodimers using an IDT oligonucleotide analyzer. Custom primers were also checked for quality using a brief SELEX cycle before being used in the complete SELEX process.

peptides
Biotinylated peptides were synthesized by Genscript. To facilitate attachment of the peptide to biotin, all C-terminal residues are lysine. The construction of each peptide is as follows: n-terminal- (2-mer prefix) - (8-mer suffix) -C-terminal-biotin.
2-mer prefix: only 20 naturally occurring amino acid prefixes are divided into 4 groups of 5 amino acids each. The 2-mer prefix is determined by pairing of amino acids within a grouping to each other and to amino acids from other groupings. Each 2-mer prefix thus belongs to one of 16 chunks (each chunk has 25 possible 2-mers). There are a total of 400 possible 2-mer prefixes. For reference, the 400 possible prefixes are depicted in fig. 34A. The 16 blocks are depicted in fig. 34B.
8-mer suffix: for dipeptide switching experiments, each 2-mer prefix is associated with 2 of 4 possible suffixes. In addition, the presence of K or C at the terminus depends on whether the peptide is biotinylated (no DNA oligonucleotide attached) or manufactured with DNA oligonucleotides attached (PoC), respectively. These suffixes are:
A' suffix: ADRWADR (K or C) (SEQ ID NO: 5)
B' suffix: MSQPLQP (K or C) (SEQ ID NO: 6)
C' suffix: NHFENEI (K or C) (SEQ ID NO: 7)
D' suffix: TKYVGTG (K or C) (SEQ ID NO: 8)
E' suffix: TAYVETE (K or C) (SEQ ID NO: 9)
F' suffix: QGHSIDN (K or C) (SEQ ID NO: 10)
Selecting the two suffixes assigned to each 2-mer prefix to avoid similarity to the 2-mer prefix. For example, 2-mer prefixes from AB chunks should be associated with C 'and D' suffixes instead of a 'and B' suffixes.
Suffixes paired with the 2-mer prefix were alternated between odd and even rounds, with only the 2-mer prefix-constant peptide combination applying selective pressure to aptamers in all 4 rounds (fig. 34C). An example of suffix and prefix combinations for DD and DC prefix experiments is depicted in fig. 34D.

Method
SELEX pre-cycle method:
cultivation of
Incubation was performed by one of three variations, depending on experimental needs. All incubations were performed using a 50 μ l PCR reaction using Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies). PCR was performed using Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads (Omega-Biotek) and SPRI purified at a rate of 0.6X by adding 100% ethanol on a Bravo automated liquid handling platform (Agilent). The amplification conditions for this and all subsequent PCR reactions (except NGS preparation) were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 ℃ for 5 min, followed by 13 amplification cycles of denaturation at 95 ℃ for 30 sec, annealing at 55 ℃ for 30 sec, and extension at 72 ℃ for 30 sec, and final extension at 72 ℃ for 5 min.
To facilitate regeneration of ssDNA libraries for aptamer incubation (detailed in the section on digestion), protected and phosphorylated primers were used. For the primer constructs described below, indicates that the nucleotides are modified such that the oxygen atom in the phosphate backbone is replaced by a sulfur atom to obtain a phosphorothioate, which makes the sequence more resistant to nuclease digestion.

Incubation variants
Option 1 (primary use):
will come fromIn 10 of the Single-stranded N40 library12Samples of each sequence (. about.48 ng) were amplified in 288 reactions of 50. mu.l each. Combining the SPRI purified products of all 288 reactions provided us with a diversity of 10 12The final culture, which was sequenced and had approximately 1200 copies, was divided into 12 SELEX reactions. This method was used to identify aptamers against the biological controls bradykinin, arginine vasopressin and GnRH as well as a part of dipeptide switching experiments.
Option 2:
two 10 from the single-stranded N40 library12Samples of each sequence (48 ng each, 96ng total) were amplified in 576 reactions of 50 microliters each. Combining all the SPRI purified products of 576 reactions provided us with a diversity of 2X 1012Final incubations of each sequence were divided into 36 SELEX reactions. This approach provides an input pool for most dipeptide switching experiments.
Option 3: double cultivation:
the incubation was performed in the manner of variation 1, but unmodified primers were used instead of the protected and phosphorylated versions. The purified culture (with 10)12Diversity of individual sequences) as a dsDNA input library for a second incubation with modified primers (variants 1 or 2). A total of 48ng of each dsDNA aliquot was amplified in 288 reactions. Double incubation allows the use of 10 in multiple sets of experiments12The same input for each sequence far exceeds the conventional 12-18 SELEX reactions usually limited by their distribution.
And (3) cultivating: inclusions
N40 constructs with known sequences were incorporated into the incubations and subsequent rounds of SELEX were completed, depending on experimental requirements. These sequences are:
·A6：high_gc_5：TAGGGAAGAGAAGGACATATGATCACCGCATCCTGAGGCCGGTGTGGAGGGCACGAAGTCTGGTTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGA(SEQ ID NO：17)
·C2：high_gc_5：TAGGGAAGAGAAGGACATATGATCTAGCATGGTGCCCTTACCCTCAGAGCGGAAGTACCTGATTTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGA(SEQ ID NO：18)
during the initial incubation period, 5.39 million molecules of each inclusion were present in each 50ul reaction, making each inclusion 53,947-fold richer than the average of the random N40 sequences.
Refolding
The aptamer library was heated to 95 ℃ for 5 minutes and then cooled on ice for 30 minutes to refold the DNA secondary structures into their lowest energy state.
Negative selection
To remove aptamers that would otherwise bind to reagents that are always present in the sample throughout the assay, the oligonucleotide library undergoes negative selection before being used as input to SELEX. To 500ug of streptavidin-coated beads (C1, T1, M270, or M280 depending on the needs of the experiment) was added 166.62pmol (4650ng) of the refolded ssDNA library to a final volume of 400ul at a concentration of 1 XPBS, 0.025% Tween, and 10mg/ml BSA. The reaction was incubated at Room Temperature (RT) at 22-24 ℃ for 30 minutes with rotation, and the supernatant was collected.
When peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates are used, the tail with only the oligonucleotide is selected. The oligonucleotide tail was ligated to a 5' biotinylated oligonucleotide fully complementary to the oligonucleotide tail in a ratio of 1: 2, tail part: ratio of complements incubation. A sample containing 1.67pmol of the oligonucleotide tail and 3.34pmol of the complement was then added to 166.62pmol of the previously negatively selected refolded ssDNA library for the beads. The reaction was incubated at room temperature at RT for 30 minutes with rotation, then 200ug of streptavidin coated beads were added and incubation continued for 30 minutes. The supernatant from this incubation was then collected as the final negative selected input.
Digestion of
The amplified library was converted to single stranded dna (ssdna) by enzymatic digestion using lambda exonuclease (New England BioLabs) and SPRI purification by automated bead cleaning. ssDNA digestion completion was characterized on bioanalyzer 2100(Agilent) using a small RNA kit (Agilent) and concentration was quantified by ssDNA Qubit assay (thermolfisher) after cleaning.
SELEX cycle method:
refolding
The aptamer library was heated to 95 ℃ for 5 minutes prior to each SELEX incubation, and then cooled on ice for 30 minutes to refold the DNA secondary structures into their lowest energy state prior to each SELEX incubation.
B.2 RCHT-SELEX incubation variants
SELEX incubation:
there are three variations on how the peptide is incubated with the ssDNA aptamer. Using variant 1, the initial SELEX incubation occurred in the presence of streptavidin beads (variant 1: SsDNA incubated with peptide-bead conjugate); using variation 2, streptavidin beads were added after most of the incubation was complete (variation 2: SsDNA incubated with peptide-oligonucleotide target, followed by bead pull-down). Using variant 3, the peptide-oligonucleotide target was incubated with biotinylated primers, followed by addition of partially double-stranded aptamer (variant 3 (5') blocked aptamer incubated with peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate, pulled down using beads). See fig. 35.
In all cases, the ssDNA pools were heated to 95 ℃ for 5 minutes before incubation, and then rapidly cooled on ice. For each reaction, up to 166.62pmol (4650ng) of refolded aptamer was added to the peptide or peptide-bead conjugate, and the total volume was brought to 400ul, with a final concentration of 1 × PBS and 0.025% TWEEN 20. The final incubation buffer of variant 3 also incorporates BSA at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. These buffer conditions can be distinguished as:
SELEX buffer v.1 (also known as SELEX buffer): 1 XPBS and 0.025% TWEEN20
SELEX buffer v.2 (also known as BSA-enriched SELEX buffer): 1 XPBS, 0.025% TWEEN20, 10mg/ml BSA
These buffers were prepared from 10 XPBS (Sigma-Aldrich), TWEEN20(Sigma Aldrich) and powdered bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich).
Variation 1: SsDNA incubation with peptide-bead conjugates
Coupling of peptides to beads
After determining the concentration gradient for the SELEX experiment, the peptide targets on the beads can be pre-fabricated in a large batch to avoid wheel-to-wheel errors caused by multiple couplings. The beads can be frozen and thawed once without any experimental defects. Aliquots for each round were made and stored in Eppendorf Lobind or Nunc plates at-20 ℃ until removed for thawing. To ensure similar properties, freshly coupled beads and frozen beads were unit tested and compared and no difference was found. The amount of production target should be based on the number of rounds, the initial concentration of the first round, and the buffer stock in the presence of an experimental disaster. In this example, a 1:10 target was used: initial ratio of DNA aptamers. Using the Bravo automated liquid handling platform (Agilent), 18.5pmol of peptide was mixed with 87.2ug (8.72ul of a 10mg/ml stock) MyOne streptavidin C1 beads (ThermoFisher) and incubated for 30 minutes. After an additional 2 washes with SELEX buffer, the initial mixture of 18.5pmol of each peptide and 87.2ug of beads was resuspended in 50ul of SELEX buffer. These numbers were scaled up to produce a large volume bead conjugate stock solution that could be divided into aliquots at the beginning of each experiment and frozen. For 1:10 of the target: for ssDNA stringency experiments, 50ul of this stock can be added to 4650ng of input ssDNA, and directly scaled down to a smaller volume for experiments using less than 4650ng of input ssDNA. For use 1: 25, the volume of the peptide-bead conjugate added was further scaled down using a factor of 0.6X.
BSA blocked M280 or T1 beads or unblocked M270 or C1 beads were used depending on the experimental requirements. The M280 and M270 beads had a diameter of 2.7um, and the C1 and T1 beads had a diameter of 1 um. The unit test confirmed that the manufacturer indicated that the best C1 beads for automation pulled different aptamer sequences from the incubations compared to M280, M270, and T1 beads. The mechanism of this result is unknown. As a result of the unit test, M280 beads were selected for the next experiment, since BSA blocking is preferred to prevent selection of aptamers bound to the bead surface, and the larger surface area target can provide a platform to place individual peptides more apart, reducing the selection of aptamers that prefer peptide dimerization.
Blank bead "conjugates" were generated by placing a mixture of beads and water in the same automated Bravo protocol, for a total of 30 minutes of incubation and 2-3 wash cycles. The initial input of 87.2ug beads was also resuspended in 50ul SELEX buffer and added to ssDNA at a later time at a ratio of 87.2ug beads per 4650ng ssDNA (for a 1:10 stringency reaction) or 34.88ug beads per 4650ng ssDNA (1:25 stringency reaction).
SELEX incubation
Up to 50ul of bead conjugate was added to 166.62pmol (4650ng) of folded aptamer and incubated for 2 hours at RT with rotation.
Streptavidin-biotin pulldown
Streptavidin M280 beads (Invitrogen) were added to the SELEX incubation in the presence of 83.33ug of peptide per 51.02pmol of peptide, for 30 minutes with rotation.
Variation 2: SsDNA incubation with peptide-oligonucleotides and aptamer incubation followed by bead pulldown
Peptide coupling
For this variant, no coupling is required prior to incubation. The target is a peptide-oligonucleotide.
SELEX incubation
The amount of target added depends on the stringency gradient desired. Typically, for small molecule targets, stringency conditions in the range of 1:1 to 1:10 (target: ssDNA) are used as starting conditions, keeping through target switching rounds, and then increasing target: ratio between DNA until sequencing data confirmed enrichment of aptamers. Here, the protocol used for ssDNA starting from the 1:10 target is described. For rounds 1 and 2, 166.62pmol (4650ng) of folded aptamer was added directly to 18.51pmol of peptide-oligonucleotide construct for ssDNA stringency as the target of 1: 10. To account for the reduced stringency of 1:25 in rounds 3 and 4, 166.62pmol (4650ng) of aptamer was added directly to 7.40pmol of peptide. The peptide and ssDNA were incubated for 2 hours at RT with rotation.
Streptavidin-biotin pulldown
In the case of a target with a DNA oligonucleotide tail, the biotinylated primer (5 'biotin TAGGGAAGAGAAGGACATATGAT 3' (SEQ ID NO: 19)) that anneals to a portion of the oligonucleotide tail was expressed as a 1:2 peptide for every 51.02pmol of peptide present: biotinylated oligonucleotide was added proportionally to SELEX incubation for 30 minutes with rotation. The primer has two functions: (1) preventing aptamer binding to the DNA oligonucleotide tail, and (2) allowing the target to be pulled down by performing a biotin-streptavidin reaction after incubation.
Streptavidin M280 beads (Invitrogen) were then added to the SELEX incubations in an amount of 83.33ug of peptide per 51.02pmol present, for 30 minutes with rotation. After incubation with the beads allowed the biotin-streptavidin reaction to complete, the beads were pulled down (manually or automatically) using a magnet, washed, and prepared for PCR.
Variation 3: (5') incubation of blocked aptamer with peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate, pulling down Using beads
Preparation of incubation solution (POC and biotinylated primer incubation)
In addition to blocking the region of the tail of the peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate (POC), a portion of the aptamer may also be blocked to prevent unwanted binding between the primer region of the aptamer and the region of the DNA tail on the POC. POC at 1: 2: biotinylated primer ratio POC was added to a 5' biotinylated primer complementary to the length of the oligonucleotide tail. 10 XPBS, TWEEN-20, BSA and water were added so that each reaction contained a final 265ul solution and 1 XPBS, 0.025% TWEEN-20 and 0.1509mg/ml BSA. The whole solution was incubated for 30 minutes at RT with rotation.
The input of POC for each reaction was determined by the expected input of aptamer. An exemplary method for a 1:10 target ssDNA stringency round is set forth below. For rounds 1 and 2, 18.5pmol POC was prepared for 166.62pmol (4650ng) aptamer input, eventually reaching a stringency of ssDNA as the target of 1: 10. In this particular gradient, after two rounds of stringency at 1:10, the next two rounds are accelerated to a stringency of 1:25 to increase the signal of enriched aptamers. It should be noted that too rapid an increase in stringency or too high an initial stringency will result in loss or disappearance of the true aptamer signal. However, too slow a stringency increase or no competition between binders for initial stringency results in a loss of time and resources due to the additional SELEX rounds required before enrichment can be observed. In this example, the amount of POC prepared for 166.62pmol (4650ng) aptamer input was reduced to 7.40pmol, taking into account the target reduction required for 1:25 stringency in rounds 3 and 4.
SELEX incubation
The peptide and ssDNA were incubated for 2 hours at RT with rotation. The final incubation buffer used for the 400ul reaction was 1 XPBS, 0.025% TWEEN20 and BSA at concentrations matched to the hybridization buffer used in the BCS experiments (see example 3-ProSeq experiment and example 4-BCS binding assay experiment below, varying from 0.10mg/ml to 10 mg/ml).
POC contrast
For the negative control of modification 3 of SELEX, aptamers were incubated with the oligonucleotide tail of POC only and not with the peptide.
Possible oligonucleotide tails for this purpose are as follows:
·/5phos/cttagatgcacgtggataATCATATGTCCTTCTCTTCCCTA(SEQ ID NO：20)
·/5phos/cttagatgcacgcagcatATCATATGTCCTTCTCTTCCCTA(SEQ ID NO：21)
streptavidin-biotin pulldown
M280 beads (Invitrogen) were added to SELEX incubation in the presence of 83.33ug of peptide per 51.02pmol of peptide, for 30 minutes with rotation.
B.3 RCHT-SELEX general experiment part II
SELEX post cycle method:
cleaning after incubation (for all variants)
Bead-peptide-aptamer conjugates were collected on Bravo using an automated washing protocol. Each SELEX reaction was incubated on a magnetic plate for 2 minutes. The supernatant containing unbound aptamer was aspirated, and the beads were washed twice with SELEX buffer and finally with 1X PBS. At the end of the protocol the 1X PBS was aspirated.
PCR on beads
Immediately after the auto-wash protocol was completed, 50ul of PCR solution was added to each well containing beads. An 86nt construct was amplified using an unmodified variant of the breeding primer, except that the construct was 84nt in length for the Wolverine2 library (the full library construct provided earlier in the description of the library).
NGS preparation
After PCR amplification on the beads, the DNA concentration was measured by the Qubit dsDNA assay and the SPRI purified PCR sample on 10ng of beads was removed for NGS preparation. Each aptamer identified from sequencing of these samples had a 6bp barcode of the peptide to which they were supposed to bind in solution. The P5 and P7 linkers required for Illumina sequencing were generated by using custom NGS primers (5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATNNNNNNNN- (forward primer) -3') (SEQ ID NO: 22) and 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACNNNNNN- (reverse primer) -3') (SEQ ID NO: 23) is incorporated by PCR. The forward and reverse primer regions are variable depending on the N40 library used for SELEX. The amplification conditions for these PCR reactions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 ℃ for 5 min, followed by 10 cycles of denaturation at 95 ℃ for 30 sec, annealing at 65 ℃ for 30 sec, and extension at 72 ℃ for 30 sec, and final extension at 72 ℃ for 5 min. The final NGS library SPRI was purified, pooled and size-selected for the 177bp construct by pippinht (sage science).
Threshold PCR
For each SELEX reaction, 4.08ng of SPRI purified product from PCR on beads was amplified in 24 50ul PCR reactions using modified primers (sequences provided in the incubation portion) tailored for each library. The SPRI purified dsDNA product of this library was an 86-bp (or 84-bp for the Wolfine 2 library) amplicon, with the same construct as the original N40 library, with protected and phosphorylated ends to facilitate enzymatic digestion of the reverse strand. The regenerated ssDNA library serves as the input for the next round of SELEX.
SELEX cycle
The protocol steps between aptamer refolding, target selection, aptamer incubation, unbound material separation, washing, amplification, NGS sample extraction, threshold amplification, ssDNA library generation and refolding can be repeated as a "SELEX round" until enriched aptamers are found in the NGS sequencing data. The incubation and initial negative selection were not repeated between rounds.
Additional Components of B.4RCHT-SELEX
False SELEX
During the first 2 hours of modification 2 of SELEX, the negative control was incubated with water and SELEX buffer only. After each round of SELEX, samples from the pseudo-SELEX were sequenced in order to determine the effect of PCR bias (since enrichment should not occur due to lack of target). False SELEX can be used for computational analysis and ML modeling of aptamers to train the model to focus on the enrichment signal of aptamer counts rather than noise of operator error, contamination, PCR bias, or other experimental or instrumental noise.
BCS compatible aptamer preparation
The use of BCS or DNA aptamers in ProSeq requires modification of the primer region of the aptamer to include the correct ligation, restriction enzyme and spacer sequences to facilitate binding and record events in BCS. However, no unique barcode is required, as sequencing can be performed over the entire aptamer sequence in order to record which aptamer binds to which target on the BCS chip. There are several ways in which aptamer libraries can be converted into BCS-compatible libraries, however the fastest, cheapest and highest throughput method is to use PCR to modify the primer regions of aptamers. For this, a 1:10 aptamer: bridge mimetic ratio ssDNA pools (up to 166.62pmol per reaction) were added to a 23nt oligonucleotide "bridge mimetic" complementary to the forward primer region of the aptamer. The solution was made up to 135ul solution with 1X PBS and 0.25% TWEEN 20. The mixture was heated to 95 ℃ for 5 minutes, rapidly cooled on ice, and then added to the incubation solution.
For SELEX N40 library 3 (also known as OMB105, Wolverine2), the library had the following construct
·5’TGATGCTATGCGACTTATTGTACNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTACTTGGCGTTCTTACCACCA 3’(SEQ ID NO：24)
And the following forward primer
·5’TGATGCTATGCGACTTATTGTAC 3’(SEQ ID NO：25)
The bridge mimetic used was 5 'GTACAATAAGTCGCATAGCATCA 3' (SEQ ID NO: 26).
Bead-based multiplexing SELEX
This assay is nearly identical to SELEX, except that multiple peptides are added to each reaction. Peptides were separately coupled to beads at the start of the experiment and the individual stocks were aliquoted and mixed in equimolar proportions at the start of the SELEX incubation. The first four rounds were processed by conventional incubation/threshold PCR, digestion, incubation, auto-wash and PCR on bead cycles. For de-multiplexing in the last round, N x 4.08ng of each reaction from PCR on beads was amplified in N x 24 reactions, where N is the number of peptides incubated simultaneously with the aptamer pool. The SsDNA from this reaction was incubated with 1:50 stringency in each SELEX reaction, with only one peptide present in each reaction.
After washing away unbound aptamers using the automatic washing protocol of Bravo, 50ul of PCR solution was added to each of the de-multiplexed wells. The SPRI purified products of each of these PCR reactions were barcoded and sequenced during NGS preparation to reveal aptamers associated with each peptide isolated.
Primer switching
Custom primers flanking the N40 region were excised and replaced with alternative primer sequences between runs. The purpose of this primer switch was to reduce contamination by over-enriched aptamers from experiments using the same N40 library.
Current primer-switch designs are designed for the TriLink N40 library. Fok1 restriction sites were introduced to generate a new full-length construct (5 'TAGGGAAGAGGGATGAAGGACATATGATNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTTGACTAGTACATCATCCGACCACTTGA (SEQ ID NO: 30)) by amplifying the original N40 construct (5' TAGGGAAGAGAAGGACATATGATNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGA (SEQ ID NO: 27)) with primers TriLinkFwd _ FokI (5 'TAGGGAAGAGGGATGAAGGACATATGAT (SEQ ID NO: 28)) and TriLinkRev _ FokI (5' TCAAGTGGTCGGATGATGTACTAGTCAA (SEQ ID NO: 29)).
By cleavage with 9bp and 13bp downstream of its restriction site (5'. GGATG (N))9/3’...CCTAC(N)13(SEQ ID NO: 31)) nuclease Fok1(NEB) digestion of this altered PCR product, we cut off (5 'TAGGGAAGAGGGATGAAGGACATA (SEQ ID NO: 32) and 5' TTGACTAGTACATCATCCGACCACTTGA (SEQ ID NO: 33)) leaving sticky ends. End-filling of the construct with Klenow fragment (NEB) resulted in blunt ends. Incubation of this blunt-ended double-stranded library with new double-stranded primers and ligase completed the protocol, leaving us with the original N40 library with a new primer set in place. The success of each digestion and ligation event was analyzed by the bioanalyzer small RNA kit (Agilent).
Board layout
To minimize the effect of local contamination between adjacent wells, technical replicates (3 per experimental condition) were spatially randomly distributed in different rows and/or different plates. For dipeptide switching experiments, there are no technical parallel samples adjacent to each other. This allows computational filtering of noise during post-sequencing analysis.
Part C: RCHT-SELEX results
Cultivation of
For the breeding, 96 unit tests were performed to determine the optimal breeding conditions for each library, which was defined as the conditions that introduced the least deviation or variation in the expression levels of all combinations of possible 6-mers after the breeding was performed. The expression intensity of each combination of possible 6-mers from a sequencing run of the DNA pool after incubation was divided by the expression intensity before incubation. For the OMB63 library, the optimal conditions to cause minimal variation in the expression level of each combination of 6-mers were 11 PCR amplification cycles using Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase and 0% DMSA, and inputting 1010Individual DNA molecules (FIG. 36).
False SELEX
The top 20 sequences from the 100,000 sequences randomly sampled from the dummy SELEX sample and the real SELEX round proved to be different, indicating that the DNA pool after SELEX incubation was altered as a result of the bead-coupled target rather than the pull-down random sequence (fig. 37). The false SELEX analysis can be used to determine the PCR bias element during the SELEX experiment and also to train the model towards background truth values for positive aptamer signals.
Digestion of food
The bioanalyzer small RNA kit trace shows a single clear peak at about 75nt after the digestion process, which correlates with the desired ssDNA product size (86 bp for most SELEX libraries) in view of measurement errors in the technique (fig. 9C). Confirmation of complete conversion of dsDNA PCR products to ssDNA occurred prior to the introduction of each aptamer library into each new round of SELEX.
Threshold PCR
Unit testing showed that the threshold PCR introduced very little bias. Comparison of the sequencing data of the DNA before and after the threshold PCR run showed that the threshold PCR resulted in a low variance (log ratio variance of 0.132) in the sequence distribution between pools before and after the threshold PCR (fig. 11B and 11C).
Parallel experiments
Parallel experiments with aptamer sequences from the same culture between experiments on the same target up to round 5 provided a higher confidence in the identified aptamers. The wells in which the bradykinin and GNRH experiments were performed were physically adjacent on the same plate. Significant leakage between the target bradykinin and GNRH was detected in the biological control SELEX experiment, allowing for detection of spatial contamination (fig. 38). Thus, randomization of sample placement was performed on each plate, with different targets placed on the same row and no spacing between each experiment, and parallel samples of the same target placed with a distance of 2 columns between each parallel sample to reduce contamination. After the significance evaluation, the observed contamination was found to be a result of the reagent being carried out of the automation.
Aptamer
Biological control
As a proof of concept of the RCHT-SELEX method, DNA aptamers directed against arginine vasopressin (peptide sequence: CYFQNCPRG { LYS (biotin) } (SEQ ID NO: 34)) and bradykinin (peptide sequence: RPPGFSPFR { LYS (biotin) } (SEQ ID NO: 35)) were identified as having high binding affinity, an equilibrium dissociation constant (K) estimated on the basis of the experimental conditions of SELEX incubationd) The value was 45nM (FIG. 39). The aptamers may be further characterized by the ability to,to determine K with and without primersd. The sequence of the N40 binding region of the aptamer identified for each target was:
arginine vasopressin: 5'-ATATTCTAGGTTGGTAGGGAAGGCATGTATCTAATTCCTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 36)
Bradykinin: 5'-CAAATCGGTGCCGGCCGGGAAGGGGCAAAAACAGTGCAAC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 37)
During RCHT-SELEX, two aptamers were flanked by the following primers:
forward primer TAGGGAAGAGAAGGACATATGAT (SEQ ID NO: 38)
Reverse primer reverse complement: TTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGA (SEQ ID NO: 39)
The same culture was assayed for arginine vasopressin and bradykinin in 3 parallel experiments per target; the identified sequences gave consistent results in experiments with the same target and did not give consistent results in experiments with different targets. The findings indicate that these aptamers are likely to be specific aptamers to arginine vasopressin and bradykinin and can be used to detect these targets in a sample.
Peptide switching
In the chunk a peptide switching experiment, the sequences were successively enriched for specific N-terminal amino acids. Representative top ranked aptamers for lysine and cysteine, defined as the aptamers with the highest sequence counts after filtering for noise, are reported in figure 40. During RCHT-SELEX, both aptamers were flanked by the following primers:
the forward primer: TAGGGAAGAGAAGGACATATGAT (SEQ ID NO: 40)
Reverse primer reverse complement: TTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGA (SEQ ID NO: 41)
Further experiments may be performed to characterize and validate the identified aptamers for use in protein sequencing.
And part D: n-terminal amino acid SELEX experiment
Example 2N-terminal amino acid SELEX
Reagent
DNA libraries were purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies, and all DNA primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and HPLC purified. All peptides were purchased from Genscript. 10 XPBS and Tween-20 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lambda exonuclease and buffers were purchased from New England Biolabs. Mag-Bind Total Pure NGS beads were purchased from Omega-Biotek. Bioanalyzers and all reagents, Bravo liquid handler, and Herculase II Phusion polymerase and buffers were purchased from Agilent. Tubes, plates and thermocyclers were purchased from Eppendorf. Nunc plates were purchased from VWR. 70% and absolute ethanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Nuclease-free Water, MgCl 2Bovine serum albumin, dNTP mix, Dynabeads M280 streptavidin, and quinbit reagent were purchased from Thermo Scientific.
Method
In this example, aptamers specific for the dipeptide proline-proline (PP) were isolated using the N-terminal amino acid SELEX method (fig. 41). 12 selections were run in parallel against a total of 5 targets (2 targets of interest and 3 control targets). Run 3 selections for each target of interest and 2 selections for each control target. All positive selection rounds were sequenced and used for enrichment analysis across rounds and targets. Furthermore, automation is used in several steps to ensure that potential errors across samples are minimized and to facilitate run-parallel selection. For this experiment, the dipeptide PP was chosen as the N-terminal dipeptide of interest because its bulky cyclic side chain allows for multiple potential binding sites. The PP target is a 10-mer peptide with a region of two prolines and 8 other amino acids at the N-terminus ("backbone"), followed by C-terminal coupled biotin (biotinylated target) or DNA tail (PoC target). To improve the chance of isolating aptamers specific for N-terminal PP dipeptides, both "switch" and "no switch" targets were utilized, with multiple selections for each. For PP targets with a C backbone ("no switching"), the target is referred to as PP-C, or for PP targets with a D backbone ("no switching"), as PP-D. If two targets are used in the selection ("switching"), they are called PPCD.
Target-bead coupling
Target-bead couplingPerformed freshly before each round of incubation. Biotinylated peptide targets were coupled to M280 streptavidin beads using an Agilent Bravo liquid operating platform. For each coupling reaction, the beads were vortexed to homogenize, and then 25uL of beads were added to a suitable volume of 75ng of peptide target. The beads and target were incubated on a cold plate (4 ℃) for 2 minutes to allow biotin and streptavidin to interact and form a tight bond, and then the beads were treated with SELEX buffer (1 XPBS, 0.025% Tween-20, 0.1mg/mL BSA, 1mM MgCl2) And (5) cleaning for several times. The final product of the bead coupling reaction was resuspended in 50uL of SELEX buffer.
Negative SELEX
DNA aptamer generation was performed using a protocol involving an aptamer in solution and a biotinylated target coupled to streptavidin beads. Removal of library stock 1015Initial library of aptamers and negative selection for 30 min against 10mg/mL streptavidin beads in 50ul SELEX buffer. The supernatant was retained and placed directly in positive selection for the peptide target. This positive selection is the first step of a 5-round SELEX using the following workflow: selection, amplification (small-scale PCR and large-scale PCR), and single-strand generation.
Positive SELEX
Before each selection step, aptamers were placed in refolding buffer (1 × PBS, 0.025% Tween-20, 1mM MgCl2) Annealing at 95 ℃ for 5 minutes and incubating at Room Temperature (RT) between 22 and 24 ℃ for at least 30 minutes. Selection was performed by spinning in SELEX buffer for 30 minutes (negative selection) or 1 hour (positive selection). The stringency of each round is reported in table 2.1 for "switch" and "no switch".
TABLE 2.1 stringency as a function of run and target type
Number of rounds | "No handover" stringency | "switching" | Switching framework | |

3 | 1:5 | 1:2 | |

The amplification is carried out in two steps: small-scale PCR and large-scale PCR. After washing away the non-binders, the remaining target-aptamer conjugates were placed directly in small scale PCR reactions, 1 reaction per sample (50 uL). PCR reaction conditions included all DNA retained from the wash step, 3uM forward primer, 3uM reverse primer, Herculase buffer, 0.2mM DNTP, 0.0.5 units/L Herculase polymerase, for a final volume of 50 uL.
After the PCR reaction was cleaned, an aliquot of the product was placed in a large scale PCR and 24 reactions of 50uL each were performed. The goal of this large scale PCR is to amplify as much DNA as possible without introducing excessive PCR bias. PCR reaction conditions included 0.17ng DNA, 6uM forward primer, 6uM reverse primer, 1 XHerculase buffer, 0.2mM DNTP, 0.5 units/uL Herculase polymerase, and a final volume of 50 uL.
Both small and large scale PCR were performed using Mastercycler Nexus using the following conditions: 95 ℃ 5min, 95 ℃ 30 seconds, 55 ℃ 30 seconds and 72 ℃ 30 seconds 13 cycles, and 72 ℃ 5 minutes. PCR reactions Using products from Omega Bio-Tek
To generate single stranded DNA from large scale PCR products, digestion with lambda exonuclease was performed at optimized times. Digestion was followed qualitatively using a bioanalyzer. The cleaned digesta was quantified and used as input for the next selection.
NGS preparation and sequencing
Samples after SELEX rounds were prepared for sequencing. The samples were normalized to a concentration of 10 ng/ul. 50ul PCR reactions (2ul of 6.25uM forward and reverse primers, 10ul of 10ng/ul DNA sample, 36ul master mix) were set up for each sample to amplify DNA and were performed using Mastercycler Nexus (PCR conditions: 98 ℃ for 5 minutes, 98 ℃ for 30 seconds, 65 ℃ for 30 seconds, 72 ℃ for 10 cycles of 30 seconds, and 72 ℃ for 5 min). After the reaction, the PCR product was cleaned (Agilent Bravo liquid operating platform). The size of the PCR product was then quantified using Tapestation to determine if the PCR reaction was successful. The sample should have a DNA size of 170-190 bp. The concentration of PCR products was determined using the qubit dsDNA assay. The PCR products were then pooled in tubes according to the concentration of each product. The concentration of the pooled products was determined using the qubit dsDNA assay. The PCR product was purified by selecting a DNA size of 177bp (Pippin Prep system, Sage Science). The concentration of the purified product was determined using the qubit dsDNA assay. After purification, 10uL of purified product was finally sent to NGS sequencing.
Analysis of
A rapid increase in enrichment of all targets was observed from round 2 to round 3 and reached a plateau from round 3 to round 5 (fig. 42). In addition, log enrichment values around 3.5, 3.2, and 3.0 were observed for aptamers that bound to bradykinin, PP-C, and PP-CD targets, respectively, indicating that these targets have putative binders (FIG. 43A). To further examine these binders, top 10 binders obtained from enrichment for each replicate for each target were extracted (fig. 43B). The enriched clustering of binders for each target between experimental replicates indicates that the selection of these targets is separating binders of interest. Further analysis of experimental replicates of binders against target showed that there was overall little overlap between binders in the different replicates (fig. 44). Due to the size of the initial random pool, there is little chance of the same sequence being present in different experimental replicates or for different targets, indicating that they are instead contaminating sequences, allowing these potential contaminating sequences to be filtered out prior to testing. These candidates were further filtered down to a short list of candidates to test for binding properties in vitro.
In order to identify the final aptamer sequence for sufficient characterization, two filtration steps were performed. Candidate aptamers from the PP-CD target with high enrichment (greater than 2, which correlates with at least a 100-fold increase from R2 to R5) and selective binding to PP-CD (binders that do not bind to other targets) were selected. Candidate sequences were filtered to yield 26 candidates, 10 of which were selected for final testing. These 10 final candidates were selected on the basis of various factors: the highest enrichment ratio, total sequencing counts, representativeness within each selection replicate, and zero sequence contamination in the selection replicates.
Enrichment calculations (formula defining growth and penalized growth):
the number of occurrences of a given aptamer sequence in the sequencing dataset is the aptamer count. Two rounds of "pre" and "post" SELEX were defined as subsets of the sequencing data to follow unique aptamer sequences. "front" is the subset from round 2 and "rear" is the subset from round 5. Applying a logarithmic scaling factor to each aptamer count to accommodate from 0 to 105Wide range of aptamer counts of (a):
front log10(front)ct+1)
After log10(afterct+1)
Growth is defined as the enrichment of a given aptamer between the "front" round (round 2) and the "back" round (round 5).
Growth after-before log10[ (front)ct+ 1)/(rearct+1)]
The original penalty value penalizing sequences with low count numbers in both rounds 2 and 5 is calculated, multiplied by a factor γ and applied to the growth factor by subtracting the product of γ and the original penalty.
γ＝1.26

Coupling of 200pmol peptide (PP-C, PP-D) to 100uL Dynabeads was performed according to the manufacturer's protocolTMM-280 streptavidin (Thermo Scientific) and resuspended to the original concentration in SELEX buffer. 5mg fluorescein biotin (Biotinium, #80019) was resuspended in DMSO. Coupling of 650pmol fluorescein Biotin to 100uL Dynabeads was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol TMM-280 chainAvidin (Thermo Scientific) was used as a positive control and resuspended to the original concentration. 5' end FAM-labeled aptamer candidates #1-10 were purchased from IDT. Aptamers were synthesized using forward and reverse primer complements and tested to have full length. The full sequence of each aptamer is as follows: 5 '-TTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGA-N40-TTCTGTCGTCCAGTCTGATGTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 42). The N40 sequences of the aptamers tested are reported in table 2.2.
Table 2.2 aptamer candidate sequences tested
Peptide-coupled beads were diluted to 0.03mg/mL or 1:320 of the original concentration for use in the binding assay. 100uL of diluted peptide-coupled beads or fluorescein-coupled beads were aliquoted into each well of a 96-well plate. The plate was placed on a magnetic rack for 2 minutes and the supernatant removed. To appropriate wells 100uL of 5' end FAM-labeled aptamer candidates diluted in SELEX buffer at different concentrations (0, 100nM, 250nM, 500nM, 750nM, 1uM, 2.5uM, 5uM, 10uM, 20uM) were added. The plates were sealed with plate sealer (AB 0558 adhesive PCR film, ThermoFisher) and spun in the dark at room temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, the seals were removed and the beads were washed 3 times with 100uL of SELEX buffer and resuspended in 100uL of SELEX buffer. The beads were transferred to a black plate and single endpoint fluorescence readings were measured using a plate reader (Biotek).
Note that this is a binding assay performed to measure KdA method of (1). Other methods of producing even more accurate measurements include: micro-scale thermophoresis, biolayer interferometry, flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance.
Part E: n-terminal SELEX results
By the above-mentioned plate-based KdMeasurement methods test aptamers. At a single concentration (100nM), 7 aptamers showed higher fluorescence signals to the target PP-D compared to the control (no aptamer, buffer only). 1 aptamer showed higher fluorescence for the target PP-C compared to the controlSignal (fig. 45). Two aptamers, aptamer 1 and aptamer 4, were selected for further testing. Aptamer 1 showed possible saturation binding to PP-C, but no specific binding to PP-D (FIG. 46A). Aptamer 4 showed saturating binding to PP-D but no binding to PP-C (FIG. 46B).
FThe method comprises the following steps: general purposeSELEXScheme(s)
Various different methods are listed above that are used, optimized and utilized to obtain aptamer conjugates from SELEX results, however, for SELEX described herein: (1) for each application of RCHT-SELEX or (2) N-terminal conjugate aptamers using NTAA-SELEX for ML analysis, there are different combinations of methods used. The following is a template scheme that can be used to decipher the combination of desired methods.
The overall work flow is as follows:
1.negative selection
2.Bead coupling
3.Amplification of
4.Single-stranded Generation/antisense digestion of incubations
5.Incubation with air
6.Amplification from incubated beads
7.Threshold amplification
8.Single-stranded generation/antisense digestion of threshold amplicons
9.Counter selection
The equipment scheme is as follows:
1, Qubit: the Qubit was used to measure the DNA concentration according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Bravo: three types of protocols were run on a Bravo liquid manipulator: (1) PCR clean ("bulk" and "variable volume"), (2) bead coupling ("bead coupling"), and (3) bead wash ("SELEX post wash but not elution"). For PCR cleaning, Bravo was programmed to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for using Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS. For bead coupling, Bravo was programmed to comply with the manufacturer's use of DynabeadsTMM-280 streptavidin. Incubation time and buffer were optimized for the coupled peptides. For bead washing, Bravo was programmed to the peptide beads (atAfter incubation with aptamer) 3 washes were performed. The plates were incubated on a magnet for 2 minutes. The first two washes were performed using SELEX buffer and the last wash was performed using 1x PBS. After the last wash, the beads were not resuspended but left in the plate for the next step of the SELEX protocol.
3. A biological analyzer: two types of protocols were run on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer with 2100Expert software. Library quality checks and post-PCR quality checks were performed using high sensitivity DNA chips using high sensitivity DNA protocols according to the manufacturer's instructions. Digestion/single strand production quality checks were performed using small RNA chips, following the manufacturer's instructions using small RNA II series protocols.

Technical terms:
fwd RC: the reverse complement of the 5' end of the forward aptamer. This is a mimetic of the bridge used in BCS, as it doublestrands the 5' end of the aptamer.
POC: peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates: this is SELEXTargetI.e. the substance for which the aptamer binding agent we are looking for. POC was generated from the 10-mer peptide and the 41nt ssDNA tail.
bt peptide oligonucleotide complement: also known asPeptide primer, biotinylated primer, DNA tail complement, blocking sheet Segment of. This fragment is the complement of the ssDNA "tail" region of the peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate (POC). This fragment has biotin on the 3' side to bind to the streptavidin bead and is a complete "blocker" of the oligonucleotide tail of POC. It was incubated with POC at a ratio of 2:1, and then the target was incubated with the aptamer.
Tail part: refers to the DNA tail coupled to the peptide in PoC (but can be used alone without the peptide attached).
Framework: also known asSuffix. This is the 8-mer region on the dipeptide target (both biotinylated and PoC) between the N-terminal dipeptide and the C-terminal coupled biotin (biotinylated target) or DNA tail (PoC target). The skeleton is named according to the following convention: [ Alphabet ]]' (e.g., C ' or D ').
Stringency: this corresponds to the target: the proportion of aptamers. For example, a stringency of 1:10 means that 10 aptamer sequences are present per 1 target, whereas a stringency of 10:1 means that 10 targets are present per 1 aptamer. 10:1 is not very tight, whereas 1:100 is very tight.
Positive selection: aptamers were incubated with their targets, pulled down, and the selection of the supernatant (containing non-binders) was discarded.
Negative selection: aptamers were incubated against random surfaces (tube sidewalls, beads, etc.) and the selection of the supernatant (containing sequences that did not bind to random surfaces) was retained.
And (3) reverse selection: aptamers are incubated against substances that closely resemble the target (e.g., different dipeptides or just the backbone) and the selection of the supernatant is retained.

6. The supernatant (. about.200 uL) was removed and transferred to a new tube.
7. The DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit ssDNA kit. Typical expected concentrations are in the range of 8-20 ng/uL.
Bead coupling
The purpose is as follows: biotinylated peptide targets were coupled to streptavidin beads, which magnetically pulled down the aptamer binders during incubation.
Note: the peptide-bead conjugates can be pre-manufactured and aliquoted in 96-well eppendorf plates for freezing (up to 1 freeze-thaw cycle), or manufactured for fresh use prior to each incubation.
1. The stock peptide was diluted to the appropriate concentration so that the peptide and beads could be combined at a ratio of 200pmol peptide target to 1mg Dynabeads M280 beads (following the manufacturer's protocol).
2. Corresponding amounts of peptide and water were pipetted into each well of a 96-well eppendorf plate to a volume of 50 uL.
3. The corresponding amount of M280 streptavidin beads was pipetted into the NUNC plate, filling only the wells to be used.
4. The "bead coupling" protocol was run using a liquid manipulator. This performs the incubation, mixing and washing steps defined by the manufacturer.
5. The peptide beads were diluted to appropriate stringency, divided into aliquots and stored at-20 ℃.
Amplification (cultivation)
The purpose is as follows: multiple copies of each aptamer of the negatively selected library were generated.
1. The master mix was prepared using a 50mL conical tube. Master mix: 3uM forward primer, 3uM reverse primer, Herculase buffer, 0.2mM dNTP, 0.5 units/uL Herculase polymerase in 16000uL final volume (this is a total of 320 reactions, each reaction 50 uL). Each 50uL reaction should have 0.17ng DNA.
2. The master mix was aliquoted into 3 96-well plates, each reacting at 50 uL.
3. The 96-well plate was sealed and placed in a thermal cycler using the following PCR protocol: 95 ℃ for 5min, (95 ℃ 30sec, 55 ℃ 30sec, 72 ℃ 30sec) x 13 cycles, 72 ℃ for 5min, maintained at 4 ℃.
4. 3 plates were combined in 1 plate of 150uL reaction.

7. The concentration of double-stranded DNA was measured using a QuBit dsDNA kit to check the concentration. Typically, the concentration is in the range of 40-90 ng/uL.
Single chain production (digestion of culture)
The purpose is as follows: the antisense strand of double-stranded DNA was digested with lambda exonuclease. In order for an aptamer to bind to a target, ssDNA must be generated.
1. Single-stranded generation reactions were set up according to the instructions of the manufacturer of lambda exonuclease (M0262, NEB) (for a 50uL reaction, up to 5ug DNA, 5uL 10 × reaction buffer, 1uL lambda exonuclease and up to 50uL H2O). First to the DNA add 10x reaction buffer, vortex and mix. Next λ was added and mixed by pipetting.
2. The reaction was incubated at 37 ℃ for 10-20 minutes depending on the DNA input concentration.
3. The exonuclease was heat inactivated by incubation at 72 ℃ for 10 minutes, kept at 4 ℃.
4. After digestion the quality of the DNA was checked by running the DNA product on a bioanalyzer small RNA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. If the trace shows that double stranded product is still present, lambda exonuclease is added in the same amount as the original reaction and incubation at 37 ℃ is extended for 5-10 minutes. The quality is checked again.
5. DNA was pooled in 1 plate and cleaned on a liquid manipulator using a "variable volume" protocol. This used Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads according to the manufacturer's protocol.
6. The DNA concentration was checked using the quibit ssDNA kit. Usually the concentration is around 30ng/ul or higher.
PoC target incubation-without bead coupling
The purpose is as follows: the aptamer library is incubated with the target to see which aptamers bind to the target.
This incubation was used only for the PoC target, where PoC was exposed to the aptamer, then the beads were reintroduced and pulled down. For any protocol using bead coupling, biotinylated target incubation is used.

6. Non-specifically bound or unbound DNA was washed off the target beads using a liquid manipulator (protocol: "Wash but not elute").
Biotinylated target incubation-coupling Using beads
The purpose is as follows: our aptamer library was incubated with the target to see which aptamers bound to the target.
This incubation protocol should be used for any target (biotinylated or PoC) coupled to the beads prior to the start of SELEX. Note that in this protocol the aptamer was exposed to both the target and the bead, as opposed to the "PoC target incubation" protocol, where PoC was exposed to the aptamer, which was then reintroduced into the bead and pulled down.
1. Will input ssDNA (10)15Individual molecules) in refolding solution (1 XPBS, 0.025% Tween-20, 1mM MgCl2，NF H2O) in the solvent. The total volume was 150 uL.
2. Annealing (refolding aptamer): heated to 95 ℃ for 5 minutes and cooled on the bench for 30 minutes.
3. The frozen bead conjugate plates were thawed and modified SELEX buffer (1 XPBS, 0.025% Tween-20, 1mM MgCl) was added 2，0.16mg/mL BSA，NF H2O) to a total volume of 250 uL.
4. 150uL of the cooled ssDNA in refolding solution was combined with 250uL of bead target conjugate in modified SELEX buffer in a total volume of 400uL and spun-incubated for 1 hour in sealed NUNC plates.
5. Non-specifically bound or unbound DNA was washed off the target beads using a liquid manipulator (protocol: "Wash but not elute").
Amplification (PCR from beads [ PoB ])
The purpose is as follows: aptamers that bind to the target are amplified using PCR. At this point, the aptamer remains bound to the target and all non-specific DNA has been washed away.
1. The master mix (3. mu.M forward primer, 3. mu.M reverse primer, Herculase buffer, 0.2mM DNTP, 0.5 units/. mu.L Herculase polymerase, final volume 50. mu.L) was added to the wells immediately after the washing protocol was finished to avoid drying of the beads.
2. Transferred to an Eppendorf low binding 96 well plate, sealed and placed in a thermocycler using the following PCR protocol: 95 ℃ for 5min, (95 ℃ 30sec, 55 ℃ 30sec, 72 ℃ 30sec) x 13 cycles, 72 ℃ for 5min, maintained at 4 ℃.
3. Cleaning was performed on a liquid manipulator using a "variable volume" protocol.
4. The concentration of double-stranded DNA was measured using a QuBit dsDNA kit on a plate reader to check the concentration. Typical concentrations are in the range of 4-20 ng/uL.
Threshold PCR
For purposes, aptamer libraries were amplified using protected primers (forward primer with 6 thiol sulfates and reverse primer with 5' phosphate).
1. The master mix was prepared using a 50mL conical tube. Master mix: 3u M forward primer, 3uM reverse primer, Herculase buffer, 0.2mM dNTP, 0.5 units/u L Herculase polymerase, the final volume is 16000uL (this is a total of 320 reactions, each reaction 50 uL).
2. 1:10 dilutions of PoB DNA were made and input concentrations were normalized by pipetting 0.17ng dsDNA per 50uL reaction. Stock solutions for each sample were prepared by adding 4.3ng dsDNA, 300uL H2O, and 954uL master mix to each well. Each sample stock solution was aliquoted into 50uL of each reaction.
3. The plate was sealed and placed in a thermal cycler using the following PCR protocol: 95 ℃ for 5min, (95 ℃ 30sec, 55 ℃ 30sec, 72 ℃ 30sec) x 13 cycles, 72 ℃ for 5min, maintained at 4 ℃.
4. The DNA was cleaned on a liquid manipulator using a "bulk" protocol.
5. The concentration of double-stranded DNA was measured using a QuBit dsDNA kit on a plate reader to check the concentration. Typically, the concentration is in the range of 30-90 ng/uL.
Single strand regeneration (digestion of threshold PCR product)
The purpose is as follows: ssDNA was generated for the next round of SELEX. This needs to be done as multiple reactions, since each selection has a different DNA concentration.
1. The single strand generation reaction was set up according to the instructions of the manufacturer of lambda exonuclease (M0262, NEB) (for a 50uL reaction, up to 5ug DNA, 5uL 10 Xreaction buffer, 1uL lambda exonuclease and up to 50uL H were used2O). First to the DNA add 10x reaction buffer, vortex and mix. Next lambda was added and mixed by pipetting.
2. The reaction was incubated at 37 ℃ for 10-20 minutes depending on the DNA input concentration. Reactions were grouped on different plates according to reaction time.
3. The exonuclease was heat inactivated by incubation at 72 ℃ for 10 minutes, kept at 4 ℃.
4. After digestion the quality of the DNA was checked by running the DNA product on a bioanalyzer small RNA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. If the trace shows that double stranded product is still present, the same amount of lambda exonuclease as the original reaction is added and the incubation at 37 ℃ is extended by 5-10 minutes. The quality is checked again.
5. DNA was pooled on one plate and cleaned using a "variable volume" protocol. This used Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads according to the manufacturer's protocol.
6. The DNA concentration was checked using the quibit ssDNA kit. Typically, the concentration is around 30ng/uL or higher.
Counter selection
The purpose is as follows: the target is incubated against other targets that are closely similar in one or more respects to the target to ensure that the enriched aptamers are specific and actually bind to the target itself. This is very similar to the positive selection, except that the target is different and there is no "wash but not elute" step.
1. Depending on the experiment, aptamers were refolded and incubations were established following the PoC or biotinylated incubation steps listed above.
2. After incubation, the plate was placed on a magnet for 2 minutes to allow all beads to be aggregated by the magnet.
3. The supernatant was removed from each well and stored in a clean eppendorf 96 well PCR plate.
4. The DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit ssDNA kit.
NGS preparation
PoB DNA from round 2 onwards was sequenced. Samples were prepared using the NextSeq protocol (NGS preparation).
The other scheme is as follows:
post-digestion bioanalyzer examination (small RNA kit):
the goal of the bioanalyzer test was to verify that dsDNA from the incubation/threshold PCR had been efficiently digested to ssDNA by lambda exonuclease. The small RNA kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
To analyze the results of the bioanalyzer assay, the locations of ssDNA and dsDNA peaks were found. ssDNA peaks at 60 seconds and dsDNA peaks at 40 seconds. If concatemers are present, they are observed at 55-65 seconds (broad, non-uniform peak). When a spike is seen at 60 seconds, digestion is complete. An exemplary electropherogram is shown in fig. 47.
dsDNA bioanalyzer examination
The purpose of this bioanalyzer test is to evaluate the quality of dsDNA after PCR/incubation + clean based on size (base size). We used a high sensitivity DNA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
To analyze the results of this assay, the lower marker at 35bp and the upper marker at 10380bp were searched. The aptamer length was checked for a match to the expected library length (86 bp in this example). An exemplary electropherogram is shown in fig. 48.
Example 3 PROSEQ experiment
The following will be described below:
part A: ProSeq experimental method
And part B: ProSeq results
Part C: generic ProSeq scheme
Part A: ProSeq experimental method
Reagent
Aptamer and substrate oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT or through K&A
Method
Protein sequencing
Building and fixing a substrate to a solid substrate
The core sequencing unit consists of 4 independent DNA fragments: a 5 ' phosphorylated barcode substrate (BF), forward and reverse co-localized linkers (FC and RC) and a protein or Peptide Target (PT) with a C-terminal oligonucleotide sequence tag attached to the protein or peptide at the 3 ' end and having a free phosphorylated 5 ' end orientation. The 5 ' end of the BF sequence is complementary to the 5 ' end of FC to allow hybridization, while the 3 ' end of BF contains a unique barcode (for sample multiplexing or related PT identification) and a short consensus sequence complementary to the bridge sequence to facilitate aptamer ligation to BF. The FC contains a BF complementary region at the 5 'terminus, followed by a sequence complementary to the glass-bound oligonucleotide, followed by a flexible T-spacer, and a short high GC content sequence complementary to RC at the 3' terminus. In turn, the 3 'end of the RC is complementary to the 3' end of the FC, followed by a long T-spacer, followed by a sequence complementary to the glass-bound oligonucleotide, followed by a sequence complementary to the PT-bound oligonucleotide. Likewise, prior to attaching PT to the 3 ' end, the 5 ' end of the PT oligonucleotide is complementary to the 5 ' end of the RC, followed by a spacer (fig. 49).
These four fragments were then pooled and hybridized in solution, allowing PT to be linked to a unique BF by FC and RC, allowing PT identification (in the case of validation and inclusion controls) or sample de-multiplexing (in the case of multiple peptide pools being sequenced simultaneously). After hybridization, the four-component complexes were incubated on oligonucleotide-seeded glass substrates. FC and RC are hybridized to the glass-bound oligonucleotide, and BF and PT oligonucleotides are covalently linked to the glass-bound oligonucleotide by ligation (in this case "gap repair" ligation) by the addition of DNA ligase. In this way, the BF-PT pairs are co-located and spatially separated from all other BF-PT pairs to ensure that binding events for a given PT are confined to a single BF. Furthermore, covalent attachment of BF and PT to glass facilitates BF and PT to remain co-localized after multiple rounds of PT sequencing despite the harsh reagents required for PT degradation. Once BF and PT were covalently attached to the glass-bound oligonucleotide, formamide was used to wash away the forward and reverse co-localized linkers annealed to BF and PT.
Aptamer incubation
After covalent attachment of BF and PT to the substrate, the sequencing process was started as follows: the first BCS-compatible aptamer pool was incubated, and then unbound aptamer was washed away and ligase was added to covalently link the aptamer to BF. This cycle of incubation and ligation is performed multiple times, with ligation occurring after each incubation or after all aptamer pools have been introduced. The single-stranded aptamer pool is incubated with a bridge oligonucleotide to form a library of BCS-compatible aptamers prior to incubating the peptide target with the aptamers. It should be noted that only a single barcode is recorded between cycles of restriction digestion (described below). After ligation, restriction enzymes (and excess sequence complementary to the restriction sites and spacers) were introduced to cleave the peptide binding sequence of the aptamer from the aptamer barcode on the 5' end, leaving only the aptamer barcode and a short consensus sequence for subsequent ligation attached to the BF. After restriction, PT is gradually degraded from the N-terminus using Edman degradation, aminopeptidase or any other processive degradation process. Obviously, the technique of constructing barcode sequences encoding aptamers can be applied equally to C-terminal to N-terminal peptide or protein sequencing, since the barcode sequence synthesis process is independent of the orientation of PT on its oligonucleotide tether. In addition, multiple rounds of aptamer incubation, ligation and restriction can be used to interrogate the same N-terminal amino acid sequence multiple times prior to PT degradation, thereby more accurately identifying the N-terminal composition.
After degradation, another pool of aptamers was incubated and the process repeated. Aptamers in each round contain unique barcodes (even when the peptide binding sequences are identical) so that missed incorporation events (e.g., apparent deletions) can be easily identified and interpreted in subsequent data analysis steps.
DNA barcode construct sequencing
The final step in the sequencing process is the addition of PCR or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) adapters. The same consensus and bridge sequences were used to attach linkers to the 3' end of the aptamer barcode sequence, which represents a series of aptamer binding events, and was used to sequence PT. The barcode construct is amplified from the chip using the glass-bound oligonucleotide sequence and/or the 5' sequence of BF as one primer and the PCR/NGS linker as another primer and sequenced using standard NGS techniques, or directly amplified and sequenced on the NGS flowcell without further processing in the case where the NGS sequencing flowcell serves as a PT sequencing platform and the NGS linker is of a suitable design.
Sup-Diff
Priori Sup-Diff
Biotinylated RNA decoy production
A priori Sup-Diff is performed on pools of BCS barcode constructs. The preliminary NGS dataset revealed sequences with high read counts as targets for stripping by Sup-Diff. The target was made separately from the other pool constituents by IDT or by an internal K & A H8 DNA synthesizer. PCR was performed on the target sequence using a standard forward primer and a reverse primer containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The PCR product was cleaned (1-2 ug) following an automated Bravo wash protocol and then used as a template to generate complementary biotinylated RNA decoys by in vitro transcription in a 20ul TranscriptAID T7 high yield transcription kit (Thermo Scientific) reaction containing 10mM ATP, CTP and GTP, 7.5mM UTP and 2.5mM biotin-16-UTP (Roche). After 4-6 hours at 37 ℃, the DNA template and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by DNase I (NEB) treatment and RNeasy mini kit column filtration (Qiagen).
In solution hybridization and bead pulldown
The mixture containing the target pool and nuclease-free water was heated at 95 ℃ for 5 minutes, cooled on ice for 2min, and then mixed with biotinylated RNA decoy and SUPERAse In RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen) In pre-warmed (65 ℃) 2 Xhybridization buffer (10 XSSPE, 10 XDenhardt's, 10mM EDTA and 0.2% SDS). After 16 hours at 65 ℃, the hybridization mixture was added to MyOne C1 streptavidin dynabeads (invitrogen) washed three times and resuspended in 2X B & W buffer (10mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1mM EDTA, 2M NaCl). After 30 minutes at RT, the beads were pulled down and the supernatant retained.
Soup processing and sequencing
The supernatant ("broth") was treated with a mixture of RNase H (NEB) and RNase A (Zymo) for 30 min at 37 ℃. The treated ssDNA is then amplified for 18 or more cycles. The initial denaturation was 95 ℃ for 5 min. Each cycle was 95 ℃ for 30 seconds, 55 ℃ for 30 seconds and 72 ℃ for 30 seconds. The final extension was 5min at 72 ℃. The Bravo washed PCR products were then subjected to NGS preparation for sequencing on Illumina Miseq using custom primers.
Sup-Diff without prior
There may also be situations where a non-a priori version of the Sup-Diff may be required. In this case, the sample from the target pool can be used as a template for In Vitro Transcription (IVT). As proof of concept, IVT optimization was performed to bias the decoy representations in the RNA decoy pool towards high abundance species.
RNA decoy pool production
A gradient (mass%) of the SELEX incorporation sequence was generated: sequence 9 (0.000125%), sequence 13 (0.01%), sequence 11 (1%), sequence 12 (10%), sequence 10 (88.98%). This ssDNA gradient pool was used as template in a 20ul TranscriptAId T7 high yield transcription kit (Thermo Scientific) reaction containing 0.1mM, 0.25mM, 1mM, 2.5mM, or 10mM rNTP (without biotinylated UTP). After 4-6 hours at 37 ℃, the DNA template and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by DNase I (NEB) treatment and RNeasy mini kit column filtration (Qiagen).
Reverse transcription
The purified decoy pool of RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA using a Maxima reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher). 28ul initial reaction containing 500ng RNA bait pool, 15-20pmol TriLink forward primer, 0.5mM dNTP equimolar mixture and nuclease free water, at 65 ℃ temperature in 5 min. Then 8ul of 5 XTRT buffer, 2ul SUPERAse In RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen) and 2ul Maxima RT were added and the reaction was incubated at 50 ℃ for 30min and then heat inactivated at 85 ℃ for 5 min. The resulting cDNA pool was treated with a mixture of RNase H (NEB) and RNase A (Zymo) for 30min at 37 ℃.
Amplification and sequencing
The treated ssDNA is then amplified for 13 or more cycles. The initial denaturation was 95 ℃ for 5 min. Each cycle was 95 ℃ for 30 seconds, 55 ℃ for 30 seconds and 72 ℃ for 30 seconds. The final extension was 5min at 72 ℃. The Bravo washed PCR products were then subjected to NGS preparation for sequencing on Illumina Miseq using custom primers. A 41x8x6 read out was performed using Miseq V2 Nano kit.
And part B: ProSeq results
Results-conceptual verification of barcode sequence Synthesis
As a proof of concept for the synthesis of DNA barcodes representing a sequence of binding events, and thus a hypothetical amino acid sequence of the protein or peptide to be sequenced, a barcode synthesis process was performed using a "mock aptamer" DNA-DNA binding (e.g., hybridization) system. In this way, the uncertainty of binding kinetics and binder-target specificity is reduced to produce an "ideal" binder-target system in which to validate the sequential barcode addition strategy. In addition, these DNA-DNA conjugates can be used as internal controls in future experiments to assess overall performance quality.
Using this idealized platform with barcode-specific bridges, up to 12 cycles of aptamer barcoding and restriction were performed with efficiencies of up to 63.8% based on the number of perfect 12/12 reads, and up to 75.5% per cycle for 3 cycles of barcode incorporation (fig. 50A). This is consistent with the current estimates of efficiency for each step, where the assumed efficiency of correct binder-target interaction is-90%, the efficiency of target-bound aptamers to ligation with their associated barcode sequences is > 99%, and the limited efficiency is estimated (conserved) to be 85%. In idealized conditions on the platform, restriction enzyme efficiency was measured to be > 95%, meaning that barcode incorporation efficiency per cycle should be above 90% if the binding specificity is moderately improved (to 95% accuracy) in the case of a complete sequencing cycle and the restriction conditions are idealized.
The universal bridge was used to design 5' CTGCGCCTATACGAATTCGTTATC # ######### CTCTCCGTTATC (SEQ ID NO: 53), where each # is a 5-nitroindole, three of the three consecutive barcode connections achieved the correct order and orientation, with an estimated efficiency of 71% per cycle (fig. 50B). In the same experiment, > 36% of the reads associated with the unique substrate (substrate 11) contained all three aptamer barcodes in the correct order, confirming that continuous ligation and restriction is possible using a universal bridge.
Results-proof of concept for peptide target identification
Preliminary results using aptamers with binding sequences derived from the RCHT-SELEX assay for biologically relevant 10-mer peptides show that in a given pool of SELEX-derived sequences, binders with affinities in the sub-nanomolar range are present.
Initial evidence of aptamer specific binding to the 10-mer arginine vasopressin peptide is shown in the combination of RCHT-SELEX and PROSEQ conditions. When a library of promising aptamers to arginine vasopressin was incubated in solution with substrates attached to arginine vasopressin, bradykinin, DD, DNA or unattached targets (empty controls), the barcodes of promising bradykinin aptamers were linked to all types of arginine vasopressin-linked barcode substrates and to barcode substrates without DD-linkage (fig. 51). The sequence of the top-ranked specific arginine vasopressin aptamer with a DNA barcode tail is:
·/5Phos/GAGAGTAAAGCCGATAGGATAACGAATTCGTATAGGCGCAGGATGGACTTGATAACCTTCTGCTGCGTGCCTTGATGTGCTTACTTGGCGTTCTTACCACCA(SEQ ID NO：54)
·/5Phos/GAGAGTTAGTCAGCAGGGATAACGAATTCGTATAGGCGCAGCATTTGATTCTGCTGCGTGCATACCCCTGTGTGTTATCCCTACTTGGCGTTCTTACCACCA(SEQ ID NO：55)
·/5Phos/GAGAGTCCACGTGCACAGATAACGAATTCGTATAGGCGCAGCATACATCGGACATACATCCTGCGTGCATCCACCTTTGCATACTTGGCGTTCTTACCACCA(SEQ ID NO：56)
The barcodes of all three aptamers described above had more than 100 hits on all different arginine vasopressin substrates and no off-target hits. This data indicates that arginine vasopressin aptamers derived from the RCHT-SELEX method preferentially bind arginine vasopressin over DD peptide and bradykinin. They also did not bind to oligonucleotides attached to all targets, as indicated by the lack of counts of arginine vasopressin aptamer barcodes against empty substrates. Furthermore, although aptamers isolated in RCHT-SELEX do not have the aptamer barcodes necessary for compatibility with PROSEQ, specificity is retained after the aptamer tail sequence is added to the 5' end.
Results-degradation
Preliminary studies on Edman degradation of biologically relevant peptides (bradykinin) immobilized to glass substrates by oligonucleotides showed that the oligonucleotide tether was stable (e.g. antibody staining showed strong signals both before and after degradation). Furthermore, after multiple cycles of Edman degradation, the signal from antibody staining decreased but did not completely disappear, indicating that the peptide remained in place after TFA exposure and that the decrease in signal was due to loss of antibody binding due to amino acid cleavage (figure 52).
results-Sup-Diff
Preliminary data on IVT optimization show that the no-a-priori Sup-Diff method is promising. Pools of RNA decoys were generated from target pools with the following distribution using a standard 10mM rNTP IVT protocol: 89% of sequence 10, 10% of sequence 12, 1% of sequence 11, 0.01% of sequence 13 and 0.000125% of sequence 9, resulting in an RNA pool with the following composition: 81% of sequence 10, 18.5% of sequence 12, 0.6% of sequence 11, 0.008% of sequence 13 and 0.0055% of sequence 9. Migration of RNA decoy profiles was achieved with decreasing final concentration of each rNTP, resulting in increased frequency of RNA decoys for high abundance targets. From a final concentration of 10mM rNTP to a final concentration of 0.25mM rNTP, the frequency of RNA decoys for the highest concentration of target, sequence 10, increased by an average of 8.5% (fig. 53). This confirms that the distribution of RNA decoy pools produced from the target pool may be biased towards high abundance sequences, allowing preferential pulling down of high abundance material when RNA decoy pools are hybridized to the target sequence pool.
Part C: generic ProSeq scheme
The following is a template protocol used in the developmental experiments.
Technical terms
PoC (protein-oligonucleotide conjugate): a protein or peptide coupled to the 3 ' terminus of an oligonucleotide comprising a linker region, a sequence complementary to the 5 ' terminus of an inverted co-localized linker, and a 5 ' phosphate group.
RC (reverse co-localized linker): the 3 'end of the RC is complementary to the 3' end of the forward co-localized linker, followed by a flexible T-spacer, followed by a sequence complementary to the glass-bound oligonucleotide linker, followed by a sequence complementary to the oligonucleotide on PoC.
FC (forward co-localized linker): the FC comprises a substrate complementary region at the 5 'end, followed by a sequence complementary to a glass-bound oligonucleotide linker, followed by a flexible T-spacer, and a short high GC content sequence complementary to RC at the 3' end.
Substrate: an oligonucleotide comprising a barcode specific for a target and having established thereon a DNA barcode that binds to the target. The 5 ' end of the substrate sequence is complementary to the 5 ' end of the FC to allow hybridization, while the 3 ' end contains a unique barcode (for sample multiplexing or identification of the associated PT) and a short consensus sequence complementary to the bridge sequence to facilitate ligation of the binder DNA barcode to the substrate.
Co-localization construct: the complete core sequencing unit, consisting of PoC, RC, FC and substrate fragments hybridized together.
Limiting/common bridge: an oligonucleotide complementary to a restriction digest sequence in the BCS cassette. This sequence is added during the restriction digestion step to hybridize to the 5 'end of the aptamer, which is ligated to the 3' end of the substrate/previous aptamer barcode if the universal bridge has been washed away so that digestion can still occur. Improving the efficiency of the digestion reaction.

Example 4 BCS binding assay
Reagent
Aptamer-based oligonucleotides and DNA targets were purified by HPLC or PAGE and purchased from IDT. Spot-Tag and bradykinin peptide-oligonucleotide constructs were purchased from Genscript. Spot-tag Nanobodies were purchased from Chromotek. The Spot-tag nanobody-oligonucleotide conjugate was prepared using a SoluLINK protein-oligonucleotide conjugate kit. Aptamer incubation and DNA barcode sequencing were performed on a MiSeq Reagent Nano v2 kit supplemented with PhiX control v3 and sequenced on MiSeq500 (Illumina). The bound aptamers were ligated to a barcode substrate using T4 ligase (blunt end/TA master mix preparation) and cleaved with EcoRI in CutSmart buffer, all purchased from New England Biolabs. Excess aptamer and hybridization buffer were washed away with 100% formamide from Millipore Sigma. The analysis of NGS data is done using a custom analysis pipeline that is allowed on a colororary notebook environment.
Method
Coupling the Spot-Tag nano antibody to the tail of DNA
Commercially available Spot-tag Nanobodies (Chromoteks) were coupled to the 3 'end of 5' phosphorylated oligonucleotides (3'ATCCCTTCTCTTCCTGTATACTAATAGGTGCACGTAGATTC/5Phos/(SEQ ID NO: 60)) in a non-site directed manner using the SoluLINK protein-oligonucleotide coupling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The success of the Spot-tag nanobody-oligonucleotide coupling was confirmed by PAGE electrophoresis (fig. 54). The labeling of proteins is not site-directed, but can be accomplished using the sortase method. Multiple higher molecular weight bands were observed on the gel, presumably corresponding to multiple oligonucleotides coupled to a single nanobody. Importantly, these constructs are of less interest for BCS experiments because they either 1) do not function, in which case they will not bind to the Spot-Tag and be washed away, or 2) will bind to the Spot-Tag, and then any of the multiple tails can be attached to nearby substrates.
Building and fixing a substrate to a solid substrate
As a proof-of-concept experiment to verify the ability of the BCS platform to record specific binding events in complex environments, Spot-Tag-oligonucleotide conjugates (Spot-Tag. o1) and 6 other control targets were seeded on MiSeq Nano v2 sequencing chips. Another peptide target is bradykinin (brady. o1) coupled to the 5' phosphorylated DNA tail. The 2 empty targets (oligonucleotide tails without target) comprise 5 ' phosphorylated oligonucleotides (5 ' phos. o1) and oligonucleotides that lack 5 ' phosphate and therefore cannot be attached to the chip (clr. null. block). The 2 DNA controls (sp6.o1 and sp4.o1) are contiguous oligonucleotide sequences containing both a 5' phosphorylated joining region for joining to the P7 primer and a binding region for hybridization to the complementary strand, serving as positive controls (fig. 55). The binding region and DNA tail sequence for each target are reported in table 4.1.
TABLE 4.1 sequences of target and oligonucleotide tails
The C-terminus of the peptide target was directly coupled to the 3' end of a DNA tail via cysteine
Binding sequence of DNA target and DNA tail are consecutive oligonucleotides rather than coupled by another chemical coupling method.
In order to immobilize a target-oligonucleotide conjugate and a DNA barcode substrate containing a sequence indicative of its associated target to a solid substrate in proximity to each other, further assembly into a core sequencing unit is necessary. The core sequencing unit of the BCS platform consists of fragments of 4 independent DNA or oligonucleotide-conjugated molecules: a 5 ' phosphorylated barcode substrate (BF), forward and reverse co-localized linkers (FC and RC), and a target with a C-terminal oligonucleotide sequence tag (in the orientation of 3 ' end to target) and a free phosphorylated 5 ' end. The 5 ' end of the BF sequence is complementary to the 5 ' end of the FC to allow hybridization, while the 3 ' end of the BF contains a unique barcode (for sample multiplexing or identification of related targets) and a short consensus sequence complementary to the bridge sequence to facilitate ligation of the aptamer to the BF. The FC comprises a BF complementary region at the 5 'end, followed by a sequence complementary to the glass-bound oligonucleotide, followed by a flexible T-spacer, and a short high GC content sequence complementary to RC at the 3' end. In turn, the 3 'end of the RC is complementary to the 3' end of the FC, followed by a long T-spacer, followed by a sequence complementary to the glass-bound oligonucleotide, followed by a sequence complementary to the oligonucleotide coupled to the target. Likewise, the 5 ' end of the target oligonucleotide is complementary to the 5 ' end of the RC, followed by a spacer, prior to attachment of the target at the 3 ' end (fig. 49).
Each control target was tested in three replicates and the Spot-Tag was tested in six replicates. Their respective FC, RC and BF were thawed on ice, and then each set of sequencing units was pooled in 91uL of hybridization buffer (0.025% TWEEN20 in 1x PBS) in separate wells to yield 10nM FC with excess RC, BF and target. In this experiment, the same FC sequence (5 'CATCAGCTCGCAGTCGATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCAGCCACCGCCAACCATCC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 69)) and RC sequence (5 'ATTATCCACGTGCATCTAAGATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGATGGTTGGCGGTGGCTGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 70)) were used for all targets. The FC and RC are maintained in a stock solution containing FC: RC in a ratio of 3:1 in the hybridization buffer. The components were added in the order of hybridization buffer, FC and RC reservoirs and BF. Target is added to the mixture just prior to hybridization. The sequence and concentration of each set of target, FC, RC and BF are reported in table 4.2. The final proportions of the individual fragments were:
·5:1BF:FC
·3:1FC:RC
10:1 target RC
To assemble the sequencing unit, the complete mixture was mixed well, centrifuged for 30 seconds, sealed, and heated in a thermocycler using the following conditions: 5 minutes at 95 ℃, 1 minute at 85 ℃, 2 minutes at 75 ℃, 3 minutes at 65 ℃, 5 minutes at 55 ℃, 5 minutes at 45 ℃, 5 minutes at 35 ℃ and 40 minutes at 25 ℃.
TABLE 4.2 base sequence of each target replicate
Target sequences are shown in Table 4.1
Prior to inoculation of the co-localized constructs, the sequencing chip was washed twice with 100uL of hybridization buffer. The mixture of each co-localized construct was diluted to 0.5nM and 1.14uL of each mixture was combined with 10uL of 2 × blunt-ended/TA MM ligase master mix and 44uL of hybridization buffer and gently mixed to obtain a final concentration of 120pM of co-localized construct. To attach the co-localized constructs to the chip, the sequencing chip was washed twice with 30uL of substrate mix and heated on a hot plate for 15 minutes at 28 ℃. It was then washed once with 100uL 100% formamide to remove unligated co-localization constructs. The chips were heated on a hot plate again for 90 seconds at 40 ℃, washed once with 500uL of blocking buffer (0.025% TWEEN20+10mg/ml BSA in 1 XPBS), washed twice with 30uL of chip blocking solution (10uM P5 complementary oligonucleotide (5'-TCTCGGTGGTCGCCGTATCATT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 92))/P7 complementary oligonucleotide (5'-ATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 93)) sequence +10uM POC tail blocking sequence (5'-TAGGGAAGAGAAGGACATATGATTATCCACGTGCATCTAAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 94))), incubated for 15 minutes at 37 ℃ on a hot plate and washed twice with 100uL of hybridization buffer for 60 seconds each, and then immediately loaded with the prepared binder library (see barcoded binder library preparation section below).
Barcoded library preparation of binders
4 "binders" with DNA barcodes, each consisting of a binder region, a DNA spacer region, a restriction site, a DNA barcode indicating the identity of the binder region, and an attachment site, are incubated with the target. 2 DNA binders U4.SA1.3 and U4.SA2.3 contain binder regions composed of DNA complementary to SP4.O1 and SP6.O1, respectively. These binders are positive controls that should bind to sp4.o1 and sp6.o1 with high affinity and specificity. Another DNA binder, u4.sa4.2, contains a binder region consisting of disordered DNA sequences that will not bind to the target present, acting as a negative control for measuring noise. The last conjugate was a Spot-tag nanobody-oligonucleotide conjugate.
Prior to incubation, each conjugate was hybridized to a universal bridge (5 '-CTGCGCCTATAGGAATTCGTTATC/i 5NitInd// i5NitInd// i5NitInd// i5NitInd// i5NitInd// i5NitInd// i5 NitInd/GGACACGGCCGTTATC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 95)), which is an oligonucleotide complementary to the restriction site spacer portion and to the consensus sequence portion (FIG. 14B). Each/i 5 NitInd/is 5-nitroindole, a universal base analogue that exhibits high duplex stability and hybridizes indiscriminately with each of the four natural bases (Loakes and Brown, 1994). The DNA binder and the Spot-tag nanobody target were hybridized to their respective bridges in separate reactions. The DNA binders were added to a 2x excess of bridge oligonucleotide per DNA binder in hybridization buffer to produce 50uL of a solution with a final concentration of 200nM for each DNA binder (600 nM for all DNA binders taken together). The solution was heated to 95 ℃ for 5 minutes and left at Room Temperature (RT) (22-24 ℃) for 1 hour.
To hybridize the Spot-tag nanobody target to the universal bridge, it was added to a 5x excess of bridges per Spot-tag nanobody target in the hybridization buffer to produce a 49uL solution of Spot-tag nanobody target with a final concentration of about 400 nM. In the preparation of nanobody-oligonucleotide conjugates, the DNA tail is added in excess and is not purified away. The presence of excess unconjugated DNA tail in solution has the potential to hybridize to the Spot-tag-oligonucleotide conjugate, preventing subsequent hybridization of the universal bridge required for connection of the Spot-tag nanobody barcode to the adjacent substrate. The use of a bridge to Spot-tag nanobody target in a ratio of 5:1, such that any excess DNA tail in solution but not coupled to the Spot-tag nanobody target from the protein-oligonucleotide coupling reaction is hybridized to the bridge, facilitates hybridization of the bridge to all oligonucleotide tails coupled to the Spot-tag nanobody target. The solution was heated to 37 ℃ for 30 minutes and cooled at RT for 30 minutes. After cooling, the solutions containing the DNA binder and the Spot-tag nanobody target, both hybridized to the universal bridge, were combined and 1uL blocking buffer (0.025% TWEEN20+10mg/ml BSA in 1 XPBS) was added. The final conjugate library solution had a concentration of 100nM of each DNA conjugate (300 nM for all DNA conjugates together) and 200nM of the Spot-tag nanobody target.
Barcoded library incubation of binders, binder barcoding ligation and restriction digestion
After washing the sequencing chip twice with 100uL hybridization buffer for 60 seconds each (see above for building up the substrate and fixing it to the solid substrate part), the chip was washed with aptamer incubation buffer (0.025% TWEEN20+0.1mg/ml BSA in 1 × PBS) for 60 seconds. The binder library was gently mixed and the sequencing chip was slowly loaded twice with 30uL of the binder library solution. The sequencing chip was incubated with the conjugate library solution on a hot plate at 25 ℃ for 30 minutes. After incubation, the chip was washed three times with 100uL of aptamer incubation buffer for 90 seconds to wash away unbound and weakly bound binders.
To prepare the ligation reaction, 7uL 2x blunt end/TA MM ligase solution was diluted in 63uL hybridization buffer and gently mixed. 30uL of the diluted ligase solution was loaded onto the chip twice, and then the chip was incubated in a hot plate at 28 ℃ for 5 minutes to attach the DNA tail of the binder to the corresponding base oligonucleotide of the target to which it bound. The ligation reaction was terminated by washing the plate three times with 100uL of 1x CutSmart solution for 60 seconds.
The remaining portion of the conjugate, except for the consensus region and the conjugate barcode, is removed from the barcode-substrate construct using a restriction digestion reaction. The restriction enzyme mixture was prepared by adding 10uL of 20 units/uL of EcoRI, 10uL of 10 × CutSmart solution and 77uL of nuclease-free H to 30uL of 10uM restriction bridge (5'-CTGCGCCTATACGAATTCGTTATC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 96)) 2O, then the contents were gently mixed. 30uL of restriction enzyme mixture was loaded onto the chip twice and incubated on a hot plate at 40 ℃ for 30 minutes. To terminate the ligation reaction and wash away any hybridized DNA, the chip was loaded with 100uL 100% formamide, incubated on a hot plate for 90 seconds at 40 ℃ and washed with 500uL hybridization buffer.
Sequencing
The final step in the sequencing process is the addition of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) linkers. 1.5uL2:1 of 1uM Universal NGS linker (/5Phos/AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGCCGTATCATT (SEQ ID NO: 97)) + Universal NGS linker bridge 9/5 (5'-TTCCGATCTCGTTA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 98)) was added to 10uL 10x CutSmart, 25uL 2x blunt-ended/TA MM ligase and nuclease H was absent at 63.5uL2And (4) diluting in O. 30uL of the NGS ligation mix was loaded onto the sequencing chip twice and the chip was incubated on a hot plate at 40 ℃ for 2 min 45 sec. The chip is applied with 500uL nuclease-free H2O washes twice with a 90 second dwell between washes. 20uL of 20pM denatured PhiX (Illumina) was diluted in 580uL HT1 buffer (Illumina) and loaded into the sample wells of the sequencing cartridge. 45 cycle reads were performed using MiSeq V2 chemistry.
Results
Coupling the Spot-Tag nano antibody to the tail of DNA
Protein labeling is not site-directed because it is performed using a sortase-mediated method. Multiple higher molecular weight bands were observed on the gel, presumably corresponding to multiple oligonucleotides conjugated to a single nanobody. Importantly, these constructs are of less interest for BCS experiments because they either 1) do not function, in which case they do not bind to the Spot-Tag and are washed away, or 2) bind to the Spot-Tag, and then any of the multiple tails can be attached to a nearby substrate.
results-BCS binding assay proof of concept
Preliminary results of tuning nanobodies against their known peptide targets on the BCS platform show that in complex environments specific binding events to the binder in the submicromolar range can be recorded in the DNA signal and deconvoluted. When a library of promising binders was incubated with substrates attached to bradykinin (brady.o1), without target (clr.null.blk and 5' phos.o1 as empty controls), DNA target (sp4.o1 and SP6 as positive controls) or Spot-Tag protein (Spot-tag.o1), the barcodes of the Spot-Tag binders were attached to all substrates associated with the Spot-Tag target at a significantly higher ratio than substrates corresponding to the other targets. The sequencing count of the Spot-tag conjugate barcodes attached to the Spot-tag target substrate compared to the other substrates was 3383-10630 compared to 0-1617 (FIG. 56). Sequencing counts showed that 32-73% of the Spot-tag target substrates were attached to the Spot-tag conjugate barcodes, while 0.3-10.7% of the other substrates were attached to the Spot-tag conjugate barcodes. For the positive target controls, sp4.o1 and sp6.o1, sequencing counts reported that a large number of DNA binder barcodes were attached to the substrate of their target of interest compared to the substrate of other targets. The substrates of the empty control target and the peptide target control for non-specific binding (brady. o1) attached to any conjugate barcode were equal to or below the noise floor. No sequencing count was observed for the negative control binder av.b4.u2.sa 4.2.
To confirm that a true signal was observed, in experiments where only unconjugated Spot nanobodies and oligonucleotides were loaded onto the sequencing chip, no Spot-tag nanobody barcode was observed on the corresponding substrate (fig. 57). To further optimize the experiments, it is important to work with carefully purified protein-oligonucleotide conjugates, validate the BCS approach using an oligonucleotide tail composed of two parts to enable modularity of the design, validate the BCS platform using protein-based binders with low affinity, such as Myc tags, and characterize the performance of BCS using binders spanning different ranges of affinities and concentrations.
Example 5 PROSEQ-VIS assay
Method
Peptide immobilization
Proteins are isolated from cells, digested and processed, and the peptide fragments are then immobilized to a solid substrate. The cells are first lysed and the proteins are then isolated by precipitation. The isolated protein is denatured with a surfactant, then reduced and alkylated to protect the cysteine side chains. To attach the oligonucleotide strand to the amino side chain of lysine, the protein is incubated in a reaction mixture of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4-5), sodium cyanoborohydride, deionized water, and an oligonucleotide modified with an aldehyde at the 3 'end and having a phosphate group at the 5' end. The protein is then digested with Lys-C, resulting in peptide fragments with oligonucleotide-modified lysines at each C-terminus. The peptide-oligonucleotide construct is then immobilized to a solid substrate by covalently attaching the 5 'end of the oligonucleotide to a 3' linker on the flow cell using a DNA ligase.
Aptamer incubation and imaging
After covalently attaching the oligonucleotide-peptide construct to the substrate, the sequencing process is initiated by incubating the first pool of aptamers and then washing away unbound aptamers. On a single chip, 2 thousand 5 million to 50 million peptide fragments can be immobilized across multiple fields of view. After target immobilization, the library of unique aptamers with unique barcode tails hybridized to protective complementary oligonucleotides is incubated with the chip to allow target binding. Unbound aptamer was washed away. Bound aptamers were treated with Paraformaldehyde (PFA), then dsDNA was partially denatured and protective complementary oligonucleotides washed away to expose the barcode containing region for probe hybridization. (ii) contacting the aptamer: the amino acid complex is incubated with a library of probes hybridized to the barcode region indicating probe iteration 1. Unbound probes are then washed away and bound probes are imaged to obtain a first optical barcode. After imaging, the bound probes were denatured from the aptamer barcode tail and washed off the chip. The bound aptamers are then incubated with the next set of probes hybridized to the barcode region indicating probe iteration 2. The iterations of probe incubation, imaging, and washing are repeated until all optical barcodes are obtained. The peptide, as well as the covalently bound aptamer, is gradually degraded from the N-terminus using Edman degradation, aminopeptidase or any other processive degradation process. Then, the cycle of iteration of aptamer incubation, probe incubation and single molecule imaging and amino acid cleavage was repeated for multiple rounds to obtain the sequence of the peptide molecule (fig. 23).
As a conceptual proof that single molecule imaging can be achieved without TIRF microscopy, forward and reverse co-localized linkers (FC and RC) were labeled with fluorescent streptavidin beads and imaged on the flow cell. The FC includes a barcode substrate complementary region at the 5 'end, followed by a sequence complementary to a glass-bound oligonucleotide, followed by a flexible T-spacer, and a short high GC content sequence complementary to RC at the 3' end. In turn, the 3 'end of the RC is complementary to the 3' end of the FC, followed by a long T-spacer, followed by a sequence complementary to the glass-bound oligonucleotide, followed by a sequence complementary to another oligonucleotide. FC and RC were biotinylated at the 5' end. FC, LC and streptavidin beads and flow cell surfaces were blocked separately with BSA buffer (1 XPBS, 0.05% Tween, 10mg/ml BSA) for 1 hour at RT. FC was reacted with 0.04 μm yellow-green fluorescent (505/515) FluoSpheres in two separate reactionsTMStreptavidin-labeled microspheres and application of RC to 0.04 μm (488/645) TransFluoSpheresTMStreptavidin-labeled microspheres were labeled with a 1: 4 to beads at RT for 30 minutes, so that each biotinylated oligonucleotide may bind to at least one bead. FC and RC were measured at a ratio of 1: 2 were combined at RT for 1 hour. Loading the solution into Illumi na MiSeq v2(50 cycles) on chip and incubated at 37 ℃ for 30 minutes to allow FC and RC to hybridize to the P7 linker in the chip. The imaging system was a wide-field upright fluorescence microscope with a 20X Nikon objective (NA ═ 0.75). The glass sheet of the chip is removed from the cartridge and the outer upper surface of the chip is imaged. The beads inside the chip were excited with a SPECTRA X LED light engine at 488nm and the emitted fluorescent signals were collected at 515nm (using 520/35 bandpass emission filter) and 645nm (using 676/29nm bandpass emission filter). Images were acquired using an Andor EMCCD camera at a 16 micron pixel size and an exposure time of 2 seconds.
Optical barcode deconvolution
After repeating this series of steps on the slide, the identity of the consecutive N-terminal amino acids of each round was deduced by co-localization of the optical barcodes and generation of peptide sequence calculations. Once the peptide sequences are generated, they are compared against the organism's proteome for protein identification and quantification.
Results
Single molecule imaging
In each iteration of probe incubation and imaging, single peptide molecules at known locations on the chip (i.e., designated coordinates (X, Y)) produce spatially overlapping fluorescent signals (fig. 58A), which can be detected by separate channels (fig. 58B).
Preliminary data show that single oligonucleotide imaging can be achieved using wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Since each biotinylated oligonucleotide was bound to at least one streptavidin bead, each fluorescent spot represents at least one bead (FIG. 59). Where each biotinylated oligonucleotide is bound to a cluster of beads, the spots appear larger or brighter than spots of the same size. Streptavidin beads with unbound oligonucleotides were imaged on glass as a control (fig. 58). The similarity in the size of the spots observed between the fluorescent beads on the chip and the sequencing chip indicates that the spots observed on the sequencing chip are single molecules. Fig. 60B shows the intensity distribution of all fluorescence spots in the image snapshot. Local maxima of counts per 10,000 gray levels (in the case of channel 1: 488nm excitation and 645nm emission, FIG. 60B) can be used to distinguish spots with various peak intensities. For example, the first interval (gray counts from 0 to 10,000 gray counts) in FIG. 60B indicates that only one streptavidin bead binds to one biotinylated oligonucleotide. The second or third interval indicates that a cluster (two or three) of streptavidin beads is bound to one biotinylated oligonucleotide. Data from the comparative size analysis and intensity distribution indicate that a single oligonucleotide molecule is detected.
Deconvoluting fluorescent signal into aptamer identity
The fluorescence signature of the fluorescence signal in each channel incorporating each iteration of a round was compared for the known optical barcodes of each unique aptamer, thereby deducing the likely identity of the bound N-terminal prefix on the basis of the probability distribution of the binding events for each aptamer of each prefix (fig. 58C).
Aptamer identity to protein sequences
For each single peptide molecule at a known position on the chip, the N-terminal prefix calls from each round were used to calculate the possible amino acid sequences for deducing the peptide immobilized at (X, Y). The computationally deduced peptide sequence has greater confidence if the N-terminal prefixes associated with the ssDNA binding regions of the noted aptamers overlap such that the second amino acid of one round is identical to the first amino acid of the subsequent round (fig. 58D).
Protein sequencing of whole proteins
In a series of discrete peptide sequences deduced by assay in the scaffold, the contiguous peptide sequences were ligated together by splicing overlapping sequences to generate the sequence of the full-length protein. The sequences were plotted against a proteomic profile to identify known proteins in the sample, such as arginine vasopressin (fig. 58E). The relative quantification of a unique protein/peptide in a sample is calculated from the number of deduced peptide sequences associated with that protein/peptide.

Reagent
Aptamer libraries were purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies, all other oligonucleiNucleotides were purchased from IDT. Peptide oligonucleotide conjugates were ordered from Genscript. All automation procedures were performed on an Agilent Bravo NGS workstation. All DNA quantification was obtained using dsDNA and/or ssDNA high sensitivity Qubit fluorescent quantitation assay (thermolfisher). All water used was AmbionTMNuclease-free water.
Method
Cultivation of
The N40 aptamer library consisted of 40 random bases flanked by custom primer regions. Aliquots of these initial libraries (TTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGANNNNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATCAGACTGGAC GACAGAA (SEQ ID NO: 99)) were ordered from TriLink. 10 from the initial library12Samples of each sequence (. about.48 ng) were amplified in 288 reactions of 50 microliters each using Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies) and SPRI purified using Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads on the Bravo automated liquid handling platform (Agilent). The amplification conditions for this and all subsequent PCR reactions (except NGS preparation) were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 ℃ for 5 min, followed by 13 amplification cycles of denaturation at 95 ℃ for 30 sec, annealing at 55 ℃ for 30 sec, and extension at 72 ℃ for 30 sec, and final extension at 72 ℃ for 5 min.
Digestion of food
The amplified library was converted to single stranded dna (ssdna) by enzymatic digestion with lambda exonuclease (NEB) and purified by automated bead cleaning. ssDNA digestion completion was characterized on bioanalyzer 2100(Agilent) using a small RNA kit (Agilent), and concentration was quantified by ssDNA Qubit assay (thermolfisher) after cleaning.
Peptide-oligonucleotide constructs
The peptide-oligonucleotide construct was synthesized by Genscript (complete construct: (N-terminus) -NNNNNNNNN-Cys (SEQ ID NO: 100) (C-terminus) -3 'ATCCCTTCTCTTCCTGTATACTANNNNNNGCACGTAGATTC 5' phosphate (SEQ ID NO: 101)). The C-terminus of the 10-mer peptide (except for 11-mer GnRH and 9-mer arginine vasopressin) was attached to the 3' end of a 41 nucleotide oligonucleotide. All but the last amino acid residues of the peptide are derived from naturally occurring peptides (e.g., GnRH, bradykinin and arginine vasopressin) or synthetic peptide designs, and the N-terminal residue is retained for cysteine to facilitate peptide attachment to the oligonucleotide. The 41 nucleotide (nt) oligonucleotide is characterized by a 9 nucleotide bridge binding region at the 3 'terminus, a 3nt spacer, a 6nt DNA barcode uniquely associated with the peptide, and a 23nt primer at the 5' terminus.
Incubation with air
The SsDNA pools were heated to 95 ℃ for 5 minutes before incubation with the peptides, and then rapidly cooled on ice. For ideal experimental conditions in the first and second rounds of multiplexing, 166.62pmol (4650ng) of folded aptamer was added to 18.51pmol of peptide-oligonucleotide construct (target: DNA with final stringency 1: 10). These numbers were scaled in each individual experiment according to the amount of ssDNA available for incubation. The stringency was increased to 1:25 for rounds 3 and 4. Final buffer was prepared from 10 XPBS (Sigma-Aldrich), TWEEN20(Sigma Aldrich) and HiFi Taq ligase buffer (NEB) to give a final incubation solution at a concentration of 1 XPBS, 1 XPFi Taq ligase buffer and 0.025% TWEEN20 in a total volume of 400 ul. The peptide-oligonucleotide constructs and aptamers were allowed to bind for 2 hours at RT and rotation.

To a mixture of 400ul aptamer and peptide-oligonucleotide constructs were added HiFi Taq ligase (NEB) and 18-mer DNA bridges (GCAUCUAAGUUCUGUCGU (SEQ ID NO: 102)) such that each 50ul incubation solution contained 1ul HiFi Taq and the final concentration of the 18-mer bridge was 100 nmol. The ligation was carried out at 25 ℃ for 30 minutes. The bridge was then degraded by adding the USER enzyme (NEB) and 10 Xcutmarst and incubating the solution at 37 ℃ for 15 minutes.
Incubation with Biotin
Biotinylated oligonucleotide (/5Biosg/TAGGGAAGAGAAGGACATATGAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 103)) hybridized to the 5'-ATCATATGTCCTTCTCTTCCCTA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 104) region of the peptide oligonucleotide construct was added to the reaction in equimolar proportions to the peptide-oligonucleotide construct. The reaction was incubated for 30 minutes with rotation.
Streptavidin-biotin pulldown
Streptavidin C1 beads (Invitrogen) were incubated with the solution for 30 minutes in an amount of 83.33ug of peptide per 51.02pmol of peptide present. Bead-bound peptide aptamer constructs were collected on Bravo using an automatic washing protocol. The multiplex reaction was incubated on a magnetic plate for 2 minutes. The supernatant containing unbound aptamer was aspirated and the beads were washed twice with SELEX buffer, then finally washed with 1X PBS. Aspirate the 1X PBS at the end of the protocol.
PCR on beads
Immediately after the auto-wash protocol was completed, 50ul of the PCR master mix solution was added to the beads. The 126nt construct (5' TTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATCAGACTGGACGACAGAACTTAGATGCACGNNNNNNATCATATGTCCTTCTCTTCCCTA 3' (SEQ ID NO: 107)) was amplified using primers 5'-TAGGGAAGAGAAGGACATATGAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 105) and TTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 106).
NGS preparation
Samples of PCR on 10ng SPRI purified beads were taken for NGS preparation. Each aptamer identified from sequencing of these samples had a 6bp barcode assuming that they bound to the peptide in solution. The P5 and P7 linkers required for Illumina sequencing were incorporated by PCR using custom NGS primers (5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATNNNNNNNNGTGCGTGCGTGCTTCTGTCGTCCAGTCTGATGTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 108) and 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACNNNNNNGCATGCAGCCGGTTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 109)). The amplification conditions for these PCR reactions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 ℃ for 5 min, followed by 10 amplification cycles of denaturation at 95 ℃ for 30 sec, annealing at 65 ℃ for 30 sec, and extension at 72 ℃ for 30 sec, and final extension at 72 ℃ for 5 min. The final NGS library SPRI was purified, pooled and cleaned by pippinht (sage science).
Threshold PCR/nested PCR
For each multiplexing reaction, 4.08ng of SPRI purified product was amplified in 24 50ul PCR reactions using 5'-T A G A AGAGAAGGACATATGAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 110) and/5 Phos '/-TTGACTAGTACATGACCACTTGA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 111)), where the indicated modified nucleotides resulted in replacement of the oxygen atoms in the phosphate backbone with sulfur atoms in phosphorothioate linkages, which made the sequence more resistant to nuclease digestion. The final product of this nested PCR was an 86-bp amplicon matched to the original N40 library. It can be converted to ssDNA by enzymatic digestion and used for another round of multiplexing.
As a result, the
The resulting data provides information on how aptamers bind preferentially to alternative targets in the same experiment. Currently, up to 6 targets have been evaluated simultaneously by multiplexing.
In a given multiplexing experiment, target-specific sequences showed selective binding behavior to their associated targets (fig. 61). The assay calculates selectivity as the read out for the desired target at round 4 divided by the read out for all targets. The top 5-ranked sequences of each target (GNRH, NC2, NC3, T1, Vaso) showed a selectivity of 0.500 to 0.924 for their target targets and no more than 0.250 for any non-target.
In multiplex experiments, there was significant bleed between targets, and no aptamer identified with only a single target (although round 4 aptamers were identified with arginine vasopressin up to 58.3% of the time, GnRH 50% of the time, and target 1_ NC2 up to 83.3% of the time). Since 3 of the 6 targets had similar sequence peptides (target 1 (N-terminal) -YQNTSQNTS-Cys (C-terminal) (SEQ ID NO: 112), target 1_ NC2 (N-terminal) -KQNTYQNTS-Cys (C-terminal) (SEQ ID NO: 113), and target 1_ NC3 (N-terminal) -QNTSYQNTS-Cys (C-terminal) (SEQ ID NO: 114)), they could pull down the same aptamer without surprise (FIG. 62).

Reagent
Constructs for expression of RNA binding proteins and RNA sequences are assembled using standard tools and methods of molecular biology, such as PCR amplification, restriction digestion, Infusion assembly or ligation. The gene of interest or DNA sequence encoding the RNA hairpin is ordered as a gene block or assembled by PCR. All regions amplified by PCR were verified by Sanger sequencing in the final bacterial clones. Cloning sequences for expression constructs for both RNA binding proteins and RNAIn one embodiment, the RBP is a DNA fragment that encodes a RNA hairpin, and the DNA fragment is a DNA fragment that encodes a RNA hairpin. Experiments were performed using tandem fusions of MS2 coat protein (dMS2) with a 9xHis motif tag for affinity purification, fused with or without Emerald GFP (EmGFP) molecules. The MS2 binding site contains a U to C mutation that increases the affinity of RNA-protein interactions. For bacterial expression, dMS2-EmGFP or dMS2 was cloned under the control of the T7 promoter in pRSFDuet1 vector using the Infusion (Takara) clone and transformed into NEB Turbo cells for plasmid amplification. Plasmids were purified from NEB Turbo cells using a standard mini-prep kit (Zymo or Thermo) and sequence verified. All water used was Ambion TMNo nuclease water.

The weight of the cell sediment was used to determine the volume of Y-PER reagent added according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The mixture was gently stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes and the soluble proteins were separated from the cell debris by centrifugation at 14,000 Xg for 10 minutes.
Supernatants containing soluble cellular proteins were removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining or BCA assay. By DynabeadsTMHis-Tag isolation and Pull-down kit, further isolation of dMS2 or dMS2-EmGFP using the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, lysates from 5-ml liquid cultures were incubated with 100ul Dynabeads in a final volume of 700-1400ul, using a binding/washing buffer (50mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20) to adjust the lysate volume. After 5-10 minutes of incubation, the beads were washed 4 times with 300-600ul binding/wash buffer, during which the supernatant was discarded and the beads were resuspended thoroughly after each wash.
To elute the proteins, the beads were incubated on a roller for 10 minutes with 100-. Eluted proteins were exchanged into PBS using a 10kDa Amicon Ultra-0.5 device and concentrated to-1 mg/ml. Purified proteins were quantified using either the Pierce BCA protein assay kit or SDS-PAGE gels stained with simlyblue SafeStain.
