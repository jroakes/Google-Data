Description
Technical field
Present invention relates in general to cordless communication network, and relate more specifically to for optimize the method and apparatus that the network between transfer period enters at cordless communication network.
Background technology
Cordless communication network is disposed to provide various communication services widely, such as voice, grouped data, multimedia broadcasting and text message, transmits.These cordless communication networks can be multi-address systems, and this multi-address system can be supported by sharing available network resource a plurality of users' communication.The example of such multi-address system comprises code division multiple access (CDMA) system, time division multiple access (TDMA) system, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system and OFDM (OFDMA) system.Cdma system can be realized wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) or cdma2000.In the document from third generation partner program (3GPP), W-CDMA has been described.In the document from " third generation partner program 2 " by name tissue (3GPP2), CDMA2000 has been described.3GPP and 3GPP2 document can openly obtain.System based on WiMAX (World Interoperability for Microwave Access, WiMax) is being designed and is developing to move in the frequency band in license, such as 2.3GHz, 2.5GHz, 3.3GHz, 3.5GHz etc.
Remote unit can move to access different network nodes on cordless communication network.In order to access each network node, remote unit must come to communicate with corresponding network node with ranging process.Existing ranging process comprises quick distance measurement or switches range finding.When expecting the switching of remote unit, remote unit can send a request message to current serving network node.This request message notifies current serving network node to initiate handoff procedure.In response to request message, serving network node can notify remote unit to be switched to the attempt of target network node to target network node.Via backbone network, should make target network node for the notice of target network node is that the switching of remote unit is ready.Therefore target network node can allow initial ranging chance based on non-competing and for the dedicated bandwidth allocations of remote unit, to support to switch range finding.
Yet, because remote unit must be initiated bandwidth request and then proceed in a similar fashion the situation that initial network enters to serving network node, so switch range finding, there is high latency.In addition, switch range finding not for remote unit provides unique area of coverage (footprint).This has caused more vulnerability in following extreme case: in this extreme case, the hacker that ranging code is intended to the service of refusal on ranging region endangers.
On the other hand, due to the pre-assigned time frame of remote unit, so quick distance measurement has increased resource utilization.Most of remote units in switching may can not complete switching in distributed time frame.For example, Fig. 1 illustrates the basic operation of coordinating switching.Under the basic operation of Fig. 1, remote unit completes one of 3 fast ranging IEs that have switching delay 45ms, 60ms or 75ms according to remote unit for the quick distance measurement information element (IE) switching.If lost any one of these chances, remote unit must be carried out the switching range finding competition to one of many shared switching ranging codes.Fig. 1 illustrates quick distance measurement and switches range finding and postpones.The detailed description with reference to the signaling flow of Fig. 1 of the independent signaling example that marks in Fig. 1 below.
Frame 2 (at remote unit place): remote unit is launched handover request (MSHO REQ) to serving network node.
Frame 3 (at serving network node place): in response to MSHO REQ, serving network node is to the target network node transmitting request of prenoticing (Prenot REQ).The attempt that Prenot REQ switches to target network node to target network node notice remote unit.
Frame 15 (at target network node place): target network node comes to serving network node transmitting Prenot response (Prenot RSP) in response to Prenot-REQ.
Frame 15 (at serving network node place): serving network node is come to target network node transmitting handoff advice (HO suggestion) in response to Prenot-RSP.HO suggestion has been gone to target network node to target network node indication remote unit.
Frame 16 (at target network node place): target network node starts to start quick distance measurement timer frame 16.Quick distance measurement timer takes into account be in the expense relating in the transmission of transfer message in serving network node.Quick distance measurement timer continues, until remote unit leaves the overlay area of current serving network node, and the overlay area of target approach network node.
Frame 16 (at serving network node place): serving network node is launched handoff response (BSHO RSP) to remote unit, is in and on frame 17, receives this handoff response at remote unit.
Frame 18 (at remote unit place): remote unit receives for switching the distribution (for the distribution of HO IND) of indication.
Frame 18 (at remote unit place): in response to the distribution for HO IND, remote unit switches indication (HO IND) to serving network node transmitting.
Frame 19 (at serving network node place): serving network node is receiving from remote unit HO IND, switches and confirms (HO confirmations) to target network node transmitting, at target network node, is in and on frame 20, receives this switching confirmation.
Frame 23 (at target network node place): target network node starts to stop quick distance measurement timer frame 23.The then distribution for the first quick distance measurement to remote unit transmitting of target network node.Now, remote unit has left the overlay area of serving network node, and the overlay area of target approach network node.
Frame 24 (at remote unit place): remote unit can respond the first quick distance measurement distribution by sending distance measurement request (RNG REQ), shown in dotted line, or may miss the first quick distance measurement is distributed to the chance responding.If remote unit distributes and responds quick distance measurement, target network node receives RNG REQ at frame 25.
When remote unit is not when the time for switching of appointment during target network node and serving network node exchange messages arrives target network node, remote unit may miss the first quick distance measurement is distributed to the chance responding.The reason that remote unit is not answered quick distance measurement distribution may comprise: cell layout; Slowly switch, wherein, because obstacle, remote unit can not be synchronizeed with target network node; Or, the change of RF situation.The example of this obstacle can comprise building, the vehicle slowly moving or the weather conditions between transfer period.In this case, the timing between target network node and remote unit is asynchronous, and target network node may be wasted for sending to remote unit the Internet resources that quick distance measurement is distributed.
Frame 26 (at target network node place): receiving after RNG REQ, target network node is launched ranging response (RNG RSP) to remote unit.
If the chance that remote unit can not utilize the first quick distance measurement to distribute, then target network node can send more quick distance measurement distribution to remote unit.The number that the quick distance measurement sending to remote unit is distributed can depend on the obtainable Internet resources of target network node.As shown in fig. 1, target network node sends three quick distance measurement to remote unit and distributes, so that remote unit starts the quick distance measurement with target network node, and completes switching.The switching delay that is assigned to the transmitting of the 3rd quick distance measurement distribution from the first quick distance measurement may be increased to 75ms from 45ms.
Frame 32 (at remote unit place): distribute if remote unit has also been lost the 3rd quick distance measurement, then remote unit switches range finding (HO RNG) code to target network node transmitting, and target network node receives this code at frame 33.In this case, remote unit must be carried out and switch range finding to complete the switching to target network node now.Remote unit selects to switch ranging code from a plurality of switching ranging codes of being broadcasted continuously by serving network node.The potential candidate of the selection of switching ranging code based on target network node being chosen as to remote unit switching.This selection can be carried out by the internal circuit of remote unit, or remote unit can obtain from serving network node the information of the best candidate for switching.Then remote unit can be used the switching ranging code of this target network node.Switch the serviced network node of ranging code and be broadcast to all remote units that communicate with serving network node.Each switches ranging code and a target network node is identified as to the potential candidate of switching.These yards are to be divided and be equipped with code division multiple access (CDMA) code that promotes switching by each network node.
Frame 34 (at target network node place): receive and switch after ranging code at target network node, target network node provides needed timing and power adjustment between target network node and remote unit.Target network node is timing and the power adjustment as ranging response (RNG RSP) continuation message to remote unit transmitting.
Frame 35 (at remote unit place): as regularly and power adjustment and after the correction that is received, remote unit is launched HO RNG code to target network node again.
Frame 37 (at target network node place): target network node is launched afterwards and had the RNG RSP success that sends the distribution of RNG REQ for remote unit receiving HO RNG code.
Frame 39 (at remote unit place): remote unit is to target network node transmitting RNG REQ, and target network node receives this RNG REQ at frame 40.RNG REQ comprises the serving network node information of switching ID and identifying remote unit at target network node place.
Frame 41 (at target network node place): target network node is to remote unit transmitting RNG RSP, to complete handoff procedure.Yet before this time point, switching delay has been increased to 120ms.Due to this high latency, in some cases, if do not carry out timing and power adjustment, subscriber may experience other delay.And subscriber must compete ranging code, to complete this switching.
Therefore, as mentioned above, quick distance measurement is not for completing the best solution of switching, and in most of the cases, it has wasted on-air radio electric resources.Quick distance measurement provides uncalled distribution for remote unit.Because a large amount of bandwidth is used in these uncalled distribution or default distribution, so target network node stops these distribution after the distribution of predetermined quantity.Total quick distance measurement duration comprises: quick distance measurement timer, and during this period, target network node waits for that remote unit arrives under the overlay area of target network node, and, for the default distribution of remote unit.
Postpone different from the 120ms in switching range finding, quick distance measurement may provide the delay of 45ms, yet quick distance measurement does not provide regularly and capability correction, regularly and capability correction normally in handoff environment, occur in the situation that changing RF situation, keep calling effective time material particular.On the other hand, switch range finding and have higher delay, such as 120ms, this is contrary with the 45ms delay in quick distance measurement, but switch range finding, is encompassed in timing and the capability correction that maintains preferably link between transfer period.If remote unit is not initiated quick distance measurement in distributed time frame, then remote unit must be carried out and switch range finding.
Therefore, need a kind of improvement and more effective method and apparatus entering for optimize the network between transfer period at cordless communication network.
