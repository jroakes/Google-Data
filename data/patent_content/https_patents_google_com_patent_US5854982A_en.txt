Definitions
- This invention relates, in general, to a communication system (and architecture thereof) and is particularly, but not exclusively, applicable to the management of the association of International Mobile Subscriber Identities (IMSIs) and Mobile Subscriber Integrated Service Digital Network (MSISDN) numbers for a cellular communication system architecture.
- IMSIs International Mobile Subscriber Identities
- MSISDN Mobile Subscriber Integrated Service Digital Network
- a cellular communication system such as the pan-European Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM) communication system
- subscription information (as well as location information) pertaining to a roaming mobile subscriber unit is stored (and up-dated periodically) in a home location register (HLR).
- HLR home location register
- a HLR (of which there are many in the communication system) provides the key by which mobile terminated calls are rooted to a relevant roaming mobile subscriber unit.
- MSISDN Mobile Subscriber Integrated Service Digital Network
- IMSI International Mobile Subscriber Identities
- an IMSI is directly associated (mapped) with the MSISDN.
- the IMSI is the key to operation of a cellular communication system.
- no two HLRs have the same ranges of MSISDNs and IMSIs, and more than one MSISDN may be associated with (mapped on to) a single IMSI. Therefore, since mappings of MSISDNs to IMSIs are fixed within a HLR, the communication system is extremely inflexible and does not lend itself to manipulation of IMSIs and MSISDNs once they have been assigned to a particular subscriber unit.
- a Smart-Card (usually termed a "SIM" card) containing an indication of the assigned IMSI is provided to a user of a subscriber unit.
- SIM Smart-Card
- a user may insert the SIM card into any one of a number of subscriber units. It is only after the insertion of the SIM card that the subscriber unit becomes fully operational and thereby allows access to at least some of the services provided by a particular network operator.
- routing of a call to a HLR is based upon the fixed association between the MSISDN and IMSI ranges of the HLRs, and as such it may not be possible to assign the original MSISDN (subscriber directory number) to the user because there are no further IMSIs available in the HLR for association with the original MSISDN. That is to say, assignment of an original subscriber directory number is not possible because the original subscriber directory number can no longer be associated with an IMSI from the dedicated range of IMSI values available in the HLR of the MSISDN.
- MSISDN subscriber directory number
- special directory numbers In a communication system, it is desirable to be able to provide, when requested, special directory numbers. More particularly, such special directory numbers may be required by a user who is unable to remember an obscure MSISDN previously assigned to him by the network operator, or where the user wishes to have a special directory number that is both easily associated with him or is easily remembered by a customer of the user. However, if a subscriber requests a particular MSISDN, then this particular MSISDN must be within the fixed MSISDN ranges of the HLRs provided to the network operator.
- a network operator may be unable to provide a subscriber-requested (special) directory number, such as 12345 or 8888, because such a special MSISDN may be out-of-range in terms of the MSISDNs available in HLRs (or parts thereof) supporting the IMSI allocated to the subscriber (bearing in mind that all IMSIs may already be allocated on the HLR supporting the desired MSISDN range).
- special directory number such as 12345 or 8888
- present-day communication systems suffer from an "out-of-range" problem since the ranges of IMSI and MSISDN for each HLR are set in the network and it is therefore difficult to apply IMSI values outside the range of MSISDN values (and vice versa). In fact, there is no convenient mechanism within any communication system to handle such out-of-range associations.
- the management of subscriber units dictates that it is easier to assemble particular groups of subscriber units in one HLR. For example, all subscriber units originating from, for example, the Manchester geographic area could be assembled within a first range of MSISDNs (or IMSIs) and hence potentially located in consecutive memory locations of one or more HLRs. Having to re-assign new IMSIs is therefore undesirable because this would distribute a group of users across numerous HLRs belonging to a network operator. Additionally, of particular concern to the network operator is the loss of an IMSI because the loss of an IMSI will restrict the number of subscribers that a network operator can service (as a whole or through a particular HLR).
- a communication system having a range of MSISDNs and a range of IMSIs assigned thereto for storing subscription information, the communication system comprising at least two databases separated from one another and indexed in terms of said ranges of MSISDNs and said ranges of IMSIs, wherein a cross-reference is both stored within a particular MSISDN and a particular IMSI to maintain an association therebetween, thereby allowing access to subscription information stored in at least one of the particular MSISDN and the particular IMSI.
- the system further comprises a plurality of home location registers each having a unique range of MSISDN addresses and IMSI addresses assigned thereto, each home location register of the plurality of home location registers comprising: memory partitioned into a MSISDN-keyed database and an IMSI-keyed database, the MSISDN-keyed database and the IMSI-keyed database each comprising memory blocks, for storing the subscription information, identified by one of a MSISDN address and an IMSI address assigned respectively thereto, wherein a MSISDN address of a first home location register of the plurality of home location registers is associated with an IMSI address of a second home location register of the plurality of home location registers and each memory block of each database contains the cross-reference for the association, thereby allowing cross-system access to similarly partitioned home location registers.
- the communication system routes a call from an external network to a subscriber unit having a directory number (MSISDN) identified in the call.
- the communication system comprises: a HLR router, coupled to the external communication network, having a range of directory numbers and a range of intermediate addresses, wherein at least some of the directory numbers of the range of directory numbers are mapped to one intermediate address (RN-MSISDN) to convert a received directory number to an intermediate address; a plurality of home location registers, each coupled to the HLR router and each having a range of intermediate addresses and a range of IMSIs, wherein each IMSI is arranged to store information pertaining to a subscriber unit and no two HLRs have the same ranges of intermediate addresses and IMSIs; and a processing unit for controlling the routing of the intermediate address to a home location register in which the intermediate address resides, such that information relevant to the directory number that originated from the external network is recovered from a mapping, in the HLR, of the intermediate address with an IMSI associated
- a home location register for a cellular communication system having a range of MSISDNs and a range of IMSIs assigned thereto, the home location register comprising at least two databases separated from one another and indexed in terms of a specific proportion of the range of MSISDNs and a specific proportion of the range of IMSIs, wherein a cross-reference is both stored within a particular MSISDN and a particular IMSI to maintain an association therebetween and such that the cross-reference may identify one of the particular MSISDN and the particular IMSI as falling outside the proportion of the range of each respective database, thereby allowing access to subscription information stored in at least one of the particular MSISDN and the particular IMSI.
- a routing terminal arranged to receive a directory number (MSISDN) originating from an external network, for routing a call to a subscriber unit having that directory number, the routing terminal arranged to be coupled to at least one home location register (HLR) of a communication system, the routing terminal comprising: a range of directory numbers (MSISDNs) and a range of intermediate addresses (RN-MSISDNs), each intermediate address (RN-MSISDN) associated with at least one directory number to convert a received directory number to an intermediate address; wherein the routing terminal is responsive to a processing unit that directs the intermediate address to a HLR having that intermediate address contained within a range of intermediate addresses, the HLR further comprising a range of IMSIs for storing information, wherein each IMSI in the range of IMSIs is responsive to at least one intermediate address of the range of intermediate addresses such that information relevant to the directory number that originated from the external network is recovered from a mapping of the intermediate address with an IMSI associated therewith
- MSISDN directory number
- RLR home
- a method of routing a call from an external network to a subscriber unit of a communication system coupled to the external network, the subscriber unit having a directory number (MSISDN) identified in the call comprising the steps of: receiving the directory number from the external network; converting the directory number to an intermediate address (RN-MSISDN) associated with the directory number; intelligently routing the intermediate address (RN-MSISDN) to a home location register (HLR) containing the intermediate address; and accessing the intermediate address in the HLR to recover information relevant to the call.
- MSISDN directory number
- FIG. 1 is a prior art representation of a communication system, such as a cellular communication system.
- FIG. 2 shows an exemplary structure of a prior art memory location for an IMSI of the communication system of FIG. 1.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an architecture for a communication system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
- FIG. 4 shows a preferred embodiment of a HLR router used in the communication system of FIG. 3.
- FIG. 5 illustrates partitioning of subscriber information within a HLR, according to a second embodiment of the present invention.
- a prior art architecture for a communications system 10 such as a cellular communication system.
- the communication system 10 is partitioned into a plurality of geographic service areas. For the purposes for illustration, only two such geographic service areas are shown; Home Area 12 and Away Area 14.
- An external network 16 such as a landline telephone network, is coupled through a communication link 17 to a Gateway Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) 18 of the cellular communication system 10.
- the Gateway MSC 18 is arranged to direct mobile terminated calls to a relevant home location register (HLR) based upon reception of a MSISDN 20 received from the external network 16.
- HLR home location register
- the MSISDN 20 comprises three portions.
- a first portion 22 of the MSISDN 20 represents an international Country Code (CC), such as 44 for the UK.
- CC international Country Code
- the second portion 24 of the MSISDN 20 is a number that represents a Network Destination Code (NDC) and is analogous to an area code in a telephone system.
- a third portion 26 of the MSISDN 20 is used, principally, for a subscriber directory number (comprising a plurality of digits), although there may be additional information slots available in this portion.
- the first portion 22, the second portion 24 (i.e. the county code and the network destination code) and the third portion 26 are used to identify an address of a particular home location register (HLR).
- HLR home location register
- the address of a particular home location register may include additional bits contained somewhere within an enlarged version of a MSISDN 20, or may be identified simply through the CC and NDC.
- a single HLR may be identified by the combination of a country code and more than one network destination code.
- Gateway MSC 18 Upon receiving MSISDN 20, Gateway MSC 18 intelligently routes the MSISDN 20 (which precedes a call) to a particular HLR based upon the identification of the country code 22 and NDC 24. Typically, the routing of MSISDN 20 to a HLR is achieved via a STP (Signalling Transfer Point) 28.
- STP 28 may be excluded from the architecture of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, but is usually included to enhance and improve the routing of calls in the cellular communication system 10, as will be understood.
- STP 28 Signal Transfer Point
- HLR 1 contains a fixed (dedicated) range of MSISDNs ranging from 100 to 119. Also, HLR 1 contains a fixed (dedicated) range of IMSIs ranging from 1000 to 1019.
- an arrow from a MSISDN address, such as address 102, to an IMSI address represents the mapping of that particular MSISDN to that particular IMSI (and illustrates the assignment of a subscriber unit or SIM card to a particular IMSI belonging to the network operator).
- HLR 2 has a range of MSISDNs ranging from 120 to 139 and a range of IMSIs ranging from 1020 to 1039.
- HLR 1 As can be seen from a comparison of HLR 1 with HLR 2 , no two HLRs have overlapping ranges of either MSISDNs or IMSIs. Furthermore, in the case of HLR 2 , it can be seen that MSISDN addresses 120 and 122 are mapped to a solitary IMSI (address 1020). This many-to-one mapping illustrates that two cellular telephones, for example, are associated with a single IMSI, whereby a single account can be utilised by the network operator to provide billing, for example, to one client having a number of cellular phones.
- MSISDNs for different telecommunication services, such as fax and data
- IMSI IMSI
- cellular telephone is generic and includes other forms of communication device, such as portable microcomputers, data telephones and radio pagers.
- Gateway MSC 18 is further coupled through a communication link 36 (a map communication link) to a Visiting Mobile Switching Centre (VMSC) 38.
- VMSC 38 contains a visiting location register (VLR) 40 that stores subscriber data down-loaded from a HLR located in another geographic service area.
- VLR visiting location register
- the subscriber data stored in VLR 40 allows local area control of a visiting subscriber unit that has roamed away from its home area (e.g. Home Area 12) into the away area of the VMSC 38.
- a base transceiver station (BTS) 42 is coupled through a Base Site Controller (BSC) 44 to the VMSC 38.
- BSC Base Site Controller
- the BTS 42 communicates with a mobile subscriber unit 46 (which may be a roaming subscriber unit) over a communication link 48, such as a radio frequency communication link.
- the prior art communication system 10 of FIG. 1 receives an instruction (in the form of MSISDN 20) to set up a mobile terminated call with a roaming subscriber unit 46.
- the home location register of roaming subscriber unit 46 is identified by Gateway MSC 18.
- Interrogation of the home location register of roaming subscriber unit 46 reveals a particular IMSI (for example IMSI 102 of HLR 1 ) in which subscription and other information pertaining to roaming subscriber unit 46 is contained.
- the current location of roaming subscriber unit 46 (amongst other things) is stored within the IMSI record at the HLR of roaming subscriber unit 46.
- the location information identifies VMSC 38 of Away Area 14 as being currently responsible for operational control of roaming subscriber unit 46.
- Gateway MSC 18 is responsible for establishing a C-7 signalling link between the home location register of the roaming subscriber unit 46 (in this case HLR 1 ) and VMSC 38. IMSI data pertaining to roaming subscriber unit 46 is then communicated over the C-7 signalling link to be stored in VLR 40.
- VLR 40 assigns a mobile subscriber roaming number (MSRN) to the roaming subscriber unit 46, and then sends back the MSRN to the home location register of roaming subscriber unit 46. Subsequently, the assigned MSRN is sent to Gateway MSC 18 and is used by Gateway MSC 18 to establish a direct link between external network 16 (that wishes to communicate with roaming subscriber unit 46) and VMSC 38.
- MSRN mobile subscriber roaming number
- FIG. 2 shows an exemplary structure of a prior art memory location for an IMSI.
- the IMSI contains a number of information bearing segments, including segments dedicated to recording a present Mobile Country Code (MCC) and a mobile network code (MNC). These information bearing segments are used to identify the current location of a roaming subscriber unit, such as unit 46, and other subscription information (as will readily be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art.) Furthermore, as will be understood, subscription data in an IMSI is periodically updated by the communication system during location updates, for example.
- MCC Mobile Country Code
- MNC mobile network code
- the preferred embodiments of the present invention provide an ability to separate IMSIs and MSISDNs between HLR platforms either by (i) utilising a home location register router positioned between the Gateway MSC 18 and the plurality of home location registers serviced by the Gateway MSC. This structural configuration is illustrated in FIG.
- HLR router 64 is coupled to a plurality of HLRs (HLR 2 , HLR 3 and HLR N ) and, via the optional STP 28, to Gateway MSC 18, or (ii) by decoupling subscriber information (data) within a HLR by internally partitioning IMSI-keyed data from MSISDN-keyed data while providing an IMSI-MSISDN cross-reference between these two partitioned storage areas, thereby allowing cross-network access to similarly partitioned HLRs.
- IMSI ranges and MSISDN ranges are separated into dedicated (indexed) databases respectively containing multitudes of IMSIs and multitudes of MSISDNs, with some form of cross-referencing provided between the IMSI and MSISDN indexed databases to maintain any relationship between a particular MSISDN and a particular IMSI.
- HLR router 64 is shown in greater detail. To provide the flexibility of allowing a user to retain a current MSISDN, or to request a particular (special) MSISDN or to conserve IMSIs by allowing a mapping of a new MSISDN to an IMSI located in a different HLR, the HLR router 64 operates to map a MSISDN to a routing number MSISDN (RN-MSISDN).
- RN-MSISDN routing number MSISDN
- the HLR router 64 which is invisible to a subscriber of the network, is therefore a large database that contains MSISDNs associated with RN-MSISDNs for substantial portions of the entire communication system. Consequently, in the new system architecture (shown in FIG.
- HLRs are re-configured to have a range of RN-MSISDN addresses (rather than a range of MSISDNs), with each address associated with a particular IMSI from a range of IMSIs in a particular HLR.
- HLR N contains RN-MSISDN addresses 1060 to 1079 and IMSI addresses 2060 to 2079, with one or more of the range of RN-MSISDN addresses capable of being mapped onto a single IMSI.
- HLR router 64 when a mobile terminated call originated from external network 16 is directed to HLR router 64 by Gateway MSC 18, the MSISDN identified in the call from the external network 16 is mapped onto the RN-MSISDN which then re-directs (maps) the MSISDN (in the form of an intermediate address, i.e. the RN-MSISDN) to the correct HLR and hence the correct IMSI.
- the HLR router 64 is operationally responsive to a processing unit 66, which intelligently routes the intermediate address to the correct HLR. This processing unit may be located at the HLR router 64, or elsewhere within the communication system, such as at Gateway MSC 18.
- the function of the present invention may, alternatively, be considered as separating assignable MSISDNs from IMSIs by providing a HLR router. Mapping of at least one MSISDN to a single IMSI across HLR platforms (having fixed address ranges) is then accomplished by providing an intermediate address (i.e. the RN-MSISDN) common to both the HLR router and a HLR, whereby a directory number assigned to a subscriber (as an electronic code in a cellular phone or as a SIM card in the case of the GSM communication system) is converted to a RN-MSISDN in the HLR router, whereafter the RN-MSISDN is intelligently networked to the HLR containing that RN-MSISDN. Therefore, since the RN-MSISDN in the HLR is also associated (mapped) with a dedicated IMSI, the information in the IMSI relating to the originally dialed directory number (MSISDN) is obtained by the communication system and forwarded accordingly.
- an intermediate address i.e.
- HLR router 64 The operation of the interface provided by HLR router 64 can be better understood with reference to the following examples in collaboration with FIG. 4.
- a roaming subscriber unit such as mobile 46
- MSISDN directory number
- HLR 3 which contains the specified RN-MSISDN range
- a subscriber has lost their assigned SIM card on which the originally assigned IMSI was recorded.
- the original directory number assigned to the subscriber was "100". Since the subscriber wishes to retain this original directory number (whilst maintaining security of IMSI information stored in the subscriber's home location register), RN-MSISDN "1060" is associated with this original directory number in HLR router 64. Consequently, a call directed towards directory number "100” will be re-routed to HLR N and hence to new IMSI "2060".
- HLR router 64 maps new directory number "3584" to RN-MSISDN "122", which routing number MSISDN directs the call to HLR 2 and hence IMSI "1020".
- HLR router 64 associates (maps) this special directory number with RN-MSISDN "108" (associated previously with originally assigned MSISDN "108"). Therefore, when special directory number "12345" is subsequently called, HLR router 64 routes the call to IMSI "1008" in HLR 3 .
- the HLR router 64 may also include a protocol translator 70 associated with each RN-MSISDN.
- the function of this protocol translator 70 is to translate, for example, a MAP protocol into a proprietary protocol which is subsequently used as the communication link to the HLR. This can be seen in FIGS. 3 and 4. More particularly, a MAP protocol may exist between Gateway MSC 18 and HLR router 60, but a proprietary protocol may be utilised between HLR router 60 and one or more of the HLRs, e.g. HLR N .
- the protocol translator 70 enables interconnection of a proprietary network to an existing cellular communication system by providing the necessary "soft" interface required for the routing of a call.
- FIG. 5 illustrates partitioning of subscriber information within HLRs (which provides database decoupling), according to a second embodiment of the present invention.
- HLRs which provides database decoupling
- the communication system in accordance with the invention need only comprise a switch (having a relationship between directory numbers (MSISDNs) and HLRs--such as the Gateway MSC 94), a first HLR (coupled to the switch and having a range of directory numbers (MSISDNs), for establishing the call with the external network if the directory number (MSISDN) identified in the call is in the range of directory numbers (MSISDNs) associated with the first HLR--such as the HLR 7 ) and a second HLR (coupled to both the first HLR and the external network, for accepting information from the first HLR to establish the call to the subscriber unit when the call is not established by the first HLR--such as the HLR 8 or the HLR 9 ).
- MSISDNs directory numbers
- MSISDNs range of directory numbers
- each HLR is coupled (typically through a MAP interface) to Gateway MSC 18, which Gateway MSC 18 contains a routing table 94 that relates HLRs with particular ranges of MSISDNs and IMSIs.
- routing table 94 identifies HLR 7 as containing a range of MSISDN addresses between "20000” and "29999" and a range of IMSI addresses between "200000" and "209999".
- Memory block 91 typically contains several data fields, including a dedicated IMSI-field 92 for a related IMSI address (in this specific instance IMSI address "200000") and data representing a distinct basic service related to a particular MSISDN.
- IMSI address such as IMSI address "300000”
- IMSI address is stored in a corresponding memory block 93 reserved for this IMSI address.
- Memory block 93 typically contains several data fields, including a dedicated MSISDN-field 94 for a related MSISDN address (in this specific instance MSISDN address "30000") and, perhaps, a field dedicated for storage of a Local Area Identifier (LAI).
- each memory block (e.g. 91) in each MSISDN-keyed database in each HLR can provide a cross-reference to another memory block (e.g. 93) in each IMSI-keyed database in each HLR (even if the databases are geographically (physically) separated between HLR platforms of a communication system).
- each database (80-90) in each HLR can contain many thousands of memory blocks (and hence many thousands of MSISDN and IMSI addresses).
- the HLR searches for a corresponding record on the relevant IMSI-keyed database or MSISDN-keyed database, i.e. the type of search proceeds on the basis of whether an IMSI address or MSISDN address was received and therefore on whatever function was invoked. Therefore, the HLR can either provide information required to perform a function directly from the database first searched, or can access the required information (that therefore resides in another database) by accordingly routing the request through the use of the IMSI-MSISDN cross-reference already stored in the first accessed database.
- a HLR receives a routing inquiry (from Gateway MSC 18) containing the MSISDN of the called party.
- the HLR accesses the subscriber data in the MSISDN-keyed database in an attempt to determine the location of the called party. Since location information (in the form of a LAI) is stored against the IMSI of the called party, the HLR takes the IMSI of the called party from the MSISDN-keyed database and accesses the IMSI-keyed database to find the location.
- the HLR may then contact the serving MSC of the called party to complete the routing inquiry on behalf of the Gateway MSC.
- the handling of out-of-range numbers during inbound call routing is facilitated in the following manner.
- the IMSI-keyed database resides on one HLR (the second or "secondary" HLR) and the MSISDN-keyed database is placed in the HLR that owns that particular MSISDN number range (the first or "primary" HLR). Since a routing inquiry from a Gateway MSC is based on the MSISDN, the primary HLR is contacted.
- the primary HLR finds the location of the called party (which is stored in the IMSI-keyed database on the secondary HLR) by translating the MSISDN into the corresponding IMSI.
- the translation is performed by the processing unit 96 coupled to the primary HLR (HLR 7 as shown in FIG. 5).
- the primary HLR forwards a Forward Send Routing Information signal to the secondary HLR, which signal contains the IMSI of the called party and the corresponding data representing the associated basic service.
- the primary HLR is able to forward the Forward Send Routing Information signal to the correct HLR because the IMSI of the called party is in the unique and defined range for that HLR.
- the secondary HLR accesses the IMSI-keyed database to find the called parties location (stored in the LAI) and then contacts the serving MSC to obtain the necessary routing information. Subsequently, this routing information is passed from the secondary HLR to the Gateway MSC to route (and thus establish) the incoming call.
- SMS short message service
- a subscriber is content with their MSISDN allocation (e.g. address "20000”. Therefore, the HLR internally jumps between the MSISDN-keyed database and IMSI-keyed database (since both MSISDN "20000” and IMSI "200000” are probably located on a common HLR).
- a subscriber has lost the assigned SIM card and does not want to change from directory number (MSISDN) "20001".
- MSISDN directory number
- a new SIM and hence a new IMSI ("300001") on a new HLR (HLR 8 rather than HLR 7 ) is assigned to the subscriber.
- Subscription data is entered in IMSI-keyed database 88 of new HLR 8 (which HLR becomes the primary HLR).
- the MSISDN record "20001" of MSISDN-keyed database 80 of HLR 7 is amended (which HLR becomes the secondary HLR) to include a cross-reference 92 to new IMSI "300001".
- the handling of calls then operates as described above.
- a subscriber asks for a directory number (MSISDN) "40000" that it out-of-range of HLR 7 .
- MSISDN directory number
- IMSI address "200001" (previously associated with the originally assigned MSISDN) of IMSI-keyed database 86 remains in HLR 7 (which HLR becomes the primary HLR).
- a subscriber record (including a cross-reference 95) is created in MSISDN-keyed database 84 of HLR 9 , since HLR 9 contains the desired directory number (MSISDN) "40000” in its MSISDN number range (whereafter HLR 9 becomes the secondary HLR).
- MSISDN desired directory number
- the interface arrangement of the present invention allows a network operator greater flexibility in system management by providing a mechanism for separating MSISDNs and IMSIs between HLR platforms.
- the network operator is able to continue to use IMSIs associated with lost SIM cards (without affecting security of that IMSI), and to continue to use an IMSI which would otherwise be out-of-range for a special directory number requested by a subscriber.
- a subscriber is therefore able to retain a current directory number.
- a network operator need only alter (change) the mapping between the MSISDN and the RN-MSISDN in the HLR router to change a directory number (for whatever reason).
- any relationship (such as a geographic relationship) between RN-MSISDNs and IMSIs in a particular HLR can be maintained by the use of the HLR router. Therefore, there is no distribution of subscriber information in the system, which may be beneficial to the network operator in terms of communication system maintenance and control.
- a network operator need only alter the IMSI-MSISDN cross-reference between the distinct, partitioned (and potentially physically separate) IMSI and MSISDN storage areas in the HLR(s).
