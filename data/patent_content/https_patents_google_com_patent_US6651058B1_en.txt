Definitions
- the present invention relates to the field of data mining, and particularly to a software system and associated methods for automatically discovering terms that are relevant to a given target topic from a large databases of unstructured information such as the World Wide Web (WWW). More specifically, the present invention relates to the automatic and iterative recognition of relevant terms by association mining and refinement of co-occurrences.
- WWW World Wide Web
- WWW World Wide Web
- search engines play an important role in furnishing desired information to the end users, the organization of the information lacks structure and consistency. Web spiders crawl web pages and index them to serve the search engines. As the web spiders visit web pages, they could look for, and learn pieces of information that would otherwise remain undetected.
- Bibliometrics involves the study of the world of authorship and citations. It measures the co-citation strength, which is a measure of the similarity between two technical papers on the basis of their common citations. Statistical techniques are used to compute this measures. In typical Bibliometric situations the citations and authorship are explicit and do not need to be mined. One of the limitations of the Bibliometrics is that it cannot be used to extract buried information in the text.
- HITS Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search
- a common technique for accessing textual materials is by means of a “keyword” combination, generally with boolean connections between the words or terms.
- This searching technique suffers from several drawbacks. First, the use of this technique is limited to text and is not usable for other types of material. Second, in order to develop a searchable database of terms, the host computer must usually download the entire documents, which is a time-consuming process, and does not normally provide an association between related terms and concepts.
- a computer program product is provided as an automatic mining system to discover terms that are relevant to a given target topic from a large databases of unstructured information such as the World Wide Web (WWW).
- the system and methods enable the automatic and iterative recognition of relevant terms by association mining and refinement of co-occurrences.
- the operation of the automatic mining system is performed in three stages: The first stage is carried out by a new terms discoverer for discovering the terms in a document d i ; the second stage is carried out by a candidate terms discoverer for discovering potentially relevant terms; and the third stage is carried out by a relevant terms discoverer for refining or testing the discovered relevance to filter false (or insignificant) relevance.
- the new terms discoverer includes a system for the automatic mining of patterns and relations, a system for the automatic mining of new relationships, and a system for selecting new terms from relations.
- the system for the automatic mining of patterns and relations identifies a set of related terms on the WWW with a high degree of confidence, using a duality concept, and includes a terms database and two identifiers: a relation identifier and a pattern identifier.
- the system for the automatic mining of new relationships enables the discovery of new relationships by association mining and refinement of co-occurrences, using automatic and iterative recognition of new binary relations through phrases that embody related pairs.
- the system for the automatic mining of new relationships is comprised of a database a knowledge module and a statistics module.
- the knowledge module includes one or more of the following units: a stemming unit, a synonym check unit, and a domain knowledge check unit. New terms are obtained from relations discovered by the system for automatic mining of patterns and relations of the same kind by selecting an item (or a column) of a pair.
- the candidate terms discoverer is comprised of a metadata extractor, a document vector module, an association module, a filtering module, and a database for storing the mined sets of relevant terms.
- the relevant terms discoverer includes a stop word filter and a system for the automatic construction of generalization-specialization hierarchy of terms.
- the system for the automatic construction of generalization-specialization hierarchy of terms includes a terms database, an augmentation module, a generalization detection module, and a hierarchy database.

- WWW World Wide Web
- FIG. 1 portrays the overall environment in which automatic mining system 10 according to the present invention can be used.
- the automatic mining system 10 includes a software or computer program product which is typically embedded within, or installed on a host server 15 .
- the automatic mining system 10 can be saved on a suitable storage medium such as a diskette, a CD, a hard drive, or like devices.
- a suitable storage medium such as a diskette, a CD, a hard drive, or like devices.
- the cloud-like communication network 20 is comprised of communication lines and switches connecting servers such as servers 25 , 27 , to gateways such as gateway 30 .
- the servers 25 , 27 and the gateway 30 provide the communication access to the WWW Internet.
- Users, such as remote internet users are represented by a variety of computers such as computers 35 , 37 , 39 , and can query the automatic mining system 10 for the desired information.
- the host server 15 is connected to the network 20 via a communications link such as a telephone, cable, or satellite link.
- the servers 25 , 27 can be connected via high speed Internet network lines 44 , 46 to other computers and gateways.
- the servers 25 , 27 provide access to stored information such as hypertext or web documents indicated generally at 50 , 55 , 60 .
- the hypertext documents 50 , 55 , 60 most likely include embedded hypertext link to other locally stored pages, and hypertext links 70 , 72 , 74 , 76 to other webs sites or documents 55 , 60 that are stored by various web servers such as the server 27 .
- the automatic mining system 10 includes a computer program product such as a software package, which is generally comprised of a new terms discoverer 90 , a candidate terms discoverer 100 , a relevant terms discoverer 110 , and a relevant terms database 130 .
- the relevant terms database 130 stores the relevant terms mined by the automatic mining system 10 . In an alternative design, the relevant terms database 130 does not form part of the automatic mining system 10 .
- a crawler that resides in the host server 15 , visits and downloads every web page or document d i on the WWW at periodic intervals, for example about once a month. During such visits, the crawler downloads all or selected sections of the document d i to the new terms discoverer 90 which discovers the terms existing in the document d i , and which limits their scope by providing a preliminary selection of those terms that are relevant to the target topic of interest. For example, in the context of a grocery shopping, the new terms discoverer 90 limits the terms in the database to grocery items by excluding or filtering non-grocery items such as hardware.
- the candidate terms discoverer 100 identifies potentially relevant terms by the frequency of their co-occurrence.
- the relevant terms discoverer 110 filters the terms mined by the candidate terms discoverer 100 to determine the accuracy of these terms and their meaningful (or close) relevance to the target concept. This is accomplished by eliminating non-meaningful co-occurring terms. For example, banana is a “major” or frequent term that occurs in a significant number of grocery shopping carts (i.e., banana is frequently purchased), and has no particular relevance to other co-occurring terms (i.e., to other purchased grocery items). As a result, the relevant terms discoverer 110 can eliminate banana from the list of closely relevant terms.
- the terms resulting from the new terms discoverer 90 are considered to be relevant and are stored in the relevant terms database 130 .
- the new terms discoverer 90 defines the terms that need to be examined for their relevance to a target topic (or concept).
- a target topic can be defined as a description of the cluster of the topic's instances in a database.
- For a given target topic and a database of HTML documents discovering a relevant topic is to discover a topic whose cluster significantly overlaps with the target topic's cluster. In other words, a significant number of the relevant topic's instances belong to the target topic's cluster. The significance is determined by a user-defined threshold. In the illustration described herein, relevance is defined in terms of co-occurrence of terms.
- the resulting quality might not be acceptable because the full text of the documents d i includes noise and unrelated terms.
- One goal of the automatic mining system 10 is to increase the accuracy of the relevance between terms by eliminating unnecessary noise and unrelated terms.
- the new terms discoverer 90 generally includes a system 135 for the automatic mining of patterns and relations, a system 140 for the automatic mining of new relationships, and a system for selecting new terms from relations 142 .
- the system 135 identifies a set of related terms on the WWW, with a high degree of confidence, using a duality concept. Duality problems arise, for example, when a user attempts to identify a pair of related phrases such as (book, author); (name, email); (acronym, expansion); or similar other relations.
- the system 135 addresses the duality problems by iteratively refining mutually dependent approximations.
- the system 135 iteratively refines (i) pairs of terms that are related in a specific way, and (ii) the patterns of their occurrences in web pages, i.e., the ways in which the related phrases are marked in the web pages.
- the system 135 runs in an iterative fashion for continuously and incrementally refining the patterns and patterns.
- FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary system 135 for the automatic mining of patterns and relations, which is comprised of a terms database 80 and two identifiers: a relation identifier 150 and a pattern identifier 160 .
- the terms database 80 contains sets of relations that have been identified by the relation identifier 150 as well as sets of patterns that have already been identified by the pattern identifier 160 .
- the terms database 80 begins with small seed sets of relations and patterns that are continuously and iteratively broadened by the system 135 .
- a more complete description of the system 135 can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/439,379, titled “System and Method for the Automatic Mining of Patterns and Relations”, which is incorporated herein by reference.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary system 140 for the automatic mining of new relationships that uses the automatic and iterative recognition of new binary relations through phrases that embody related pairs by applying lexicographic and statistical techniques to classify the relations, and further by applying a minimal amount of domain knowledge of the relevance of the terms and relations.
- New terms are obtained from relations discovered by the system for automatic mining of patterns and relations of the same kind by selecting an item (or a column) of a pair. For example, for the purpose of identifying relevant products, one can obtain all the product names from the product item (or column) of (company, product) pairs of a production relationship.
- the system 140 includes a database a knowledge module 165 and a statistics module 200 .
- the knowledge module 165 inquires whether or not a new relation exists in the set of relations. If the relation is deemed not to exist, the knowledge module 165 forwards the pair and the derived relation to the statistics module 200 . The derived relation is stored in a relationship database 210 . If the knowledge module 165 determines that the relation already exists, the knowledge module 165 terminates the mining progress and proceeds to mine additional pairs and relations.
- the knowledge module 165 includes one or more of the following units: a stemming unit 170 , a synonym check unit 180 , and a domain knowledge check unit 190 .
- the stemming unit 170 determines if the relation being analyzed shares a common root with a previously mined relation.
- the synonym check unit 180 identifies the synonyms of the relation.
- the domain knowledge check unit 190 considers the content of the document d i or semantic meaning or categorization of each item in the relation for indications that would further clarify the relationship being mined.
- the statistics module 200 optimizes and increases the confidence level in the relationship.
- the second stage of the operation of the automatic mining system 10 is carried out by the candidate terms discoverer 100 which is illustrated in FIG. 6 .
- the candidate terms discoverer 100 presumes that a hypertext document that discusses a certain target topic references related concepts using hyperlinks. Based on this premise, the candidate terms discoverer 100 aims at learning frequently co-occurring and thus potentially relevant terms by finding associations rules among the terms appearing on the hyperlink metadata of the web pages. The terms that are identified by strong association rules are likely to be relevant to the target topic, and therefore form a set of potentially relevant terms or candidate terms.
- One feature of the candidate terms discoverer 100 is to design metrics that address the learning process of relevant terms by finding associations among terms that appear as link annotations, and to minimize the association errors resulting from one or more of the following sources: false associations governed by the rules of association algorithms; the unknowability of the optimal metric of significance for a domain; and the large amount of noise contained within the web pages.
- FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary candidate terms discoverer 100 , which is comprised of a metadata extractor 220 , a document vector module 230 , an association module 240 , and a filtering module 250 .
- the candidate terms discoverer 100 further includes a database 260 for storing the mined sets of relevant terms. The set of relevant terms is continuously and iteratively broadened by the candidate terms discoverer 100 .
- the metadata extractor 220 identifies all the hypertext link metadata in the document di.
- the document vector module 230 creates a document vector for each document d i .
- the document vector module 230 does not list duplicate terms or the frequency of occurrence of all the terms.
- the association module 240 measures the number of documents that contain the terms, regardless of the frequency of occurrence of the terms within a single document d i . Such measurement enables the association module 240 to perform the necessary statistical analyses.
- the filtering module 250 filters strong association rules of which relevance surpasses a user specified threshold.
- a set of strong association rules R can be expressed as follows:
- t is a term and T is a topic term
- rel (tT) is a relevance metric of the association rule such as support of confidence
- c is a user-specified threshold
- association rule ct T in R.
- the terms in such association rule are candidate terms.
- U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/440,602 is now pending titled A System and Method for the Automatic Recognition of Relevant Terms by Mining Link Annotations”, which is incorporated herein by reference.
- the third stage of the operation of the automatic mining system 10 is carried out by the relevant terms discoverer 110 which is illustrated in FIGS. 7, 8 .
- the relevant terms discoverer 110 compensates for the presence of false association among the candidate terms and the target topic, and aims at retaining only or principally the clearly relevant terms.
- the relevant terms discoverer 110 generally includes a stop word filter 270 and a system 275 for the automatic construction of generalization-specialization hierarchy of terms.
- the stop word filter 270 excludes known stop words from the set of candidate terms (CT) developed by the candidate terms discoverer 100 .
- the stop word set (SWS) contains words that bear no or little relevance to the target topic and appear with a high frequency in most of the documents d i .
- Exemplary stop words are: api, com, edu, faq, free, ftp, gif, html, http, ieee, li, map, mime, mpeg, ol, org, site, tr, toc, ul, url, web, www, and so forth.
- the system 275 for the automatic construction of generalization-specialization hierarchy of terms builds a relevance model based upon a generalization-specialization hierarchy. Initially, starting with only the target topic, the relevance model is progressively constructed by new terms and the generalization relationship between the new terms and the existing terms in the relevance model. A generalization relationship between a new candidate term (Ct) and a term in the relevance model (rt), is added to the relevance model if the taxonomy declares the candidate term (ct) to be a specialization of the term in the relevance model (rt).
- LGG Least General Generalization
- a generalized term by LGG is said to be overgeneralized, if the co-occurrence between the generalized term and its specialization in the relevance model is below a predetermined threshold.
- a predetermined threshold As an example, in a random sample set (S) of documents the co-occurrence of the LGG and a term (rt) in the relevance model that is a specialization of the LGG is measured by the joint probability of the LGG and the term (rt). If the joint probability of the LGG and the relevance model in the set (S) is less than a user provided threshold (t), i.e.
- the LGG is overgeneralized, and the LGG is not added to the relevance model. Based on this relevance model, a candidate term is determined to be relevant to the target topic if the candidate term is a specialization of a term in the relevance model.
- FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary system 275 for the automatic construction of generalization-specialization hierarchy of terms that enables the automatic and iterative recognition of relevant terms using, for example, the Least General
- the system 275 is generally comprised of a terms database 280 , an augmentation module 282 , a generalization detection module 284 , and a hierarchy database 286 .
- the terms database 280 stores the sets of terms and their associated meanings (Mi), and the hierarchy database 286 stores the mined generalization hierarchy.
- the set of terms includes the set of mined generalizations, and the generalization hierarchy is defined by a set of edges and a set of terms.
- the augmentation module 282 One function of the augmentation module 282 is to update the set of terms knowing the terms stored in the terms database 280 .
- This feature is implemented by a generalization technique such as the “Least General Generalization” or LGG model.
- the generalization detection module maps the LGG sets that are stored in the terms database 280 and the LGG terms that are derived by the augmentation module 282 , updates the set of edges (or hierarchical or generalization relationships), and derives a generalization hierarchy.
- the system 275 begins with no predefined taxonomy of the terms, and the LGG model derives a generalization hierarchy, modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), from the set of terms.
- DAG Directed Acyclic Graph
- the generalization hierarchy maps the generalization and specialization relationships between the terms.
- the operation of the automatic mining system 10 is represented by a process 300 that includes the three stages previously described.
- the new terms discoverer 90 carries out the first stage of discovering the terms in a document d i .
- the candidate terms discoverer 100 carries out the second stage of discovering potentially relevant terms at step 310 .
- the relevant terms discoverer 110 carries out the third stage of refining or testing the discovered relevance to filter false (or insignificant) relevance, at step 315 .
