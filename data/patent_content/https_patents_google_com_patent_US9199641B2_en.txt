Further, the computing device may be configured to determine an area 1002 within a threshold distance 1004 of a surface of the road 404 .
- the threshold distance 1004 may be about 30 inches or more to include cones of standardized lengths (e.g., 18 inches or 28 inches). Other threshold distances are possible based on the standard specifications regulating a particular construction zone.

- the computing device may be configured to identify a construction zone cone 1008 in the LIDAR-based image 1006 .
- the computing device may be configured to determine, for each identified construction zone object, a respective likelihood of the identification.
- the computing device may be configured to determine a shape of the cone 1008 defined by respective points of a set of points representing the cone 1008 .
- the computing device may be configured to match the shape to one or more shapes of standard construction zone cones.
- the computing device may be configured to determine a match metric indicative of how similar the shape is to a given standard shape of a typical construction zone cone (e.g., a percentage of match between dimensional characteristics of the shape and the given standard shape).
- the respective likelihood may be determined based on the match metric.
- the computing device may be configured to cluster points (e.g., the points forming the cone 1008 ) depicted in the LIDAR-based image 1006 together into a cluster, based on locations of the points or relative locations of the points to each other.
- the computing device further may be configured to extract from the cluster of points a set of features (e.g., minimum height of the points, maximum height of the points, number of the points, width of the cluster of points, general statistics of the points at varying heights, etc.).
- the computing device may be configured to process this set of features through a classifier to determine whether the cluster of points represent a given construction zone cone.
- the classifier can map input information (e.g., the set of features extracted from the cluster of points) to a class (e.g., the cluster represents a construction zone cone). Examples of classifiers, training data, and classification algorithms are described above with regard to block 304 of the method 300 illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- typical construction zone cones may be required by the standard specifications of construction zones to be made of a retroreflective sheeting materials such as glass beads or prisms, and the computing device may be configured to compare intensity values of points forming the cone 1008 to a threshold intensity value of the retroreflective sheeting material. Based on the comparison, the computing device may be configured to confirm identification of the cone 1008 , for example.
- the computing device may be configured to exclude cones that are away from the road by a certain distance, since such cones may indicate a work zone that is away from the road and may not affect traffic. Also, in an example, the computing device may be configured to exclude sets of points that represent objects that clearly cannot be construction zone cones based on size as compared to a typical size of typical construction zone cones (e.g., too large or too small to be construction zone cones).
- the computing device may be configured to identify the construction zone cone based on LIDAR-based information received from two (or more) consecutive scans by the LIDAR to confirm the identification and filter out false identification caused by electronic or signal noise in a single scan.
- the method 900 includes determining, using the computing device, a number and locations of the one or more construction zone objects.
- the standard specifications for construction zones also may specify requirements for number of and spacing between the cones. In an example, tighter spacing may be specified, under some conditions, to enhance guidance of vehicles and drivers. Table 1 illustrates an example of minimum spacing between construction zone cones based on speed limits.
- the computing device may be configured to further determine the number and locations of the identified cones.
- the computing device may be configured to detect or identify, based on the LIDAR-based information, the cone(s) 406 and also determine number of the cone(s) 406 as well as locations or relative locations of the cone(s) 406 with respect to each other.

- the computing device may be configured to estimate a respective distance between pairs of cones.
- the method 900 includes determining, using the computing device, a likelihood of existence of a construction zone, based on the number and locations of the one or more construction zone objects.
- a single cone on a side of the road may not be indicative of an active construction zone. Therefore, in addition to detecting presence of or identifying cones on the road, the computing device may be configured, for example, to determine, based on the number and locations (e.g., relative distance) of the cones, that the cones may form a lane boundary and are within a predetermined distance of each other, which may be indicative of an active construction zone causing road changes.
- the computing device thus may be configured to determine a likelihood or confirm that the cones are indicative of a construction zone, based on the determined number and locations of the cones.
- the computing device may be configured to determine the number and locations of the construction zone cones based on the LIDAR-based information, and compare a pattern formed by the identified construction zone cones to a typical pattern formed by construction zone cones in a typical construction zone (e.g., pattern of cones forming a lane boundary).
- the computing device may be configured to determine that the detected construction zone cones are associated with a construction zone based on the comparison, and determine the likelihood accordingly.
- the computing device may be configured to generate a probabilistic model (e.g., a Gaussian distribution), based on the determined number and locations of the cones to determine the likelihood of existence of the construction zone.
- a probabilistic model e.g., a Gaussian distribution
- the likelihood may be determined as a function of a set of parameter values that are determined based on the number and locations of the identified cones.
- the likelihood may be defined as equal to probability of an observed outcome (the cones are indicative of a construction zone on the road) given those parameter values.
- the computing device may be configured to process information relating to the number and locations of the cones through a classifier to determine the likelihood.
- the classifier can map input information (e.g., the number and location of the cones) to a class (e.g., existence of the construction zone). Examples of classifiers and classification algorithms are described above with regard to block 304 of the method 300 illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- a training computing device may be configured to receive training data for a plurality of driving situations of a given vehicle.
- respective training data may include, for each of the plurality of driving situations, respective LIDAR-based information relating to a respective 3D point cloud of a respective road.
- the computing device may be configured to identify respective cones as well as determine respective number and locations of the respective cones.
- the computing device may be configured to receive positive or negative indication of respective existence of a respective construction zone corresponding to the respective training data for each of the driving situations.
- the training computing device may be configured to correlate, for each driving situation, the positive or negative indication with the respective training data, and determine parameters (e.g., vector of weights for equation 1) of the classifier based on the correlations for the plurality of driving situations. These parameters may be provided to the computing device configured to control the vehicle such that as the computing device receives the LIDAR-based information, the computing device may be configured to process the LIDAR-based information through the classifier using the determined parameters of the classifier to determine the likelihood.
- parameters e.g., vector of weights for equation 1
- the likelihood may be qualitative such as “low,” “medium,” “high” or may be numerical such as a number on a scale, for example. Other examples are possible.
- the method 900 includes modifying, using the computing device, a control strategy associated with a driving behavior of the vehicle, based on the likelihood of the existence of the construction zone on the road.
- the computing device may be configured to modify or select, based on the determined likelihood of the existence of the construction zone, a control strategy comprising rules for actions that control the vehicle speed to safely maintain a distance with other objects and select a lane that is considered safest given road changes due to the existence of the construction zone. Examples of modifying the control strategy based on the likelihood are described above with regard to block 306 of the method 300 illustrated in FIG. 3 .
- the method 900 includes controlling, using the computing device, the vehicle based on the modified control strategy.
- Controlling the vehicle may include adjusting translational velocity, or rotational velocity, or both, of the vehicle based on the modified driving behavior.
