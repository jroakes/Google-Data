Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to web search engines.
- Modern search engines allow a user to initiate search queries for items of information. Such a search engine executes such queries based on one or more search terms of each query and provides search results, e.g., a listing of different web pages, via an interface of the search engine, e.g., at the user's web browser. Some search engines are configured to personalize search results for a particular user, based on different search data associated with the user and the user's search query.
- the disclosed subject matter relates to providing user control of personalized search results returned for search queries submitted by a user via an interface of a search engine.
- the subject technology can be embodied in an example method, which includes receiving a search query from a user via an interface of a search engine. Different user-selected options for excluding at least one search category in a plurality of predetermined search categories are identified. Each search category corresponds to one or more query signals and page signals used by the search engine to execute search queries.
- the search query is executed by computing a score for each potential result of the search query to be executed based on the user-selected options, one or more query signals related to the search query received from the user, and one or more page signals related to each potential result of the search query to be executed. Search results are provided to the user based on the executed search query.
- FIG. 1 is a diagram of an example network environment suitable for practicing an implementation of the subject technology.
- FIG. 2A illustrates an example graphical user interface of a client application for providing search results to a user of a search engine based on a search query submitted by the user via the interface.
- FIG. 2B illustrates an example options panel of the graphical user interface of FIG. 2A for selecting search categories to ignore during execution of search queries.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example system for providing user control of personalized search results returned for search queries submitted by a user via an interface of a search engine.
- FIG. 4 is a process flowchart of an example method for providing user control of personalized search results returned for search queries submitted by a user via an interface of a search engine.
- FIG. 5 conceptually illustrates an example electronic system in which some of the subject technology may be implemented.
- the disclosed subject matter relates to providing user control of personalized search results returned for search queries submitted by a user via an interface of a search engine.
- a capability may, for example, allow the user to selectively control or limit the degree to which a search engine may personalize search results for user-submitted search queries.
- an interface of a search engine is provided to the user via a client application executable at the user's computing device.
- An example of such a client application includes, but is not limited to, a web browser.
- the interface of the search engine in this example may be provided to the user via the web browser.
- the search engine interface in this example may be, for example, a web page loaded within the web browser.

- GUI graphical user interface
- the search engine interface may include, for example and without limitation, a search field for receiving a search query comprising one or more search terms submitted by the user in addition to a content area for providing search results upon executing the user-submitted search query.
- the search engine interface provided to the user may include various user options corresponding to different categories of search signals used by the search engine to personalize the search results provided to the user for each executed search query.
- the user may enable or disable one or more of these user options in order to vary the amount of personalization that the search engine is configured to use when providing the user with search results for executed search queries.
- a benefit of the subject technology as described herein may include, but is not limited to, providing the user with relatively more flexibility with respect to the types of information the search engine may consider when executing search queries and returning the results of these queries.
- the techniques allow the user to convey the user's actual search preferences directly to the search engine, rather than having to rely on inferences made automatically by the search engine, e.g., based on browser settings or global search options that may apply to all or only a single type of information that may be used by the search engine when executing a search query received from the user and providing the user with appropriate search results based on the executed query.
- web page data and “web page content” are used herein to refer to any data or resource that can be provided over a network including, e.g., the Internet or World Wide Web (or “the web”), and be presented to a user, e.g., via a web browser.

- query signals may be derived directly from the search query itself and may include, but are not limited to, the search term(s) of the query, the particular type of web browser 115 used to submit the query and the user's geographic location.
- Additional query signals may be derived from various attributes associated with the particular user. Such attributes may be associated with, for example, a public profile stored for the particular user in the search engine. Further, such user attributes may be based on, for example, the user's activities within a web browser including, but not limited to, the user's search or browsing history. Other attributes may be, for example, personal attributes of the particular user including, but not limited to, the user's geographic location.
- the user's geographic location may correspond to that of web browser's 115 geographic location. Further, the geographic location may be based on, for example, the IP address associated with browser 115 or clients 110 a - c . Additional query signals may be derived from information associated with the user, e.g., as stored in data store 134 , as described above.

- GUI 200 includes a web page address field 202 that enables a user at the computing device to enter a location address (e.g., URL) corresponding to a web page to be loaded within the browser.
- GUI 200 includes other user control elements including, for example, navigation controls for the user to navigate between different web pages to be loaded and displayed within a content area 215 .
- the web page content loaded in the web browser may be for a web interface of a search engine that the user can use to submit web search queries.
- the user may enter the one or more search terms of the search query via a search field 210 of the search engine's interface using one or more user input devices coupled to the computing device (e.g., a mouse for selecting inside search field 210 and a keyboard for entering text characters).
- the interface of the search engine may be integrated with the web browser, for example, as a separate search field (not shown) of GUI 200 .
- the search engine may display a list of search results in the form of, for example, web page content or data loaded within content area 215 .
- the search results displayed in content area 215 may include, for example, a list of links to different web pages that may be relevant to a particular search query submitted by the user.
- the user may select a search result displayed in content area 215 by, for example, selecting a link to a web page using a user input device, as described above.
- search query options 220 may be displayed as different entries or items in a pop-up or drop-down list control element in association with search field 210 .
- each of these search query options 220 may correspond to different search signals used by the search engine to execute search queries submitted by the user via search field 210 .
- the degree to which the search engine filters search results based on a comparison of query and page signals may be adjusted in accordance with the user's preferences for personalized search results.
- the user may specify such preferences via an options panel of GUI 200 of FIG. 2A , as shown by the example of FIG. 2B .
- FIG. 2B illustrates an example options panel 230 for selecting search categories to ignore during execution of search queries.
- Options panel 230 may be accessible via, for example, an option displayed in a menu control (not shown) of GUI 200 .
- the user may specify such preferences by toggling various options in a list of options presented to the user via options panel 230 .
- each user option corresponds to a category of search signals, e.g., including both query and page signals, used by the search engine to personalize search results.
- search signals e.g., including both query and page signals
- different user-dependent or query signals used by the search engine may be grouped into predetermined categories for the user.
- an example of such a category may include a “Geographical” category that groups query signals related to the user's location including, but not limited to, the user's current location, past locations and search history involving geographic locations of interest or travel plans (e.g., searches for airline ticket prices).
- categories may include, but are not limited to, a “Search History” category including all of the user's previously submitted search queries and corresponding results selected in addition to a “Social” category including signals related to the user's social connections or contacts associated with an email account or profile in a social networking site or service.
- FIG. 3 illustrates an example system 300 for providing user control of personalized search results returned for search queries submitted by a user via an interface of a search engine.
- system 300 includes a client device 310 , a web browser 315 executable at device 310 and a search engine 335 executable at a server system 330 .
- client device 310 may be implemented using, for example, any of clients 110 a - c of FIG. 1 , as described above.
- system 300 may be described using GUI 200 of the web browser of FIG. 2A , as described above, but is not intended to be limited thereto.
- web browser 315 may correspond to, for example, browser 115 of FIG. 1 or the web browser of FIG. 2A , as described above.
- Client device 310 communicates with server system 330 (e.g., system 130 of FIG. 1 , as described above) via a network 320 (e.g., network 120 of FIG. 1 , as described above).
- search engine 335 identifies relevant search results 306 (e.g., web pages or other content) for a search query to be executed by analyzing a plurality of search signals for the search query.
- search signals may include, for example, user-dependent query signals 302 related to the user and/or search query received from the user, e.g., via an interface of search engine 335 at web browser 315 as well as page signals 304 related solely to the potential search results (e.g., relevant web pages) to be presented to the user.
- the query signals 302 may be derived directly from the search query itself and may include, but are not limited to, the search term(s) of the query, the particular type of web browser 315 used to submit the query and web browser's 315 geographic location (e.g., based on the IP address associated with browser 315 or client device 310 ). Additional query signals 302 may be derived from information associated with the user or an online account/profile of the user that is public or has been made available to search engine 335 . Such information may include, for example and without limitation, the user's social connections within an online social networking site or service, the user's search history (e.g., previous search queries submitted and/or search results selected by the user) or other public information associated with the user (or user profile). Further, such information for the user may be stored, for example, in an online data store accessible to the search engine or within a search cookie file linked to the web browser 315 at the user's computing device.
- Page signals 304 may be related to web pages to be provided as results of the search query may be derived from, for example, web page content that is local to an individual web page or global across multiple web pages (e.g., based on the number or quality of web pages that may be linked to the individual web page). Examples of different page signals may include, but are not limited to, the frequency of search terms within the contents of a web page, the language(s) of such web page content, the source of the content (e.g., country the page or corresponding web site may be hosted) and the type or nature of the content (e.g., advertisements vs. informational).
- search engine 335 may execute a search query for the user by first comparing the page signals 304 related to web page content in a list of potential search results for the query and query signals 302 related to the user and/or search query itself. The search engine 335 may then compute a score for each web page or potential search result (e.g., in the list of potential search results), based on the comparison between page signals 304 and query signals 302 . It should be noted that search engine 335 may be use any of various techniques for computing the score for each potential search result. Further, such techniques may compute the score based on various inputs including query signals and page signals.
- the computed score of each web page or potential search result may represent the relevance of each search result with respect to the user's search query in comparison with other search results in list of potential search results.
- the relative score of each potential search result may then be used to rank the web pages/search results in the list of potential search results.
- the search engine 335 may then provide search results to the user by filtering out from the list any search result or web page having a score (or “page rank”) that falls below a predetermined threshold score or ranking.
- the degree to which the search engine 335 filters search results based on query and page signals may be adjusted in accordance with the user's preferences for personalized search results.
- the user may specify such preferences by toggling various options in a list of options presented to the user via an interface of the search engine 335 .
- each user option corresponds to a category of search signals, e.g., including both query and page signals, used by the search engine 335 to personalize search results.
- different user-dependent or query signals used by the search engine 335 may be grouped into predetermined categories for the user.
- examples of such categories may include, but are not limited to, a “Geographical” category that groups query signals related to the user's location, a “Search History” category including all of the user's previously submitted search queries and a “Social” category including signals related to the user's social connections or contacts.
- a category may include query signals, page signals or any combination thereof.
- a user option to disable a category may cause the search engine 335 to remove query signals, page signals or both types of signals from consideration when ranking search results or filtering such results based on rank, as described above. For example, if a page signal is removed, the search engine 335 will no longer compare or attempt to match the removed page signal against any remaining query signal. Similarly, if a query signal is removed, the search engine 335 will no longer compare or attempt to match the removed query signal against any remaining page signal.
- the use of categories to represent different search signals allows the search engine 335 to provide the user with a relatively easy way to enable/disable relevant search signals, without revealing any implementation details with respect to the specific search signals being used by the search engine.
- the options selected by the user may be stored as the user's search preferences, for example, in association with a user account or profile for the search engine 335 .
- the use of such search categories also helps to ensure that such user preferences remain persistent over multiple user sessions and any future updates to the search engine 335 that may change the particular signals used by search engine 335 to personalize search results (e.g., by removing or replacing existing signals or adding new signals). For example, a user preference to disable a particular search category (e.g., the “Geographical” category) still would be effective for any new search signals that pertain to this category and that may be added during an update of the search engine 335 .
- a particular search category e.g., the “Geographical” category
- the list of user options for enabling or disabling different search categories may be provided to the user via an interface of the search engine 335 .
- Such an interface may be presented to the user, for example, as an online interface via a web page loaded within web browser 315 for the search engine 335 .
- such an interface may be provided as part of a user interface of the web browser 315 itself.
- the search engine 335 may define a protocol for a web browser 315 to communicate the user's search preferences (e.g., specified via an interface of the web browser 315 ) to the search engine 335 .
- the user preferences may be obtained by the search engine 335 from the web browser 315 , for example, when the user navigates to a web page associated with the search engine 335 using the browser 315 or when a search query is received from the user via an interface of the search engine 335 (e.g., as provided to the user via the web page).
- the user preferences sent from the browser 315 to the search engine 335 may include, for example, user options specifying the particular search categories to disable.
- search engine 335 may be configured to map each user option or search category (e.g., each option displayed in options panel 230 of FIG. 2B , described above) from the browser's 315 interface to one or more corresponding search signals (e.g., that may be specific to the search engine's particular implementation).
- search signals e.g., that may be specific to the search engine's particular implementation.
- the list of options displayed to the user may be specific to the particular type browser.
- the names and types of search categories may vary from one browser to another.
- search engine 335 may define a standardized protocol or application programming interface (or API) for each browser to use in order to implement the search functionality and features of search engine 335 within the browser.
- Such a protocol or API of search engine 335 may define, for example, a data format that browser 315 can use to specify each search category option and any associated data, which search engine 335 may in turn use to map the specified search category to the appropriate set of search query signals.
- the search engine 335 can support different types of web browsers, e.g., which conform to the protocol defined by the search engine.
- FIG. 4 is a process flow chart of an example method 400 for providing user control of personalized search results returned for search queries submitted by a user via an interface of a search engine.
- method 400 will be described using system 300 of FIG. 3 , as described above. However, method 400 is not intended to be limited thereto. Thus, the steps of method 400 may be performed by, for example, search engine 335 of system 300 of FIG. 3 , as described above.
- Method 400 begins in step 402 , which includes receiving a search query from a user via an interface of a search engine.
- step 404 it is determined whether the user selected any search signal options for excluding one or more search signal categories. If it is determined in step 404 that the user did not select any search signal options, method 400 proceeds to step 406 , in which the search query is executed as normal, without excluding any search signals. In this case, method 400 proceeds directly to step 414 , in which search results are provided to the user (e.g., via a web browser) based on the executed query.
- step 404 if it is determined in step 404 that the user specified such options, method 400 proceeds to step 408 , in which user-selected options are identified for excluding at least one search category in a plurality of predetermined search categories.
- Each predetermined search category may correspond to, for example, one or more of a plurality of query signals and page signals used by the search engine to execute search queries.
- Step 410 includes comparing one or more query signals related to the search query received from the user and one or more page signals related to each potential result of the search query to be executed.
- the comparison in step 410 is based on the user-selected options identified in step 408 , discussed above. In an example, at least one of the plurality of identified query signals and page signals may correspond to a search category to be excluded from the comparison.
- the search query is executed by the search engine (e.g., search engine 300 of FIG. 3 , as described above) based on the comparison in step 408 .
- step 414 the search results are provided to the user based on the executed search query in step 412 .
- Computer readable storage medium also referred to as computer readable medium.

- multiple software aspects of the subject disclosure can be implemented as sub-parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software aspects of the subject disclosure.
- multiple software aspects can also be implemented as separate programs.
- any combination of separate programs that together implement a software aspect described here is within the scope of the subject disclosure.
- the software programs when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems, define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.
- a computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, object, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.
- a computer program may, but need not, correspond to a file in a file system.
- a program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code).
- a computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.
