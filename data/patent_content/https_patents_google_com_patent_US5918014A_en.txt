Definitions
- This invention involves the display of advertising to users of an interactive communications medium. It is particularly useful with the World Wide Web, which utilizes a communications protocol on the Internet.
- a CPU central processing unit
- RAM random access memory
- Internet connection for instance, through a phone line and modem
- input device such as a keyboard
- output device such as a TV, CRT or LCD.
- This invention is based on the fact that people who have shown a tendency for similar interests and likes and dislikes in the past will usually continue to show a tendency for such similarities in the future. In particular, people who have shown a historical tendency to be interested in the same ads in the past will usually continue to display such a tendency as time goes on. Those people who strongly display such similarities with respect to a particular person (who we will refer to as “the subject") are referred to as that person's "community.”
- this invention combines techniques for solving two problems: determining the subject's community, and determining which ads to show based on characteristics of the subject's community.
- the information used to determine whether a given individual should be in the subject's community is gleaned from the activities of the individual in the interactive medium in question.
- the information may involve such facts as the choices of Web sites the individuals have each visited, the frequency of such visits, the nature of the content at those sites, etc. If the sites are online stores, the information may involve the choice of specific items purchased, as well as the prices of those items.
- the site is an entertainment recommendation service based on user-supplied ratings (Firefly at www.ffly.com is an example), the ratings can be used.
- This information is used as the basis for calculations which generate a (usually numeric) measure of similarity between individuals.
- similarity measures are well-known to programmers of ordinary skill in the field of collaborative filtering.
- clusters are formed of groups of very similar consumers. Then, the subjects community consists of all or some of the other members of his cluster.
- the next major task is to decide what ads to show the subject based on his community.
- a new ad is displayed randomly or on a fixed schedule to a certain number of users. During this "training period" for the new ad, a certain percentage of the members of the subject's community will click on it. If this is an unusually high proportion, then there is a relatively high likelihood that the ad will be of relatively high interest to the subject.
- statistical techniques are used to determine a probability, associated with a fixed confidence level, with which we can assume a randomly-chosen member of the subject's community will tend to click on the ad; this probability is used as the measure of similarity.
- Other embodiments involve other analytic techniques.
- the advertiser specifies the demographic profile he wants to show the ad to.
- the system targets ads by considering the subject's community members who have supplied demographic information. For instance, by computing the average age of the members of the subject's community who have supplied their ages, the system is enabled to make an "intelligent guess" about the subject's age, and use that guess for the purpose of targeting ads.
- special Web pages or sites are supplied which enable advertisers to specify specific specific sites they would like their ads to run on (or not run on); similarly, special Web pages or sites are supplied which enable Web site administrators to specify ads they would like to display or not display.
- means are supplied for consumers to specify and update their demographic information; these means take the form of a Web site or page in one embodiment, and software running on the consumer's computer in another.
- software running on the consumer's computer makes the choices about which ads are to be displayed for that user.
- This embodiment has the advantage that it obviates the need for a central database storing detailed information about consumer together with an identifier for each consumer; so the consumer's privacy is protected.
- FIG. 1 is a flowchart diagram for the steps performed in selectively displaying one or more advertisements to a subject in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.
- the system begins by tracking activities of the subject in the interactive medium (step 10). Next, the system derives information from the activities of the subject (step 20). The system then determines a community of the subject using all or a portion of the information (step 30). Finally, the system determines which of the one or more advertisements to present to the subject based on the subject's community by displaying a new advertisement for a training period and determining whether a high or low proportion of members of the subject's community have chosen to view further information about the advertisement (step 40).
- a Smart Ad Box is an area on a Web page (usually rectangular) which is used to display Web advertising. Special software algorithms are used to determine which ads are shown to which users; different visitors to a Web page can simultaneously see different ads.
- a number of factors can be used by the software in determining which ads to show. For instance, based on their Dec. 6, 1995 press release, the company C
- a Dec. 19, 1995 press release from Novo Media Group indicates at least somewhat similar plans.
- This invention involves using automated collaborative filtering (ACF) either instead of, or in addition to, the above-mentioned techniques.
- ACF is also referred to as social information filtering.
- ACF can be used in a complementary manner to techniques such as those C
- ACF can give us a certain amount of evidence that a particular ad should be shown to a particular user; such information as age, sex, Internet domain, etc. can be considered as well.
- the Smart Ad Box consists of a small amount of HTML code. It may optionally involve non-HTML code, such as Java. It involves calling a CGI routine.
- the Smart Ad Box When a Smart Ad Box appears on a page, a user viewing that page will see an ad which is targeted to that particular user. Thus, simultaneous viewers of the same page will often be presented with different ads.
- the ad is visually contained in the Smart Ad Box.
- the Smart Ad Box may or may not be rectangular in shape; it will often, but not necessarily, exist in a fixed region on the screen.
- the Smart Ad Box will present different ads to a user over time. Certainly, simply showing the same ad over and over again is not maximally effective. The user would simply become used to it and would therefore come to ignore it.
- This invention involves rotating the user through different ads which are of likely to be of interest to that particular user.
- the rotation schedule can be chosen for maximal overall advertising effectiveness.
- One way to measure effectiveness would be the frequency of clicks on ads in Smart Ad Boxes--the rotation schedule could be chosen to maximize this number. It could involve such information as the number of times the user has seen each ad in the past, and the predicted likelihood that the user will be interested in the given ad.
- Another factor that could be considered is resonance with the Web page showing the ad--perhaps ads that relate in some way to the subject matter of the page will be more likely to be clicked on.
- particular implementations of the present invention can optionally include certain additional features, such as the ability to reject an ad--for instance, with an option-click of the mouse. A user would do this for an ad that had no interest for him. The rejected ad would automatically be replaced with another ad targeted to that user.
- the central database can optionally contain rules or control records provided by advertisers and Web site managers. These could be used for the following purposes:
- An advertiser may not want to be associated with certain Web sites or types of Web sites; alternatively there may be certain sites or types of sites they would like to be associated with as strongly as possible. Advertisers could specify such inclinations, and they can be stored in a database. Then, when the software is choosing the next ad to show to a particular user who is visiting a particular Web site, those factors can be taken into account.
- a Web site may prefer certain advertisers or advertisements or types of advertisements to others.
- the Web site can specify such inclinations, and they can be taken into account when the next ad is chosen for a particular user currently visiting that Web site.
- a check box could appear next to each item. If the advertiser clicks a checkbox for an item which has subordinate items (for instance, the user may have clicked on the checkbox for a Web site which was listed with its individual pages) then the checkboxes for the subordinate items could be automatically "checked” or "filled in” by the software. (Java or JavaScript could be used to do this in "real-time” instead of requiring the user to submit the form.) But a number of other mechanisms could be used instead of checkboxes--for instance, the listings could change color to indicate having been chosen. Checkboxes are probably preferable, though, since their meaning is so intuitively clear.
- advertisers should be able to retrieve the information already entered for a particular ad. For instance, an advertiser may change his mind about showing an ad on a given site. So, by specifying the ad's identifier, the advertiser should be presented with a listing of pages which indicate the choices he has already made; ideally, he should be able to change those choices using the same techniques used to enter those choices originally--for instance, by clicking on the checkboxes.
- allowed ads could be presented hierarchically by subject matter, with checkboxes at both levels.
- the ad listings could, optionally, consist of the ad banners themselves. Alternatively, they could be "hot-linked" text that the webmaster could click on to be transported to a page containing the banner (which might additionally have other information supplied by the advertiser about the ad). There should optionally also be a way for the webmaster to visit the site that the banner will be linked to; this could be accomplished simply by hotlinking the banner to the site, just as will be the case for users. It could also be accomplished other ways, including having a button, next to the listing for the ad, which is hotlinked to the related site.
- the system could work the opposite way. Instead of enabling advertisers to offer ads to chosen Web sites, the process could start with Web sites offering pages to advertisers, which could then choose which pages they want to accept.
- Hierarchies could be collapsible, similar to the way files are listed in the Finder of Macintosh's System 7 operating system when View is "by Name.” This would enable people using the lists to navigate them more effectively, especially if the actions for expanding and collapsing hierarchy levels were very fast.
- a Java applet could be written which handled some or all aspects of the user interaction.
- Web pages can optionally display a hot link to a site where users can enter their demographic data. Users can optionally be given the ability to modify their demographic data at any time. Finally, if they wish to, they can optionally be given the ability to delete their demographic data at any time.
- users should have easy access to information stating how the demographic data is used, and who has access to it.
- the Web site that allows users to update or delete their demographic data could optionally also allow users to specify a chosen level of privacy. For instance, some users might wish to allow companies to have access to their demographic data in order to receive certain special offers (which could be made by direct mail, email, or other means).
- users could choose companies by means of a hierarchically-organized list, grouped by product category. Again, the hierarchies could be collapsible in order to increase ease of navigation. Of course, the companies could alternatively by listed in some other manner, such as alphabetical order.
- Users can be induced to supply such data by special offers such as discounts on selected merchandise.
- the system could optionally be designed so that similar users were grouped into statistical clusters; all the people in one cluster would be more similar to each other than to people in any other cluster.
- information describing the clusters could be sent to Sam's machine, which could decide which cluster Sam was in.
- a variety of different types of information could be sent to Sam's machine describing each cluster. For instance, the average amount of time spent on each tracked Web site, where that number is computed from the data corresponding to all users in the cluster, would be a good candidate. For each cluster, this number could be sent for every tracked page (or for only a subset of the tracked pages, which could be chosen, for instance, for their statistical significance). Then, software running on Sam's machine could determine how closely each cluster matches Sam's activities; Sam would be considered to be in the cluster he matches most closely.
- information about each user or cluster into Sam's computer could be sent about the demographics which apply to each ad. These demographics could be supplied to the system by the advertiser or ad agency, or could be determined by a central computer by means of ACF as described elsewhere in this document.
- Inline Plug-Ins unlike Java applets, have the ability to write directly to the user's hard disk. (The situation for Java applets may change in the future, and other technologies may emerge that can accomplish the same purposes.) This ability is essential for storing the user's data.
- the Inline Plug-In could, if desired, handle all functionality of displaying the ad, determining what ad to show, and reading and writing the relevant information from and to the hard disk. Otherwise, this functionality could be divided the between the Inline Plug-In and other software, such as Java applets.
- a separate application could be written, which the user could download, to manage his demographic information on his hard disk.
- This program could contain the user interface that would enable him to easily update the information.
- the cookie mechanism provides a very high level of security.
- a user's randomly generated cookie is stored on the user's machine; and that is the one and only way information stored on a central database is associated with that user.
- the cookie mechanism is such that only programs with the same domain name as the one that created the cookie can read or modify it. So while the system's central server machine can track a user by means of the cookie, a program existing under a different domain name will not be able to access the cookie at all.
- Each Web page which contains a Smart Ad Box will contain code, which may be comprised of HTML, Java, or other languages, which will allow a user to be tracked. (This code may work in conjunction with other software, such as Netscape-style Inline Plug-Ins.) In addition, such means for tracking a user can be embedded in pages that do not themselves display advertising. Pages which have the ability to cause a central database to be updated with tracking information will be referred to in this document as "tracking-enabled.”
- a central database will be updated to show that that particular user visited that page.
- the length of time spent on the page, or other such information can also be stored.
- a CGI script can exist on the machine which is hosting the page. To perform updates, it would communicate over the Internet with a program which exists on the machine hosting the database.
- the identifier of the ad displayed for the user in the smart ad box is the identifier of the ad displayed for the user in the smart ad box.
- the preferred embodiment involves using the Netscape Navigator's cookie mechanism. This will allow us to accurately track the 70% to 80% of Web users who use the Netscape product. In addition, it will work with any Web browser that has a cookie mechanism compatible with Netscape's. It is likely that the vast majority of Web browsers will, in time, have such compatibility.
- the preferred way to use it is as follows:
- a CGI script is executed.
- This CGI script referred to in this document as the Tracking Script, is referenced by each tracking-enabled page; that is, all tracking-enabled pages, which may be spread out over many different host machines, will all call the same Tracking Script which exists on just one machine or networked group of machines accessible through the one URL. (It is necessary for the Tracking Script to exist under just one domain tail in order to receive the cookie no matter which page the user is on.
- a CGI on a machine with a different domain tail will have no way to access the cookie.
- a domain tail consists of the "tail end" of the domain name such that the included portion contains at least 2 or 3 periods, depending on the particular top-level domain. For more on this, see Netscape's technical note on the Web at http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie -- spec.html or any other documentation on Netscape's cookie mechanism, which is a public protocol that any competent practitioner is familiar with.
- a set of Tracking Scripts could be made available, all under the same domain tail, such that a particular participating Web site could interact with one of these routines. For instance, there might be different properties associated with the different Tracking Scripts--for instance, in cases where the Tracking Scripts also draw the Smart Ad Boxes, different Tracking Scripts might draw Smart Ad Boxes of different sizes. Again, it is essential that all of these Tracking Scripts be under the same domain tail in order that they can all access the cookie.
- the Tracking Script will examine the cookies passed to it to see whether one of them is the Tracking Cookie.
- this cookie will contain the identifier of the user; the central database can then be updated with the ID of the user and of the current page, and, optionally, other information such as the time spent on the page.
- the expiration date of the Tracking Cookie could be updated; for instance, it could always be set to one year after the last Tracking Cookie access.
- the value of the Tracking Cookie could be generated using a random number generator; one of many other alternatives would simply be to pick a number one greater than the last value generated.
- the Tracking Cookie is then stored on the user's machine using the Netscape cookie mechanism; each time from then on that a user visits a tracking-enabled page, the stored Tracking Cookie will be used to re-identify that user.
- the Tracking Cookie should be assigned an expiration date so that it doesn't disappear when the user leaves. The expiration date could be, for instance, one year in the future.
- Tracking Cookie will not allow anyone to intrude on the user's privacy by sending him email or by any other means. There need be no way to associate the Tracking Cookie with the user's name, physical location, or any other personally-identifying information.
- the challenge is to get the code that does this tracking into the user's machine. Users don't want to manually download software unless they clearly understand that there is a fundamental benefit in it for them.
- Java applet would be the perfect means to track user activity over time. But current implementations of Java automatically flush Java applets from the cache whenever the user moves to a domain other than the one the Java applet originally came from. So Java currently has limited usefulness for this purpose.
- a Web browser could automatically open up a socket for communications with the central database. At intervals, it could send tracking information to the central database without any participation on the part of the user. This information could include, for example, the URL of each page visited and the amount of time spent there.
- the user could download an application or other type of software (such as a Macintosh-style control panel or system extension) which could track his activities and communicate them to the central database.
- an application or other type of software such as a Macintosh-style control panel or system extension
- This software could operate with the cooperation of the Web browser.
- the Netscape Navigator allows user activities to be communicated to separate applications; on the Macintosh, this mechanism is based on Apple Events.
- Screensavers typically run all the time, although they only take over the screen when the user is inactive.
- this screensaver could be designed so that it could display HTML and/or execute Java code. In fact, it could have much of the functionality of a Web browser. (Or, it could use its own protocols for displaying images and text on the screen, different from those used in Web browsers. However, it would probably be best for it to use standard protocols.)
- An example of content that would motivate many users to download the Internet Screensaver would be a continuously updated stock ticker.
- a couple of other examples would be continuously updated news headlines or weather reports.
- a further example might be showing the status of the user's email box.
- the software could enable an Internet connection for a brief period in every hour (or other interval) during which news headlines, weather, stock prices, or other information could be downloaded and displayed during periods of user inactivity during the intervening hour.
- the Internet screensaver could simply wait for the user to log on to the Internet, and download content at that time to be used as content until the next user-initiated Internet connection.
- the content could include news stories, etc.; it could also include less timely content such as comic strips.
- the Internet Screensaver could interact with the operating system of the user's computer to perform other functions.
- a clock residing on the Internet
- it could periodically retrieve the exact time from a clock residing on the Internet, and then use that information to set the clock in the user's computer.
- the current time according to the US Naval Observatory is available on the World Wide Web at http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl
- a "drift" factor could be computed.
- the screensaver could then update the clock at regular intervals to compensate for expected drift; it could do this between access to the true time over the Internet.
- Screensaver does not necessarily have to be a separate piece of software from a Web browser.
- a Web browser could itself be a screensaver, through the addition of screensaver-related capabilities such as the ability to sense user inactivity, the ability to bring itself into the foreground when user inactivity is sensed, and the ability to completely take over the screen so that only the desired screensaver content is visable usual menus, etc. would be hidden!.
- Screensaver content is usually, but not exclusively, a dark screen containing moving images.
- Such a Web browser could use its regular graphics abilities to display screensaver content in the form of HTML, Java, JavaScript, or other protocols.
- Bookmark files contain a form of tracking information. They list the sites the user visited and liked enough to want to be able to easily visit again. Also, Netscape's bookmarks file, for instance, contains the dates that the user created the bookmark for each site as well as the date the user last visited the site. These could be used to make inferences about how useful the user finds the site--for instance, if he bookmarked a site a long time ago and visited it very recently, it's fairly likely that it's one of his more frequently-accessed sites.
- WebHound Web site (now called WebHunter) which was produced by the MIT Media Lab does, in fact, use bookmark files to facilitate recommendation of Web sites by means of automated collaborative filtering.
- a Java applet would be a candidate, except that security restrictions currently prohibit Java from reading files on the user's hard disk. Lifting this restriction in the case of bookmark files would solve this problem.
- Code can be provided to a number of Web sites that enable them all to access the same central database when a user logs in, enabling the user to use the same user ID and password on many different Web sites and potentially freeing each Web site from the need to have a database for checking whether each user had already registered.
- This code can update a central database to show which participating sites have been accessed by each user.
- a Web site (or, perhaps, a page or set of pages) should be made available that contains complete instructions on how to set up a participating page. Instructions should explain how to place a Smart Ad Box on a page, as well as how to enable the tracking of users on a page (if the embodiment involves separate code for tracking and for the Smart Ad Box).
- the code could be designed in such a way that there need be no direct communication between the people supplying the Smart Ad Box service and related services and the people who want to enable their Web site to participate in those services. Any competent practitioner could design such code. Furthermore, it should be designed in such a way that the modifications required to enable a Web page to participate are minimal. Again, any competent practitioner could design such code.
- an instructional site would enable participation in the service to grow rapidly. Web sites could very easily become participants on a trial basis.
- the Web site discussed in this section could allow participating Web sites to determine the amount of money they have earned to date by virtue of their participation. (It is expected that advertisers will pay the company offering Smart Ad Box and related services, and that this company will pay the participating Web sites.)
- each participating site could have an identifying code and/or password which they acquire through interaction with the instructional Web site or some other Web site.
- the participating sites themselves could choose their ID codes and/or passwords, or they could be assigned by the software.
- advertisers have ID codes and/or passwords, they should be able to go to a particular page and type in that information, and, in return, be enabled to see the amount of money they have earned to date.
- an embodiment could identify companies by other means, such as checking a cookie on the client machine or simply allowing companies to type in the company name.
- Web sites who would like to become paid participants would be able to accomplish everything needed online, without manual intervention. This would save considerable money, and make it even more practical to allow small Web sites to participate.
- Prospective participants could input whatever information is required for payment; for instance, if physical checks are to be sent through the mail, this information would include the address and the name to make the check out to.
- the system could automatically cause payment to be made.
- Checks could be printed, or funds transmitted by electronic means, all with no (or minimal) human intervention.
- the system could optionally be programmed not to send a payment until the money owed to the participating sound exceeded some preset amount. This way, the expense of sending the payment will only be a small percentage of the funds involved.
- Web page input is based on hardware such as a video screen, keyboard, random access memory, etc. The techniques described here are a method for enabling this hardware to achieve the desired ends.
- ACF is a field of research which has been receiving attention in recent years from such organizations as BellCore and the MIT Media Lab. I myself devoted 18 months over the last few years to research in this area.
- An MIT Media Lab spinoff company called Agents, Inc. has a Web site which uses this technology for making personalized recommendations of music CD's.
- Agents, Inc. Upendra Shardanand's 1994 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab Master's Degree thesis, entitled Social Information Filtering For Music Recommendation (hereby incorporated by reference) is a good write-up of their basic technology.
- a list of similar users can be stored in the database, or can be generated "on the fly.” Ideally, we would also compute a number representing the degree of likely similarity of interests. In fact, the list of similar people can be based on this number: for example, the most similar person to Joe is at the top of the list, and each successive entry displays less similarity until some cutoff point is reached, beyond which people aren't added to the list.
- This data will involve the information we have stored in our database by tracking each user over time. (Optionally, it could also involve other information such as demographic data supplied by the user; but by not relying on such data, we eliminate the need for the user to actively participate in this process in any way.)
- the system "knows" which Web sites Joe has visited, and, possibly, how often he has visited each one, the amount of time spent at each one, which ads he clicked on or rejected, and/or other information. We will have collected similar information with respect to other users.
- Joe and the other user will have visited none or very few of the same sites. In other cases, the tracking information will show that they are remarkably similar in the sites they've chosen to visit; this would be indicative of a high degree of similarity of interests.
- the current embodiment is one in which users can (perhaps optionally) provide demographic information, then some users who are similar to Joe will, most likely, have supplied such information. Since they have similar interests to Joe, there is a probability that their demographic backgrounds will also be similar to Joe's.
- the software can therefore make intelligent guesses about Joe's demographic data. For instance, with regard to age, the software can compute the average age of the people close to Joe who have supplied us with their ages. The same idea holds for income level. The software can guess items such as sex by extrapolating from the most common sex of people with similar interests to Joe. Similarly, the software can make intelligent guesses about other categories of demographic data. The specific technique used to make the extrapolation isn't the concern here. The point is that an extrapolation can easily be made.
- the software can check to see which ads are most highly targeted for Joe. However, even if the advertiser hasn't given that information, the software can examine the data to see which demographic groups have showed the most interest in each ad--so the system can supply this information if the advertiser doesn't.
- Joe's interests are atypical for his demographic group. For instance, some people in their 50's have interests that are more common for people in their 30's. Thus, the technique described here may incorrectly come to the conclusion that Joe is in his 30's when he's really in his 50's--but that erroneous conclusion would actually lead, in this case, to a better targeting of advertisements. If Joe's interests are closer to those of a person in his 30's, then ads directed to that age group are the ads that are most likely to be of interest to him.
- This ratio provides a very rough measure of the interest of people on the list in the ad. The greater the ratio, the more interest is indicated.
- the ad with the highest ratio would be considered to be the one most likely to be of interest to Joe; the ad with the second highest ratio would be the one second most likely to be of interest; etc.
- the fitness function would be the algorithm's success in predicting which ads are of interest to Joe. For purposes of the genetic programming process, the fitness function would measure how good a particular algorithm is at "predicting" how interested Joe was in ads that he has already been exposed to, and where we have already counted how many impressions it took him to click on them.
- weights can be generated by trial and error or by other means.
- P not R
- R is the number we're really interested in.
- R is just a rough estimate of P. The reason for this is that we only have a limited amount of data available to us; if we had an unlimited amount of data, R would be the same as P.
- P A is a number that we can have a known degree of confidence in.
- P A there are a number of different approaches for computing P A .
- One of these uses the cumulative binomial distribution together with a search algorithm.
- the search algorithm successively tests possible values for P A at certain fixed intervals, for instance, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, . . . , 0.99 until it finds the greatest P A such that we can reject the null hypothesis that P ⁇ P A with confidence level A.
- a binary search mechanism is used to accomplish the same goal more quickly and/or accurately. We'll refer to the chosen search algorithm as S(). Let C() be the cumulative binomial probability distribution function.
- C() will calculate the probability that the presented combination of (2) and (3) (or a greater number of successes) could have occurred by chance alone given the assumption of (1). If this is a low probability, it's unlikely that the assumption is correct.
- S() will repeatedly call C() with different trial values for P, until it finds one (P A ) such that the the calculated probability is A. If we have chosen a low A, then this would imply that we can confidently reject the hypothesis that P ⁇ P A .
- P A can determine the order in which we present the ads; they are presented in reverse order of P A .
- genetic programming could be used to evolve an algorithm that outputs an approximation to P A .
- the system orders the ads by using demographic data and also orders the ads using a "pure ACF” approach, such that the most appropriate ads for a given user come first, then the two approaches could easily be combined by calculating the average position for each ad.
- the ad might be the nth ad in the demographic-based ranking and the mth ad in the "pure ACF” ranking; the combined rank could be (n+m)/2.
- cluster analysis can be used.
- Joe instead of comparing Joe to each individual user, we can compare Joe to clusters of similar users. These clusters will be comprised of individuals with similar demographics and/or tracking histories. The degree of similarity between people will be computed as described above; in each cluster, each individual will be more similar to people in his own cluster than to people in other clusters.
- the system has to collect data on a number of users which shows whether or not they responded to particular ads. Then, when, for instance, the system needs to compute the priority with which we should consider showing a particular ad to Joe, it finds users with similar profiles to Joe and who it has knowledge about whether or not they responded to the ad. But this creates a chicken-or-egg situation; when an ad is new, there won't be any users who have already been exposed to the ad, so the system will be unable to find users who are similar to Joe and who it has prior knowledge about with respect to that ad.
- the desired proportion of displaying ads according to the ACF output relative to displaying ads randomly or according to a fixed schedule can be determined by measuring such factors as overall system-wide number of responses to ads in a given period of time (which should ideally be high) and polling users on their satisfaction with the system.
- a mathematical analysis could also be used in predicting the best proportion.
- a simple and sensible starting point would be to simply assign 10% of viewing time to randomly chosen ads.
