- information e.g., characteristics such as demographic information, user interests, etc.
- more effective advertisements can be selected (e.g., advertisements that appeal to interests shared by a number of users that are presently within a certain proximity to a content presentation medium), and such advertisements can be further configured/formatted in a manner that accounts for characteristics of various users and/or their respective proximities to the content presentation medium.
- third party content providers such as advertisers can provide content, such as advertisements, in a manner that more effectively accounts for characteristics of various users, as well as the proximity of such users to the medium on which such advertisements are presented.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing an example content presentation system 100 .
- one or more third party content providers such as advertisers, using advertiser devices 102 , can directly, or indirectly, enter, maintain, and log third party content information such as ad information in a content management system such as advertising management system 104 .
- a content management system such as advertising management system 104 .
- the ads can be in the form of graphical ads, such as banner ads, text-only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, media ads, interactive ads, ads combining one or more of any of such components, etc.
- the ads can also include embedded information, such as links, meta-information, and/or machine executable instructions.
- One or more first party content providers such as publishers, using publisher devices 106 , can submit requests for third party content items such as ads to the system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending third party content items to the requesting publisher device 106 for placement on, or association with, one or more of the publisher's content items (e.g., web properties such as web pages).
- third party content items such as ads can be provided in a substantially similar manner in television and radio content slots (such as advertising slots), and/or print media space.
- Other entities such as users, using user devices 108 , and third party content providers such as the advertisers, using advertiser devices 102 , can provide usage information to the system 104 , such as, for example, whether or not a conversion (e.g., a purchase or other interaction including, for example, a request for driving directions to a location associated with a third party content item such as an ad, navigating to the location associated with a third party content item such as the ad, or walking to the location associated with a third party content item such as the ad) or a click-through related to a third party content item such as an ad (e.g., a user has selected a third party content item such as an ad) has occurred.
- a conversion e.g., a purchase or other interaction including, for example, a request for driving directions to a location associated with a third party content item such as an ad, navigating to the location associated with a third party content item such as the ad, or walking to the
- This usage information can include measured or observed user behavior related to third party content items such as ads that have been served.
- a user may enable and/or disable the recording or observation of such usage information.
- identifiers associated with each user may be anonymized so that the identity of each user is not provided to a third party content provider such as the advertiser.
- the system 104 can perform financial transactions, for example, crediting first party content providers such as the publishers 106 and charging third party content providers such as the advertisers 102 based on the usage information.
- a content presentation/delivery medium such as advertising medium 112 can provide a setting where first party content (such as that originating at one or more publishers) and/or third party content (such as that originating at one or more advertisers, e.g., ads) can be displayed, projected, and/or otherwise disseminated.
- first party content such as that originating at one or more publishers
- third party content such as that originating at one or more advertisers, e.g., ads
- advertising media 112 include LCD/LED display screens (or any other such screen or medium capable of depicting one or more advertisements, such as a billboard or sign) and loudspeakers/sound projection devices (capable of projecting audio advertisements).
- advertising medium 112 can be equipped with and/or otherwise in communication with any number of communications components and/or devices (not shown) that can enable the perception of and/or communication with user devices 108 A-F by advertising medium 112 .
- a network 110 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof, connects advertiser devices 102 , the system 104 , publisher devices 106 , user devices 108 , and advertising medium 112 .
- LAN local area network
- WAN wide area network
- the Internet one or more telephony networks or a combination thereof, connects advertiser devices 102 , the system 104 , publisher devices 106 , user devices 108 , and advertising medium 112 .
- One example publisher device 106 is a general content server that receives requests for first party content (e.g., articles, discussion threads, music, video, graphics, search results, web page listings, information feeds, etc.), and retrieves the requested first party content in response to the request.
- the content server can submit a request for third party content such as ads to a content server such as an advertisement server in the system 104 .
- the third party content item request can include a number of third party content items such as ads desired.
- the third party content item request can also include content request information.
- This information can include the content itself (e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content), a category corresponding to the content or the content request (e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.), part or all of the content request, content age, content type (e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.), geo-location information, etc.
- content e.g., page, video broadcast, radio show, or other type of content
- a category corresponding to the content or the content request e.g., arts, business, computers, arts-movies, arts-music, etc.
- content age e.g., text, graphics, video, audio, mixed media, etc.
- geo-location information e.g., geo-location information, etc.
- the content server or a client browser can combine the requested first party content with one or more of the third party content items such as ads provided by the system 104 .
- the combined first party content and third party content items such as ads can be sent/rendered to the user devices 108 that requested the content for presentation in a viewer (e.g., a browser or other content display system).
- the content server can transmit information about the third party content items such as ads back to the content server, including information describing how, when, and/or where the third party content items such as ads are to be rendered (e.g., in HTML or JavaScriptTM).
- the first party content and/or the third party content items such as ads can be sent/rendered to and advertising medium 112 (e.g., a digital display screen) for presentation thereon.
- Another example publisher device 106 is a server that provides a search service.
- a search service can receive queries for search results.
- the search service can retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages).
- Search results can include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and can be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.
- the search service can submit a request for third party content items such as ads to the system 104 .
- the request can include a number of third party content items desired. This number can depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the third party content items, and/or a variety of other factors. In some implementations, the number of desired third party content items will be from one to ten, or from three to five.
- the request for third party content items can also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and/or information associated with, or based on, the search results.
- Such information can include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or “docIDs”), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (“IR”) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages), full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc.
- IR scores can be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.
- the content management system 104 includes an auction process to select third party content items such as ads from the third party content providers such as advertisers.
- third party content providers such as the advertisers can be permitted to select, or bid, an amount they are willing to pay for each presentation of or interaction with (e.g., click of) a third party content item, e.g., a cost-per-click amount a third party content provider pays when, for example, a user clicks on a third party content item.
- the cost-per-click can include a maximum cost-per-click, e.g., the maximum amount the third party content provider is willing to pay for each click of an third party content item based on a keyword, e.g., a word or words in a query.
- Other bid types can also be used. Based on these bids, third party content items can be selected and ranked for presentation.
- the search service can combine the search results with one or more of the third party content items provided by the system 104 . This combined information can then be forwarded to the user devices 108 that requested the content.
- the search results can be maintained as distinct from the third party content items, so as not to confuse the user between paid third party content items and presumably neutral search results.
- one or more publisher devices 106 can submit requests for third party content items such as ads to a content management system such as advertising management system 104 .
- the system 104 responds by sending third party content items to the publisher device 106 for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content) that are relevant to the web property.
- the advertising management system can provide sports-related ads to the publisher device 106 .
- the requests can instead be executed by devices associated with the user 108 , e.g., by the execution of a particular script when the publisher's web page is loading on a client device.
- an ad push model is used to provide third party content items such as ads from third party content providers such as advertisers.
- ads can be pushed to idle screens (e.g., of a mobile devices or particular applications) based on particular criteria (e.g., the user's location).
- the referenced publisher can be a mobile application developer.
- a mobile application is an application specifically designed for operation on a mobile device (e.g., a smart phone).
- the mobile application can also include ads positioned within the content of the mobile application. Similar to publishers, the ads can be received from the system 104 for placement in the mobile application when accessed by a user device (e.g., when a particular page of a mobile application is loaded on the mobile device).
- one or more content presentation mediums can submit requests to a content management system such as advertising management system 104 for third party content items such as ads.
- the system 104 responds by sending third party content items to the advertising medium 112 for placement/display thereon.
- advertising medium 112 can store multiple ads, and advertising management system 104 can provide instructions regarding which ads should be displayed on the advertising medium 112 , and under what circumstances such ads should be displayed.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control the manner such information is collected with respect to programs or features that may collect personal information (e.g., information about a user's preferences or a user's current location). Users may also be informed of the accompanying limitations on the functionality of a service that may result from limiting access to such personal information.
- certain data may be anonymized in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed.
- a device identifier associated with a user's identity may be anonymized so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, zip code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example system 200 for providing third party content.
- a third party content provider such as advertiser, using advertiser devices 102 A- 102 N (referred to collectively as advertiser devices 102 ) can submit one or more third party content items such as ads 210 A- 210 N (also known as “creatives”) (referred to collectively as ads 210 ) to an ad system 204 , and such ads 210 are stored in a third party content repository such as an ad repository 202 .
- Each ad includes one or more words, phrases, web links, and/or any other such element and/or component (e.g., images, video, audio, etc.) that are provided to one or more user devices 108 (e.g., banner ads, text-only ads, image ads, audio ads, video ads, etc.) and/or to advertising medium 112 .
- one or more keywords are associated with one or more creatives in order to enable the identification and selection of pertinent ads for display to a user based on one or more search queries received from the user.
- ads 210 are described herein as referring to individual ads, in certain implementations ads 210 can refer to groups of ads, such as ad groups, campaigns, and/or categories.
- Ad system 204 can also include an ad presentation manager 260 .
- the ad presentation manager 260 can identify ads in the ad repository 202 to present at advertising medium 112 and/or to a user device 108 , for example based on various criteria such as keywords in a search query, web page content, context, location, ad financials (e.g., cost per impression).
- ad presentation manager 260 can identify one or more ads 210 associated with one or more characteristics of various users that are within a certain proximity of advertising medium, and such creatives can be provided at advertising medium 112 as described in greater detail herein.
- ad presentation manager 260 can identify one or more ads 210 associated with one or more keywords that are similar and/or identical to the search query provided by the user, and such creatives can be provided to the user in any number of ad formats.
- the ad system 204 can interact with a search system, for example presenting ads alongside search results.
- the ad system 204 can interact with content publishers, for example, providing ads to publishers or users for presentation along with web content, e-mail, or other content.
- Ad system 204 can also include one or more ad logs 212 .
- ad log 212 can maintain ad display histories, which maintains a record of the various instances of the display of respective ads to respective users.
- ad log 212 can maintain a record of one or more ad performance metrics 220 that reflect the performance or success of a particular third party content item such as an ad.
- ad log 212 can maintain a record of the ‘click through rate’ (CTR), reflecting the percentage of users presented with an ad that click on or otherwise select the presented content, though it should be understood that any number of other performance metrics can be similarly tracked (e.g., conversion rate), as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
- CTR click through rate
- Ad system 204 can also include a profile repository 230 that stores one or more profiles 270 A- 270 N (referred to collectively as profiles 270 ) such as user profiles.
- profiles 270 can reflect one or more characteristics of a user and/or of a particular type of or group of users, such as demographic information, interests, preferences, etc.
- profiles can be associated with and/or otherwise linked to one (or more) identifiers 220 A- 220 N (referred to collectively as profiles 270 ), which can correspond to items such as SSIDs, MAC addresses, etc., as described in greater detail herein.
- users may be provided with the ability to control whether such information is collected, the extent to which such information is collected, and/or the extent to which a user can be identified based on it. For example, a user can select an option whereby any personal or identifying information is immediately aggregated with that of other users such that such information cannot subsequently be associated with or otherwise identify the individual user.
- FIG. 2 depicts ad repository 202 within ad system 204
- ad repository 202 can be configured external to ad system 204 , such as at advertising medium 112 .
- ad system 204 can include ad configuration engine 206 .
- the ad configuration engine 206 can select one or more third party content items, such as ads 210 , and can configure such ads for presentation, such as on an advertising medium 112 , based on respective characteristics of users that are within a certain proximity to the advertising medium 112 , and/or characteristics of such users, as described in detail herein.
- ad configuration engine 206 can include one or more processors configured by code to implement the functionality of the ad configuration engine that is being described.
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example method 300 for providing third party content.
- the method 300 can be performed by a processor executing instructions in a computer-readable storage medium.
- the method 300 can be performed by the ad system 204 of FIG. 2 .
- each respective identifier is associated with a respective device, such as a user device 108 .
- FIG. 4 depicts an advertising medium 112 (e.g., a digital display screen), as well as various users, each of which is holding (or otherwise in possession of) a respective user device 108 A-F (e.g., a smart phone).
- advertising medium 112 can perceive and/or communicate with user devices 108 A-F.
- respective service set identifiers can be broadcasted by user devices 108 and received by advertising medium 112
- identifiers such as media access control (MAC) addresses, Bluetooth identifiers, near-field communications (NFC) identifiers, and/or GPS coordinates
- MAC media access control
- NFC near-field communications
- each respective identifier can correspond to and/or be associated with a respective user profile 270 .
- such identifiers e.g., respective SSIDs of each user device
- an SSID nomenclature can be implemented whereby numeric and/or alphanumeric elements (e.g., letters and numbers) can reflect various characteristics of the user of the device.
- numeric and/or alphanumeric elements e.g., letters and numbers
- each letter/number in the SSID “R4X59” can correspond to a particular characteristic of the user (e.g., “R” can correspond to an interest in sports, “4” can correspond to the language the user speaks, etc.).
- advertising medium 112 can identify various characteristics of the user of the device, as described in greater detail herein.
- identifiers pertain to personal or identifying information
- users may be provided with the ability to control whether such information is collected or otherwise utilized, the extent to which such information is collected/utilized, and/or the extent to which a user can be identified based on such information. For example, a user can select an option whereby any personal or identifying information (such as that reflected in an identifier such as an SSID) is immediately aggregated with that of other users such that such information cannot subsequently be associated with or otherwise used to identify an individual user.
- any personal or identifying information such as that reflected in an identifier such as an SSID
- Respective proximities of the one or more devices to a content presentation medium are determined ( 320 ). That is, it can be further appreciated with reference to FIG. 4 that each of the various user devices 108 are situated within varying degrees of proximity to advertising medium 112 . For example, user devices 108 A-D are in relatively closer proximity to advertising medium 112 , while user devices 108 E-F are relatively further away.
- such respective proximities to the content presentation medium can be determined based on the respective signal strengths associated with each of the identifiers (e.g., SSIDs, MAC addresses, etc., as referenced above) as received at the advertising medium 112 , such as in a manner known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
- such respective proximities to the content presentation medium can be determined based on a comparison of location information (e.g., GPS coordinates) associated with a respective device and corresponding location information for the advertising medium 112 , such as in a manner known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
- location information e.g., GPS coordinates
- the respective identifiers are processed ( 330 ). That is, having received one or more identifiers (such as at 310 ), each of which correspond to a particular user device 108 , each identifier can be processed in order to determine one or more characteristics such as characteristics pertaining to users of the respective devices.
- each identifier 220 (each of which corresponds to a particular user device 108 ) can be associated with a particular user profile 270 .
- a user profile e.g., a social networking profile, etc.
- one or more characteristics can be determined, such as characteristics that pertain to users of the devices. For example, based on the processing of a particular identifier, a user profile can be identified, based upon which it can be determined that a particular user is a member of a particular demographic and has an interest in sports and video games. Moreover, having processed identifiers for multiple users, various characteristics that are shared by some, most, or all users can be identified (e.g., common interests, demographic information, etc.).
- An effectiveness of the one or more third party content items is computed ( 340 ). That is, it can be appreciated that different third party content items, such as advertisements, can be determined to be more (or less) effective when presented to users who are among a certain demographic and/or that have particular interests. For example, certain products (e.g., beauty supplies, video games, sports, etc.) may be of greater interest to users having certain interests and/or that are among a certain demographic, and advertisers may wish to focus advertising resources specifically towards such groups.
- products e.g., beauty supplies, video games, sports, etc.
- advertisers may wish to focus advertising resources specifically towards such groups.
- various ads 210 can be processed together with various characteristics of a particular user or users (such as those characteristics determined at 330 ) in order to compute an effectiveness of a particular advertisement (or advertisements) with respect to the referenced characteristics. For example, having identified that several users share a characteristic of having an interest in video games, an effectiveness of an advertisement for video games is likely to be determined to be greater (with respect to such users) than an effectiveness of an advertisement for baby food.
- an effectiveness (with respect to one or more users) of a particular third party content item, such as an advertisement can be computed based on characteristics pertaining to the manner in which users interact with or otherwise relate to advertisements presented in other contexts/mediums, such as advertisements presented within webpages. That is, it can be appreciated that users who regularly interact with (e.g., click on) online advertisements may show greater interest in advertisements presented in other mediums (e.g., on digital display screens), while users who rarely (or never) interact with online advertisements may show lesser interest in advertisements presented in other mediums.
- an ad that pertains to interests of those users who interact with other forms of advertising more frequently can be determined to be more effective (by virtue of the fact that such an ad is directed to the interests of users who are more receptive to advertising) than an ad that pertains to interests of users who interact with other forms of advertising less frequently.
- an effectiveness of a particular advertisement (with respect to one or more users) can be computed based on ad display histories of respective users. That is, it can be appreciated that, in certain implementations, users who have already viewed a particular ad (irrespective of the medium on which the ad was presented), or that have viewed a particular ad a number of times, may be less receptive to viewing such an ad again (and thus, such an ad can be determined to be less effective, at least with respect to such users).
- ad display histories can be utilized to determine an effectiveness of displaying a particular ad to a particular user or group of users.
- Third party content items are selected based on the one or more characteristics ( 350 ). For example, one or more third party content items, such as advertisements, that are focused towards users having one or more characteristics (such as those determined at 330 ) can be selected.
- each respective user can have a set of his/her own characteristics (e.g., one user may be interested in sports and TV, another in movies and music, etc.).
- the various characteristics identified with respect to each of the various users can be processed, and, in doing so, common characteristics that are shared by multiple users can be identified (for example, by identifying that several users are in a particular demographic, and/or that several users are interested in action movies). In doing so, one or more ads can be selected that are focused toward such characteristics.
- one or more third party content items can be selected based on an effectiveness, such as the effectiveness computed at 340 . That is, it can be appreciated that a particular advertisement can be relatively more effective with respect to users having a certain characteristic, while relatively less effective with respect to users having another characteristic. Thus, for example, in a scenario where a number of user devices are within close proximity to an advertising medium, an advertisement that can be determined to be particularly effective to certain users can be selected in lieu of an advertisement determined to be less effective to such users.
- an advertisement having broader applicability can be selected, even if such advertisement may be relatively less effective (i.e., is not of particular interest to any of the users).
- One or more third party content items are configured for presentation at the content presentation medium ( 360 ). That is, having selected a particular third party content item, such as an advertisement, for presentation at a content presentation medium, such as advertising medium 112 (such as in the manner described at 350 ), the selected advertisement can be further configured for presentation based on any number of factors. For example, in certain implementations, an advertisement can be configured for display at advertising medium 112 based on the respective proximities of the one or more user devices 108 to the advertising medium 112 (such as those determined at 320 ) and/or based on one or more characteristics (such as those determined at 330 ). That is, it can be appreciated that, in general, users positioned in relatively closer proximity to an advertising medium are more capable of viewing advertisements than users standing relatively further away.
- FIG. 5 depicts the presence of several users, each having a user device 108 , present in relatively close proximity to advertising medium 112 . It can be appreciated that, in light of the relatively close proximity of the users to advertising medium 112 , such users are likely to have a relatively easy time viewing/reading content presented at advertising medium 112 . As such, the advertisement selected for presentation (such as in the manner described at 350 ), can be further configured/formatted to account for such proximity. For example, as shown in FIG.
