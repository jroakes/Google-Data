Definitions
- a unified air interface which utilizes licensed, unlicensed, and shared license radio spectrum, in multiple frequency bands, is one aspect of enabling the capabilities of fifth generation new radio (5G NR) communication systems.
- 5G NR fifth generation new radio
- Some 5GNR systems that operate in unlicensed radio spectrum share the unlicensed radio spectrum with other radio systems and operate under regulations that require access techniques to fairly share the radio spectrum between different users.
- 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems there is at least one licensed carrier available so that downlink communications requiring low latency can be transmitted on licensed carriers for deterministic operation.
- Some 5G NR systems are targeted to operate exclusively using unlicensed radio spectrum, generally in a standalone mode that lacks licensed channels. Therefore, these 5G NR systems lack the ability to provide radio resources to support deterministic behavior for communications that require low or guaranteed latency.

- This document describes using cross-carrier Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) transmission in a Fifth Generation New Radio (5G R) radio system that can perform retransmissions of data from a base station to a user equipment on a second carrier different from a first carrier used for a previous transmission for a same HARQ process.
- the techniques described are useful in providing deterministic operation and low-latency operation using unlicensed radio spectrum where regulations require Clear Channel (CCA), also known as listen-before-talk (LBT), operations to promote coexistence between users of the unlicensed spectrum.
- CCA Clear Channel
- LBT listen-before-talk
- retransmissions of downlink data can be switched among different carriers to provide determinism and low-latency.
- Clear channel assessment is a technique used by wireless devices to assess the channel status using energy detection before attempting to perform a transmission.
- a wireless device measures the energy in a wireless channel to determine if the detected energy is above a threshold which indicates that another device is transmitting on the channel.
- the wireless device postpones transmitting on the channel or moves to another channel to transmit.
- Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request is a physical layer transmission technique in modern communication systems where retransmissions are requested by the receiver in the case of a decoding failure. The retransmissions are combined with failed previous transmissions to enable a user equipment to determine whether there is still useful information embedded in the previous failed transmissions.
- Error control coding is commonly applied to implement HARQ.
- LTE systems tail- biting convolutional coding (TBCC) and turbo coding with incremental redundancy (IR) are used.
- TBCC tail- biting convolutional coding
- IR incremental redundancy
- 5G NR systems low density parity checking (LDPC) coding is used.
- the base station issues explicit downlink control information (DCI) to a user device (e.g., user equipment or UE) along with the associated downlink data.
- a user device e.g., user equipment or UE
- the user equipment can then configure itself to receive the downlink data and buffers the downlink data if the decoding fails.
- the user equipment transmits a HARQ ACK/NACK (Acknowledgement/Negative Acknowledgement) feedback message to the base station based on the decoding result for the downlink data.
- HARQ ACK/NACK Acknowledgement/Negative Acknowledgement
- the base station In the case of receiving a NACK, the base station retransmits a different redundancy version (RV) of the downlink data to the user equipment.
- RV redundancy version
- Multiple stop-and-wait (SW) HARQ processes can occur in a pipeline, so that one HARQ process can begin before obtaining the HARQ ACK/NACK associated with a previous HARQ process.
- Each HARQ process is given a unique identification number (ID), which is carried in the DCI.
- ID unique identification number
- Carrier aggregation was first introduced in LTE- Advanced (3 GPP Release 10) in order to increase bandwidth, thereby increasing the bit rate for data transmission.
- CC component carrier
- CC component carrier
- a maximum of 16 component carriers can be aggregated.
- Carrier aggregation with at least one secondary cell (SCell) operating in unlicensed spectrum is referred to as Li censed- Assisted Access (LAA) in LTE/LTE-A systems.
- LAA Li censed- Assisted Access
- operations in unlicensed spectrum are termed NR-U.
- NR-U Conventionally, downlink data transmission on a particular carrier can only be scheduled on the same carrier.
- the base station can only transmit a DCI and associated downlink data on the same carrier.
- Cross-carrier scheduling removes the limitation of scheduling on a single carrier.
- each carrier is given a unique ID which is carried in the DCI to indicate which carrier is associated with the downlink DCI.
- the user equipment receives DCIs using blind decoding.
- a certain set of time-frequency resources, which the base station can potentially use to transmit a DCI to the user equipment, is known in advance to both the user equipment and the base station.
- Such a set of time-frequency resources is called a search space.
- the user equipment blindly performs detection of a DCI over all valid positions in the search space to receive DCIs sent from the base station.
- a carrier can have more than one search space, with each search space determined by the ID of the scheduled carrier.
- a NR-U base station can perform retransmissions on a second carrier different than a first carrier used for a previous transmission of the same HARQ process.
- a cross-HARQ indicator field is included in the DCI. If the cross-HARQ indicator field is set to OFF, the existing carrier indicator field (CIF) (e.g, carrier identifier) functions as before, i.e., a CIF pointing to another carrier indicates that there is downlink data (e.g, first data) scheduled for the user equipment on that carrier.
- CIF carrier indicator field
- the CIF indicates which carrier is targeted for the downlink data.
- a DCI transmitted on a first carrier including a CIF pointing to a second carrier means the associated downlink data is to be transmitted on the first carrier, but the continuation of the HARQ process for the downlink data occurs on the second carrier.
- the transmission of the downlink data is conceptually moved from the first carrier to the second carrier. This solves the problem when the first carrier is temporarily unavailable for retransmission due to an LBT failure.
- the base station can send different redundancy versions of the same downlink data on different carriers in the same slot. This can be accomplished by transmitting multiple DCIs on separate component carriers with the DCIs all having the same CIF and the cross-HARQ indicator being set to ON. The user equipment would then be able to determine that all the DCIs and their associated copies of the downlink data originate from a same data, and the copies of downlink data are simply different redundancy versions. In case there are multiple HARQ processes, a HARQ process ID is also carried in the DCI to further distinguish among different HARQ processes. For example, the base station can configure a third carrier to be cross-scheduled by the first carrier to transmit additional data.
- the base station transmits a second message configuring the third carrier and generates a third DCI including a third carrier identifier for the third carrier, and a third cross-Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request indicator field indicating a third data (additional data) associated with the third DCI is not a cross-Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request transmission.
- the base station can configure a fourth carrier to transmit the a second (different) redundancy version of the first data.
- the base station generates a fourth DCI and a fourth data associated with the fourth DCI, the fourth data being a retransmission of the first data.
- the base station transmits the fourth downlink control information to the user equipment on a fourth carrier in the second slot.
- the fourth DCI includes a third HARQ process identifier having same value as the first Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request process identifier.
- the fourth DCI includes a second counter downlink assignment index having same value as in the first counter downlink assignment index indicating that the fourth data is a second redundancy version of the first data.

Abstract
This document describes using cross-carrier Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) transmission in a Fifth Generation New Radio (5G NR) radio system that can perform retransmissions of data from a base station (121) to a user equipment (110) on a second carrier different than a first carrier used for a previous transmission for a same HARQ process. The techniques described are useful in providing deterministic operation and low-latency operation using unlicensed radio spectrum where regulations require Clear Channel (CCA), also known as listen-before-talk (LBT), operations to promote coexistence between users of the unlicensed spectrum.

Description
CROSS-CARRIER HYBRID AUTOMATIC REPEAT REQUEST
BACKGROUND
[0001] A unified air interface, which utilizes licensed, unlicensed, and shared license radio spectrum, in multiple frequency bands, is one aspect of enabling the capabilities of fifth generation new radio (5G NR) communication systems. Some 5GNR systems that operate in unlicensed radio spectrum share the unlicensed radio spectrum with other radio systems and operate under regulations that require access techniques to fairly share the radio spectrum between different users.
[0002] Unlike resources in licensed radio spectrum that can be scheduled to support deterministic operation for communications that require low or guaranteed latency, operations under spectrum-sharing regulations for unlicensed radio spectrum can create uncertainty about when particular resources will be available or become unavailable. A communication device may not be able to transmit on a desired carrier in a timely fashion if that carrier is in use by another wireless transmitting device.
[0003] In fourth generation (4G) Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, there is at least one licensed carrier available so that downlink communications requiring low latency can be transmitted on licensed carriers for deterministic operation. Some 5G NR systems are targeted to operate exclusively using unlicensed radio spectrum, generally in a standalone mode that lacks licensed channels. Therefore, these 5G NR systems lack the ability to provide radio resources to support deterministic behavior for communications that require low or guaranteed latency.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0008] This document describes using cross-carrier Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) transmission in a Fifth Generation New Radio (5G R) radio system that can perform retransmissions of data from a base station to a user equipment on a second carrier different from a first carrier used for a previous transmission for a same HARQ process. The techniques described are useful in providing deterministic operation and low-latency operation using unlicensed radio spectrum where regulations require Clear Channel (CCA), also known as listen-before-talk (LBT), operations to promote coexistence between users of the unlicensed spectrum. With cross-carrier HARQ transmission techniques, retransmissions of downlink data can be switched among different carriers to provide determinism and low-latency.
[0009] The rapid uptake of 4G LTE in different regions of the world shows both that demand for wireless broadband data is increasing and that 4G LTE is an extremely successful platform to meet that demand. For International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) systems, existing and new spectrum licensed for exclusive use by IMT technologies will remain important for providing seamless coverage, achieving high spectral efficiency, and ensuring high reliability of cellular networks through careful planning and deployment of network equipment and devices. All of
these qualities cannot be achieved with unlicensed spectrum that can be accessed by a variety of wireless devices.
[0010] However, the use of unlicensed spectrum is increasingly being considered by cellular operators to augment their service offerings and solutions provided on licensed spectrum. Efficient use of unlicensed spectrum as a complement to licensed spectrum is potentially valuable to service providers and the wireless industry as a whole. Given the widespread deployment and usage of other technologies in unlicensed spectrum for wireless communications, it is necessary for 4G LTE and 5GNR to coexist with incumbent systems in this shared, unlicensed spectrum.
[0011] One approach to coexistence is determining if a radio channel is in use by another device before beginning a transmission. Clear channel assessment (CCA) is a technique used by wireless devices to assess the channel status using energy detection before attempting to perform a transmission. A wireless device measures the energy in a wireless channel to determine if the detected energy is above a threshold which indicates that another device is transmitting on the channel. When the CCA detects energy above the threshold, the wireless device postpones transmitting on the channel or moves to another channel to transmit.
[0012] Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) is a physical layer transmission technique in modern communication systems where retransmissions are requested by the receiver in the case of a decoding failure. The retransmissions are combined with failed previous transmissions to enable a user equipment to determine whether there is still useful information embedded in the previous failed transmissions. Error control coding is commonly applied to implement HARQ. In LTE systems, tail- biting convolutional coding (TBCC) and turbo coding with incremental redundancy (IR) are used. In 5G NR systems, low density parity checking (LDPC) coding is used. To appropriately operate using HARQ, a receiver has to be aware of the existence of a
transmission in advance, even if the transmission itself fails to be correctly decoded, so that the failed transmission can be retained and combined with later retransmissions. In 4G LTE and 5G NR systems, the base station issues explicit downlink control information (DCI) to a user device (e.g., user equipment or UE) along with the associated downlink data. After receiving the DCI, the user equipment can then configure itself to receive the downlink data and buffers the downlink data if the decoding fails. The user equipment transmits a HARQ ACK/NACK (Acknowledgement/Negative Acknowledgement) feedback message to the base station based on the decoding result for the downlink data. In the case of receiving a NACK, the base station retransmits a different redundancy version (RV) of the downlink data to the user equipment. Multiple stop-and-wait (SW) HARQ processes can occur in a pipeline, so that one HARQ process can begin before obtaining the HARQ ACK/NACK associated with a previous HARQ process. Each HARQ process is given a unique identification number (ID), which is carried in the DCI.
[0013] Carrier aggregation (CA) was first introduced in LTE- Advanced (3 GPP Release 10) in order to increase bandwidth, thereby increasing the bit rate for data transmission. Each carrier in a carrier aggregation is referred to as a component carrier (CC). In 5G NR, a maximum of 16 component carriers can be aggregated. Carrier aggregation with at least one secondary cell (SCell) operating in unlicensed spectrum is referred to as Li censed- Assisted Access (LAA) in LTE/LTE-A systems. In 5G NR, operations in unlicensed spectrum are termed NR-U. Conventionally, downlink data transmission on a particular carrier can only be scheduled on the same carrier. In other words, the base station can only transmit a DCI and associated downlink data on the same carrier. Cross-carrier scheduling (CCS) removes the limitation of scheduling on a single carrier. In cross-carrier scheduling, each carrier is given a unique ID which is carried in the DCI to indicate which carrier is associated with the downlink DCI.
[0014] The user equipment receives DCIs using blind decoding. A certain set of time-frequency resources, which the base station can potentially use to transmit a DCI to the user equipment, is known in advance to both the user equipment and the base station. Such a set of time-frequency resources is called a search space. The user equipment blindly performs detection of a DCI over all valid positions in the search space to receive DCIs sent from the base station. Using cross-carrier scheduling, a carrier can have more than one search space, with each search space determined by the ID of the scheduled carrier.
[0015] Due to the uncertainty created by listen-before-talk (LBT) operations in NR-U systems, a transmitter might not be able to perform retransmissions on the same carrier in a timely fashion, since that the carrier could become occupied by another wireless transmitting device between the time of the original transmission and the time of the retransmission. This results in a lack of determinism for devices and applications having stringent latency requirements in NR-U systems. In 4G LTE, there is at least one licensed carrier available so that downlink data requiring low latency can be transmitted on a licensed carrier, if needed. However, an NR-U base station can operate solely with unlicensed carriers and requires a solution to support deterministic and low- latency operations in unlicensed radio bands.
[0016] In aspects, by using cross-carrier HARQ transmission, a NR-U base station can perform retransmissions on a second carrier different than a first carrier used for a previous transmission of the same HARQ process. To coexist with the mechanism of cross-carrier scheduling, a cross-HARQ indicator field is included in the DCI. If the cross-HARQ indicator field is set to OFF, the existing carrier indicator field (CIF) (e.g, carrier identifier) functions as before, i.e., a CIF pointing to another carrier indicates that there is downlink data (e.g, first data) scheduled for the user equipment on that carrier.
[0017] If the cross-HARQ indicator field is set to ON, the CIF indicates which carrier is targeted for the downlink data. For example, a DCI transmitted on a first carrier including a CIF pointing to a second carrier means the associated downlink data is to be transmitted on the first carrier, but the continuation of the HARQ process for the downlink data occurs on the second carrier. In other words, the transmission of the downlink data is conceptually moved from the first carrier to the second carrier. This solves the problem when the first carrier is temporarily unavailable for retransmission due to an LBT failure.
[0018] In another aspect, the base station can send different redundancy versions of the same downlink data on different carriers in the same slot. This can be accomplished by transmitting multiple DCIs on separate component carriers with the DCIs all having the same CIF and the cross-HARQ indicator being set to ON. The user equipment would then be able to determine that all the DCIs and their associated copies of the downlink data originate from a same data, and the copies of downlink data are simply different redundancy versions. In case there are multiple HARQ processes, a HARQ process ID is also carried in the DCI to further distinguish among different HARQ processes. For example, the base station can configure a third carrier to be cross-scheduled by the first carrier to transmit additional data. The base station transmits a second message configuring the third carrier and generates a third DCI including a third carrier identifier for the third carrier, and a third cross-Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request indicator field indicating a third data (additional data) associated with the third DCI is not a cross-Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request transmission. In a further example, to transmit a different redundancy version of the first data, the base station can configure a fourth carrier to transmit the a second (different) redundancy version of the first data. The base station generates a fourth DCI and a fourth data associated with the fourth DCI, the fourth data being a retransmission
of the first data. The base station transmits the fourth downlink control information to the user equipment on a fourth carrier in the second slot. The fourth DCI includes a third HARQ process identifier having same value as the first Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request process identifier. The fourth DCI includes a second counter downlink assignment index having same value as in the first counter downlink assignment index indicating that the fourth data is a second redundancy version of the first data.

For example, the base station 121 performs a clear channel assessment by detecting an amount of energy on a radio channel to determine if the detected energy is above a threshold which indicates that another device is transmitting on the channel.
[0031] At block 304, the base station generates a first downlink control information (DCI) including a first carrier identifier (ID) for a first carrier. For
example, the base station 121 generates a first downlink control information (DCI) including a first carrier identifier (ID) for a first carrier. The DCI includes a cross- HARQ indicator field to enable the HARQ transmission and/or retransmission to move to another carrier on another channel if the channel of the first carrier becomes unavailable to the base station.
[0032] At block 306, the base station transmits the first DCI in a first search space to the user equipment on the first carrier in a first slot, the first search space being determined by at least the first carrier ID. For example, the base station 121 transmits the first DCI in a first search space to the user equipment 110 on the first carrier in a first slot, the first search space being determined by at least the first carrier ID.
[0033] At block 308, the base station transmits a first data associated with the first DCI to the user equipment and on the first carrier. For example, the base station 121 transmits a first data associated with the first DCI to the user equipment 110 and on the first carrier.
[0034] At block 310, the base station receives a Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request Acknowledgement/Negative Acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK/NACK) feedback message corresponding to the first data. For example, the base station 121 receives a Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request Acknowledgement/Negative Acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK/NACK) feedback message corresponding to the first data from the user equipment 110.
[0035] At block 312, the base station generates a second DCI including the first carrier ID. For example, the base station 121 generates a second DCI including the first carrier ID that indicates that a continuation of the HARQ process for the first data occurs on the second carrier.
[0036] At block 314, the base station transmits the second DCI in a second search space to the user equipment on a second carrier in a second slot, the second
search space being determined by at least a second carrier ID for the second carrier. For example, the base station 121 transmits the second DCI in a second search space to the user equipment 110 on a second carrier in a second slot, the second search space being determined by at least a second carrier ID for the second carrier.
[0037] At block 316, the base station transmits a second data associated with the second DCI to the user equipment on the second carrier, the second data being a Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) retransmission of the first data. For example, the base station 121 transmits a second data associated with the second DCI to the user equipment 110 on the second carrier, the second data being a Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) retransmission of the first data.
[0038] FIG. 4 illustrates example method(s) 400 of cross-carrier hybrid automatic repeat request as generally related to the user equipment 110. At block 402, a user equipment performs a clear channel assessment procedure. For example, the user equipment 110 performs a clear channel assessment by detecting an amount of energy on a radio channel.
[0039] At block 404, the user equipment receives a first downlink control information (DCI) in a first search space from the base station on a first carrier in a first slot, the first DCI including a first carrier identifier (ID) for the first carrier, the first search space being determined by at least the first carrier ID. For example, the user equipment 110 receives a first downlink control information (DCI) in a first search space from the base station 121 on a first carrier in a first slot, the first DCI including a first carrier identifier (ID) for the first carrier, the first search space being determined by at least the first carrier ID. After receiving the first DCI, the user equipment then configures itself to receive the first data and buffers the first data if the decoding of the first data fails.
[0040] At block 406, the user equipment receives a first data on the first carrier using the first DCI. For example, the user equipment 110 receives a first data on the first carrier using the first DCI from the base station 121.
[0041] At block 408, the user equipment generates a first decoding result by using the first data. For example, the data decoder 216 of the user equipment 110 generates a first decoding result by using the first data.
[0042] At block 410, based on the first decoding result, the user equipment transmits a Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request Acknowledgement/Negative Acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK/NACK) feedback message to the base station. For example, based on the first decoding result, the user equipment 110 transmits a Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request Acknowledgement/Negative Acknowledgement (HARQ- ACK/NACK) feedback message to the base station 121 indicating that the first data was successfully decoded or that the decoding failed.
[0043] At block 412, the user equipment receives a second DCI in a second search space on a second carrier in a second slot, the second DCI including the first carrier ID, the second search space being determined by at least a second carrier ID for the second carrier. For example, the user equipment 110 receives, from the base station 121, a second DCI in a second search space on a second carrier in a second slot, the second DCI including the first carrier ID, the second search space being determined by at least a second carrier ID for the second carrier.
[0044] At block 414, the user equipment receives a second data on the second carrier using the second DCI, the second data being a retransmission of the first data. For example, the user equipment 110 receives, from the base station 121, a second data on the second carrier using the second DCI, the second data being a retransmission of the first data.
[0045] At block 416, the user equipment generates a second decoding result by using at least the first data and the second data. For example, the data decoder 216 of the user equipment 110 generates a second decoding result by using at least the first data, buffered by the user equipment, and the second data.
[0046] At block 418, based on the second decoding result, the user equipment transmits a second HARQ-ACK/NACK feedback message to the base station. For example, based on the second decoding result, the user equipment 110 transmits a second HARQ-ACK/NACK feedback message to the base station 121 indicating that the first data and second data was successfully decoded or that the decoding failed.
