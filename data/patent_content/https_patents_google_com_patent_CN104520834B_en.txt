In only show that 101, user equipmenies 114 of a storage system based on web and a third party system 103 are attached to avoid making
Figure complicates.In general, system 100 can support multiple storage systems based on web, third party system, server, data
Storehouse, developer's equipment and user equipment.
Storage system 101 based on web is to allow user via one or more user equipment, such as user equipment
114 storages, the file mandatory system fetched and change data.This data is properly termed as the web data of user.As an example,
Storage system 101 based on web can be stored in individual server system or in distributed system.Specifically, it is based on
Web storage system 101 can store user data using cloud storage device.
If metadata database 109 stores the data of dry type.Specifically, metadata database 109 stores and in base
In in web storage system 101 or stored on third party system 103 file content association metadata.Metadata can
With including the shortcut (shortcut) for pointing to associated with content, reference or pointer.Such as metadata can include referring to
Former documentary pointer into database, such as native database 106 or third party database 107.In this example, first number
The binary file associated with the binary file content stored on native database 106 is stored according to database 109.Another
In one example, metadata database 109 store inside on native database 106, third-party application (i.e. with based on web
Storage system association native applications) reference document.In another example, metadata database 109, which for example stores, is used for
The reference document of the third-party application (being associated with third party system 103) stored on third party database 107.
The primary file that the storage of native database 106 can use native applications and be checked or be edited.Native applications
Corresponding to the inside in the storage system 101 based on web, first party application.Pass through as an example, native applications can provide
Access (be used to check and/or edit primary document) of the web browser between user and primary file.Primary file can be with
It is relevant with text document, electronic form document, presentation file, drawing documents or any other appropriate document.Specifically, it is former
Raw database 106 stores the primary file in the specific format for being suitable for the storage system 101 based on web.Appropriate format
It can be the 101 distinctive form of storage system based on web and " first party is primary " form can be referred to as.
Third party system 103 is communicated to access in native database by network 102 with the storage system 101 based on web
The expression of the primary file stored on 106.As depicted in Figure 1, third party system 103 include third party database 107,
Third-party server 108 and developer's equipment 112.Third party database 107, which can store to be in, is suitable for third party system
The primary file of third party of 103 specific format.Suitable form can be 103 distinctive form of third party system and can be by
Referred to as " third party " form.
The content that third-party application accesses primary file is occasionally wanted to, so as to which third-party application can be grasped to file content
Make.If file is the primary file of first party or the primary file of third party with separating third-party application association, third party
Using the original contents that can not can directly access file.Describe in detail below when file is the primary file of first party
Situation.It is however generally that those skilled in the art will appreciate that described herein be used to provide file to third-party application
The system and method for the derived expression of content can also be applied to the associated with one or more other third-party application
The primary file of tripartite.
When file is the primary file of first party, third-party application can be not configured as directly reading or writing
The primary file content of one side, because the form of the primary file of first party and the form that third-party application is configured as importing be not simultaneous
Hold.In addition, the original contents of the primary file of first party can include Proprietary Information, and it may not want that permission third party system
103 have the unrestricted access to original contents.In order to maintain the primary text of first party in the storage system 101 based on web
The proprietary property of part, indirectly expose the original contents of the primary file of first party.Replace, the generation of processor 105 is in
It is suitable for acting on behalf of version to the primary file of first party of one or more form derived from third party system 103.Specifically
For, primary file is converted into appropriate format, and (appropriate format can be exported by the storage system 101 based on web and can be by
Three method, systems -103 import), and allow third-party application to access the read-only expression of primary file and do not share original contents.
Third-party application can use the appropriate expression of one or more API (API) access primary file of first party.
In order to provide the access to the content of primary file to third-party application, processor 105 can identify and primary text
One or more of part association can export form.Specifically, form, processor can be exported in order to identify one or more
105 can identify one or more application with primary file association.In this example, associated application can be with based on web
Storage system 101 associate first party native applications.Figure 2 illustrates four primary files and its number of examples of associated application
According to structure 200.Fig. 3 show five applications and the correspondence each applied can import format and can export form list example
Data structure 300.Data structure 200 and 300 can be stored in any database shown in Fig. 1 in database, such as the 3rd
On party database 107, native database 106, metadata database 109 or any other proper data storehouse.Processor 105 is true
It is fixed whether have the application with primary file association export form set and associated with third-party application can import format
Matching between set.If identifying matching form, primary file is converted into matching form.Identifying multiple matchings
During form, form can be selected based on user's input or default setting.Then the file of conversion is exported to third party should
With the third-party application opens the file of conversion.
As an example, third-party application can be configured as opening the file of (or importing) some type (as such as
Image file) the fax program based on web.User may want to (such as be stored in the 3rd using the fax program based on web
On method, system 103) content of the primary file 514 (such as being stored on native database 106) of transmission.In data structure 200
Shown, the content of primary file 514 includes text and the primary file 514 associated with using V.Text is may, for example, be using V
Editing machine.Fax program based on web can be as shown in data structure 300 with one can import format associate and not with can
Export the text editor of form association.In this case, compare with using V associate export format list and with application
W association can import format list with identify it is any matching whether exist between list.Because form pdf is in two lists
The only form included, so primary file 514 is converted into pdf files and is based on web to third party by processor 105
Fax program W export.
In another example, user may want in the primary file of third party to the not third party with primary file association
Using offer access to content.In order to illustrate this example, primary file 1574 associates with third-party application Y, but user
It is W that desired third-party application, which can be specified,.In this case, W can be pdf reader programs, and due to third party
The file in pdf forms can be exported using Y, so the content of primary file 1574 is converted into pdf forms and exported
To third-party application W.
In another example, if exporting format list and and third party corresponding with the associated application of primary file
Can not find matching between import format list using corresponding, then can refuse user in primary file to
Tripartite's application provides the request of the access of file content.Such as user may want to provide to third-party application X and access primary text
Content in part 238.In this case, because primary file 238 is with applying Z to associate, and can what is associated with application Z
Export form and with using X associate can be between import format without matching, so the request of user is rejected.
Therefore, although the original contents of primary file can not may be accessed by third party system 103, third party system
103 still can access the content of primary file by importing the converted version of primary file.In this way, system
100 can allow third-party application to access in native database in the case where not giving the access to original primary file content
The expression of the primary file stored in 106.System 100 can provide read-only access to third party system 103, so as to the 3rd
The third-party application stored on party database 107 can import the file in third party's native format but can not to
The original document stored on native database 106 carries out any change.
In certain embodiments, the developer of third party system 103 creates the third-party application version (or " cloud " of software
Version).Third-party server 108 can run application version and provide user interface to user equipment 114 by network 102
(such as passing through web browser).In this case, user interacted by the user interface of offer with third-party application without
Third party software is locally installed on user equipment 114.In certain embodiments, third-party application with user equipment 114
Locally-installed software application is relevant.Such as software can include document editor or reader, and user can set
Standby, such as locally-installed software on personal computer.
The configuration of system 100 is favourable for a user, because system 100 allows user's use in diverse location (i.e. the
Three method, systems 103) third-party application of operation accesses the text stored in a position (i.e. the storage system based on web)
Part.In this way, it is not necessary to which software application is installed locally on user equipment 114.Software is installed in equipment and takes this
Space in ground memory and spend the time to install.In addition, user can use any number using third-party application
Different user devices access identical primary file, as long as each user equipment is configured as communicating with network 102.By permitting
Perhaps any user equipment 114 to be communicated with network 102 accesses the expression of primary file, system described herein using third-party application
System and method allow the web data for flexibly and conveniently accessing user.
Fig. 2 be according to example embodiment on the native database 106 including the data relevant with primary file
The declarative data structure 200 of storage.Data structure 200 includes the list of four primary file identifiers, each primary file
Identifier corresponds to the primary file stored on native database 106.For each primary file, data structure 200 has
For the field entries of user identifier, user identifier instruction and the user of file association.Specifically, based on web's
Storage system 101 can be by each multiple users with one or more partial association of the storage system 101 based on web
And/or application developer accesses.User can access memory space by user equipment 114 and network 102.
In addition to storing the user identifier with primary file association, data structure 200 also includes the word for form
Section entry.Specifically, primary file 514 is the primary text associated with user A, and primary file 238 be with
The primary demonstration document of family C associations.Primary file 765 is image file, and primary file 1574 is electronic form file, this
Two files associate with user B.
Data structure 200 also includes being used for the field with one or more application of each primary file association.Association
Using can be first party application or third-party application.As shown in data structure 200, one is shown for each primary file
Individual application, but in general, any number of application can be with primary file association.Additional entries in data structure 200
It can include with these corresponding identifiers of application, to using instruction, the associated application pair for being first party or third-party application
The previously visited date and time of file content, with any other proper data of primary file association or its combine.Remove
Outside shown field or field shown in substitution, data structure 200 can also include being used for creating, access or editing files
Date and time, the user for having the right to read or writing file list, with the file association that is stored in storage system
Any other proper data or its any appropriately combined field.
In certain embodiments, the format fields in data structure 200 are " association " fields.Specifically, primary file
Association can include one or more and may export list of form, and primary file can have one or more
Corresponding association.As an example, the association stored for primary file 514 includes " text ".The association " text " can correspond to
In one group of one or more form, for example including pdf, plaintext, html, opened document (opendocument), rtf and
doc.As another example, the association stored for primary file 238 includes " demonstration ".The association " demonstration " can correspond to
In the group of one or more form (such as including pdf and ppt).Storing may for the association rather than storage of primary file
The list of form, which can be exported, can be advantageous to save memory space and allow more efficiently to access data.In some implementations,
Format fields and associate field are the different fields in data structure 200.
