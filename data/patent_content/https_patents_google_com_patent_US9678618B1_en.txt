For news articles, for instance, a number of news articles, published by a number of different sources, may all be related to a real-world event (e.g., the news event or topic).
- Document cluster generation component 420 may determine the documents related to the event based on a number of factors, such as similarity of content (e.g., documents describing the effects of a recent tornado in Kansas may tend to include the terms “tornado” and “kansas”) or closeness in the publication date/time. Techniques for determining clusters of related documents are generally known.
- document cluster generation component 420 may include other documents, such as documents that are not necessarily documents that directly describe the topic (e.g., for news documents, the document may be published well before the news event), but may provide context to or additional information that may be useful to a user when exploring the topic. For example, people, places, and things may be associated with documents that describe the person (e.g., a biography page), place or thing. As another example, weather forecasts or other weather information may be useful in the context of an event. As another example, for a news article that references a public company, a link to financial information (e.g., a stock quote) for the company may be useful to a reader reading the news article about the company.
- documents that are not necessarily documents that directly describe the topic e.g., for news documents, the document may be published well before the news event
- context to or additional information may be useful to a user when exploring the topic. For example, people, places, and things may be associated with documents that describe the person (e.g., a biography page), place or
- document cluster generation component 420 may automatically determine clusters of documents, and the topics associated with each cluster, from document memory 410 .
- information describing an intended topic may be input to document cluster generation component 420 , which may then generate a cluster of documents based on the input topic.
- Descriptive information for a topic may be input as, for example, a word, a phrase, or as link to a document that is to be used to generate the cluster.
- Document selection component 430 may receive the document cluster(s) from document cluster generation component 420 .
- Document selection component 430 may select documents from the cluster to use in a summary view and in an expanded view.
- document selection component 430 may choose documents such that certain categories or types of documents are used.
- document selection component 430 may choose one or two documents to use in the summary view. These documents may be selected as highly ranked textual web documents that are determined to be about the topic of the cluster.
- Other document types, such as videos, if available may be chosen for the expanded view.
- Other document types, such as documents that provide context for the topic of the cluster may be selected.
- document chooser component 430 may select images or search queries related to the topic.
- the different chosen documents may be from a number of different content servers 230 or domains. A separate domain may correspond to a separate hostname that is used to identify a web site.
- the documents include: primary representative documents, which may include highly ranked documents (e.g., documents with ranking/relevancy scores greater than a threshold) that are relevant to the topic and are to be displayed in the summary view; secondary document(s), which may include one or more documents that are relevant to the topic and that are to be listed in the expanded view; videos relating to the topic (e.g., newscasts about a news event); images relating to the topic; context articles; related searches, which may include search queries that were previously performed by other users interested in the topic; and other related information/facts.
- Other document types may additionally be used.
- server 220 may contain fewer functional components, different functional components, differently arranged functional components, and/or additional functional components than those depicted in FIG. 4 .
- one or more functional components of server 220 may perform one or more other tasks described as being performed by one or more other functional components of server 220 .
- FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an example process 500 for generating summary and expanded views for topics.
- Process 500 may be performed by, for example, server 220 or a group of devices separate from, or including, server 220 .
- Process 500 may include generating document clusters relating to topics (block 510 ).
- document cluster generation component 420 may automatically determine clusters of documents, and the topics associated from each cluster, from document memory 410 .
- an automatic clustering may be performed on recent documents from predetermined news content providers. If a number of such documents are similar, and tend to form a cluster, a news document cluster may be created.
- a word, a phrase, or a document such as a document relating to a current news story, may be input to document cluster generation component 420 , which may then generate a cluster of documents relating to the word, phrase, or document.
- Process 500 may further include choosing the documents from a cluster to represent the cluster (block 520 ). At least some of the chosen documents may include documents that provide context to the cluster (block 520 ). As previously discussed, document selection component 430 may select documents from the cluster to represent the topic in the summary and expanded views. In some implementations, the documents that provide context to the cluster may be documents that are selected from outside the cluster. For example, a cluster may include news documents relating to a news story about the trial of a celebrity. The documents that provide context may include a document providing a biography of the celebrity. In some implementations, the context documents may include facts or other information that may be directly displayed in summary and/or expanded views.
- a weather report may be displayed with a weather related news topic and a stock quote may be displayed with a finance related news topic.
- the documents that provide context to the cluster may be, for example, documents that are obtained through a search using a search engine or a predetermined set of documents.
- Process 500 may further include generating a web page that includes the topics (block 530 ).
- the web page may include instructions to display each topic (or, in some implementations, at least some) in an expandable visual area such that the user can select between a summary view and an expanded view (block 530 ).
- the web page may present, for a topic, the documents chosen in block 520 .
- a visual icon may be displayed when the user mouses over the visual area of a topic. By selecting the icon, the visual area may change from the summary view to the expanded view or from the expanded view to the summary view. In this way, for a list of topics and at the user's discretion, any number of the topics can be concurrently shown in either the expanded or summary view.
- the expandable visual area may be implemented using, for example, a scripting language, such as JavaScript included as part of hyper-text markup language (HTML) code that defines the web page.
- a scripting language such as JavaScript included as part of hyper-text markup language (HTML) code that defines the web page.
- HTML hyper-text markup language
- Other scripting languages or other techniques may alternatively be used to switch between summary and expanded views.
- Process 500 may further include transmitting the web page to the user at a client 110 (block 540 ).
- the user may then view and interact with the web page using, for example, a browser program.
- the web page may be uniquely generated and transmitted to each user.
- the web page may be pre-generated and transmitted to multiple users.
- the home page for a news search site may include a number of current news topics, that for a particular period, such as an hour or ten minutes, remain static. In this case, all users visiting the home page for the news search site may receive a copy of the same web page.
- FIG. 6 is a diagram of a user interface 600 , such as a user interface presented by a browser program executing at one of clients 110 .
- a list of three topics 610 , 620 , and 630 is illustrated, in which each topic is presented to the user as a summary view.
- Each topic may correspond to a cluster of documents.
- each topic may include a title for the topic, a snippet of text that may provide additional information relating to the primary document for the topic, and an image.
- title 612 is illustrated as “Serbia sends Mladic to Hague war crimes tribunal.”
- Title 612 may include anchor text for a link that, when selected by a user, may present the linked document (e.g., the primary document for this topic) to the user.
- Topic 610 may also include information 614 describing the source of the primary document (e.g., Chat.co.uk, 42 minutes ago).
- Topic 610 may also include a snippet of text, snippet 616 , which may include text from the primary document.
- snippet 616 may be selected to provide the user with a brief summary of the primary document. For example, as illustrated, snippet 616 may include the first sentence from the primary document.
- An image 618 may also be associated with the summary view for topic 610 .
- the image may include, for example, a thumbnail image from the primary document, another document in the cluster, or from another source (e.g., a stock image).
- Image 618 may also act as a link so that, when selected by the user, it may present the primary document or to another document in the cluster to the user.
- FIG. 7 is a diagram of a user interface 700 , such as a user interface presented by a browser program executing at one of clients 110 .
- Interface 700 may be a version of interface 600 in which a user expands topic 610 by, for example, selecting an icon 705 .
- topic 610 may expand to the expanded view in which additional information relating to the topic is shown.
- the additional information is shown as links 712 to additional documents in the cluster; links 714 to related searches; links 716 to additional documents; and links 718 to videos/images about the topic.
- Links 712 to additional documents may include links to the secondary documents, such as news articles, about the main topic. Links 712 may link to documents that overlap, in content, with the primary document. In some implementations, the secondary documents may be selected to minimize too much overlap or to minimize duplicate content.
- Links 714 to related searches may include one or more links, that when selected, may initiate a search (e.g., submit a search query to search engine 225 ) for the search query of the link. In FIG. 7 , the search queries “Ratko Mladic,” “Serbia,” and “Bosnia and Herzegovina” are shown.
- Links 716 to additional documents may include links to one or more additional documents.
- the additional documents may be context documents that provide additional information, about the topic, but that may not be traditional news stories for the topic.
- the links 716 to the documents may include labels such as “International,” “Opinion,” “In Depth,” and “Wikipedia” to apprise the users that these links refer to specific types of documents.
- Links 718 to videos may include links to videos relevant to the topic. As shown in FIG. 7 , each link may be displayed as an image, such as an image from the video.
- the view of the topic may toggle between the summary view and the expanded view.
- a user viewing the summary view can select icon 705 to see the expanded view and then select icon 705 again to return to the summary view.
- Icon 705 may change its visual appearance when switching between the summary and expanded views.
- links 712 to additional local documents may link to a different news web site.
- Links 716 may link to yet other domains.
- FIG. 8 is a diagram of a user interface 800 , such as a user interface presented by a browser program executing at one of clients 110 .
- Interface 800 may be similar to interface 700 , except that another topic, topic 810 , is shown in an expanded view.
- information shown for topic 810 includes links 812 to additional documents in the cluster; links 814 to related searches; link 816 to an additional document labeled as a local document (“Local”); a link 818 to an additional document labeled as a wiki document; links 820 to videos; and an image link 822 .
- Links 812 to additional documents may include links to the secondary documents, such as news articles, about the main topic (“Will Republicans learn the of lesson NY-26 loss?”).
- Links 814 to related searches may include one or more links that, when selected, may initiate a search for the search query of the link. In FIG. 8 , the search queries “Kathy Hochul,” “Paul Ryan,” and “Jane Corwin” are shown.
- Link 816 to a local document may include a link that has the label “Local.”
- link 818 may include a link to wiki document about “Kathy Hochul” and is labeled “Wikipedia.”
- links 820 may include links to videos about the topic and link 822 may be in the form of an image that may link to a document, such as a text document or an image, about the topic.
- Expanded interfaces 710 ( FIG. 7 ) and 810 ( FIG. 8 ) generally illustrate some types of links and/or documents that may be included in an expandable view of a topic. Other types of links and/or documents may additionally be included.
- the labels shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 may include other labels, such as a “Highly Cited” label to indicate that a particular document is frequently linked to by other documents or “Opinion” to indicate that a document is an editorial document.
- Other examples of possible labels that may be used include: International, Live Blog, Satire, Preferred Source, and “Important.”
- Some labels, such as Important may be labels that are provided by the publisher of the document.
- Other labels may be determined and associated with the document by search engine 225 .
- other information such as facts relevant to a topic, may be displayed in an expanded view. For instance, for a topic about a heat wave in a particular region, the daily high temperature for the region may be presented. As another example, for a finance topic about a public company, a stock quote may be presented. Additional examples of information that may be shown in a the expanded view may include infographics (e.g., graphic visual representations of information, data, or knowledge) and user interactive boxes, such as a search box, user poll interfaces (e.g., a user may vote on a subject related to the topic by selecting choices in a user poll graphic), etc.
- infographics e.g., graphic visual representations of information, data, or knowledge
- user interactive boxes such as a search box, user poll interfaces (e.g., a user may vote on a subject related to the topic by selecting choices in a user poll graphic), etc.
- FIG. 9 is a diagram of a user interface 900 that may be presented to a user in response to selection of a video link, such as one of links 820 .
- the video may play back in an active window 910 that is overlaid on the interface of the expanded and summary views (e.g., as illustrated, on interface 800 ).
- the overlaid interface may be visually dimmed or otherwise de-emphasized relative to active window 910 .
