- the base station 104 transmits DCI messages to the UE 100 on a control channel that is carried in one or more of the subframes. Examples of control channels include a PDCCH and an EPDCCH.
- control channels include a PDCCH and an EPDCCH.
- the base station 104 transmits multiple instances of a DCI message spread out over multiple subframes. For example, turning to FIG. 3 , each radio frame in an embodiment is 10 milliseconds (“ms”) long. Each radio frame is divided into 10 subframes of 1 ms each. Each subframe includes a set of one or more CCEs, in which an instance of the DCI message is contained.
- subframe 30 has a set 302 of CCEs
- subframe 31 has a set 304 of CCEs
- Each set of CCEs of each of these 10 subframes has an instance of a DCI message for the UE 100 .
- the UE 100 is capable of aggregating as many of these instances as it needs in order to decode the DCI successfully. The more instances over which the DCI is repeated, the more likely it is that the UE 100 will successfully decode it.
- the UE 100 When the UE 100 receives transmissions from the base station 104 , the UE 100 does not initially know how many CCEs the base station 104 used to carry the DCI message. Furthermore, it does not necessarily know the number of repetitions over which the base station 104 has transmitted the DCI message. Turning to FIG. 4 , for example, the base station 104 may have repeated the DCI message over 10 subframes, starting from subframe 0 and ending at subframe 9 . This entire set of resources over which the DCI message is transmitted is referred to as the total aggregated resource (“TAR”).
- TAR total aggregated resource
- a group of subframes in which each subframes includes an instance of a particular DCI message is referred to a “subframe bundle.”
- the label TART refers to the fact that the DCI message is repeated over the course of one radio frame.
- the set of CCEs in the radio frame for which the UE performs a decoding attempt is said to be a “candidate,” and is labeled in FIG. 4 as C 0 .
- the first candidate may include of a total of eighty CCEs, with eight CCEs (indexed as CCE0, CCE1, CCE2, . . . , CCE7 within a subframe) in each subframe of a radio frame.
- the UE 100 can attempt to decode the DCI in the second radio frame, which is labeled C 1 (as in “candidate C 1 ”), the third radio frame C 2 , and the fourth radio frame C 3 .
- the base station 104 can also repeat the DCI message in subframe bundles that span multiple radio frames.
- the candidates C 4 and C 5 each span two radio frames and are referred to as having a TAR level of 2 (“TAR2”).
- Candidate C 6 spans four radio frames and is referred to as having a TAR level of 4 (“TAR4”).

- the modules In transmitting the DCI to the UE 100 , the modules carry out the following operations. The output from each of the modules acts as an input to the next module, as indicated by the arrows. Furthermore, the processing may be performed in other ways that result in an equivalent operation.

- the DCI-scrambling module 504 : (a) scrambles the CRC portion of the output of the cyclic-redundancy-check module 502 to generate a second set of bits and (b) scrambles the second set of bits using a scrambling sequence that is based on the subframe number of the first subframe of the subframe bundle to generate a third set of bits.
- the scrambling-sequence length is the number of bits in the DCI plus the number of bits in the CRC.
- the scrambling-sequence length may be small if only a small portion of the DCI plus the number of bits in the CRC are scrambled. For example, if the starting subframe is limited to only four possible values, then the scrambling sequence may be only two bits long (e.g., 00, 01, 10, or 11), hence only two bits of the encoded DCI are scrambled.

- the rate-matching module 508 rate matches the parity bits, resulting in rate-matched parity bits.
- the cell-specific scrambling module 510 scrambles the rate-matched parity bits in a cell-specific manner.

- the subframe bundle includes the subframes 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , and 39 .
- the DCI-scrambling module 504 could encode the number 30 (or a function that indicates the number 30) into the parity bits.
- this means that the subframe number would be encoded with the DCI on the CCEs 302 , the CCEs 304 , . . . , and the CCEs 320 .

Abstract
The present disclosure describes methods for multi-frame transmission and reception of control information. According to various embodiments, a base station scrambles bits of a downlink-control information (“DCI”) message using a scrambling sequence that is based on the subframe number of the first subframe of a bundle of subframes. In some embodiments, the scrambling sequence is based on the total aggregated resources used for transmitting the DCI. According to an embodiment, the base station performs this scrambling operation after performing a cyclic-redundancy-check operation. In other embodiments, the base station performs this scrambling operation after carrying out channel encoding. In still other embodiments, the base station performs this scrambling operation after carrying out rate matching.
Description
- The present disclosure relates generally to wireless communication and, more particularly, to methods for multi-subframe transmission and reception of control information.
- One area of exploration in wireless communication networking that has recently received increased attention is machine-type communication (“MTC”). A premise of MTC is that there is a need to have unattended devices such as home appliances communicate with wireless networks (e.g., cellular networks). Another premise is that such devices have communication needs that are distinct from devices such as cellphones, tablets, and laptops. One of those distinct needs relates to signal coverage. MTC devices are more likely to be in areas where there is high signal attenuation, making it more difficult to maintain reliable communication links. For example, one can imagine how difficult it might be for a basement humidifier to communicate with a cellular network in light of how much the structure of the house and the layers of earth would tend to attenuate the signal. One way of making signal coverage more robust is to overcome the attenuation by transmitting the signal over a longer period, such as by repeating the same information over multiple instances. This allows the receiving MTC device to accumulate signal energy over a longer duration.
- One circumstance in which this repetition principle can be used is in the transmission of downlink-control information (“DCI”). In Third Generation Partnership Project (“3GPP”) communication schemes (such as Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”)
Release 8 and above), a base station transmits DCI to a user equipment (“UE”) over a physical downlink-control channel (“PDCCH”) or enhanced physical downlink-control channel (“EPDCCH”). DCI includes physical-layer control information (such as resource allocation and modulation and coding schemes), hybrid automatic repeat request (“HARQ”) information (such as a new-data indicator, a HARQ process number, and a redundancy version), spatial-multiplexing information (such as the number of spatial-multiplexing layers, the precoding matrices, and information regarding the demodulation reference signal), uplink power-control bits, sounding reference signal, and Cyclic-Redundancy-Check (“CRC”) information (for error checking) Initially, a UE is not aware of the exact control channel structure of the transmissions it receives from a base station. Such structure includes the number of control channel elements (“CCEs”) used for transmitting a control channel to the UE and the location of the CCEs. The base station can transmit multiple control channels, any of which may or may not be relevant to the UE. The UE finds the control channel specific to it by attempting to decode each “candidate”—i.e., each set of CCEs on which a particular control channel could be mapped. If checks such as the CRC pass for a candidate control channel, then the UE considers the passing candidate to be the proper control channel. Occasionally, candidates with incorrect DCI contents and an incorrect CRC pass, but these can be discarded using consistency checks. If the same DCI is repeated over multiple subframes, however, the UE may have trouble identifying the subframe in which the DCI first appeared. This is significant because the UE may need to use that first subframe as a marker to identify where the data transmissions in the uplink and the downlink directions begin. For example, if the UE is supposed to start transmitting uplink data four subframes after the subframe in which the DCI first appeared, then decoding the wrong candidate can cause the UE to transmit data at the wrong time. - While the appended claims set forth the features of the present techniques with particularity, these techniques may be best understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of which:

In some embodiments, the scrambling sequence is based on the total aggregated resource used for transmitting the DCI. According to an embodiment, the base station performs this scrambling operation after performing a CRC operation. In other embodiments, the base station performs this scrambling operation after carrying out channel encoding. In still other embodiments, the base station performs this scrambling operation after carrying out rate matching.
- According to various embodiments, a UE descrambles bits of a DCI using a scrambling sequence that is based on the subframe number of the first subframe of a bundle of subframes. In some embodiments, the scrambling sequence is based on the total aggregated resource used for transmitting the DCI. According to an embodiment, the UE performs this scrambling operation after carrying out rate-dematching but before carrying out channel decoding (e.g., convolutional decoding). In other embodiments, the UE performs this scrambling operation after cell-specific descrambling but before performing rate-dematching. In other embodiments, the UE performs this scrambling operation after carrying out channel decoding but before performing a CRC-decoding operation.
- Turning to
FIG. 1 , a UE 100 is configured for wireless communication with awireless network 102 via abase station 104. Possible implementations of the UE 100 include a mobile phone (e.g., smartphone), a tablet computer, a laptop, a sensor, an electricity-meter reader, a smart thermostat, or other computing device. In one embodiment, thewireless network 102 operates according to one of the 3GPP standards (such as LTE), and thebase station 104 is an enhanced Node B. - Turning to
FIG. 2 , a possible implementation of the UE 100 and the base station 104 (“the device”) includes acontroller 202, a first transceiver 204 (e.g., a baseband chipset that includes a transceiver capable of communicating by radio according to a 3GPP standard), and asecond transceiver 206. The device further includes a memory 208 (in which the instructions of various signal-processing modules 210 are stored), a network interface 212 (used, for example, by thebase station 104 to communicate with other parts of the network 102), user-input devices 214 (e.g., a touchscreen and a microphone), output devices 216 (e.g., a display and a speaker), andantennas memory 208 can be implemented as volatile memory, non-volatile memory, or a combination thereof Thememory 208 may be implemented in multiple physical locations and across multiple types of media (e.g., dynamic random-access memory plus a hard-disk drive). Thememory 208 can also be split among multiple hardware components. In one embodiment, each of thecontroller 202, thefirst transceiver 204, and thesecond transceiver 206 has a separate memory, which is collectively represented by thememory 208. Thecontroller 202 retrieves instructions (including those of the signal-processing modules 210) from thememory 208 and operates according to those instructions to carry out various functions, including providing outgoing data to and receiving incoming data from thefirst transceiver 204 and thesecond transceiver 206. Thus, when this disclosure refers to any of the signal-processing modules 210 carrying out an action, it is, in many embodiments, thecontroller 202 that actually carries out the action (in coordination with other pieces of hardware of the device as necessary). - Each of the elements of the UE 100 is communicatively linked to the other elements via
data pathways 222. Possible implementations of thedata pathways 222 include wires, conductive pathways on a microchip, and wireless connections. Possible implementations of thecontroller 202 include a microprocessor (such as a baseband processor), a microcontroller, a digital signal processor, and a field-programmable gate array. - The
base station 104 communicates with theUE 100 using radio frames, each of which is divided into a series of subframes. Thebase station 104 transmits DCI messages to theUE 100 on a control channel that is carried in one or more of the subframes. Examples of control channels include a PDCCH and an EPDCCH. In an embodiment, thebase station 104 transmits multiple instances of a DCI message spread out over multiple subframes. For example, turning toFIG. 3 , each radio frame in an embodiment is 10 milliseconds (“ms”) long. Each radio frame is divided into 10 subframes of 1 ms each. Each subframe includes a set of one or more CCEs, in which an instance of the DCI message is contained. For example,subframe 30 has a set 302 of CCEs,subframe 31 has a set 304 of CCEs, etc. Each set of CCEs of each of these 10 subframes has an instance of a DCI message for theUE 100. TheUE 100 is capable of aggregating as many of these instances as it needs in order to decode the DCI successfully. The more instances over which the DCI is repeated, the more likely it is that theUE 100 will successfully decode it. - When the
UE 100 receives transmissions from thebase station 104, theUE 100 does not initially know how many CCEs thebase station 104 used to carry the DCI message. Furthermore, it does not necessarily know the number of repetitions over which thebase station 104 has transmitted the DCI message. Turning toFIG. 4 , for example, thebase station 104 may have repeated the DCI message over 10 subframes, starting fromsubframe 0 and ending atsubframe 9. This entire set of resources over which the DCI message is transmitted is referred to as the total aggregated resource (“TAR”). A group of subframes in which each subframes includes an instance of a particular DCI message is referred to a “subframe bundle.” The label TART refers to the fact that the DCI message is repeated over the course of one radio frame. When theUE 100 attempts to decode the DCI message in that first radio frame, the set of CCEs in the radio frame for which the UE performs a decoding attempt is said to be a “candidate,” and is labeled inFIG. 4 as C0. For example, the first candidate may include of a total of eighty CCEs, with eight CCEs (indexed as CCE0, CCE1, CCE2, . . . , CCE7 within a subframe) in each subframe of a radio frame. Similarly, theUE 100 can attempt to decode the DCI in the second radio frame, which is labeled C1 (as in “candidate C1”), the third radio frame C2, and the fourth radio frame C3. Thebase station 104 can also repeat the DCI message in subframe bundles that span multiple radio frames. For example, the candidates C4 and C5 each span two radio frames and are referred to as having a TAR level of 2 (“TAR2”). Candidate C6 spans four radio frames and is referred to as having a TAR level of 4 (“TAR4”). - Turning to
FIG. 5A , in an embodiment, the signal-processingmodules 210 of thebase station 104 include a cyclic-redundancy-check module 502, a DCI-scramblingmodule 504, a channel-encoding module 506 (e.g., a convolutional encoding module), a rate-matchingmodule 508, a cell-specific scrambling module 510, and a modulation andmapping module 512. In transmitting the DCI to theUE 100, the modules carry out the following operations. The output from each of the modules acts as an input to the next module, as indicated by the arrows. Furthermore, the processing may be performed in other ways that result in an equivalent operation. In this embodiment, the cyclic-redundancy-check module 502 generates parity bits based on the DCI and attaches those bits to the DCI. The DCI-scrambling module 504: (a) scrambles the CRC portion of the output of the cyclic-redundancy-check module 502 to generate a second set of bits and (b) scrambles the second set of bits using a scrambling sequence that is based on the subframe number of the first subframe of the subframe bundle to generate a third set of bits. Thus, the scrambling-sequence length is the number of bits in the DCI plus the number of bits in the CRC. In some operations the scrambling-sequence length may be small if only a small portion of the DCI plus the number of bits in the CRC are scrambled. For example, if the starting subframe is limited to only four possible values, then the scrambling sequence may be only two bits long (e.g., 00, 01, 10, or 11), hence only two bits of the encoded DCI are scrambled. The channel-encodingmodule 506 encodes the third set of bits to generate parity bits. The rate-matchingmodule 508 rate matches the parity bits, resulting in rate-matched parity bits. The cell-specific scrambling module 510 scrambles the rate-matched parity bits in a cell-specific manner. The modulation andmapping module 512 modulates the signals that are to carry the DCI and maps the signals to resource elements. There may be other processing modules as well. For example, in the case of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, the software modules include modules to associate the resource elements with subcarriers (i.e., in the frequency domain) and perform an inverse Fast Fourier Transform operation to obtain a time-domain signal. These steps are typically followed by other operations to prepare a transmission. - The
base station 104 transmits the output of the modulation andmapping module 512 via thefirst transceiver 204 and theantenna 218. The base station 104 (using the signal-processing modules 210) carries out these operations for each subframe of the subframe bundle. Thus, the subframe number of the first subframe of the bundle will, in effect, be encoded into the parity bits of each instance of the DCI in each of the subframes of the bundle. For example, if the subframe bundle includes thesubframes module 504 could encode the number 30 (or a function that indicates the number 30) into the parity bits. Continuing with the example ofFIG. 3 , this means that the subframe number would be encoded with the DCI on theCCEs 302, theCCEs 304, . . . , and theCCEs 320. - Turning to
FIG. 5B , in another embodiment, the signal-processingmodules 210 of thebase station 104 perform their respective functions in a different order. In this embodiment, the cyclic-redundancy-check module 502 generates parity bits based on the DCI and attaches those bits to the DCI. Thechannel encoder 506 encodes the output of the cyclic-redundancy-check module 502, including the parity bits. The DCI-scramblingmodule 504 then scrambles the channel-coded output ofchannel encoder 506 using a scrambling sequence that is based on the subframe number of the first subframe of the subframe bundle. In this embodiment, the scrambling sequence length is: -
- where R is code rate of the channel coding. For example, the rate is 1/3 for a convolutional encoder used in
Release 8 of LTE for the DCI transmission. The rate-matchingmodule 508, cell-specific scrambling module 510, and modulation andmapping module 512 each performs its respective functions in the same manner described above in conjunction withFIG. 5A . Thebase station 104 transmits the output of the modulation andmapping module 512 via thefirst transceiver 204 and theantenna 218. The base station 104 (using the signal-processing modules 210) carries out these operations for each subframe of the subframe bundle. - Turning to
FIG. 5C , in still another embodiment, the signal-processingmodules 210 of thebase station 104 perform their respective functions in another order. In this embodiment, the cyclic-redundancy-check module 502 generates parity bits based on the DCI and attaches those bits to the DCI. Thechannel encoder 506 encodes the output of the cyclic-redundancy-check module 502, including the parity bits. The rate-matchingmodule 508 rate matches the parity bits to generate rate-matched parity bits. The DCI-scramblingmodule 504 scrambles the parity bits using a scrambling sequence that is based on the subframe number of the first subframe of the subframe bundle. In this embodiment, the scrambling sequence length is: -
- where Reff is code-rate based on the available number of coded bits to transmit the DCI in one subframe. The modulation and
mapping module 512 performs its function in the same manner described above in conjunction withFIG. 5A . Thebase station 104 transmits the output of the modulation andmapping module 512 via thefirst transceiver 204 and theantenna 218. The base station 104 (using the signal-processing modules 210) carries out these operations for each subframe of the subframe bundle. - In the embodiments of
FIG. 5A ,FIG. 5B , andFIG. 5C , according to an embodiment, the TAR size is based on the number of subframes in the subframe bundle as well as on the resource size (e.g., the number of CCEs used) in each subframe of the subframe bundle. The TAR size may be selected from a set of known values (e.g., {1, 2, 4}). In some embodiments, the scrambling sequence is based on the TAR used for transmitting the DCI as well as on the subframe number of the first subframe. - In the embodiments of
FIG. 5A ,FIG. 5B , andFIG. 5C , the scrambling initialization cinit for the DCI-scramblingmodule 504 is given by cinit=f(ns,nstart DCI,TARDCI) where f is a function, nstart DCI is the slot number (or subframe number) of the first CCE (of a TAR) in which the DCI is transmitted, TARDCI denotes the TAR indicator for the DCI (e.g., 0 for TAR1, 1 for TAR2, and 2 for TAR4), and ns denotes the current slot number. In one example, cinit=└nstart DCI/2┘·29+TARDCI. In another example, cinit=└nstart DCI/2┘·29. In another example, for EPDCCH, cinit=└nstart DCI/2┘·29+nID,m EPDCCH, where nID,m EPDCCH is a scrambling identifier that is part of the EPDCCH configuration indicated by higher layer signaling. Note that the slot number can be replaced by a corresponding subframe number for equivalence. The scrambling initialization seed may be used with a scrambling-sequence generator (such as defined in the 3GPP LTE specification) to generate scrambling sequences. - According to various embodiments, the signal-processing
modules 210 of theUE 100 have a function inverse of those of thebase station 104 and may also have arrangements that mirror those ofFIG. 5A ,FIG. 5B , andFIG. 5C . - Turning to
