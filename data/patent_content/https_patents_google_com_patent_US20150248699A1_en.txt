Definitions
- This specification relates to keyword remarketing.
- the Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, for example, webpages, images, audio files, and videos. Such access to these resources has likewise enabled opportunities for providing relevant additional content.
- additional content is advertisements.
- resources of particular interest to a user can be identified by a search engine in response to a user query. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, it is possible to provide relevant advertisements (or other content items) to the user with search results.
- remarketing Another form of online advertising is remarketing, which allows advertisers to choose particular advertisements to be shown to users who have performed certain actions on a web page of an advertiser. For example, an advertiser can choose to show a particular advertisement to users who have recently visited the advertiser's website. As these users are likely interested in the advertiser's offerings, they are likely to be interested in the advertised product or service. Accordingly, remarketing can help drive online customers to the advertiser's website.
- This specification describes technologies relating to keyword remarketing.
- one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of generating a keyword remarketing list associated with one or more keywords selected by a content item provider; for each of a plurality of recipient identifiers, adding the recipient identifier to the keyword remarketing list in response to receiving an indication that a user device that corresponds to the recipient identifier has interacted with a search content item of the content item provider, the search content item having been provided to the user device in response to the user device transmitting a search query associated with one of the keywords; receiving a content item request for a content item to be provided with a publisher resource; determining that the content item request for the content item is for a user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list; and in response to the determination, providing a remarketing content item associated with the keyword remarketing list to the user device, the remarketing content item being a content item provided by the content item provider for distribution to user devices associated with recipient identifiers included
- Receiving a content item request may comprise receiving a content item request from the user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list.
- Receiving a content item request may comprise receiving a content item request from a content item network, and the content item request may include data indicating that the content item request is for a user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list.
- the publisher resource may be a web page hosted by a publisher, and the content item request may be generated in response to the user device rendering the publisher resource.
- the interaction with the search content item may comprise a selection of the search content item at the user device.
- the recipient identifier may be stored in a cookie associated with a content item server, and the cookie may be provided to the user device in response to the selection.
- Content item providers such as advertisers
- remarketing opportunities are identified on a keyword basis in conjunction with a user interaction. This allows content item providers to facilitate the generation of remarketing lists based on keywords without requiring modification of content item providers' landing pages, and without requiring referral information to be provided to or interpreted by content item providers.
- neither the content items nor the landing pages of the content item providers need be identified in advance.
- Remarketing helps advertisers identify opportunities to advertise to users who have already expressed an interest in products or services the advertisers offer. This may lead to a better return on investment for advertisers. Users, in turn, are provided with advertisements and other content items that are likely to be of interest the user.
- FIG. 1A is a block diagram of an example environment in which keyword remarketing occurs.
- FIG. 1B is a block diagram of an example data flow that represents a keyword remarketing process.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process for performing keyword remarketing.
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an example data processing apparatus.
- Advertisers may run advertising campaigns designed to provide customized or particular advertisements to users who have expressed interest in the advertiser's products or services.
- the systems and methods described below provide remarketing advertisements to users based on the users' interactions with search-based advertisements.
- An advertiser may select keywords to associate with a keyword remarketing list.
- the keywords to associate with an advertiser's keyword remarketing list may be selected from keywords that the advertiser is using to distribute search advertisements through a search engine.
- a shoe company may have a keyword remarketing list associated with the keyword, “shoes,” and a search advertisement associated with the keyword, “shoes.”
- the search advertisement is an advertisement that may be presented to a user device in response to the user device transmitting a search query that includes the word, “shoes,” to the search engine.
- User devices have recipient identifiers that may be added to an advertiser's keyword remarketing list in response to a user device interacting with a search advertisement of the advertiser. For example, if a user device transmits a search query including the word “shoes” to a search engine, the user device may be presented with the search advertisement associated with the keyword, “shoes.” If a user of the user device clicks on the search advertisement, a recipient identifier associated with the user device in the form of a advertisement server cookie (or some other identifier) may be set on the user device. Furthermore, the cookie identifier may be added to the advertiser's keyword remarketing list that is associated with the keyword, “shoes.”
- an advertisement system may receive a request for an advertisement to be provided with a publisher's resource, such as a web page. If the request indicates that the advertisement request is for a user device having a recipient identifier that is included in the keyword remarketing list, a remarketing advertisement associated with the keyword remarketing list may then be provided to the user device.
- a publisher's resource such as a web page.
- the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.
- user information e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location
- certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters).
- a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
- location information such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level
- FIG. 1A is a block diagram of an example environment 100 in which keyword remarketing occurs.
- a computer network 102 such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects publisher resources 104 , user devices 106 , advertisers 108 , a search engine 110 , a search advertisement system 112 , and a display advertisement system 114 .
- the online environment 100 may include many thousands of publisher resources 104 and user devices 106 .
- FIG. 1B is a block diagram of an example data flow 150 that represents a keyword remarketing process which may be performed in the example environment 100 .
- the example data flow 150 is a representation of the process by which a remarketing advertisement is provided to a particular user device 156 . Reference is made to both FIGS. 1A and 1B in the following description.
- a resource 104 is any data that can be provided by a publisher over the network 102 and that is associated with a resource address.
- Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few.
- PDF portable document format
- the resources may be included in a web site hosted by a publisher, such as publisher 160 , and the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts).
- a user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receiving resources 104 over the network 102 .
- Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over the network 102 .
- a user device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network 102 .
- the web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network.
- the search engine 110 identifies the resources by crawling publisher web sites and indexing the resources 104 provided by the publisher web sites.
- the resources are indexed in an index 116 .
- the user devices 106 submit search queries to the search engine 110 .
- the search queries are submitted in the form of a search request that includes the search request and, optionally, a unique identifier that identifies the user device 106 that submits the request.
- the unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device, or a user account identifier if the user maintains an account with the search engine 110 , or some other identifier that identifies the user device 106 or the user using the user device.
- the user device 156 submits a search query 118 , such as the word, “shoes,” to the search engine 110 .
- the search query 118 may be accompanied with an identifier that identifies the user device 156 .
- the search engine 110 uses the index 116 to identify resources that are relevant to the queries.
- the search engine 110 identifies the resources in the form of search results and returns the search results to the user devices 106 in a search results page resource.
- a search result is data generated by the search engine 110 that identifies a resource that satisfies a particular search query, and includes a resource locator for the resource.
- An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page.
- the search results are ranked based on scores related to the resources identified by the search results, such as information retrieval (“IR”) scores, and optionally a separate ranking of each resource relative to other resources (e.g., an authority score).
- IR information retrieval
- the search results are ordered according to these scores and provided to the user device according to the order.
- the search engine 110 in the example data flow 150 may receive the search query 118 , “shoes,” and identify resources related to “shoes” in the index 116 .
- the search engine 110 then provides ranked search results 120 to the user device 156 , and each search result includes a resource locator for a resource related to the search query 118 , “shoes.”
- the user devices 106 receive the search results pages and render the pages for presentation to users.
- the user device 106 requests the resource identified by the resource locator included in the selected search result.
- the publisher of the web site hosting the resource receives the request for the resource from the user device 106 and provides the resource to the requesting user device 106 .
- the search advertisement system 112 and display advertisement system 114 facilitate the provisioning of advertisements with search results and resources 104 .
- the search advertisement system 112 and display advertisement system 114 may be separate systems or, in some implementations, they may be part of a single advertisement management system 122 .
- the search advertisement system 112 and display advertisement system 114 allow advertisers 108 to define selection rules that take into account attributes of particular users to provide advertisements customized for the users.
- Example selection rules include keyword based selection, in which advertiser provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries or webpage content. Advertisements that are associated with keywords having bids that result in an advertisement slot being awarded in response to an auction are selected for displaying in the advertisement slots. Advertisements can be provided for many different resources, such as a search results page resource, or one of the resources 104 hosted by a publisher, e.g., publisher 160 .
- Keyword remarketing advertising allows an advertiser 108 to select specific advertisements to be presented to users who have interacted with a keyword advertisement belonging to the advertiser. For example, the advertisement management system 122 may generate a keyword remarketing list associated with the keywords, “shoes” and “sneakers,” which are keywords selected by Advertiser 166 . If a user selects one of the Advertiser's advertisements that are served based on the keyword, “shoes” or “sneakers,” that user may be added to a keyword remarketing list and later be provided with a remarketing advertisement based on the previous advertisement selection.
- the user device 156 renders the search results page 120 and sends a search advertisement request 124 to the search advertisement system 112 , along with one or more keywords related to the search query 118 that the user provided to the search engine 110 , e.g., the keyword “shoes.”
- the search advertisement request 124 may also be accompanied with a recipient identifier 158 , e.g., “RID1,” that identifies the user device 156 .
- the search advertisement system 112 provides search advertisements 126 to the particular user device 156 .
- Advertiser 166 may have search advertisements that it wants to distribute to users searching for shoes.
- Advertiser 166 has bid for the keyword “shoes” and wins a search advertisement auction, which results in its search advertisement(s) being provided to the user device 156 by the search advertisement system 112 .
- the user device 106 When a user of a user device 106 selects an advertisement on the search results page, the user device 106 generates a request for a landing page of the advertisement.
- the landing page may be, for example, a webpage of the advertiser.
- the advertisers 108 may also be web site publishers, each web site hosting respective web pages, some of which are landing pages for the advertisements of the advertisers 108 .
- the user device 106 may send data indicating that the user has selected the advertisement to the search advertisement system 112 or display advertisement system 114 .
- the user device will send selection data 170 to the search advertisement system 112 , and the selection data 170 may indicate the particular search advertisement selected by the user and, in some implementations, a recipient identifier for the user device 156 .
- the selection data also includes the particular keyword searched by the user device, e.g., “shoes.”
- the search advertisement system 112 upon receipt of the selection data 170 that includes a recipient identifier, may add the recipient identifier to a keyword remarketing list 168 for the advertiser that provided the search advertisement selected by the user device 156 .
- the recipient identifier included in the selection data 170 e.g., “RID1”
- the recipient identifier included in the selection data 170 can be added to the advertiser's keyword remarketing list 168 for the keyword “shoes.”
- a keyword included in the selection data e.g., “shoes” is also added to the keyword remarketing list and associated with the recipient identifier.
- the keyword remarketing list 168 may be used by the display advertisement system 114 to provide a remarketing advertisement associated with the keyword remarketing list 168 .
- a subsequent search advertisement interaction can be separately recorded in the keyword remarketing list. For example, a new entry in the keyword remarketing list may be created for each search advertisement interaction originating from a particular recipient identifier.
- a counter may be used to count multiple interactions with a search advertisement based on the same keyword. If a search advertisement is selected based on separate keywords associated with the keyword remarketing list, each keyword may be associated with the recipient identifier in the keyword remarketing list. For example, a user device may be used to select two search advertisements belonging to the advertiser 166 after issuing two different search queries.
- One search advertisement selection may be a result of the search query “shoes,” while a second selection may be the result of the search query, “sneakers.”
- both keywords e.g., “sneakers” and “shoes,” may be associated with the corresponding recipient identifier of the user device in the keyword remarketing list 168 for the advertiser 166 .
- the resource includes instructions that cause a user device 106 to send an advertisement request to the display advertisement system 114 .
- the advertisement request may include a recipient identifier for the user device and, optionally, keyword identifiers related to the content of the resource 104 .
- the display advertisement system 114 provides display advertisements to the particular user device.
- the user device 156 may send a resource request 162 to the publisher 160 of a particular resource.
- the publisher 160 provides the resource 164 , e.g., a web page, to the user device 156 along with instructions that cause the user device 156 to send a display advertisement request 128 to the display advertisement system 114 .
- the display advertisement request 128 also includes the recipient identifier 158 for the user device 156 .
- the display advertisement system 114 may determine that the recipient identifier 158 included with the request is included in the keyword remarketing list 168 . In response to making that determination, the display advertisement system 112 may select an advertisement associated with the keyword remarketing list 168 to provide to the user device 156 .
- the particular advertisement selected may depend on the particular keyword used to place the recipient identifier on the keyword remarketing list. If the display advertising system determines that a recipient identifier is not included in a keyword remarketing list, it may use any suitable method to provide a standard display advertisement.
- the display advertisement system 114 in response to each request for display advertisements, conducts an auction to select display advertisements that are provided in response to the request.
- the display advertisements may include remarketing advertisements, among other advertisements, each of which may be ranked according to a score that is based on an advertisement bid and one or more parameters specified in the display ad data 136 .
- the highest ranked display advertisements resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device.
- the advertisement management system 122 includes a data storage system that stores search ad data 132 and display ad data 134 .
- the each data storage stores advertisements, selection information, and budgeting information for advertisers.
- the data stores also performance data indicating the performance of the advertisements that are served.
- Such performance data can include, for example, click through rates for advertisements, the number of impressions for advertisements, and the number of conversions for advertisements. Other performance data can also be stored.
- FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for performing keyword remarketing.
- the process 200 may be used by a data processing apparatus that is used to realize one or more of the systems described above.
- the process 200 may be used by a display advertisement system or advertisement management system to provide a remarketing advertisement to a user device.
- the process 200 generates a keyword remarketing list ( 202 ).
- the keyword remarketing list is associated with one or more keywords selected by an advertiser.
- the advertiser selects keywords that are being used to serve the advertiser's search advertisements. For example, if an advertiser is an online bicycle retailer using the keywords “mountain bike,” “mountain bike sale,” “road bike,” and “road bike sale” to serve its search advertisements, then keywords “mountain bike,” and “road bike” may be selected by the advertiser for associating with a keyword remarketing list. Any single keyword or combinations of keywords being used by the advertiser for search advertisements may be selected for associating with a keyword remarketing list.
- the process 200 adds a recipient identifier to the keyword remarketing list ( 204 ).
- the recipient identifier is added to the keyword remarketing list in response to receiving an indication that a user device that corresponds to the recipient identifier has interacted with a search advertisement of the advertiser, and the search advertisement was provided to the user device in response to the user device transmitting a search query associated with one of the keywords. This may be done for each recipient identifier corresponding to a user device that has interacted with a search advertisement.
- the interaction with the search advertisement is a selection of the search advertisement at the user device. For example, if a user device transmits a search query including the keyword “mountain bike,” the user device may be provided with one of the bicycle retailer's advertisements associated with the keyword “mountain bike.” Upon receiving an indication that the advertisement was selected, the process 200 may add a recipient identifier of the user device to the bicycle retailer's keyword remarketing list for the “mountain bike” keyword.
- the particular keyword e.g., “mountain bike”
- the recipient identifier is stored in a cookie associated with an advertisement server, and the cookie including the identifier is provided to the user device in response to the advertisement selection.
- the process 200 receives an advertisement request ( 206 ).
- the advertisement request may be for an advertisement that is to be provided with a publisher resource.
- the publisher resource is a web page hosted by a publisher, and the advertisement request is generated in response to the user device rendering the publisher resource.
- a user device may request a web page from the publisher of a sports news website. When the user device renders the web page provided by the publisher, the user device may also request an advertisement to fill an ad slot of the requested web page.
- the advertisement request is received from the user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list.
- the same user device that clicked on the search advertisement associated with the keyword, “mountain bike,” may be the same user device requesting the advertisement.
- the advertisement request is received from an advertisement network, and the advertisement request includes data indicating that the advertisement request is for a user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list.
- the same user device that clicked on the search advertisement associated with the keyword, “mountain bike” may have requested an advertisement from an advertisement network, which in turn provided the advertisement request and recipient identifier to a data processing apparatus implementing the process 200 .
- the process 200 determines that the advertisement request is for a user device that is associated with a recipient identifier that is included in the keyword remarketing list ( 208 ).
- the recipient identifier included in the advertisement request may match a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list, e.g., the recipient identifier that was added to the keyword remarketing list in response to its corresponding user device selecting the search advertisement that was served based on the keyword “mountain bike.”
- the process 200 provides a remarketing advertisement associated with the keyword remarketing list to the user device ( 210 ).
- the remarketing advertisement is an advertisement provided by an advertiser for distribution to user devices associated with recipient identifiers included in one of its keyword remarketing lists.
- the bicycle retailer may create two advertisements, one advertisement for a mountain bike that it sells online, and a second advertisement for a road bike that it sells online.
- the retailer may associate the advertisements with its keyword remarketing list for the keywords “mountain bike,” and “road bike.”
- the user device may be provided with one of the advertisements that the retailer associated with the list.
- the particular advertisement provided may depend on the keyword associated with the recipient identifier included in the list. For example, if the recipient identifier was added to the list based on the keyword “mountain bike,” the advertisement for the mountain bike may be provided to the user device. Conversely, if the recipient identifier was added to the list based on the keyword “road bike,” the advertisement for the road bike may be provided to the user device.

Abstract
Methods, systems, and apparatus for keyword remarketing. In one aspect, a method includes generating a keyword remarketing list associated with one or more keywords selected by a content item provider; adding a recipient identifier to the keyword remarketing list in response to receiving an indication that a user device has interacted with a search content item, the search content item having been provided to the user device in response to the user device transmitting a search query; receiving a content item request for a content item to be provided; determining that the content item request is for a user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list; and providing a remarketing content item to the user device, the remarketing content item being a content item provided by the content item provider for distribution to user devices included in the keyword remarketing list.
Description
- This specification relates to keyword remarketing.
- The Internet provides access to a wide variety of resources, for example, webpages, images, audio files, and videos. Such access to these resources has likewise enabled opportunities for providing relevant additional content. One example of additional content is advertisements. For example, resources of particular interest to a user can be identified by a search engine in response to a user query. By comparing the user query to a list of keywords specified by an advertiser, it is possible to provide relevant advertisements (or other content items) to the user with search results.
- Another form of online advertising is remarketing, which allows advertisers to choose particular advertisements to be shown to users who have performed certain actions on a web page of an advertiser. For example, an advertiser can choose to show a particular advertisement to users who have recently visited the advertiser's website. As these users are likely interested in the advertiser's offerings, they are likely to be interested in the advertised product or service. Accordingly, remarketing can help drive online customers to the advertiser's website.
- This specification describes technologies relating to keyword remarketing.
- In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of generating a keyword remarketing list associated with one or more keywords selected by a content item provider; for each of a plurality of recipient identifiers, adding the recipient identifier to the keyword remarketing list in response to receiving an indication that a user device that corresponds to the recipient identifier has interacted with a search content item of the content item provider, the search content item having been provided to the user device in response to the user device transmitting a search query associated with one of the keywords; receiving a content item request for a content item to be provided with a publisher resource; determining that the content item request for the content item is for a user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list; and in response to the determination, providing a remarketing content item associated with the keyword remarketing list to the user device, the remarketing content item being a content item provided by the content item provider for distribution to user devices associated with recipient identifiers included in the keyword remarketing list. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.
- These and other embodiments can each optionally include one or more of the following features.
- Receiving a content item request may comprise receiving a content item request from the user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list.
- Receiving a content item request may comprise receiving a content item request from a content item network, and the content item request may include data indicating that the content item request is for a user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list.
- The publisher resource may be a web page hosted by a publisher, and the content item request may be generated in response to the user device rendering the publisher resource.
- The interaction with the search content item may comprise a selection of the search content item at the user device.
- The recipient identifier may be stored in a cookie associated with a content item server, and the cookie may be provided to the user device in response to the selection.
- Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Content item providers, such as advertisers, are presented with additional opportunities to customize content items for particular users without the need to specify particular content items or particular landing pages subject to remarketing. Instead, remarketing opportunities are identified on a keyword basis in conjunction with a user interaction. This allows content item providers to facilitate the generation of remarketing lists based on keywords without requiring modification of content item providers' landing pages, and without requiring referral information to be provided to or interpreted by content item providers. In addition, neither the content items nor the landing pages of the content item providers need be identified in advance. Remarketing helps advertisers identify opportunities to advertise to users who have already expressed an interest in products or services the advertisers offer. This may lead to a better return on investment for advertisers. Users, in turn, are provided with advertisements and other content items that are likely to be of interest the user.
- The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.

- Advertisers may run advertising campaigns designed to provide customized or particular advertisements to users who have expressed interest in the advertiser's products or services. The systems and methods described below provide remarketing advertisements to users based on the users' interactions with search-based advertisements.
- An advertiser may select keywords to associate with a keyword remarketing list. The keywords to associate with an advertiser's keyword remarketing list may be selected from keywords that the advertiser is using to distribute search advertisements through a search engine. For example, a shoe company may have a keyword remarketing list associated with the keyword, “shoes,” and a search advertisement associated with the keyword, “shoes.” The search advertisement is an advertisement that may be presented to a user device in response to the user device transmitting a search query that includes the word, “shoes,” to the search engine.
- User devices have recipient identifiers that may be added to an advertiser's keyword remarketing list in response to a user device interacting with a search advertisement of the advertiser. For example, if a user device transmits a search query including the word “shoes” to a search engine, the user device may be presented with the search advertisement associated with the keyword, “shoes.” If a user of the user device clicks on the search advertisement, a recipient identifier associated with the user device in the form of a advertisement server cookie (or some other identifier) may be set on the user device. Furthermore, the cookie identifier may be added to the advertiser's keyword remarketing list that is associated with the keyword, “shoes.”
- At a later time, an advertisement system may receive a request for an advertisement to be provided with a publisher's resource, such as a web page. If the request indicates that the advertisement request is for a user device having a recipient identifier that is included in the keyword remarketing list, a remarketing advertisement associated with the keyword remarketing list may then be provided to the user device.
- These features and other features are described in more detail below.
- For situations in which the systems discussed here collect information about users, or may make use of information about users, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features that may collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that certain information about the user is removed when generating parameters (e.g., demographic parameters). For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no identifying information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, users may have control over how information is collected about them and used by a content server.
- While implementations below are described with reference to advertisers and advertisements, the description is equally applicable to all content item providers and content items. The systems and methods described herein need not be limited to advertisers and advertisements.

FIG. 1A is a block diagram of anexample environment 100 in which keyword remarketing occurs. Acomputer network 102, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connectspublisher resources 104,user devices 106,advertisers 108, asearch engine 110, asearch advertisement system 112, and adisplay advertisement system 114. Theonline environment 100 may include many thousands ofpublisher resources 104 anduser devices 106. -
FIG. 1B is a block diagram of an example data flow 150 that represents a keyword remarketing process which may be performed in theexample environment 100. In particular, the example data flow 150 is a representation of the process by which a remarketing advertisement is provided to aparticular user device 156. Reference is made to bothFIGS. 1A and 1B in the following description. - A
resource 104 is any data that can be provided by a publisher over thenetwork 102 and that is associated with a resource address. Resources include HTML pages, word processing documents, and portable document format (PDF) documents, images, video, and feed sources, to name just a few. The resources may be included in a web site hosted by a publisher, such aspublisher 160, and the resources can include content, such as words, phrases, pictures, and so on, and may include embedded information (such as meta information and hyperlinks) and/or embedded instructions (such as scripts). - A
user device 106 is an electronic device that is under the control of a user and is capable of requesting and receivingresources 104 over thenetwork 102.Example user devices 106 include personal computers, mobile communication devices, and other devices that can send and receive data over thenetwork 102. Auser device 106 typically includes a user application, such as a web browser, to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over thenetwork 102. The web browser can enable a user to display and interact with text, images, videos, music and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web or a local area network. - To facilitate searching of these
resources 104, thesearch engine 110 identifies the resources by crawling publisher web sites and indexing theresources 104 provided by the publisher web sites. The resources are indexed in anindex 116. - The
user devices 106 submit search queries to thesearch engine 110. The search queries are submitted in the form of a search request that includes the search request and, optionally, a unique identifier that identifies theuser device 106 that submits the request. The unique identifier can be data from a cookie stored at the user device, or a user account identifier if the user maintains an account with thesearch engine 110, or some other identifier that identifies theuser device 106 or the user using the user device. In the example data flow 150 ofFIG. 1B , theuser device 156 submits asearch query 118, such as the word, “shoes,” to thesearch engine 110. Thesearch query 118 may be accompanied with an identifier that identifies theuser device 156. - In response to the search request, the
search engine 110 uses theindex 116 to identify resources that are relevant to the queries. Thesearch engine 110 identifies the resources in the form of search results and returns the search results to theuser devices 106 in a search results page resource. A search result is data generated by thesearch engine 110 that identifies a resource that satisfies a particular search query, and includes a resource locator for the resource. An example search result can include a web page title, a snippet of text extracted from the web page, and the URL of the web page. - The search results are ranked based on scores related to the resources identified by the search results, such as information retrieval (“IR”) scores, and optionally a separate ranking of each resource relative to other resources (e.g., an authority score). The search results are ordered according to these scores and provided to the user device according to the order.
- For example, the
search engine 110 in the example data flow 150 may receive thesearch query 118, “shoes,” and identify resources related to “shoes” in theindex 116. Thesearch engine 110 then provides rankedsearch results 120 to theuser device 156, and each search result includes a resource locator for a resource related to thesearch query 118, “shoes.” - The
user devices 106 receive the search results pages and render the pages for presentation to users. In response to the user selecting a search result at auser device 106, theuser device 106 requests the resource identified by the resource locator included in the selected search result. The publisher of the web site hosting the resource receives the request for the resource from theuser device 106 and provides the resource to the requestinguser device 106. - The
search advertisement system 112 anddisplay advertisement system 114 facilitate the provisioning of advertisements with search results andresources 104. Thesearch advertisement system 112 anddisplay advertisement system 114 may be separate systems or, in some implementations, they may be part of a singleadvertisement management system 122. In particular, thesearch advertisement system 112 anddisplay advertisement system 114 allowadvertisers 108 to define selection rules that take into account attributes of particular users to provide advertisements customized for the users. Example selection rules include keyword based selection, in which advertiser provide bids for keywords that are present in either search queries or webpage content. Advertisements that are associated with keywords having bids that result in an advertisement slot being awarded in response to an auction are selected for displaying in the advertisement slots. Advertisements can be provided for many different resources, such as a search results page resource, or one of theresources 104 hosted by a publisher, e.g.,publisher 160. - Another form of advertising facilitated by the
advertisement management system 122 is keyword remarketing advertising. Keyword remarketing advertising allows anadvertiser 108 to select specific advertisements to be presented to users who have interacted with a keyword advertisement belonging to the advertiser. For example, theadvertisement management system 122 may generate a keyword remarketing list associated with the keywords, “shoes” and “sneakers,” which are keywords selected byAdvertiser 166. If a user selects one of the Advertiser's advertisements that are served based on the keyword, “shoes” or “sneakers,” that user may be added to a keyword remarketing list and later be provided with a remarketing advertisement based on the previous advertisement selection. - In the example data flow 150, the
user device 156 renders the search resultspage 120 and sends a search advertisement request 124 to thesearch advertisement system 112, along with one or more keywords related to thesearch query 118 that the user provided to thesearch engine 110, e.g., the keyword “shoes.” The search advertisement request 124 may also be accompanied with arecipient identifier 158, e.g., “RID1,” that identifies theuser device 156. - The
search advertisement system 112, in turn, providessearch advertisements 126 to theparticular user device 156. For example,Advertiser 166 may have search advertisements that it wants to distribute to users searching for shoes. In the example environment 150,Advertiser 166 has bid for the keyword “shoes” and wins a search advertisement auction, which results in its search advertisement(s) being provided to theuser device 156 by thesearch advertisement system 112. - When a user of a
user device 106 selects an advertisement on the search results page, theuser device 106 generates a request for a landing page of the advertisement. The landing page may be, for example, a webpage of the advertiser. In some implementations, theadvertisers 108 may also be web site publishers, each web site hosting respective web pages, some of which are landing pages for the advertisements of theadvertisers 108. - In addition to requesting the landing page of the selected advertisement, the
user device 106 may send data indicating that the user has selected the advertisement to thesearch advertisement system 112 ordisplay advertisement system 114. For example, when theuser device 156 selects one of thesearch advertisements 126, the user device will sendselection data 170 to thesearch advertisement system 112, and theselection data 170 may indicate the particular search advertisement selected by the user and, in some implementations, a recipient identifier for theuser device 156. In some implementations, the selection data also includes the particular keyword searched by the user device, e.g., “shoes.” - The
search advertisement system 112, upon receipt of theselection data 170 that includes a recipient identifier, may add the recipient identifier to akeyword remarketing list 168 for the advertiser that provided the search advertisement selected by theuser device 156. For example, if theselection data 170 indicates that the user selected a search advertisement that was served based on the keyword “shoes,” and the selected search advertisement belonged toadvertiser 166, the recipient identifier included in theselection data 170, e.g., “RID1,” can be added to the advertiser'skeyword remarketing list 168 for the keyword “shoes.” In some implementations, a keyword included in the selection data, e.g., “shoes,” is also added to the keyword remarketing list and associated with the recipient identifier. Thekeyword remarketing list 168 may be used by thedisplay advertisement system 114 to provide a remarketing advertisement associated with thekeyword remarketing list 168. - In some implementations, if a recipient identifier is already included in a keyword remarketing list, a subsequent search advertisement interaction can be separately recorded in the keyword remarketing list. For example, a new entry in the keyword remarketing list may be created for each search advertisement interaction originating from a particular recipient identifier. In some implementations, a counter may be used to count multiple interactions with a search advertisement based on the same keyword. If a search advertisement is selected based on separate keywords associated with the keyword remarketing list, each keyword may be associated with the recipient identifier in the keyword remarketing list. For example, a user device may be used to select two search advertisements belonging to the
advertiser 166 after issuing two different search queries. One search advertisement selection may be a result of the search query “shoes,” while a second selection may be the result of the search query, “sneakers.” In this situation, both keywords, e.g., “sneakers” and “shoes,” may be associated with the corresponding recipient identifier of the user device in thekeyword remarketing list 168 for theadvertiser 166. - With respect to advertisements provided with a
resource 104 from a publisher, the resource includes instructions that cause auser device 106 to send an advertisement request to thedisplay advertisement system 114. The advertisement request may include a recipient identifier for the user device and, optionally, keyword identifiers related to the content of theresource 104. Thedisplay advertisement system 114, in turn, provides display advertisements to the particular user device. - For example, the
user device 156 may send aresource request 162 to thepublisher 160 of a particular resource. Thepublisher 160 provides theresource 164, e.g., a web page, to theuser device 156 along with instructions that cause theuser device 156 to send adisplay advertisement request 128 to thedisplay advertisement system 114. Thedisplay advertisement request 128 also includes therecipient identifier 158 for theuser device 156. When thedisplay advertisement system 114 receives thedisplay advertisement request 128, it may determine that therecipient identifier 158 included with the request is included in thekeyword remarketing list 168. In response to making that determination, thedisplay advertisement system 112 may select an advertisement associated with thekeyword remarketing list 168 to provide to theuser device 156. If the keyword remarketing list is associated with multiple keywords and advertisements, the particular advertisement selected may depend on the particular keyword used to place the recipient identifier on the keyword remarketing list. If the display advertising system determines that a recipient identifier is not included in a keyword remarketing list, it may use any suitable method to provide a standard display advertisement. - In some implementations, the
display advertisement system 114, in response to each request for display advertisements, conducts an auction to select display advertisements that are provided in response to the request. The display advertisements may include remarketing advertisements, among other advertisements, each of which may be ranked according to a score that is based on an advertisement bid and one or more parameters specified in thedisplay ad data 136. The highest ranked display advertisements resulting from the auction are selected and provided to the requesting user device. - The
advertisement management system 122 includes a data storage system that stores search ad data 132 anddisplay ad data 134. The each data storage stores advertisements, selection information, and budgeting information for advertisers. In some implementations, the data stores also performance data indicating the performance of the advertisements that are served. Such performance data can include, for example, click through rates for advertisements, the number of impressions for advertisements, and the number of conversions for advertisements. Other performance data can also be stored. -
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an example process 200 for performing keyword remarketing. The process 200 may be used by a data processing apparatus that is used to realize one or more of the systems described above. In particular, the process 200 may be used by a display advertisement system or advertisement management system to provide a remarketing advertisement to a user device. - The process 200 generates a keyword remarketing list (202). The keyword remarketing list is associated with one or more keywords selected by an advertiser. In some implementations, the advertiser selects keywords that are being used to serve the advertiser's search advertisements. For example, if an advertiser is an online bicycle retailer using the keywords “mountain bike,” “mountain bike sale,” “road bike,” and “road bike sale” to serve its search advertisements, then keywords “mountain bike,” and “road bike” may be selected by the advertiser for associating with a keyword remarketing list. Any single keyword or combinations of keywords being used by the advertiser for search advertisements may be selected for associating with a keyword remarketing list.
- The process 200 adds a recipient identifier to the keyword remarketing list (204). The recipient identifier is added to the keyword remarketing list in response to receiving an indication that a user device that corresponds to the recipient identifier has interacted with a search advertisement of the advertiser, and the search advertisement was provided to the user device in response to the user device transmitting a search query associated with one of the keywords. This may be done for each recipient identifier corresponding to a user device that has interacted with a search advertisement.
- In some implementations, the interaction with the search advertisement is a selection of the search advertisement at the user device. For example, if a user device transmits a search query including the keyword “mountain bike,” the user device may be provided with one of the bicycle retailer's advertisements associated with the keyword “mountain bike.” Upon receiving an indication that the advertisement was selected, the process 200 may add a recipient identifier of the user device to the bicycle retailer's keyword remarketing list for the “mountain bike” keyword. In some implementations, the particular keyword, e.g., “mountain bike,” is also stored with the recipient identifier in the keyword remarketing list. In some implementations, the recipient identifier is stored in a cookie associated with an advertisement server, and the cookie including the identifier is provided to the user device in response to the advertisement selection.
- The process 200 receives an advertisement request (206). The advertisement request may be for an advertisement that is to be provided with a publisher resource. In some implementations, the publisher resource is a web page hosted by a publisher, and the advertisement request is generated in response to the user device rendering the publisher resource. For example, a user device may request a web page from the publisher of a sports news website. When the user device renders the web page provided by the publisher, the user device may also request an advertisement to fill an ad slot of the requested web page.
- In some implementations, the advertisement request is received from the user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list. For example, the same user device that clicked on the search advertisement associated with the keyword, “mountain bike,” may be the same user device requesting the advertisement. In some implementations, the advertisement request is received from an advertisement network, and the advertisement request includes data indicating that the advertisement request is for a user device that is associated with a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list. For example, the same user device that clicked on the search advertisement associated with the keyword, “mountain bike,” may have requested an advertisement from an advertisement network, which in turn provided the advertisement request and recipient identifier to a data processing apparatus implementing the process 200.
- The process 200 determines that the advertisement request is for a user device that is associated with a recipient identifier that is included in the keyword remarketing list (208). For example, the recipient identifier included in the advertisement request may match a recipient identifier included in the keyword remarketing list, e.g., the recipient identifier that was added to the keyword remarketing list in response to its corresponding user device selecting the search advertisement that was served based on the keyword “mountain bike.”
- In response to the determination, the process 200 provides a remarketing advertisement associated with the keyword remarketing list to the user device (210). The remarketing advertisement is an advertisement provided by an advertiser for distribution to user devices associated with recipient identifiers included in one of its keyword remarketing lists. For example, the bicycle retailer may create two advertisements, one advertisement for a mountain bike that it sells online, and a second advertisement for a road bike that it sells online. The retailer may associate the advertisements with its keyword remarketing list for the keywords “mountain bike,” and “road bike.” When a user device with a recipient identifier included in the list requests an advertisement, the user device may be provided with one of the advertisements that the retailer associated with the list.
- In some implementations the particular advertisement provided may depend on the keyword associated with the recipient identifier included in the list. For example, if the recipient identifier was added to the list based on the keyword “mountain bike,” the advertisement for the mountain bike may be provided to the user device. Conversely, if the recipient identifier was added to the list based on the keyword “road bike,” the advertisement for the road bike may be provided to the user device.

- Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing actions in accordance with instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio or video player, a game console, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, or a portable storage device (e.g., a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive), to name just a few. Devices suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.
- To provide for interaction with a user, embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's user device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a user computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification, or any combination of one or more such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (“LAN”) and a wide area network (“WAN”), an inter-network (e.g., the Internet), and peer-to-peer networks (e.g., ad hoc peer-to-peer networks).
- The computing system can include users and servers. A user and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of user and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a user-server relationship to each other. In some embodiments, a server transmits data (e.g., an HTML page) to a user device (e.g., for purposes of displaying data to and receiving user input from a user interacting with the user device). Data generated at the user device (e.g., a result of the user interaction) can be received from the user device at the server.
- While this specification contains many specific implementation details, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any inventions or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular embodiments of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments can also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.
- Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.
- Thus, particular embodiments of the subject matter have been described. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
