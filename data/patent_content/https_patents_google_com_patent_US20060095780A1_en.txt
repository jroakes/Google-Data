Abstract
Description
- The invention relates generally to the field of network-based communications and, more particularly, to a system and method to facilitate importation of user profile data over a network, such as the Internet.
- The explosive growth of the Internet, and of its subset, the World Wide Web (Web), as a publication and interactive communication platform has created an electronic environment that is changing the way business is transacted. Many sites found on the Web allow users to create a user profile and to store data related to the user in the user profile. In some instances, the user may modify such data by accessing the user profile within the site, while in other instances data may be modified by other users according to specific rules developed by the site.
- For example, many sites allow users to accumulate a reputation based on feedback information entered by participants in transactions on the particular site. Following the completion of a transaction, the participants may enter positive or negative “feedback” evaluating the honesty, reliability, and/or promptness of their transactional counterparts. Over time, evaluations of a particular user accumulate in the user profile, allowing prospective transactional counterparts of the user to assess the reputation of the user prior to any potential transaction.
- In another example, certain sites allow users to develop a reputation using indirect means. Users are allowed to submit reviews of products listed on the site, such as, for example books or other literary works. Subsequent visitors to the site may read such reviews and judge their usefulness. The users who gather positive comments are considered top reviewers and their reputation is enhanced.
- In yet another example, certain sites allow users to submit comments on stories posted by the editors of that particular site. Other users can subsequently evaluate such comments by assigning various descriptive attributes, such as “funny” or “informative.” A resulting score is computed for each comment posted on the site, with predetermined positive attributes increasing the score and predetermined negative attributes lowering the score.
- While such attempts appear to be useful within each respective site, the scope of such ratings is limited. The user profile data defines the user within the universe of the site and is not portable from site to site. Thus, what is needed is a system and method to facilitate importation of user profile data from one entity to another over a network, such as, for example, the Internet.
- A system and method to facilitate importation of user profile data over a network are described. In one preferred embodiment, a request to import the user profile data is received from a user, the user profile data being stored in a source user account within a source entity. Prior to importation of the user profile data, the source user account is authenticated as being associated with the user. Subsequent to the authentication, the user profile data is received from the source entity and is merged within a destination user account associated with the user. Alternatively, the user profile data may be used to create a destination user account associated with the user.

FIG. 3 , theauthentication servers 122 request authentication data directly from the user, such as, for example, a valid password for the source user account, and use the password to authenticate the transfer. In an alternate embodiment, as further described in detail in connection withFIG. 4 , theauthentication servers 122 authenticate the source user account by monitoring the user through theclient machine 110 as the user performs an authentication action that necessarily requires access to the source user account. In another alternate embodiment, as further described in detail in connection withFIG. 5 , theauthentication servers 122 may request the user to provide an outwardly visible change on the source entity via the source user account. - Referring back to
FIG. 2 , atprocessing block 230, subsequent to successful authentication of the source user account, a request to import the user profile data is transmitted to thesource entity 130. In one embodiment, thedestination entity 120 connects to thesource entity 130 via thenetwork 101 andcommunications servers source entity 130. Theauthentication servers 131 receive the request, retrieve the user profile data from the respective tables within theuser database 133 and transmit the user profile data back to thedestination entity 120. In an alternate embodiment, the user may request the transfer of profile data from thesource entity 130 to thedestination entity 120 via theclient machine 110 and thenetwork 101. - At
processing block 240, the user profile data is received from thesource entity 130. In one embodiment, theauthentication servers 122 within thedestination entity 120 receive the user profile data from thesource entity 130 via thenetwork 101. - Finally, at
processing block 250, the received user profile data is merged within a destination user account. In one embodiment, theauthentication servers 122 merge the user profile data received from the source user account into the destination user account stored in thedestination user database 123, which also contains user profile data accumulated for the user as a result of completion of transactions with thedestination entity 120. In an alternate embodiment, the user profile data received from the source user account may be used to create or to set up a destination user account for transactions via thedestination entity 120. The user may subsequently modify the user profile data by adding new data derived from the transactions completed via thedestination entity 120. -
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a method to authenticate a user and a corresponding source user account, according to one embodiment of the invention. As illustrated inFIG. 3 , atprocessing block 310, a request to provide authentication data for the source user account is transmitted to the user. In one embodiment, theauthentication servers 122 request authentication data directly from the user, such as, for example, a valid password for the source user account. - At
processing block 320, the authentication data is received from the user. In one embodiment, the user transmits the authentication data, such as, for example the valid password, to theauthentication servers 122 via theclient machine 110, thenetwork 101, and thecommunication servers 121. - At
processing block 330, the source user account within thesource entity 130 is accessed using the authentication data provided by the user. In one embodiment, theauthentication servers 122 access the source user account within thesource entity 130 and authenticate the source user account using the valid password submitted by the user. -
FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a method to authenticate a user and a corresponding source user account, according to an alternate embodiment of the invention. As illustrated inFIG. 4 , atprocessing block 410, a destination client, such as, for example a destination client program similar to theclient program 115, is installed on theclient machine 110 of the user. In one embodiment, theauthentication servers 122 install the destination client program on theclient machine 110 to monitor the activity of the user and any Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) transfer requests that the user exchanges with the source entity through thenetwork 101. - At
processing block 420, the user is prompted to access the source user account within thesource entity 130. In one embodiment, theauthentication servers 122 within thedestination entity 120 prompt the user to connect to thesource entity 130 and to access the source user account. Alternatively, theauthentication servers 122 prompt the user to connect to thesource entity 130 using a link accessible only with a valid password, thereby authenticating the user and the source user account. - At
processing block 430, the access to thesource entity 130 and the source user account is monitored via the destination client program to authenticate the user and the source user account. In one embodiment, theauthentication servers 122 monitor the user activity via the destination client program installed within theclient machine 110 and authenticate the user as the owner of the source user account if the user accesses the source user account within thesource entity 130 using a valid password. Alternatively, theauthentication servers 122 complete the authentication process if the user connects to thesource entity 130 and receives information via a HTTP request from the link accessible only with the valid password. -
FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a method to authenticate a user and a corresponding source user account, according to another alternate embodiment of the invention. As illustrated inFIG. 5 , atprocessing block 510, a request is transmitted to the user to modify one or more parameters related to the source user account within thesource entity 130. In one embodiment, theauthentication servers 122 within thedestination entity 120 transmit a request to the user via thenetwork 101 to modify one or more parameters within thesource entity 130, each parameter being related to the source user account and being outwardly visible to thedestination entity 120 via thenetwork 101. The user may then communicate with thedestination entity 120, the communication detailing modification of the parameter or parameters. For example, if the source user account login procedure provides for a password hint in the event that the user forgets the password for the account, theauthentication servers 122 may request the user to alter the password hint as evidence of valid access to the source user account. Specifically, the user may communicate to thedestination entity 120 that a change of the password hint from “xxx” to “yyy” will take place after a predetermined period of time. Theauthentication servers 122 may subsequently request the original password hint and the modified password hint from thesource entity 130 and verify the validity of the action. - At
processing block 520, theauthentication servers 122 within thedestination entity 120 connect to thesource entity 130 via thenetwork 101 and verify the modified parameters to authenticate the user as the owner of the source user account. In an alternate embodiment, other externally visible changes may be used, such as, for example, a publicly visible transaction (a sale, or a posting of a review or comment) requiring valid access to the source user account may be conducted by the user and theauthentication servers 122 may verify such posting of the transaction within thesource entity 130. -
