- the personal search index may return a search result that identifies the document that includes the portion that is only to be accessible by the user. Whereas another user issuing the same search query, and who does not have access to the portion of the document, may not receive the search result that identifies the document.
- a document is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product.
- a document may include, for example, a website, an e-mail, a business listing, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, etc.
- a common document is a web page.
- Documents often include textual information and may include embedded information, such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc., and/or embedded instructions, such as Javascript, etc.
- metadata e.g., face tags, computer vision labels, and other types of metadata
- GUIs graphical user interfaces
- non-graphical user interfaces such as text-based interfaces.

- Information associated with the user interfaces may be selected and/or manipulated by a user of a user device (e.g., via a touch screen display, a mouse, a keyboard, a keypad, voice commands, etc.).
- FIGS. 1A and 1B are diagrams illustrating an overview of some implementations described herein.
- a personal search system includes private content (e.g., one or more documents) that may be visible and/or searchable (i.e., accessible) by a set of users.
- the private content includes a particular document (e.g., Document 3) with a portion that is to be visible and/or searchable only by particular user(s) of the set of users.
- the personal search system may include an indexer component that receives the documents from the private content.
- the indexer component may extract metadata associated with each document, and may store the document metadata in a personal search index.
- the metadata may include, for example, information that describes how large the image is, a color depth of the image, a resolution of the image, when the image was created, etc.
- the metadata may include, for example, information about a length of the document, an author of the document, when the document was written, a summary of the document, etc.
- the document metadata may include metadata associated with a first document (e.g., Document 1), a second document (e.g., Document 2), etc.
- the indexer component may determine, based on the document metadata, whether a portion of a document includes information that is only to be accessible by a particular user(s) from the set of users. For example, the indexer component may determine that a portion of the particular document (e.g., Document 3) includes information that is only to be accessible by the particular user(s).
- the indexer component may append a restrict indicator to the metadata of the particular document. The restrict indicator may identify the particular user and the portion of the particular document.
- the indexer component may determine that a portion of a document is accessible to a certain class of users, and may assign a restrict indicator to the certain class of users (e.g., as opposed to enumerating each member of the certain class).
- the indexer component may store the particular document metadata and the restrict indicator in the personal search index.
- personal search system includes a search engine component that receives a search query from a user.
- the search query relates to the particular document (e.g., Document 3) and/or the restricted portion of the particular document.
- the search engine component may add a restriction(s) to the search query based on information associated with the user (e.g., user identification).
- the restriction(s) may include information identifying document portions that are accessible by the user.
- the restriction(s) may specify that the portion of the particular document (e.g., Document 3) is accessible by the user.
- the search engine component may compare the search query and the restriction(s) with the personal search index, and may identify search result(s) based on the search query and the restriction(s). For example, the search engine component may identify the particular document in the search result(s) based on the restriction(s) matching the restrict indicator.
- the search engine component may provide the search result(s) to a scoring component of the personal search system.
- the scoring component may score the search result(s), and may provide the scored search result(s) to the user, via the search engine component.

- Server devices 220 - 240 may include server devices that gather, process, search, and/or implement functions in a manner described herein. Each server device 220 - 240 may be implemented as a single server device or a collection of server devices that may be co-located or remotely located. In some implementations, any two or more of server devices 220 - 240 may be implemented within a single, common server device or a single, common collection of server devices. While server devices 220 - 240 are shown as separate components, it may be possible for one or more of server devices 220 - 240 to perform one or more of the functions of another one or more of server devices 220 - 240 .
- server device 220 may implement a search system 225 that receives search queries from user device 210 , and that provides search results that are responsive to the search queries.
- search system 225 may include a personal search system that enables a set of users to search private content accessible only to the set of users.
- Server device 220 may crawl a corpus of documents, e.g., web pages, index the documents, and store information associated with the documents.

- environment 200 may include additional components, fewer components, different components, and/or differently arranged components than those depicted in FIG. 2 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more components of environment 200 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other components of environment 200 .
- FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process 300 for indexing documents with restricted portions.
- process 300 may be performed by server device 220 , such as by search system 225 of server device 220 .
- process 300 may be performed by one or more other devices instead of, or possibly in conjunction with, server device 220 .
- Process 300 may include receiving a document from private content that includes a group of documents and is accessible by a set of users (block 310 ).
- server device 220 and/or servers 230 / 240 may include a repository of private content.
- the private content may include one or more documents that may only be visible and/or searchable (i.e., accessible) by a set of users.
- the private content may include blog posts, images, videos, text documents, etc. stored by the set of users in the repository.
- Server device 220 e.g., search system 225
- search system 225 may request the document from the repository, and the repository may provide the document to search system 225 based on the request.
- search system 225 may crawl the private content, and may receive the document based on crawling the private content.
- one or more documents of the private content may include portion(s) that are only to be accessible to a subset (e.g., one or more particular users) of the set of users.
- a user of the set of users may provide photos in the private content and may identify who is in each photo by tagging their faces with names. Different users of the set of users may tag a same photo as the user. The set of users may have access to the user's photos, but the user may mark the tags as private and restricted to particular users.
- Process 300 may further include extracting metadata from the document (block 320 ).
- server device 220 e.g., an indexer component of search system 225
- the metadata may include, for example, information that describes how large the image is, a color depth of the image, a resolution of the image, when the image was created, etc.
- the metadata may include, for example, information about a length of the document, an author of the document, when the document was written, a summary of the document, etc.
- the indexer component may extract information from text and/or hypertext markup language (HTML) code of the document, and may associate the extracted information, as keywords, with information identifying the document.
- the indexer component may create, from the HTML code of the document, keywords relating to visual features of the document.
- the indexer component may create, from the HTML code of the document, a keyword corresponding to the color of the background of the document, a keyword corresponding to the color of the text in the document, a keyword corresponding to the size of the text in the document, a keyword indicating whether the document includes an image, a keyword associated with a geographic location, e.g., global satellite coordinates, associated with an image in the document, a keyword indicating a date and/or time when the image was captured, and/or a keyword indicating the quantity of images in document.
- a geographic location e.g., global satellite coordinates
- Process 300 may further include determining, based on the metadata, whether a portion of the document includes information only to be accessible by a particular user(s) of the set of users (block 330 ).
- server device 220 e.g., the indexer component of search system 225
- the indexer component may analyze the metadata of the image to determine whether there are private tags (e.g., private face tags) associated with the image.
- the indexer component may analyze the document metadata to identify the private location information. In some implementations, if the document is a presentation, the indexer component may analyze the metadata of the presentation to determine whether there are private notes associated with the presentation.
- the private tags, the private location information, and the private notes may be considered portions of a document that include information that is only to be accessible by the particular user(s).
- two or more different portions of a document may be marked as private (i.e., restricted) to the same user, to different users, etc.
- a first portion of an image may be marked as private to a first user
- a second, different portion of the image may be marked as private to a second user.
- an entire document may be restricted to a subset of users of the set of users, and one or more portions of the document may be restricted to a subset of the subset of users. For example, if the set of users includes one-hundred (100) people, the entire document may be restricted to ten (10) people from the set of users, and portion(s) of the document may be restricted to three (3) of the ten people.
- process 300 may include appending a restrict indicator to the metadata (block 340 ).
- server device 220 e.g., the indexer component of search system 225 , may determine that a portion of the document includes information that is only to be accessible by a particular user of the set of users. Based on this determination, the indexer component may append a restrict indicator to the metadata associated with the document.
- the restrict indicator may identify the particular user, the portion of the document, and/or the information provided in the document portion. For example, if the document is an image that includes a private tag, the restrict indicator may include the following information:
- the indexer component may append a restrict indicator for each of the two or more different portions. In some implementations, the indexer component may append a single restrict indicator for the two or more different portions of the document.
- Process 300 may also include storing the metadata and the restrict indicator in a personal search index (block 350 ).
- server device 220 e.g., the indexer component of search system 225
- the document metadata and the restrict indicator may be searched by the set of users in the personal search index.
- the restrict indicator may be used to instruct the personal search index to provide search results, which include the document with the private portion, to only the particular user(s) with access to the private portion of the document.
- the search results may provide the document to all users of the set of users but may block out the portion for the set of users, except for the particular user(s).
- the search results may provide the image to the set of users but may blur (e.g., via image processing) the restricted portion for the set of users, except for the particular user(s).
- process 300 may include storing the metadata in the personal search index (block 350 ).
- server device 220 e.g., the indexer component of search system 225 , may determine that a portion of the document does not include information that is only to be accessible by a particular user of the set of users. Based on this determination, the indexer component may store the document metadata in the personal search index. In this situation, the indexer component would not associate a restrict indicator with the metadata.
- process 300 may include additional blocks, different blocks, fewer blocks, and/or differently arranged blocks than those depicted in FIG. 3 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more of the blocks of process 300 may be performed in parallel.
- FIGS. 4A-4C are diagrams of an example 400 of the process described above with respect to FIG. 3 .
- a first user e.g., USER 1
- user device 210 includes an image of the first user, identified as document 410 in FIG. 4A .
- the first user may provide a private tag 420 in a portion of document 410 , and may want document 410 and/or private tag 420 to be visible and/or searchable (i.e., accessible) by the first user and a second user (not shown in FIG. 4A ).
- the first user may provide, in private tag 420 , information that indicates that private tag 420 is only to be accessible by the first user and the second user (e.g., USER 2).
- the first user may instruct user device 210 to provide document 410 and private tag 420 to a repository of private content.

Abstract
One or more computer devices may receive a document from private content that is accessible by a set of users, and may extract metadata from the document. The metadata may provide information relating to one or more aspects of the document. The one or more computer devices may determine, based on the metadata, whether a portion of the document includes information that is only to be accessible by a particular user from the set of users, and may append a restrict indicator to the metadata when the portion of the document includes information that is only to be accessible by the particular user. The restrict indicator may identify the particular user and the portion of the document. The one or more computer devices may store the metadata and the restrict indicator in a personal search index.
Description
- This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119 based on U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/823,086, filed May 14, 2013, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- Current personal search systems enable a set of users to search private content accessible only to the set of users. For example, the personal search systems may provide search results that include tips, photos, posts, etc. from the set of users and are personal and private to the set of users. However, in such personal search systems, if one user of the set of users has access to a document or a piece of content, all users of the set of users can search the metadata of the document in an index associated with the personal search system.
- Described herein are devices and techniques for appending a restrict indicator to metadata associated with a document that includes a portion that is only to be accessible by particular user(s) of a set of users. The devices and techniques may store the document metadata and the restrict indicator in a personal search index. The devices and techniques may interpret a user's search query and may add restrictions to the search query based on information associated with the user. The personal search index may return a search result that identifies the document that includes the portion that is only to be accessible by the user.
- In some possible implementations, a method, performed by one or more computer devices, may include: receiving a document from private content, the private content being accessible by a set of users; extracting metadata from the document, the metadata providing information relating to one or more aspects of the document; determining, based on the metadata, whether a portion of the document includes information that is only to be accessible by a particular user from the set of users; appending a restrict indicator to the metadata when the portion of the document includes information that is only to be accessible by the particular user, the restrict indicator identifying the particular user and the portion of the document; and storing the metadata and the restrict indicator in a personal search index.
- In some possible implementations, the method may further include storing only metadata in the personal search index for a second document that is accessible to the set of users.
- In some possible implementations, the method may further include: receiving a search query from the particular user; adding a restriction to the search query based on information associated with the particular user, and identifying search results, based on the search query and the restriction, from the personal search index, the search results including information identifying the document.
- In some possible implementations, the method may further include: comparing the restriction and the restrict indicator; and identifying, from the personal search index, the document in the search results based on the comparing.
- In some possible implementations, the method may further include: scoring the search results; and providing the scored search results to the particular user.
- In some possible implementations, the method may further include: receiving a selection of a particular scored search result of the scored search results, the particular scored search result being associated with the document; and providing the document and the portion of the document to the particular user.
- In some possible implementations, the method may further include: receiving a selection of a particular scored search result of the scored search results, the particular scored search result being associated with a second document that includes a restricted portion that is not accessible by the particular user; and providing the second document, without the restricted portion, to the particular user.
- In some possible implementations, a device may include one or more processors to: receive a document from private content that is accessible by a set of users; extract metadata from the document, the metadata providing information relating to one or more aspects of the document; determine, based on the metadata, whether a portion of the document includes information that is only to be accessible by a particular user from the set of users; append a restrict indicator to the metadata when the portion of the document includes information that is only to be accessible by the particular user, the restrict indicator identifying the particular user and the portion of the document; and store the metadata and the restrict indicator in a personal search index.

FIG. 2 is a diagram of an example environment in which systems and/or methods described herein may be implemented; -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of an example process for indexing documents with restricted portions; -
FIGS. 4A-4C are diagrams of an example of the process ofFIG. 3 ; -

FIGS. 6A-6D are diagrams of an example of the process ofFIG. 5 ; and -
FIG. 7 is an example of a generic computer device and a generic mobile computer device according to some implementations. - The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.
- Systems and/or methods, as described herein, may provide an indexing mechanism that appends a restrict indicator to metadata associated with a document that includes a portion that is only to be accessible by particular user(s) (e.g., an owner or creator of the document) of a set of users. The indexing mechanism may store the document metadata and the restrict indicator in a personal search index. The systems and/or methods may provide a query mechanism that interprets a user's search query and adds restrictions to the search query based on information associated with the user (e.g., user identification). For example, the query mechanism may add a restriction that enables the user to search, in the personal search index, for a document that includes a portion that is only to be accessible by the user. The personal search index may return a search result that identifies the document that includes the portion that is only to be accessible by the user. Whereas another user issuing the same search query, and who does not have access to the portion of the document, may not receive the search result that identifies the document.
- The term document, as used herein, is to be broadly interpreted to include any machine-readable and machine-storable work product. A document may include, for example, a website, an e-mail, a business listing, a file, a combination of files, one or more files with embedded links to other files, a news group posting, a blog, etc. In the context of the Internet, a common document is a web page. Documents often include textual information and may include embedded information, such as meta information, images, hyperlinks, etc., and/or embedded instructions, such as Javascript, etc. In some implementations, metadata (e.g., face tags, computer vision labels, and other types of metadata) may relate to, be derived, and/or be associated with a document.
- User interfaces, as described herein, may include graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and/or non-graphical user interfaces, such as text-based interfaces. The user interfaces may provide information to users via customized interfaces (e.g., proprietary interfaces) and/or other types of interfaces (e.g., browser-based interfaces, etc.). The user interfaces may receive user inputs via one or more input devices, may be user-configurable (e.g., a user may change the sizes of the user interfaces, information displayed in the user interfaces, color schemes used by the user interfaces, positions of text, images, icons, windows, etc., in the user interfaces, etc.), and/or may not be user-configurable. Information associated with the user interfaces may be selected and/or manipulated by a user of a user device (e.g., via a touch screen display, a mouse, a keyboard, a keypad, voice commands, etc.).
-
FIGS. 1A and 1B are diagrams illustrating an overview of some implementations described herein. For the overview and as shown inFIG. 1A , assume that a personal search system includes private content (e.g., one or more documents) that may be visible and/or searchable (i.e., accessible) by a set of users. Further assume that the private content includes a particular document (e.g., Document 3) with a portion that is to be visible and/or searchable only by particular user(s) of the set of users. As further shown inFIG. 1A , the personal search system may include an indexer component that receives the documents from the private content. The indexer component may extract metadata associated with each document, and may store the document metadata in a personal search index. If the document is an image, the metadata may include, for example, information that describes how large the image is, a color depth of the image, a resolution of the image, when the image was created, etc. If the document is a text document, the metadata may include, for example, information about a length of the document, an author of the document, when the document was written, a summary of the document, etc. For example, as shown inFIG. 1A , the document metadata may include metadata associated with a first document (e.g., Document 1), a second document (e.g., Document 2), etc. - The indexer component may determine, based on the document metadata, whether a portion of a document includes information that is only to be accessible by a particular user(s) from the set of users. For example, the indexer component may determine that a portion of the particular document (e.g., Document 3) includes information that is only to be accessible by the particular user(s). The indexer component may append a restrict indicator to the metadata of the particular document. The restrict indicator may identify the particular user and the portion of the particular document. In some implementations, the indexer component may determine that a portion of a document is accessible to a certain class of users, and may assign a restrict indicator to the certain class of users (e.g., as opposed to enumerating each member of the certain class). As further shown in
FIG. 1A , the indexer component may store the particular document metadata and the restrict indicator in the personal search index. - With reference to
FIG. 1B , assume that personal search system includes a search engine component that receives a search query from a user. Assume further that the search query relates to the particular document (e.g., Document 3) and/or the restricted portion of the particular document. The search engine component may add a restriction(s) to the search query based on information associated with the user (e.g., user identification). The restriction(s) may include information identifying document portions that are accessible by the user. For example, the restriction(s) may specify that the portion of the particular document (e.g., Document 3) is accessible by the user. - The search engine component may compare the search query and the restriction(s) with the personal search index, and may identify search result(s) based on the search query and the restriction(s). For example, the search engine component may identify the particular document in the search result(s) based on the restriction(s) matching the restrict indicator. The search engine component may provide the search result(s) to a scoring component of the personal search system. The scoring component may score the search result(s), and may provide the scored search result(s) to the user, via the search engine component. At least one of the scored search result(s) may include, for example, information associated with the particular document (e.g., Document 3), the restricted portion of the particular document, etc.

FIG. 2 is a diagram of anexample environment 200 in which systems and/or methods described herein may be implemented.Environment 200 may include a user device 210 connected to multiple server devices 220-240 via anetwork 250. - User device 210 may include a device capable of interacting with
server device 220 to perform a search. Examples of user device 210 may include a personal computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a personal digital assistant, a mobile telephone, such as a smart phone, etc. User device 210 may include user interfaces presented through one or more browsers, e.g., web browsers. - Server devices 220-240 may include server devices that gather, process, search, and/or implement functions in a manner described herein. Each server device 220-240 may be implemented as a single server device or a collection of server devices that may be co-located or remotely located. In some implementations, any two or more of server devices 220-240 may be implemented within a single, common server device or a single, common collection of server devices. While server devices 220-240 are shown as separate components, it may be possible for one or more of server devices 220-240 to perform one or more of the functions of another one or more of server devices 220-240.
- As shown in
FIG. 2 ,server device 220 may implement asearch system 225 that receives search queries from user device 210, and that provides search results that are responsive to the search queries. In some implementations,search system 225 may include a personal search system that enables a set of users to search private content accessible only to the set of users.Server device 220 may crawl a corpus of documents, e.g., web pages, index the documents, and store information associated with the documents.Server devices server device 220. -
Network 250 may include any type of network, such as, for example, a local area network, also referred to as a “LAN,” a wide area network, also referred to as a “WAN,” a telephone network, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or a cellular network, an intranet, the Internet, a combination of networks, etc. User device 210 and server devices 220-240 may connect to network 250 via wired and/or wireless connections. In other words, any one of user device 210 and server devices 220-240 may connect to network 250 via a wired connection, a wireless connection, or a combination of a wired connection and a wireless connection. - Although
FIG. 2 shows example components ofenvironment 200, in some implementations,environment 200 may include additional components, fewer components, different components, and/or differently arranged components than those depicted inFIG. 2 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more components ofenvironment 200 may perform one or more tasks described as being performed by one or more other components ofenvironment 200. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart of anexample process 300 for indexing documents with restricted portions. In some implementations,process 300 may be performed byserver device 220, such as bysearch system 225 ofserver device 220. In some implementations,process 300 may be performed by one or more other devices instead of, or possibly in conjunction with,server device 220. -
Process 300 may include receiving a document from private content that includes a group of documents and is accessible by a set of users (block 310). For example,server device 220 and/orservers 230/240 may include a repository of private content. The private content may include one or more documents that may only be visible and/or searchable (i.e., accessible) by a set of users. In some implementations, the private content may include blog posts, images, videos, text documents, etc. stored by the set of users in the repository. Server device 220 (e.g., search system 225) may receive a document from the private content in a number of ways. For example,search system 225 may request the document from the repository, and the repository may provide the document to searchsystem 225 based on the request. In some implementations,search system 225 may crawl the private content, and may receive the document based on crawling the private content. - In some implementations, one or more documents of the private content may include portion(s) that are only to be accessible to a subset (e.g., one or more particular users) of the set of users. For example, a user of the set of users may provide photos in the private content and may identify who is in each photo by tagging their faces with names. Different users of the set of users may tag a same photo as the user. The set of users may have access to the user's photos, but the user may mark the tags as private and restricted to particular users.
-
Process 300 may further include extracting metadata from the document (block 320). For example,server device 220, e.g., an indexer component ofsearch system 225, may extract metadata from the document. If the document is an image, the metadata may include, for example, information that describes how large the image is, a color depth of the image, a resolution of the image, when the image was created, etc. If the document is a text document, the metadata may include, for example, information about a length of the document, an author of the document, when the document was written, a summary of the document, etc. - In some implementations, the indexer component may extract information from text and/or hypertext markup language (HTML) code of the document, and may associate the extracted information, as keywords, with information identifying the document. In one example, the indexer component may create, from the HTML code of the document, keywords relating to visual features of the document. For example, the indexer component may create, from the HTML code of the document, a keyword corresponding to the color of the background of the document, a keyword corresponding to the color of the text in the document, a keyword corresponding to the size of the text in the document, a keyword indicating whether the document includes an image, a keyword associated with a geographic location, e.g., global satellite coordinates, associated with an image in the document, a keyword indicating a date and/or time when the image was captured, and/or a keyword indicating the quantity of images in document.
-
Process 300 may further include determining, based on the metadata, whether a portion of the document includes information only to be accessible by a particular user(s) of the set of users (block 330). For example,server device 220, e.g., the indexer component ofsearch system 225, may analyze the metadata of the document to determine whether any portion of the document includes information that is only to be accessible by one or more particular users of the set of users. In one example, if the document is an image, the indexer component may analyze the metadata of the image to determine whether there are private tags (e.g., private face tags) associated with the image. In some implementations, if the document includes private location information, associated with a user of the set of users, the indexer component may analyze the document metadata to identify the private location information. In some implementations, if the document is a presentation, the indexer component may analyze the metadata of the presentation to determine whether there are private notes associated with the presentation. The private tags, the private location information, and the private notes may be considered portions of a document that include information that is only to be accessible by the particular user(s). - In some implementations, two or more different portions of a document may be marked as private (i.e., restricted) to the same user, to different users, etc. For example, a first portion of an image may be marked as private to a first user, and a second, different portion of the image may be marked as private to a second user. In some implementations, an entire document may be restricted to a subset of users of the set of users, and one or more portions of the document may be restricted to a subset of the subset of users. For example, if the set of users includes one-hundred (100) people, the entire document may be restricted to ten (10) people from the set of users, and portion(s) of the document may be restricted to three (3) of the ten people.
- As further shown in
FIG. 3 , if the portion of the document includes information only to be accessible by the particular user(s) of the set of users (block 330—YES),process 300 may include appending a restrict indicator to the metadata (block 340). For example,server device 220, e.g., the indexer component ofsearch system 225, may determine that a portion of the document includes information that is only to be accessible by a particular user of the set of users. Based on this determination, the indexer component may append a restrict indicator to the metadata associated with the document. The restrict indicator may identify the particular user, the portion of the document, and/or the information provided in the document portion. For example, if the document is an image that includes a private tag, the restrict indicator may include the following information: -
- private_tag=NameOfPerson_only_visible_to=NameOfImageOwner.
If the document is a text document that includes pages that are restricted to particular user(s), the restrict indicator may identify the particular user(s) and the pages of the text document that are restricted.
- private_tag=NameOfPerson_only_visible_to=NameOfImageOwner.
- In some implementations, if two or more different portions of a document are restricted to particular user(s), the indexer component may append a restrict indicator for each of the two or more different portions. In some implementations, the indexer component may append a single restrict indicator for the two or more different portions of the document.
-
Process 300 may also include storing the metadata and the restrict indicator in a personal search index (block 350). For example,server device 220, e.g., the indexer component ofsearch system 225, may store the metadata and the restrict indicator, associated with the document, in a personal search index. The document metadata and the restrict indicator may be searched by the set of users in the personal search index. The restrict indicator may be used to instruct the personal search index to provide search results, which include the document with the private portion, to only the particular user(s) with access to the private portion of the document. In some implementations, the search results may provide the document to all users of the set of users but may block out the portion for the set of users, except for the particular user(s). For example, if the document is an image that includes a restricted portion, the search results may provide the image to the set of users but may blur (e.g., via image processing) the restricted portion for the set of users, except for the particular user(s). - As further shown in
FIG. 3 , if the portion of the document does not include information only to be accessible by the particular user(s) of the set of users (block 330—NO),process 300 may include storing the metadata in the personal search index (block 350). For example,server device 220, e.g., the indexer component ofsearch system 225, may determine that a portion of the document does not include information that is only to be accessible by a particular user of the set of users. Based on this determination, the indexer component may store the document metadata in the personal search index. In this situation, the indexer component would not associate a restrict indicator with the metadata. - Although
FIG. 3 shows example blocks ofprocess 300, in some implementations,process 300 may include additional blocks, different blocks, fewer blocks, and/or differently arranged blocks than those depicted inFIG. 3 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more of the blocks ofprocess 300 may be performed in parallel. -
FIGS. 4A-4C are diagrams of an example 400 of the process described above with respect toFIG. 3 . In example 400, assume that a first user (e.g., USER 1), of a set of users, is associated with user device 210 (not shown inFIG. 4A ). Further assume that user device 210 includes an image of the first user, identified asdocument 410 inFIG. 4A . The first user may provide aprivate tag 420 in a portion ofdocument 410, and may wantdocument 410 and/orprivate tag 420 to be visible and/or searchable (i.e., accessible) by the first user and a second user (not shown inFIG. 4A ). For example, the first user may provide, inprivate tag 420, information that indicates thatprivate tag 420 is only to be accessible by the first user and the second user (e.g., USER 2). - The first user may instruct user device 210 to provide
document 410 andprivate tag 420 to a repository of private content. In some implementations, the repository of the private content may be provided in server device 230 (e.g., as shown inFIG. 4A ),server device 220, and/orserver device 240. The private content may include one or more documents that may be visible and/or searchable (i.e., accessible) by the set of users.Server device 230, e.g., the repository, may receivedocument 410 andprivate tag 420, and may storedocument 410 andprivate tag 420, as further shown inFIG. 4A . - In example 400 and as shown in
FIG. 4B , further assume thatsearch system 225 includes anindexer component 430 that receives documents from the private content, and extracts metadata from the documents for a personal search index (e.g., not shown inFIG. 4B ). As further shown inFIG. 4B ,indexer component 430 may receivedocument 410 andprivate tag 420 from the private content and may extractmetadata 440 from document 410 (e.g., the image of the first user).Metadata 440 may include, for example, information associated with a size of the image, a color of the image, when the image was created, etc.; location information associated with the image; information associated withprivate tag 420; etc. -
Indexer component 430 may analyzemetadata 440 to determine whether a portion ofdocument 410 includes information only to be accessible by particular user(s) of the set of users. In example 400 and as shown inFIG. 4C ,indexer component 430 may identify the private tag information as a portion ofdocument 410 that includes information 450 only to be accessible by the particular user(s). For example, the private tag information may indicate thatprivate tag 420 is only to be accessible by the first user and the second user. - Based on the identification of information 450,
indexer component 430 may providemetadata 440 ofdocument 410 in apersonal search index 460, as further shown inFIG. 4C .Personal search index 460 may be provided in server device 230 (e.g., as shown inFIG. 4C ),server device 220, and/orserver device 240.Personal search index 460 may include an index that is searchable by the set of users associated with the private content.Personal search index 460 may store information (e.g., metadata) associated with other documents, and may associate the metadata from the other documents with information identifying the other documents.Personal search index 460 may storemetadata 440 associated withdocument 410, and may associate metadata 440 withinformation identifying document 410. Based on the identification of information 450,indexer component 430 may append a restrictindicator 470 tometadata 440 inpersonal search index 460. Restrictindicator 470 may identify the first user and the second user,private tag 420, and/or the information provided inprivate tag 420. For example, restrictindicator 470 may include the following information: -
- private_tag=
USER 1 only_visible_to=USER 1 andUSER 2.
- private_tag=
- If
document 410 did not includeprivate tag 420,indexer component 430 may determine thatdocument 410 does not include information only to be accessible by particular user(s) of the set of users. In such a scenario,indexer component 430 may providemetadata 440 ofdocument 410 topersonal search index 460, andpersonal search index 460 may storemetadata 440 without a restrict indicator. - As indicated above,
FIGS. 4A-4C are provided merely as an example. Other examples are possible and may differ from what was described with regard toFIGS. 4A-4C . -
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of anexample process 500 for searching documents with restricted portions. In some implementations,process 500 may be performed byserver device 220, such as bysearch system 225 ofserver device 220. In some implementations,process 500 may be performed by one or more other devices instead of, or possibly in conjunction with,server device 220. -
Process 500 may include receiving a search query from a user (block 510). For example, a user may provide a search query to user device 210, and user device 210 may provide the search query toserver device 220, e.g.,search system 225 ofserver device 220. In some implementations,search system 225 may include a search engine component that receives the search query from user device 210. In some implementations, the search query may be directed to a search for one or more documents provided in the private content and indexed in personal search index 460 (FIG. 4C ). For example, the search query may be directed to a search for images associated with a particular user of the set of users. -
Process 500 may also include adding one or more restrictions to the search query based on information associated with the user (block 520). For example, the search engine component ofsearch system 225 may add one or more restrictions to the search query based on information associated with the user of user device 210. In some implementations, the search engine component may include a data structure that associates the user information (e.g., user identification) with restrictions that are associated with the user. The information associated with the user may include information identifying the user, a location of user device 210, etc. The restriction(s) may include information identifying document portion(s) that are accessible by the user. In some implementations, a single restriction may be provided for the user and may include a list of documents with portions marked as private to the user. For example, the restriction(s) may specify that a portion of a particular document is accessible by the user. In some implementations, if the particular document is an image and the portion of the particular document is a private tag associated with the user, the restriction(s) may include the following information: -
- private_tag=User visible to=User.
- In some implementations, the user may provide one or more restrictions in the search query, with or without the aid of the search engine component. For example, the user may provide private tags, such as private_tag=User visible to=User, in the search query. Such a search query may return search results associated with documents that include private tags that are restricted to the user.
-
Process 500 may further include identifying search results, based on the search query and the restriction(s), from a personal search index associated with the user (block 530). For example, the user may be associated with the set of users and personal search index 460 (FIG. 4C ). The search engine component ofsearch system 225 may compare the search query and the restriction(s) to information provided inpersonal search index 460, and may identify search results based on the comparison. In some implementations, the search engine component may identify documents by determining which terms of the search query match the document metadata provided inpersonal search index 460. The search engine component may determine whether any of the identified documents are associated with restrict indicators. If particular documents of the identified documents are associated with restrict indicators, the search engine component may determine whether the restrict indicators associated with the particular documents match the restriction(s). The search engine component may include the particular documents with matching restrict indicators in the search results, and may not include the particular documents without matching restrict indicators in the search results. - For example, if the search query is directed to a search for images of the user, the search engine component may search
personal search index 460 for metadata associated with images of the user. The search engine component may also searchpersonal search index 460 for restrict indicators associated with images of the user that are accessible by the user. The search engine component may identify the search results based on the searches ofpersonal search index 460. In some implementations, the search results may include one or more images, e.g., of the user, that do not include private information and/or one or more images, e.g., of the user, that include private information. -
Process 500 may additionally include scoring the search results (block 540). For example, the search engine component ofsearch system 225 may provide the search results to a scoring component ofsearch system 225. The scoring component may score the search results. In some implementations, the scoring component may score the search results based on the search query and/or the restriction(s). -
Process 500 may further include providing one or more scored search results (block 550). For example, the scoring component ofsearch system 225 may provide one or more scored search results to user device 210, and user device 210 may display the one or more scored search results to the user. In some implementations, the scored search result(s) may include a ranked list of scored search results that is sorted according to the scores allotted to the search results. In some implementations, at least one scored search result may be associated with a document that includes a portion only to be accessible by particular user(s) of the set of users. In some implementations, the scored search results may include documents with private portions that are not accessible to the particular user. Such documents may be visible to the particular user, but the private portions may not be visible to the particular user. For example, if Bob is the particular user and wants to search for “photos of Matt,” the scored search results may include image(s) of Matt that do not include private portions, image(s) of Matt with the private portions that are accessible by Bob, and/or image(s) of Matt with the private portions blocked since that are not accessible by Bob. Alternatively, the scored search results may not include image(s) of Matt that have private portions not accessible to Bob. - In some implementations,
search system 225 may pre-filter the search results that are returned to the user based on the restriction(s) added to the search query and/or the restrict indicators provided inpersonal search index 460. For example,search system 225 may not return, to the user, search results associated with documents that include portions not accessible to the user. In some implementations,search system 225 may return search results associated with documents that include portions not accessible to the user, and may provide such documents to the user. However,search system 225 may block (i.e., remove) the portions not accessible to the user from such documents. - In some implementations,
search system 225 may post-filter the search results that are returned to the user based on the restriction(s) added to the search query and/or the restrict indicators provided inpersonal search index 460. For example, the search engine ofsearch system 225 may return all search results associated with the search query, and may remove search results associated with documents that include portions not accessible to the user (e.g., based on the restriction(s)). -
Process 500 may also include receiving a selection of a particular scored search result associated with a document with a restricted portion (block 560). For example, the user may utilize user device 210 to select a particular scored search result from the displayed one or more scored search results. In some implementations, the particular scored search result may be associated with a document that includes a portion only to be accessible by particular user(s) of the set of users. For example, the particular scored search result may include information associated with an image with a private tag that is only to be accessible to the user of user device 210. User device 210 may provide the selection toserver device 220, e.g.,search system 225 ofserver device 220, andsearch system 225 may receive the selection. -
Process 500 may include providing the document with the restricted portion when the user is permitted access to the restricted portion (block 570). For example, based on the selection of the particular scored search result,search system 225 ofserver device 220 may retrieve, from the private content, the document that includes the portion only to be accessible by the user of user device 210.Search system 225 may provide the document to user device 210, and user device 210 may display the document to the user. Since the user has access to the restricted portion of the document, the user may view the restricted portion of the document. - Although
FIG. 5 shows example blocks ofprocess 500, in some implementations,process 500 may include additional blocks, different blocks, fewer blocks, and/or differently arranged blocks than those depicted inFIG. 5 . Additionally, or alternatively, one or more of the blocks ofprocess 500 may be performed in parallel. -
FIGS. 6A-6D are diagrams of an example 600 of the process described above with respect toFIG. 5 . In example 600, assume that a second user (e.g., USER 2) is associated with user device 210, and that user device 210 displays auser interface 610 to the second user, as shown inFIG. 6A .User interface 610 may be provided by the search engine component ofsearch system 225, and may include information that enables the second user to perform a search for documents provided in the private content. As further shown inFIG. 6A , the second user may enter asearch query 620 viauser interface 610. In example 600,search query 620 may be directed to photos or images of a first user (e.g., USER 1). User device 210 may receivesearch query 620, and may providesearch query 620 to asearch engine component 630 ofsearch system 225. -
Search engine component 630 may receivesearch query 620, and may add restrictions 640 to searchquery 620 based on information associated with the second user, as shown inFIG. 6B . For example,search engine component 630 may add restrictions 640 to searchquery 620 based on the identification of the second user. In example 600, assume that restrictions 640 specify that portions of documents, related tosearch query 620, are accessible by the second user, based on the following: -
- find all photos that have private_tag=
USER 1 visible to=USER 2.
Search engine component 630 may comparesearch query 620 to information contained inpersonal search index 460, as further shown inFIG. 6B , to identify documents that matchsearch query 620.Search engine component 630 may determine whether any of the identified documents are associated with the restrict indicators. If particular documents of the identified documents are associated with the restrict indicators,search engine component 630 may determine whether the restrict indicators associated with the particular documents match restrictions 640.Search engine component 630 may include the particular documents with matching restrict indicators insearch results 650, and may not include the particular documents without matching restrict indicators in search results 650.
- find all photos that have private_tag=
- In example 600 and as shown in
FIG. 6B , assume that search results 650 include metadata of a particular image of the first user (e.g., USER 1), such as document 410 (FIG. 4A ), restrict indicator 470 (FIG. 4C ) associated withdocument 410, and metadata for other images of the first user. Further assume that the particular image includes a portion that is only to be accessible to the first user and the second user, and that the particular image may or may not be accessible to other users. For example, the particular image may includeprivate tag 420 provided by the first user indocument 410, as described above in connection withFIG. 4A . -
Search engine component 630 may providesearch results 650 to ascoring component 660 ofsearch system 225, as shown inFIG. 6C . Scoringcomponent 660 may scoresearch results 650 to generate scored search results 670. In example 600, assume that scoringcomponent 660 scores the metadata ofdocument 410 higher than the metadata for other images of the first user. Scoringcomponent 660 may provide scoredsearch results 670 to user device 210, and user device 210 may display scoredsearch results 670 in auser interface 680, as further shown inFIG. 6C . In example 600,user interface 680 may display the metadata ofdocument 410 as a “Restricted photo ofUSER 1.”User interface 680 may also display the metadata for other images of the first user as “Unrestricted photos ofUSER 1” (i.e., as not including restricted portions). - The second user may utilize user device 210 to select one of scored
search results 670 fromuser interface 680. For example, the second user may select the “Restricted photo ofUSER 1” fromuser interface 680, and user device 210 may receive the selection. User device 210 may provide the selection to searchsystem 225, andsearch system 225 may retrieve document 410 from the private content based on the selection.Search system 225 may providedocument 410 to user device 210, and user device 210 may displaydocument 410 in auser interface 690, as shown inFIG. 6D . The second user may view document 410 (e.g., the image of the first user) and information provided inprivate tag 420. - In some implementations, if a third user submits
search query 620 and does not have access toprivate tag 420 indocument 410,search system 225 may not return the metadata ofdocument 410 insearch results 650 to the third user. Alternatively,search system 225 may return the metadata ofdocument 410 insearch results 650 to the third user. However, if the third user selects the metadata ofdocument 410,search system 225 may providedocument 410 to the third user but may not provideprivate tag 420 ofdocument 410 to the third user. - As indicated above,
FIGS. 6A-6D are provided merely as an example. Other examples are possible and may differ from what was described with regard toFIGS. 6A-6D . -
