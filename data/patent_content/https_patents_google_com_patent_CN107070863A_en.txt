For example, resource apparatus 102 can parse from client device 106 receive access request it is one or more to identify
The function of being asked, and further determine that or identify the role needed for the asked function of the access of client device 106.This
Outside, as described above, resource apparatus 102 can determine that local IP access token not yet expires based on the sequence for the attention explanation extracted
(for example, the due date specified in parameter is accessed does not occur also).Resource apparatus 102 can be with (for example, based in access
The role specified in parameter) mark distributes to role or the privilege level of client device 106, and can identify by the owner
Equipment 104 is applied to one or more additional limitations on client device 106 (for example, time restriction, the limit to access type
System, offline use and limitation of subsequent authorization etc.).
In some aspects, resource apparatus 102 can determine that client device 106 accesses the role needed for asked function
It is whether consistent with the role that (for example, by owner's equipment 104) distributes to client device 106, and further determine that and ask
The function of asking is consistent with one or more additional limitations that owner's equipment 104 applies.When the access asked is with being distributed
When role is consistent with the limitation applied, resource apparatus 102 can generate uniformity determined by instruction and confirm to permit asking
The data (for example, access confirmation data 405) for the access asked and client device 106 is sent it to by network 126, and
And resource apparatus 102 can permit the access (for example, permitting accessing 406) for client device 106 of request.Or, when
When resource apparatus 102 thinks asked access with the role distributed and/or the inconsistent limitation applied, resource apparatus
102 can with generation error message (not shown in Fig. 4) and by network 126 send it to client device 106 (for example,
It can point out client device 106 to change asked access).Then client device 106 and resource apparatus 102 can be handed over
Change the additional data for promoting client device 106 to the access of resource apparatus 102.
Fig. 5 is according to disclosed embodiment, for permitting the exemplary mistake to the client device access of resource apparatus
The flow chart of journey.In some respects, the step of resource apparatus (resource apparatus 102) can perform example process 500, it causes
The safety and direct nothing of the client device (for example, client device 106) accessed can be established and asked to resource apparatus 102
Line is connected, and is made based on the local IP access for being presented to resource apparatus 102 by direct wireless connection by client device 106
Board (for example, local IP access token) permits the access for client device 106.
In some respects, with reference to the verification operation performed by client device 106, resource apparatus 102 can be performed and used
Any of the above described example technique, safety is established and direct by network 126 between resource apparatus 102 and client device 106
The operation of wireless connection (for example, in step 502).For example, as described above, when the client particular value of symmetric cryptographic key
The equipment that (for example, being calculated by client device 106) corresponds to symmetric cryptographic key is specifically worth (for example, such as being set by resource
Standby 102 calculating) when, client device 106 and resource apparatus 102 can collectively establish the safety and orientation by network 126
Wireless connection (for example, in step 502).In addition, client device 106 and resource apparatus 102 can also collectively establish as
The client of the symmetric cryptographic key of session key (for example, Fig. 4 session key 403) is specifically and in the specific value of equipment
Corresponding value, client device 106 and resource apparatus 102 can make to use it to wireless connection of the encryption by safe, orientation
The subsequent communications of (for example, as established in step 502).
In some respects, resource apparatus 102 can pass through established wireless connection and be accessed from the reception of client device 106
The request (for example, Fig. 4 local IP access request data 404) of the one or more functions of resource apparatus 102 is (for example, in step
In 504).In some respects, received request can include identifying asked local IP access (for example, the scope accessed, class
Type, and/or duration) data, and can further include the copy of stored local IP access token.
Resource apparatus 102 can parse received request, to obtain local IP access token and identify asked access
Data at least a portion, and in certain aspects, it may be determined that local IP access token and its mandate chain of instruction have
Effect property (for example, in step 506).For example, as described above, computing system 108 can be based on being generated and being tieed up by resource apparatus 102
The extension of the main access token of shield generates local access token.In some aspects, resource apparatus 102 can make from local IP access
The sequence for noting explanation is extracted in the part received of board (for example, it can specify the local visit for defining client device 106
Ask the access parameter of privilege), and by MAC algorithms be applied to extracted attention explanation sequence and main access token (for example,
As generated and stored as resource apparatus 102), with the specific copy of equipment for the institute's receiving portion for calculating local IP access token.
In addition, resource apparatus 102 can the comparison based on the copy for receiving and calculating of local reception token (for example, with Macaron
Certificate form, the comparison of the label of the copy received and calculating of local IP access token), to determine local IP access token
Validity (and it is thus determined that the part received be from authorize access resource apparatus 102 effective token derived from).
Some aspects, resource apparatus 102 can be configured as based on the data being locally stored and not by network 122 and computing system
108 communicatedly determine the validity of local IP access token that receives.
If resource apparatus 102 will determine the meter that the copy received of local IP access token can not be with local IP access token
The copy calculated is matched (for example, step 506；It is no), then resource apparatus 102 can be generated and sent to client device 106 and be referred to
Show the wrong data of invalid local IP access token (for example, in step 508).Then, example process is completed in step 510
500。
If however, resources measurement between the copy received and calculating of local IP access token matching (for example,
Step 506；Be), then resource apparatus 102 may establish that the receiving portion of local IP access token be derived from effective token, and
And therefore establish the validity of local IP access token (for example, in step 512).In certain aspects, and in response to really
Fixed validity, resource apparatus 102 can determine whether the access that client device 106 is asked is permitted with owner's equipment 104
Access it is consistent, for example, specified in the access parameter of sequence as described in the attention extracted (for example, in step 514
In).
For example, in the step 514, resource apparatus 102 can parse the access request from the reception of client device 106 to mark
Know one or more asked functions, and further determine that or identify client device 106 and access asked function institute
The role needed.In addition, resource apparatus 102 can determine that local IP access token is not yet expired based on the part for the sequence for noting explanation
(for example, the due date specified in parameter is accessed not yet occurs).In the step 514, resource apparatus 102 can also be identified point
The role of dispensing client device 106 or level of privilege (for example, based on the role specified in access parameter), and can recognize
By owner's equipment 104 be applied on client device 106 one or more additional limitations (for example, time restriction, access class
The limitation of type, to offline using and to the limitation subsequently entrusted etc.).
In some aspects, resource apparatus 102 can determine that client device 106 accesses asked work(in step 516
Role needed for energy whether with distributing to role's (for example, owner's equipment 104) of client device 106 unanimously, and in addition,
The additional constraint and the limitation whether function of being asked applies with owner's equipment 104 (for example, accessing in parameter) are consistent.When
Role needed for resource apparatus 102 is determined and the role distributed are inconsistent (for example, the function of being asked needs " manager " role
When, owner's equipment distributes to the relatively low role of client device 106 " user ") and/or the function asked and applied
Constrain and limit inconsistent (for example, step 516；It is no), resource apparatus 102 may return to step 518, and can generate simultaneously
Error message is sent to client device 106 by network 126.Then example process 500 is completed in step 510.
Or, if resource apparatus 102 determine needed for role it is consistent with the role distributed, and the function of being asked and
The constraint applied is consistent (for example, step 516 with limitation；It is), then resource apparatus 102 can generate consistent determined by instruction
Property and confirm to permit the data (for example, Fig. 4 access confirmation data 405) of asked access, and send it to visitor
Family end equipment 106 (for example, in step 518).Resource apparatus 102 can permit asked access to client device 106,
And the additional data for promoting client device 106 to access asked function can be exchanged (for example, in step 520).So
Afterwards, example process 500 is completed in step 510.
However, using one or more disclosed exemplary embodiments, possess or control the entity of resource apparatus 102
Equipment (for example, owner's equipment 104) can be with the shared access (example to resource apparatus 102 of one or more client devices
Such as, by client device 106).As described above, owner's equipment 104 can be established and computing system 108 by network 122
Communication, and can provide mark with access privileges one or more entities data (for example, client device 106
Device identifier), and specify the restrictive condition of limitation and/or constraint definition these access rights.However, disclosed reality
The direct wireless connection that example both need not be between owner's equipment 104 and client device 106 is applied, in order to be set to client
Standby 106 provide access rights, it is not required that client device 106 verifies or proved its identity to owner's equipment 104.In addition,
In above-mentioned some embodiments, owner's equipment 104 can be independently of being probably offline and/or power-off resource apparatus 102
With client device 106, to the certification itself of computing system 108, and the access spy for indicating to share is provided to computing system 108
The data of power.
In addition, as described above, client device 106 can by network 122 to the certification itself of computing system 108, and
The local device and access token of being easy to client device 106 to access resource apparatus 102 are obtained (for example, being set according to by the owner
Standby 104 limitations and/or constraint applied, and be incorporated into the accesses control list (ACL) safeguarded by computing system 108).To the greatest extent
Pipe client device 106 can establish the communication with computing system 108 to ask and obtain these tokens by network 122, but
