- FIG. 1 is an exemplary diagram of a system for displaying non-geographic information associated with a viewed point of interest, including a user interface and a geographic information processor for automatically determining the point of interest, according to one aspect of the subject technology.
- System 100 includes a geographic information processor 101 for processing geographic-related information received from a client display tenninal 102, and for generating geographic and local information for display at client display terminal 102.
- client display terminal 102 and information processor 101 may be integrated in a computer-enabled device (for example, a personal computer, tablet computer, server, PDA, smart phone, or the like).
- information processor 101 may include software instructions executable by the computer-enabled device that, when executed, configures the computer- enabled device to perform the operations and functionality described herein.
- information processor 101 and display terminal 102 may exist as separate devices that communicate over a wired or wireless connection.
- Client display terminal 102 may include a client device configured to display, on a display screen, a viewport (for example, a region within a web browser configured to display information using HTML, Java, .NET, Javascript, or the like).
- Information processor 101 may include a server and/or microprocessor configured to receive display information from client display terminal 102 over the wired or wireless comiection, and to execute code or instructions to perform the operations and functionality described herein (see, for example, FIG. 6).
- Client display terminal 102 may be configured to display an interactive map and an information panel for displaying a set of elements related to a displayed portion of the interactive map.
- client display terminal 102 may include instructions for determining when the interactive map is repositioned (for example, moved as a result of a dragging, panning, or zooming action), and, on being repositioned more than a predetermined amount, send one or more update requests to information processor 101.
- the one or more update requests may include viewport information, including a center coordinate and/or one or more other coordinates, area bounds, zoom level, and/or the like.
- Information processor 101 and client display terminal 102 may communicate with each other via a network using HTTP request/response, XMLHttpRequest (XHR), or the like.

- the one or more coordinates may include a center coordinate of the displayed map.
- the one or more coordinates may include a coordinate generated, for example, by product of a prior coordinate and a vector of the direction and distance of a panning action generated by the interaction between the interactive map and a pointing device or keystroke at client display terminal 102.
- the viewport information may also include one or more other coordinates within an area surrounding the center coordinate (for example, within an area defined by a polygon about a geographic coordinate).
- the displayed point of interest may be reverse geocoded from the viewport information by location service 103, which may be configured to determine the point of interest by querying a database and/or location service using the one or more coordinates.
- Geographic points of interest for example, one or more cities, counties, and/or states
- location service 103 may query a web service (for example, on a remote server) to retrieve the geographic point of interest. Once the geographic point of interest has been retrieved and/or determined, location service 103 may return it to information processor 101.
- a web service for example, on a remote server
- a processor displaying a user interface at client display terminal 102 may determine one or more points of interest from information included within the viewed interactive map and/or provided with the previously described viewport information.
- tf!e point of interest may be determined by a location entered by a user at a search input on client display terminal 102. Once the point of interest is received by information processor 101 , it may be passed directly to local information service 104.
- Local information service 104 may be configured to provide non-geographic information based on the previously described point of interest.
- non-geographic information may include local trends, information on businesses at or proximal to the point of interest, photos, tourism information, advertisements associated with the point of interest, and/or the like.
- the non-geographic information provided may not be tied to a specific point on a map. Rather, the information may be related to the point of interest to the extent it imparts information pertaining to the point of interest.
- the non-geographic information may be stored in a database associated with local information service 104, indexed by geographic points of interest.
- local information service may receive one or more geographic points of interest (for example, from information processor 101 or location service 103) and then perform a lookup of one or more elements of non-geographic information to be returned to client display terminal 102, for example, to be displayed in adjacent window 205.
- local information server 104 may act as an intermediary between information processor 101 and the database or other information source.
- local information service 104 may query a web service (for example, on a remote server) to retrieve the information.
- location service 103 and/or local information service 104 may include a processor configured to execute code or instructions to perform the operations and functionality described herein (see, for example, FIG. 6).
- location service 103 and/or local information service 104 may include software (for example, a web service) executable by a computer-enabled device (for example, a server, personal computer, tablet computer, PDA, smart phone, GPS device, or the like) that, when executed, configures the computer-enabled device to receive requests from information processor 101 and to perform the operations and functionality described herein.
- a computer-enabled device for example, a server, personal computer, tablet computer, PDA, smart phone, GPS device, or the like
