Abstract
A system and method is disclosed for automatically configure a webpage to display a geographically focused internet offering. An interactive map is configured to, when displayed in a web browser, automatically detect one or more online marketing components associated with a currently displayed webpage. On an initial display or user-repositioning of the interactive map, the map transmits a geographic location displayed on the map to the marketing components. Each marketing component then displays one or more offerings related to the displayed area of interest.
Description
- The subject technology relates generally to the display of websites, namely systems for displaying advertisements in website components.
- A website may be integrated with an interactive internet map that provides a user with the ability to view geographic information. The interactive map may be rendered within a computer-enabled interactive viewport that comprises a region of the display, and that functions to display a portion of the map at any one time. The website may also be configured with one or more marketing components that dynamically display advertisements based on predetermined user interests. For example, information may be gathered about a user's interests (for example, with the user's permission) and stored in connection with the storage of one or more HTTP Cookies on a web browser. Those interests may then be retrieved and used by the online marketing component to generate the one or more offerings.
- The subject technology provides a system and method for automatically configure a webpage to display a geographically focused internet offering. According to one aspect, a computer-implemented method may include providing, using one or more computing devices, an interactive map for display in connection with a currently displayed website, automatically detecting one or more online marketing components associated with the currently displayed website, the one or more marketing components being separated from the interactive map and configured to display one or more offerings based on a geographic information, on an initial display or user-repositioning of the interactive map, providing, to at least one of the one or more marketing components, using the one or more computing devices, geographic information for an area of interest displayed on the interactive map, and displaying, by the at least one marketing component, one or more offerings related the area of interest displayed on the interactive map.
- In another aspect, a machine-readable medium may include instructions stored thereon that, when executed, cause a machine to perform a method of displaying a geographically focused internet offering. In this regard, the method may include providing a marketing component to a webpage, the marketing component configured to display, in a web browser, one or more offerings related to the webpage and, when available, geographic information, automatically detecting an interactive map displayed in connection with the webpage, receiving from the interactive map, on an initial display or user-repositioning of the interactive map, geographic information related to an area of interest displayed on the interactive map, and displaying, on the currently displayed webpage, one or more offerings related to the area of interest.
- In a further aspect, a system according to the subject technology may include one or more first processors and a first memory. The first memory may include first server instructions thereon that, when executed, by the one or more first processors, cause map instructions to be provided to a web browser located on a client device. In this regard, the map instructions, when executed by the client device, may cause the client device to display an interactive map on a currently displayed webpage, automatically detect the presence of one or more online marketing components displayed by the currently displayed webpage, and, on an initial display or user-repositioning of the interactive map, provide, to the one or more online marketing components, an area of interest displayed on the interactive map. The system may also include one or more second processors and a second memory. The second memory may include second server instructions thereon that, when executed, by the one or more first processors, provide the one or more online marketing components for display at the client device in connection with a request by the currently displayed webpage to display the one or more online marketing components. The one or more online marketing components, when displayed by the client device, may be configured to cause the client device to receive the area of interest displayed on the interactive map, determine one or more offerings based on the geographic information based on one or more focusing signals and the area of interest displayed on the interactive map, and provide the one or more offerings for display in connection with the currently displayed webpage.
- It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized, the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects, all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.
- A detailed description will be made with reference to the accompanying drawings:
-

FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a computing device for automatically configuring a webpage to display a geographically focused internet offering, including a processor and other internal components, according to one aspect of the subject technology. -
FIG. 1 depicts anexemplary webpage 101, displayed by aweb browser 102, including aninteractive Internet map 103 and one ormore marketing components 104 according to one aspect of the subject technology. Amarketing component 104 may comprise programming instructions (for example, JavaScript or other scripting code) inserted into the code that generateswebpage 101. Each time the page is visited, the programming instructions may send information to a remote server call and retrieve marketing content via a series of procedural calls fromwebpage 101. The marketing content may include one or more offerings (for example, online advertisements, offers, coupons, or the like) for display in connection with the currently displayed webpage. Information passed to the remote server to generate the marketing content may include certain keywords, for example, programmed by the creator ofwebpage 101 to describe the content ofwebpage 101, services provided by it, or an interaction with a user. In one aspect, the subject technology enablesmarketing component 104 to determine one or more offerings for display bymarketing component 104 based on geographic information received frominteractive map 103. In this regard, offerings presented to a user may be related (for example, narrowed) by the geographic area of interest to the user. -
Interactive map 103 may be provided in aviewport 105 displayed onwebpage 101, separated frommarketing components 104. The term “viewport” as used herein encompasses its plain and ordinary meaning, including, but not limited to, a rectangular geographic region of an interactive map that is visible at any one time, a section of programming instructions integrated with a webpage (for example, webpage 101) that, when executed by a web browser, displays a fraction of an interactive map, and/or the like. The operations ofviewport 105 or an associated interactive map are unrelated to whether or not a marketing component is operating on the same website, or vice versa.Interactive map 103 may initially display a geographic area associated with information displayed on the webpage, or a stored user interest, and may then be manually repositioned by the user as a result of, for example, a dragging, panning, or zooming action. In other aspects, the interactive map may be automatically repositioned. For example,interactive map 103 may be displayed on a GPS-enabled device (for example, a smart phone or navigation unit) that updates the map in real-time as the device is moved in three-dimensional space.Viewport 105 may be capable of dynamically re-renderinginteractive map 103 as a user selectively pans the map within the viewport, and sending information tomarketing component 104 based on portion(s) of the interactive map displayed inviewport 105 when the viewport is updated. As depicted byFIG. 1 ,marketing components 104 may be responsible for generating and updating offerings displayedoutside viewport 105 when the viewport is updated. -
FIG. 2 is an diagram of exemplary components for automatically configuring a webpage to display a geographically focused internet offering according to one aspect of the subject technology. Auser 200 may navigate to a webpage that includes a map viewport 201 (for example, viewport 105) and a marketing component 202 (for example, marketing component 104).Map viewport 201 may display a portion of an interactive internet map (for example, interactive map 103) that may be manipulated byuser 200.Map viewport 201 may further be in operable communication with amap server 203, which may receive one or more coordinates frommap viewport 201, process a user-manipulation of the map, and provide an updated portion of the map to mapviewport 201. -
Marketing component 202 may provide information about itself to other components of the webpage, including, for example, types of offerings displayed, the marketing component's virtual location on the webpage (for example, top, bottom, side), and the like. In one example, marketing component may provide the information through the exposing of one or more (public) functions or global parameters. In one aspect,map viewport 201 may be configured to automatically detect the presence ofmarketing component 202 by detecting and/or analyzing global parameters exposed byonline marketing component 202. Likewise,marketing component 202 may be configured to automatically detect the presence ofmap viewport 201 by detecting and/or analyzing global parameters exposed bymap viewport 201. -
Map viewport 201 andmarketing component 202 may then be automatically placed in operable communication with each other, for example, via a series of function calls betweenmap viewport 201 andmarketing component 202. In one aspect, where multiple marketing components are displayed on a webpage,map viewport 201 may be placed in communication with a marketing component that is selected based on position information provided by the marketing components. For example, instructions provided in connection withmap viewport 201 may determine which of the multiple marketing components is nearest to map viewport 202 (and, for example, the interactive map) and communicate with that component. Oncemap viewport 201 andmarketing component 202 are placed in communication with each other,marketing component 202 may receive map information from the interactive map, for example, via the previously described global parameters or function calls, or by subscribing to viewport updates from the map component. - On an initial display or user-repositioning of the interactive map, map instructions may transmit geographic information to one or more online marketing components located on the currently displayed webpage. In one aspect, the geographic information may be based on an area of interest displayed on the interactive map. The area of interest may, for example, be represented as one or more coordinates, such as latitude and longitude coordinates and/or altitude information, GPS position information, cartography data, or the like. In this regard,
marketing component 202 may be in operable communication with amarketing server 206 responsible for the generation of content for display bymarketing component 202.Marketing component 202 may receive the geographic information frommap viewport 201 and pass (for example, send, transmit, make available, or the like) the geographic information as one or more parameters to marketingserver 206 along with other parameters. -
Marketing server 206 may display one or more offerings based on the previously described geographic information, as well as other focusing signals. For example, focusing signals may include the content or category (for example, type of services provided) of a currently viewed web page, predetermined search terms associated with a displayed region of the map, a geographic location derived from an IP address, or the like. The focusing signals may be used to determine a candidate set of offerings (for example, selected based on the focusing signals), and then the candidate set may be narrowed by the received geographic information. In one example, one or more offerings may be determined based on a predetermined user interest. Predetermined user interests may be derived from, for example, previous websites visited, internet searches made through a search engine and the like, and then stored, upon the discretion of the user, in one or more cookies, in a centralized storage (for example, a data cloud), or the like. In this regard,marketing server 206 may be integrated with a user account 207 ofuser 200. If the user has opted-in to the storage of marketing preferences, information pertaining to one or more interests of the user may be privately stored in connection with user account 207. Onuser 200 authenticating to user account 207, the information may be used as one or more parameters bymarketing server 206 in determining one or more offerings to return tomarketing component 202 for display touser 200.Marketing server 206 may then index the centralized storage by the received parameters to retrieve one or more offerings related to the parameters. Oncemarketing component 202 receives the selection of offerings frommarketing server 206,marketing component 203 may display, on the currently displayed webpage, the one or more offerings touser 200. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a process for automatically configuring a webpage to display a geographically focused internet offering according to one aspect of the subject technology. Inblock 301, aninteractive map 103 is provided for display in connection with a currently displayed website. The interactive map may be provided by one or more server computing devices, includingmap server 203 ormarketing server 206.User 200 may navigate aweb browser 102 of a client computing device to a website hosted by the one or more server computing devices. In this respect, the interactive map may be displayed in amap viewport 201 on awebpage 101, together with one ormore marketing components 202. The one ormore marketing components 202 may be separated from, or embedded within,map viewport 201. In some aspects, the marketing components may be provided to the webpage by a different computing device than the computing device which provides the interactive map. The one or more marketing components are configured to display one or more offerings based on geographic information. - In
block 302, the one or more online marketing components associated with the currently displayed website are automatically detected (for example, by the instructions associated with the interactive map). In some aspects, one or moreonline marketing components 202 may be detected bymap viewport 201. Instructions provided withmap viewport 201 may detect a component by automatically detecting the presence of one or more global parameters exposed by the component. In other aspects, the one or more marketing components may be detected by instructions executing in connection with the currently displayed webpage (for example, on map server 203), or instructions embedded withinweb browser 102. - In
block 303, an indication that the interactive map was initially displayed or repositioned may be received. The indication may be received, for example, at the website or the one or more server computing devices. In some implementations, the map is repositioned on a pan or zoom operation performed byuser 200. In other implementations, where the client computing device is a mobile device the map may be updated in real-time as the device is moved in three-dimensional space. - In
block 304, on the initial display or user-repositioning of the interactive map, geographic information for an area of interest displayed on the interactive map is provided to at least one of the one or more marketing components. Whether amarketing component 202 receives the geographic information is based on selection criteria such as the position of the marketing component relative toviewport 201, configuration information or meta data embedded into the marketing component or currently displayed webpage, or the like. For example, position information may be obtained byviewport 201 for all marketing components on the currently displayed webpage, and the geographic information sent to the marketing component closest to the viewport, or located at a predetermined position on the webpage. - In
block 305, at least one marketing component displays one or more offerings related the area of interest displayed on the interactive map. Accordingly, in some implementations, a selectedmarketing component 202 receives and transmits the geographic information tomarketing server 206.Marketing server 206 may authenticate to, or confirm the presence of, user account 207.Marketing server 206 may then determines the one or more offerings based on the geographic information and, in some implementations, marketing preferences stored in connection with user account 207. The offerings are then returned to the selected marketing component for display touser 200. -

Likewise, in one aspect,marketing server 401 andmap server 405 may be connected to and/or communicate with each other via the remote private LAN/WAN orInternet 403. In some aspects, the various connections betweenmarketing server 401,client device 404,map server 405, and/or the Internet or private LAN/WAN may be made over a wired or wireless connection. In some aspects, the functionality ofmarketing server 401 andmap server 405 may be implemented on the same physical server or distributed among a plurality of servers. Similarly, the functionality ofmarketing database 402 andmap database 406 may be implemented in the same database or distributed across a plurality of databases. Moreover, the databases may take any form such as relational databases, object-oriented databases, file structures, text-based records, or other forms of data repositories. -
Marketing server 401 and/ormap server 405 may be configured to communicate with a user interface 407 (for example, a webpage displayed in a web browser) onclient device 404. In this aspect,user interface 407 may be configured to (for example, in connection with viewing a webpage) display to auser 409 an interactive geographic representation 408 (for example,interactive map 103 or the like) received frommap server 405. Likewise,user interface 407 may also be configured to display (for example, on panel 205) one or more marketing components 510 (for example,marketing components 104 or 202) for the display of one or more online offerings along a side of interactivegeographic representation 408, or to superimpose the offerings on the interactive map (for example, in the form of icons and/or text). - In one aspect, a
first communication channel 411 is made betweenmarketing server 401 anduser interface 407 to convey content information (for example, the one or more offerings) tomarketing components 410.First communication channel 411 may be uni-directional, or bi-directional in that it may, for example, also receive parameters from user interface 407 (for example, to facilitate the selection of offerings to display). Asecond communication channel 412 may be made betweenmap server 405 anduser interface 407 to conveygeographic representation 408 or portion thereof to user interface 407 (for example, to be displayed by a map viewport 201).Second communication channel 412 may be uni-directional, or bi-directional in that it may, for example, also receive selections made byuser 409 in relation touser interface 407 and/or interactive geographic representation 408 (for example, on a user-repositioning of an interactive map). The user selections and/or parameters provided bymarketing component 410 may be sent byuser interface 407 using HTTP request/response, XMLHttpRequest (XHR), or the like. - In one aspect,
user interface 407 may be a webpage or website viewed in a web browser, and displaying interactivegeographic representation 408 may include redirecting a region of the browser (for example, viewport 105) to another location responsible for displaying interactivegeographic representation 408. Redirection may be by domain redirection, a GET or POST command, and/or the like. In some aspects, geographic location data (for example, coordinates) may be sent to and frommap server 405 in connection with displaying and/or interacting with interactivegeographic representation 408 atuser interface 407, for example, as the result ofuser 409 panning an interactive map. -
