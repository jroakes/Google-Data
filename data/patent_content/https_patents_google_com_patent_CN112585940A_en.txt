Description
RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 62/742,810 filed on 8/10/2018. U.S. provisional patent application No. 62/742,810 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for capturing images. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for providing feedback to a user of an image capture device based on an output of an artificial intelligence system that analyzes an incoming image frame, for example, to measure attributes of the incoming frame and/or to determine whether to automatically capture the incoming frame.
Background
More and more individuals are using computing devices to capture, store, share, and interact with visual content such as photographs and videos. In particular, for some individuals, handheld computing devices (such as smartphones or tablets) are the primary devices used to capture visual content (such as photographs and videos).
Some example types of photographs that users often capture are self-photographs and group photographs. In self-photography, a user typically holds her image capture device (e.g., a smartphone with a camera) so that the front camera captures imagery of the user facing the device. The user may also typically view the current field of view of the camera on the front-facing display screen to determine the attributes and quality of the images available for capture. The user may press the shutter button to capture an image. However, such a scenario requires the user to operate the camera shutter while also attempting to pose for taking a picture. Performing both tasks simultaneously can be challenging and can reduce the enjoyment or success of the selfing. Performing these tasks while also evaluating the properties of the image to be captured when operating the shutter can be particularly challenging for the user. This can result in captured images with suboptimal lighting effects and/or other undesirable image properties.
In group photography, a group of people typically pose together for an image. Historically, group photography required one of the participants to operate the camera from a position behind the camera, which resulted in the photographer being excluded from the photograph, which was an unsatisfactory result for both the photographer and the photographer wishing to join their group. One attempted solution to this problem is to use a delay timer based acquisition technique. However, in delay timer based capture techniques, the user is typically required to place the camera at a certain location and then to quickly join a group pose before the timer expires, which is a challenging action for many people or in many scenarios. Furthermore, due at least in part to the fact that the viewfinder of the camera is not used in an efficient manner at the time of image capture (requiring the user to leave the camera to take a shot), the timer-captured pictures may have suboptimal lighting effects and/or other undesirable image properties. Furthermore, photos captured by a timer often do not allow all people in the group to look at the camera, since someone may go out of focus while the timer is running or may not know that the timer is set to expire. Collective autophotography is a mixture of the two types of photographs described above and often suffers from the same or similar problems.

Detailed Description
SUMMARY
In general, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for providing feedback to a user of an image capture device, the system including an artificial intelligence system that analyzes incoming image frames, for example, to determine whether to automatically capture and store the incoming frames. In particular, one example device or computing system (e.g., a smartphone) may include an image capture system configured to capture a plurality of image frames and an artificial intelligence system configured to analyze each of the plurality of image frames and output, for each of the plurality of image frames, a respective measure (measure) of one or more attributes, such as lighting, of a respective scene depicted by the image frame. For example, the artificial intelligence system may output a score or other measure of how desirable a particular image frame is to meet a particular photographic goal (such as, for example, a selfie, a group photograph, and/or a group selfie). In some embodiments, the artificial intelligence system may be further configured to automatically select certain images for storage based on their respective measurements generated by the artificial intelligence system. The example system may provide a live video stream depicting at least a portion of a current field of view of the image capture system in a viewfinder portion of a user interface presented on the display. In particular, a live video stream may comprise a plurality of image frames. According to an aspect of the disclosure, the example system may also provide a graphical intelligent feedback indicator associated with the live video stream in a viewfinder portion of a user interface presented on the display. The graphical intelligent feedback indicator may graphically indicate, for each of a plurality of image frames (when such image frame is presented within a viewfinder portion of the user interface), a respective measurement, output by the artificial intelligence system, of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by the image frame. Thus, in some implementations, as image frames are shown on the display in real-time, the graphical smart feedback indicators may indicate or represent a score or other measure of the degree to which the currently shown image frame is desirable to meet a particular photographic goal (such as, for example, selfie, group photo, and/or group selfie). In particular, in some implementations, the feedback indicator may be considered a gauge that indicates the proximity of the artificial intelligence system to the automatic capture and non-temporary storage of imagery (e.g., how close the image frames are to meeting the criteria for automatic capture and storage). In this manner, the user may be presented with real-time feedback informing the user what, when, and why the automatic capture decision was made by the artificial intelligence system, which may engage the user in a collaborative image capture process.
Accordingly, by using an artificial intelligence system to select the best shot (shot) and perform the shutter work, aspects of the present disclosure help users capture and store images that best satisfy their photographic goals (e.g., self-photographs, group photographs, landscape photographs, traditional portraits, action scenes, or other photographic goals). Further, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may provide real-time feedback indicating measurements of one or more attributes of the currently displayed view generated by the artificial intelligence system. As examples, the measured attributes may include lighting in the image frame, colors of the image frame, presence and/or number of frontal faces, posed faces, faces with smiling facial expressions, faces with abnormal facial expressions, faces with eyes open, and/or faces with a front gaze. In particular, aspects of the present disclosure enable continuous and guided human-machine interaction by which feedback of attributes of image frames is provided to a user via a feedback indicator in real-time. This knowledge of the properties of the image frames, which may for example comprise illumination and/or color properties of the image frames, enables the user to synthesize an image with the desired properties. As part of this, the user can fall back and focus on posing or otherwise composing images, leaving the intelligent system to handle shutter control in an intelligent and hands-free manner. This also makes it easier for the tandic (candid) collective shots to get in by letting everyone get to the shot and capture automatically and/or via remote triggers when everyone looks best.
Thus, the device may provide a feedback indicator that tells the user whether and/or to what extent the artificial intelligence system finds the attributes of the current view appropriate, desirable, or otherwise well-suited for a particular photographic subject (such as a selfie or group photo). In this manner, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may enable collaboration between a user and an artificial intelligence system by guiding user-machine interaction to capture images that satisfy a photographic target. For example, a user may be guided to change attributes of image frames rendered on a device by moving to areas of a room with different lighting conditions based on real-time feedback.
More particularly, an example device or computing system (e.g., a smartphone) may include an image capture system configured to capture a plurality of image frames. As one example, the image capture system may include a front-facing camera facing in the same direction as the display. Although a smartphone with a front-facing camera is used herein as a common example, aspects of the present disclosure are equally applicable to many other devices, systems, and camera configurations, including, for example, a rear-facing camera.
The device or computing system may present a user interface on the display. The user interface may include a viewfinder portion. The device or system may present a live video stream in a viewfinder portion of the user interface that depicts at least a portion of the current field of view of the image capture system. More particularly, as incoming image frames are received from the image capture system, the device may display them to provide the user with an understanding of the current field of view of the image capture system. Thus, as the user moves the device or otherwise changes the scene (e.g., by moving to portions of the room with different lighting conditions or making different facial expressions), the user may be given a real-time view of the field of view of the image capture system.
The device or computing system may also include an artificial intelligence system configured to analyze each of the plurality of image frames and output, for each of the plurality of image frames, a respective measurement of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by the image frame. For example, the artificial intelligence system may output a score or other measure of how desirable a particular image frame is to meet a particular photographic goal (such as, for example, a selfie, a group photograph, and/or a group selfie).
In some implementations, the artificial intelligence system can include one or more machine learning models, such as, for example, a machine-learned face detection model, a machine-learned gesture detection model, and/or a machine-learned facial expression model. An artificial intelligence system may utilize a machine-learned model to determine a measure of attribute(s) of an image. For example, in some embodiments, the presence of one or more of the following in the respective scene results in an increase in the respective measure of one or more attributes of the respective scene output by the artificial intelligence system: a front face; a posed face; a face with smiling facial expressions; and/or a face with an abnormal facial expression.
Further, according to an aspect of the disclosure, the device or system may also provide a graphical intelligent feedback indicator associated with the live video stream in a viewfinder portion of a user interface presented on the display. The graphical intelligent feedback indicator may graphically indicate, for each of a plurality of image frames (when such image frame is presented within a viewfinder portion of the user interface), a respective measurement, output by the artificial intelligence system, of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by the image frame. Thus, in some implementations, as image frames are shown on the display in real-time, the graphical smart feedback indicators may indicate or represent a score or other measure of the degree to which the currently shown image frame is desirable to meet a particular photographic objective (such as, for example, selfie, group photo, or group selfie). This feedback may continuously guide the user's interaction with the system, allowing the shot to meet the shooting goals. The final lens may have, for example, particular lighting and/or color properties and/or include certain themes (e.g., a face facing a camera smile).
While portions of the present disclosure focus on graphical indicators, aspects of the present disclosure are equally applicable to other types of feedback indicators, including audio feedback indicators provided by speakers (e.g., changes in tone or frequency indicate feedback), tactile feedback indicators, optical feedback indicators provided by light emitters other than displays (e.g., changes in intensity of light or flashing frequency indicate feedback), and/or other types of indicators. Further, although portions of the present disclosure focus on a photographic subject that is a self-portrait or a group-portrait, aspects of the present disclosure are equally applicable to other types of photographic subjects, including, for example, landscape photography, traditional portrait, action scenes, architectural photography, fashion photography, or other photographic subjects.
The graphical feedback indicator may take a variety of different forms or styles and may operate in a variety of different ways. As an example, in some implementations, the graphical smart feedback indicator can include a graphical bar having dimensions that positively correlate with and indicate respective measurements of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by an image frame currently presented in the viewfinder portion of the user interface. For example, the graphical bar may be a horizontal bar at the bottom edge or the top edge of the viewfinder portion of the user interface.
In some embodiments, the graphic bar may have a center point and extend along a first axis. In some implementations, the graphical bar may be fixed or pinned at a center point of the graphical bar and may increase or decrease in size in two directions from the center point of the graphical bar along the first axis to indicate a change in a respective measure of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by an image frame currently being presented in a viewfinder portion of the user interface.
Thus, in one example, if a user is looking at the viewfinder and the graphical bar, they can see that the graphical bar grows or shrinks as the scene becomes more or less desirable. For example, if the user turns his face away from the camera, the bar may shrink, while if the user turns his face towards the camera, the bar may grow. Likewise, if the user frowns, the bar may shrink, and if the user smiles, the bar may grow. In some implementations, when the bar hits an edge of the display, this may indicate that the device has decided to automatically capture a photograph. This may also be accompanied by automatic capture of notifications, as described further below. Thus, the user can be given a feeling that as the bar grows, the probability that an image will be automatically captured also grows.
In another example, in some implementations, the graphical smart feedback indicator can include a graphical shape (e.g., a circle, triangle, rectangle, arrow, star, sphere, box, etc.). The amount of graphical shapes that are filled may be positively correlated with and indicative of respective measurements of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by an image frame currently presented in a viewfinder portion of the user interface.
In one particular example, the graphical shape (e.g., a circle) may have a center point. The amount of the graphical shape (e.g., a circle) that is filled may increase and decrease radially from a center point of the shape to a perimeter of the shape to indicate a respective measured change in one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by an image frame currently being rendered in a viewfinder portion of the user interface.
In some implementations, the graphical smart feedback indicators can include textual feedback (e.g., displayed in a viewfinder portion of the user interface) in addition to or instead of the example feedback indicators described above. For example, the text feedback may provide one or more suggestions to improve the measurement of one or more attributes of the respective scene. In some cases, the one or more suggestions may be generated by or based on an output of the artificial intelligence system.
In some implementations, the graphical intelligent feedback indicator may be considered or operate as a meter that indicates the proximity of the artificial intelligence system to the automatic capture and non-temporary storage of the imagery. For example, the feedback indicator may be filled and/or increased in size to indicate the extent to which the artificial intelligence system is approaching automatic capture and storage of images.
In some implementations, the graphical smart feedback indicator graphically indicates, for each image frame, a raw measurement of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by the image frame without reference to measurements of any other image frame. In other implementations, the graphical smart feedback indicator graphically indicates, for each image frame, a relative measurement of one or more properties of the respective scene depicted by the image frame relative to a previous respective measurement of one or more properties of the respective image frame that has been previously presented within a viewfinder portion of the user interface. For example, the relative measurements may be relative to images that have been captured during a current operating session of the device or system, during a current capture session, and/or since a last instance of automatic capture and storage. Thus, in some implementations, the characteristics (e.g., size) of the graphical smart feedback indicator may be determined based on measurements of the attribute(s) of the current frame and the history of frames that have been recently seen and/or processed.
More particularly, as indicated above, in some implementations, a device or system may automatically store a non-temporal copy of at least one of the plurality of image frames based at least in part on respective measurements, output by the artificial intelligence system, of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by the at least one of the plurality of image frames. For example, if the measurement of the attribute(s) of a particular image frame meets one or more criteria, the device or system may store a copy of that image in a non-temporary memory location (e.g., flash memory, etc.). Conversely, image frames that are not selected for storage may be discarded without non-temporary storage. For example, image frames may be placed in a temporary image buffer, analyzed by an artificial intelligence system, and then deleted from the temporary image buffer (e.g., on a first-in-first-out basis) such that only those images selected for non-temporary storage are retained after operation of the device and clearing of the buffer.
In some implementations, in response to automatically storing a non-temporary copy of at least one of the plurality of image frames, the device or system can provide an automatic capture notification (e.g., in a viewfinder portion of a user interface presented on the display). For example, the auto-capture notification may include a flash (flash) within a viewfinder portion of a user interface presented on the display. The automatic capture notification may indicate to the user that the image was captured (e.g., stored in a non-temporary memory location). This enables the user to understand the operation of the artificial intelligence system and participate in the photographing process.
In some implementations, after automatically storing the non-temporal copy of the at least one of the plurality of image frames, the device or system may operate in a refractory (reflex) mode for a refractory period. In the non-responsive mode, the computer system does not automatically store additional non-temporary copies of the additional image frames regardless of the respective measurements of the one or more properties of the respective scenes depicted by the additional image frames. Alternatively or additionally, in the non-refractory mode, the measurement and/or graphical feedback indicator output by the artificial intelligence system may be depressed to a level that is lower than such item would have been if the device had not been operating in the non-refractory mode. Operation in the refractory mode may avoid situations where multiple nearly identical frames are captured and stored redundantly. Operation in the refractory mode may also provide a natural "pause" reflected in the collaborative feedback from the device to the user, which may be a natural signal for the user to change gestures and/or facial expressions, similar to the behavior that occurs naturally when taking successive photographs in a photograph.
In some embodiments, a device or system may operate in a number of different operating modes, and automatic capture and/or feedback operations may be aspects of only a subset of such different operating modes. Thus, in some implementations, a device or system may receive user input requesting a computing system to operate in a photo kiosk (photo booth) mode, and in response to the user input, operate in the photo kiosk mode, wherein providing a graphical smart feedback indicator associated with a live video stream in a viewfinder portion of a user interface presented on a display is performed as part of the photo kiosk mode. By way of example, a device or system may be switched between a photo kiosk mode and one or more other modes (such as a legacy capture mode, a video mode, etc.). The user is presented with the opportunity to choose to have temporary automatic capture as a dedicated mode. Alternatively, the device or system may always provide automatic capture and/or feedback operations regardless of the current operating mode of the device or system.
The systems and methods of the present disclosure are applicable to many different use cases. As one example, the systems and methods of the present disclosure enable easier capture of a group photograph (e.g., via a guided interactive process between a user and a device). In particular, in one illustrative example, a user may put her smartphone in place, place the smartphone in an auto-capture mode, and let the smartphone operate like a photographer who happens to know what to look for. As another example, the systems and methods of the present disclosure make it easier to capture (e.g., via the same or similar guided interactive process) a personal selfie. In particular, in one illustrative example, a user may hold up her smartphone to take a selfie picture for sharing on social media. By using the automatic capture mode, the user may receive feedback on the attributes of the current image frame and focus on composing the image to be captured, for example by smiling and posing rather than operating a camera shutter. In fact, the user can turn her phone into a photo kiosk, play as pleased, and pick out just what she likes best at a later time. As yet another example, the systems and methods of the present disclosure enable collective selfings to be more easily captured. In particular, in one illustrative example, instead of requiring the user to attempt to capture an image at the right time when everyone is looking at the camera, the group may simply be gathered in front of the camera, receive feedback regarding the attributes of the current image frame and interact with the artificial intelligence system, for example by changing the position and/or facial expression based on the feedback, to cause the artificial intelligence system to capture an image with specific attributes. In yet another example use case, a user may hold a camera device (e.g., a smartphone) and point it at a certain subject (e.g., the rear camera points at a subject other than the user). The user may have the frame selection processed intelligently while the user is still responsible for camera positioning, scene framing, and/or subject guidance.
In each of the above example use cases, the smartphone may provide feedback during capture indicating to the user or group of users how they can improve the likelihood of automatic image capture and the quality of the captured image. In this manner, the user(s) may be presented with real-time feedback informing the user(s) what, when, and why automatic capture decisions were made by the artificial intelligence system, which may enable the user to participate in the collaborative image capture process. Through such a collaborative process, automatically captured images can capture a flat, transient, realistic facial expression that can only be reliably captured by fast enough, more carefully observed artificial intelligence.
The system and method of the present disclosure provide a number of technical effects and benefits. As one example, the systems and methods described herein may use minimal computing resources to automatically capture images, which may result in faster and more efficient execution relative to capturing and storing a large number of images in non-transitory memory, and then viewing the stored image frames to identify those image frames worth retaining. For example, in some embodiments, the systems and methods described herein may be quickly and efficiently performed on a user computing device, such as, for example, a smartphone, due to reduced computing requirements. As such, aspects of the present disclosure may improve accessibility of image captures using such devices, for example, in scenarios where cloud computing is not available or otherwise desirable (e.g., for reasons of improving user privacy and/or reducing communication costs).
In this manner, the systems and methods described herein may provide for more efficient operation of mobile image capture. By storing only the best, automatically selected image, the efficiency with which a particular image can be extracted and stored in non-temporary memory can be improved. In particular, the capture of transient and/or unpredictable events, such as laughs or smiles, may be improved. Thus, the systems and methods described herein avoid less efficient image capture operations, such as manual culling after continuous shooting.
Further, by using feedback indicators, the user is able to more effectively cooperate with the artificial intelligence system. In particular, users are given a sense of what will result in automatic image capture and storage, and can modify their behavior or other scene characteristics to more quickly achieve automatic capture and storage of images suitable for photographic targets. Thus, the use of feedback may result in a device or system obtaining high quality results in less operating time, thereby saving operating resources such as processing power, battery usage, memory usage, and the like.
In various embodiments, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may be included as a feature of an operating system, as a service via an application programming interface, or otherwise used within the context of an application plug-in (e.g., browser plug-in), application, or in other contexts. Thus, in some implementations, the machine learning models described herein may be included in or otherwise stored and implemented by a user computing device (such as a laptop, tablet, or smartphone). As yet another example, the model may be included in or otherwise stored and implemented by a server computing device in communication with the user computing device according to a client-server relationship. For example, the model may be implemented by a server computing device as part of a web service (e.g., a web image capture service).
Referring now to the drawings, example embodiments of the disclosure will be discussed in further detail.
Example apparatus and System
Fig. 1A depicts a block diagram of an example computing system 100, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. The system 100 includes a user computing device 102, a server computing system 130, and a training computing system 150 communicatively coupled through a network 180.
The user computing device 102 may be any type of computing device, such as, for example, a personal computing device (e.g., a laptop or desktop computer), a mobile computing device (e.g., a smartphone or tablet), a gaming console or controller, a wearable computing device, an embedded computing device, or any other type of computing device.
The user computing device 102 includes one or more processors 112 and memory 114. The one or more processors 112 may be any suitable processing device (e.g., processor core, microprocessor, ASIC, FPGA, controller, microcontroller, etc.) and may be one processor or operatively connected processors. The memory 114 may include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, a disk, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The memory 114 may store instructions 116 and data 115 that are executed by the processor 112 to cause the user computing device 102 to perform operations.
In some implementations, the user computing device can include an artificial intelligence system 119. The artificial intelligence system 119 may be configured to analyze each of the plurality of image frames and output, for each of the plurality of image frames, a respective measure of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by the image frame. For example, the artificial intelligence system 119 may output a score or other measure of how desirable a particular image frame is to meet a particular photographic goal (such as, for example, a selfie, group photograph, or group selfie).
In some implementations, the artificial intelligence system 119 can be configured to capture content characterized by people and faces, where the subject is in focus without blurring and/or the subject is smiling or expressing a positive mood. The artificial intelligence system 119 may avoid capturing objects that are eyes closed or blinking.
Thus, in some implementations, the artificial intelligence system 119 can detect the face of a person in the view and prioritize capture when the face is within 3-8 feet of the camera field of view and is located in the center of the camera field of view (e.g., not within the outer 10% edges of the view). In some implementations, the artificial intelligence system 119 can detect and prioritize the capture of positive human emotions. For example, the artificial intelligence system 119 may detect smiles, laughs, and/or other expressions of pleasure (such as surprise and satisfaction).
In some implementations, the artificial intelligence system 119 can detect a person's gaze and eyes to prioritize capture when a subject is looking at the camera, and/or avoid blinking or closing eyes in selected motion picture poster frames. In some implementations, the artificial intelligence system 119 can detect and prioritize the capture clips when face focus is known and properly exposed according to the autofocus/autoexposure attributes defined by the camera application API.
In some implementations, the artificial intelligence system 119 can prioritize capture when there is a reasonable confidence that the camera is dropped or held steady (e.g., using IMU data to avoid delivering "shaky" shots). In some embodiments, the artificial intelligence system 119 can perform activity detection. In some embodiments, the artificial intelligence system 119 may perform automatic pruning (crop).
In some implementations, the artificial intelligence system 119 can store or include one or more machine-learned models 120. For example, the machine-learned model 120 may be or may otherwise include various machine-learned models, such as neural networks (e.g., deep neural networks) or other types of machine-learned models, including non-linear models and/or linear models. The neural network may include a feed-forward neural network, a recurrent neural network (e.g., a long-short term memory recurrent neural network), a convolutional neural network, or other form of neural network. An example machine-learned model 120 is discussed with reference to fig. 3.
In some implementations, the one or more machine-learned models 120 can be received from the server computing system 130 over the network 180, stored in the user computing device memory 114, and then used or otherwise implemented by the one or more processors 112. In some implementations, the user computing device 102 can implement multiple parallel instances of a single machine-learned model 120 (e.g., to perform analysis of multiple images in parallel).
Additionally or alternatively, one or more machine-learned models 140 may be included in or otherwise stored and implemented by the server computing system 130 in communication with the user computing device 102 according to a client-server relationship. For example, the machine-learned model 140 may be implemented by the server computing system 140 as part of a web service. Accordingly, one or more models 120 may be stored and implemented at the user computing device 102, and/or one or more models 140 may be stored and implemented at the server computing system 130.
The user computing device 102 may also include one or more user input components 122 that receive user input. For example, user input component 122 may be a touch-sensitive component (e.g., a touch-sensitive display screen or touchpad) that is sensitive to touch by a user input object (e.g., a finger or stylus). The touch sensitive component may be used to implement a virtual keyboard. Other example user input components include a microphone, a conventional keyboard, or other means by which a user may provide user input.
The user computing device 102 may include a display 124. The display 124 may be any type of display including, for example, a cathode ray tube display, a light emitting diode display (LED), an electroluminescent display (ELD), an electronic paper or electronic ink display, a Plasma Display Panel (PDP), a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), an organic light emitting diode display (OLED), and the like.
The user computing device 102 may include an image capture system 126 configured to capture images. The image capture system 126 may include one or more cameras. Each camera may include various components, such as, for example, one or more lenses, an image sensor (e.g., a CMOS sensor or a CCD sensor), an imaging pipeline (e.g., an image signal processor), and/or other components.
The camera(s) may be any type of camera positioned according to any configuration. In one example, the device 102 may have multiple front-facing cameras and/or multiple rear-facing cameras. The camera may be a narrow angle camera, a wide angle camera, or a combination thereof. The cameras may have different filters (filters) and/or may accept different wavelengths of light (e.g., one infrared camera and one visible spectrum camera). In one example, the device 102 may have a first rear camera (e.g., with a wide angle lens and/or f/1.8 aperture), a second rear camera (e.g., with a telephoto lens and/or f/2.4 aperture), and a front camera (e.g., with a wide angle lens and/or f/2.2 aperture). In another particular example, the device 102 may include the following cameras: a rear camera (e.g., with 12.2-megapixels, laser autofocus, and/or two-pixel phase detection), a first front camera (e.g., with 8.1-megapixels and/or f/1.8 apertures), and a second front camera (e.g., with 8.1-megapixels, wide angle lenses, and/or variable f/1.8 and f/2.2 apertures).
The server computing system 130 includes one or more processors 132 and memory 134. The one or more processors 132 may be any suitable processing device (e.g., processor core, microprocessor, ASIC, FPGA, controller, microcontroller, etc.) and may be one processor or operably connected processors. Memory 134 may include one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media, such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, EPROM, flash memory devices, a disk, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. The memory 134 may store instructions 138 and data 136 that are executed by the processor 132 to cause the server computing system 130 to perform operations.
In some implementations, the server computing system 130 includes or is otherwise implemented by one or more server computing devices. Where the server computing system 130 includes multiple server computing devices, such server computing devices may operate according to a sequential computing architecture, a parallel computing architecture, or some combination thereof.
As described above, the server computing system 130 may store or otherwise include one or more machine-learned models 140. For example, the model 140 may be or may otherwise include various machine-learned models. Example machine-learned models include neural networks or other multi-layered nonlinear models. Example neural networks include feed-forward neural networks, deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. An example model 140 is discussed with reference to FIG. 3.
The user computing device 102 and/or the server computing system 130 may train the models 120 and/or 140 via interaction with a training computing system 150 communicatively coupled through a network 180. The training computing system 150 may be separate from the server computing system 130 or may be part of the server computing system 130.
In particular, the model trainer 160 may train the machine-learned models 120 and/or 140 based on a set of training data 162. The training data 162 may include, for example, processed images and/or unprocessed images as training images.
Thus, in some embodiments, the model trainer 160 may train a new model or update a version of an existing model on the additional image data. The training data 162 may include images that have been tagged with ground truth measurements or one or more attributes of interest. As an example, model trainer 160 may use manual labeling of desired images to train one or more models to provide an output regarding the desirability of input images. In particular, in some embodiments, the additional training data may be images created or selected by the user through an editing interface. Thus, the model trainer 160 can train updated versions of the models on the personalized data set to better infer, capture, and store images that satisfy a user's particular visual tastes. In other cases, the additional training data may be anonymous, aggregated user feedback.
Thus, in some implementations, the training examples may be provided by the user computing device 102 if the user has provided consent. Thus, in such implementations, the model 120 provided to the user computing device 102 may be trained by the training computing system 150 on user-specific data received from the user computing device 102. In some cases, this process may be referred to as personalizing the model.
The model trainer 160 includes computer logic for providing the desired functionality. Model trainer 160 may be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software that controls a general purpose processor. For example, in some embodiments, model trainer 160 includes program files stored on a storage device, loaded into memory, and executed by one or more processors. In other embodiments, model trainer 160 includes one or more sets of computer-executable instructions stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium, such as a RAM hard disk or an optical or magnetic medium.
FIG. 1A illustrates one example computing system that can be used to implement the present disclosure. Other computing systems may also be used. For example, in some implementations, the user computing device 102 may include a model trainer 160 and a training data set 162. In such implementations, the model 120 may be trained and used locally at the user computing device 102. In some such implementations, the user computing device 102 may implement the model trainer 160 to personalize the model 120 based on user-specific data.
FIG. 1B depicts a block diagram of an example computing device 10, performed in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Computing device 10 may be a user computing device or a server computing device.
As shown in fig. 1B, each application may communicate with many other components of the computing device, such as, for example, one or more sensors, a context manager, a device state component, and/or additional components. In some implementations, each application can communicate with each device component using an API (e.g., a public API). In some embodiments, the API used by each application is specific to that application.
Fig. 1C depicts a block diagram of an example computing device 50, performed in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Computing device 50 may be a user computing device or a server computing device.
The central smart inlay includes a number of machine-learned models. For example, as shown in fig. 1C, a respective machine-learned model (e.g., model) may be provided for each application and managed by the central intelligence layer. In other implementations, two or more applications may share a single machine-learned model. For example, in some embodiments, the central smart inlay may provide a single model (e.g., a single model) for all applications. In some embodiments, the central smart inlay is included within or otherwise implemented by the operating system of the computing device 50.
The central smart inlay may communicate with a central device data plane. The central device data layer may be a centralized repository for data of the computing device 50. As shown in fig. 1C, the central device data layer may communicate with a plurality of other components of the computing device, such as, for example, one or more sensors, a context manager, a device state component, and/or additional components. In some implementations, the central device data layer can communicate with each device component using an API (e.g., a private API).
Fig. 2 depicts a schematic diagram of an example image processing framework 200, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. In particular, the schematic depicted in fig. 2 illustrates the relationships between components that allow multiple potential data paths or workflows to pass through the framework 200. The image processing framework 200 may be included in the user computing device 102 of FIG. 1A.
Fig. 2 provides one example of an image processing framework, but the present disclosure is not limited to the example provided in fig. 2. Other configurations of image processing frameworks with more or fewer components and/or different data flows may be used in accordance with the present disclosure.
Referring to fig. 2, an image processing framework 200 includes an image sensor 202 that outputs raw image data. For example, the RAW image data may be a bayer RAW image. The raw image data may be transferred to the first memory 204 and/or the imaging pipeline 206. As one example, the first memory 204 storing the raw image data output by the image sensor 202 may be named a raw temporary data buffer and may be, for example, a DRAM memory. In some implementations, the imaging pipeline 206 streams raw image data directly from the image sensor 202. In such a scenario, the temporary data buffer may optionally store processed images instead of raw image data.
The imaging pipeline 206 acquires raw image data received from the image sensor 202 and processes the raw image data to generate an image. For example, the processed image may be an RGB image, a YUV image, a YCbCr image, or an image according to other color spaces. Further, the imaging pipeline 206 may be operably connected to a system processor 214. The system processor 214 may include a hardware block 216 that assists the imaging pipeline 206 in performing Debayer filtering, RAW filtering, LSC filtering, or other image processing operations. The RAW filtering stage may provide image statistics 216 for real-time automatic exposure and/or automatic white balance operations. Software filters may also optionally be employed.
Depending on the capture mode of the mobile image capture device and/or other parameters, the imaging pipeline 206 may provide images to an optional scaler (scaler)208 or a second memory 222, as will be discussed further below. The scaler 208 may downsample the received image to output a lower resolution version of the image. Thus, in some embodiments, scaler 208 may be named a downsampler.
The scaler 208 provides the image to a third memory 210. The third memory 210 may be the same memory as the second memory 222 or a different memory. The second memory 222 and/or the third memory 210 may store temporary copies of the images. Accordingly, the second memory 222 and/or the third memory 210 may be named a temporary image buffer. In some embodiments, the second memory 222 and/or the third memory 210 are DRAMs. Further, in some embodiments, downsampling may be performed at the beginning of the imaging pipeline, enabling the imaging pipeline to operate at a lower resolution and to save power to a greater extent.
The second memory 222 and/or the third memory 210 may provide image information to the artificial intelligence system 212. In some implementations, the artificial intelligence system 212 is operable to analyze a scene depicted by an image to assess desirability of such scene, and based at least in part on such desirability, determine whether to store a non-temporary copy of such image or discard a temporary copy of such image without further storage. The artificial intelligence system 212 can also access various data 218 stored at the system processor 214.
If the artificial intelligence system 212 determines that a non-temporary copy of the image should be stored, the artificial intelligence system 212 can provide the image to the compression component 226. In other implementations, the compression component 226 may receive images from the second memory 222 and/or the third memory 210. In still other embodiments, if the artificial intelligence system determines that a non-temporary copy of the image should be stored, the raw image data stored in the first memory 204 will be retrieved and processed by the imaging pipeline 206 and the resulting processed image will be provided to the compression component 226.
The compression component 226 compresses the received image. The compression component 226 may be a hardware component or image compression software implemented on a processor (e.g., the system processor 214). After compression, the non-temporary copy of the image is written to non-volatile memory 228. For example, the non-volatile memory 228 may be an SD card or other type of non-transitory memory.
It should be noted that in some embodiments, the image compression path 220 marked in the dotted box may be inactive when no image is selected for compression and storage. Thus, in some embodiments, the output of the artificial intelligence system 212 may be used to turn on the image compression path 220 or control the image sensor 202. In particular, the artificial intelligence system 212 (e.g., in cooperative relationship with the system processor 214) may provide a sensor control signal 230 to control the image sensor 202, as will be discussed further below. Additionally, in some embodiments, the output of the artificial intelligence system 212 may also be used to open or close imaging pipeline paths. Further, in some implementations and/or capture modes, some portions of the scene analysis may be performed for low resolution images while other portions of the scene analysis may be performed on cropped portions of high resolution images (e.g., facial expression analysis may require cropped portions of high resolution images).
In some implementations, the output from the image sensor 202 may control most of the timing through the imaging pipeline 206. For example, image processing at the imaging pipeline 206 may be approximately synchronized with the transfer frame at the image sensor receiver (e.g., MIPI receiver). Each stage of image processing 206 may have some delay that causes the output to lag the input by a few image sensor lines. This amount of delay may be constant given the amount of processing that occurs in the pipeline 206.
In some embodiments, the artificial intelligence system 212 may start shortly after the imaging pipeline 206 has written all lines (lines) of an image to memory. In other embodiments, the artificial intelligence system 212 starts up even before the imaging pipeline 206 writes all lines of an image to memory. For example, some models included in an artificial intelligence system (e.g., face detector models) may operate on a subset of images at a time, thus not requiring all lines of an image to be written to memory. In some embodiments, the compression may be performed after the artificial intelligence system 212 determines that the image is worth saving and compressing. In other embodiments, instead of analyzing images that have been completely processed by the image processing pipeline 206, the artificial intelligence system 212 may analyze images that have been only slightly processed by the imaging pipeline 206 or bayer raw images.
FIG. 3 depicts an example configuration 1200 of a model in an artificial intelligence system according to an example embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 3 depicts different components operating in an artificial intelligence system and the flow of data between them. As shown, certain portions of the execution may be parallelized.
Fig. 3 provides one example of an artificial intelligence system, but the disclosure is not limited to the example provided in fig. 3. Other configurations of artificial intelligence systems with more or fewer components and/or different data flows may be used in accordance with the present disclosure.
The following discussion with reference to fig. 3 will refer to various models. In some embodiments, one or more (e.g., all) of such models are artificial neural networks (e.g., deep neural networks). Each model may output at least one descriptor that describes a measure of a property of the image. The image may be annotated with such descriptor(s). Thus, the output of the model will be referred to as an annotation. In some embodiments, the model provides the annotation to the preservation controller 1250, and the preservation controller 1250 annotates the image with the annotation.
The frames of imagery 1202 are provided to a face detection or tracking model 1204. A face detection or tracking model 1204 detects one or more faces depicted by the frame 1202 and outputs one or more face bounding boxes 1206 describing respective locations of the one or more detected faces. The face bounding box 1206 may be annotated to the frame 1202 and may also be provided as input to the face properties model 1208 and the face recognition model 1216 along with the frame 1202.
In some implementations, the face detection or tracking model 1204 performs face tracking rather than simple face detection. In some implementations, model 1204 can select which of detection or tracking to perform. Face tracking is a faster alternative to face detection. Face tracking may take as additional input the face detection bounding box 1206 from a frame of a previous image. Face tracking model 1204 updates the position of bounding box 1206, but may not detect a new face in some cases.
Importantly, neither face detection nor face tracking attempts to determine or confirm the human identity of any detected face. Instead, the face detection or tracking model 1204 outputs only a face bounding box 1206 that describes the position of the face within the frame 1202 of the imagery. Thus, model 1204 only performs the original detection of faces (e.g., identifying the depicted image features of "face-like"), without any attempt to match faces to identities.
The facial attribute model 1208 may receive as input one or more cropped portions (e.g., relatively higher resolution cropped portions) of the frame 1202 of the imagery, where the one or more cropped portions correspond to the portion(s) of the frame 1202 defined by the coordinates of the bounding box(s) 1206. The face properties model 1208 may output an indication (e.g., a probability) that the detected face(s) include certain face properties 1210. For example, the facial attribute model 1208 may output respective probabilities that the detected face includes smiles, open eyes, certain gestures, certain expressions, expression diversification, or other facial attributes 1210.
The face attributes 1210 may be provided as input to the face up mirror model 1212 along with the frame 1202 of the imagery. The facial onview model 1212 may output a single face score 1214 that represents the pose, the expressive onview level, and/or other characteristics or attributes of the detected face(s).
Returning to the output of the face detection or tracking model 1204, the face recognition model 1216 may receive as input one or more cropped portions (e.g., relatively higher resolution cropped portions) of the frame 1202 of the imagery, where the one or more cropped portions correspond to the portion(s) of the frame 1202 defined by the coordinates of the bounding box(s) 1206. The face recognition model 1216 may output a face signature for each detected face. A face signature may be an abstraction of a face, such as a nesting or template of faces or features of faces.
Importantly, the facial recognition model 1216 does not attempt to determine or confirm the human identity of the detected face(s). Thus, the face recognition model 1216 does not attempt to determine the name of the face or otherwise match the face to a public image or other such information. Instead, the face recognition model 1216 simply matches an abstraction (e.g., a nested or other low-dimensional representation) of the detected face(s) with corresponding other abstractions associated with previously "recognized" faces. As one example, the face recognition model 1216 may provide a probability (e.g., a confidence level from 0.0 to 1.0) that an abstraction of a face depicted in the input image matches an abstraction of a face depicted in a previously captured image. Thus, the facial recognition model 1216 may indicate (e.g., in the facial signature 1218) that a face detected in the image 1202 may also be depicted in a previously captured image, but does not attempt to identify "who" this face belongs in the context of human identity.
The frames 1202 of the imagery may also be provided as input to the image content model 1220. The image content model 1220 may output one or more semantic feature vectors 1222 and one or more semantic tags 1224. The semantic feature vector 1222 may be used to determine that two images contain similar content (e.g., similar to how face nesting is used to determine that two faces are similar). Semantic tags 1224 may identify one or more semantic features (e.g., "dogs," "sunsets," "mountains," "eiffel towers," etc.) detected within the frame 1202 of the imagery. The concept of similarity (probability) between images can be used to ensure diversity of captured images.
In some implementations, the image content model 1220 is a version of a deep convolutional neural network trained for image classification. In some implementations, a subset of semantic classes that are of particular importance to the user of the mobile image capture device (e.g., animals, dogs, cats, sunsets, birthday cakes, etc.) can be established, and the image content model 1220 can place particular emphasis on detection/classification of such a subset of semantic classes with increasing importance.
The frame 1202 of imagery may also be provided as input to the visual feature extractor model 1226. The visual feature extractor model 1226 may output one or more visual feature vectors 1228 that describe one or more visual features of the frame 1202 (e.g., a color histogram, a combination of colors, an indication of an amount of blur, an indication of lighting quality, etc.).
The semantic feature vectors 1222, semantic tags 1224, and visual feature vectors 1228 may be provided as inputs to the photo quality model 1230 along with the frame 1202. The photo quality model 1230 may output a photo quality score 1232 based on the input. In general, the photo quality model 1230 will determine a photo quality score 1232 based on the interestingness of the image 1202 (e.g., as indicated by the semantic tags 1224), the technical quality of the image 1202 (e.g., as indicated by the visual feature vector 1228 describing blur and/or illumination), and/or the composition quality of the image 1202 (e.g., as indicated by the relative positions of the semantic entities and the visual features).
Some or all of the annotations 1206, 1210, 1214, 1218, 1222, 1224, 1228, and 1232 may be measurements of properties of the image frame 1202. In some implementations, some or all of the annotations 1206, 1210, 1214, 1218, 1222, 1224, 1228, and 1232 may be used to generate a single aggregate measurement or score for the image frame 1202. In some embodiments, the individual scores may be generated according to heuristics, such as, for example, a weighted average of the respective scores provided for the annotations, where the weights of the weighted average and/or the respective scoring functions for the respective annotations may be modified or tuned to score the image for a particular photographic target. In some implementations, a single score may be used to control a feedback indicator representing the single score.
In some embodiments, preservation controller 1250 includes an in-memory annotation index or other frame buffer so that preservation decisions can be made with respect to the frame 1202 with respect to peer (peer) images. In other embodiments, the preservation controller 1250 makes the decision based only on information about the current frame 1202.
In some embodiments, and to provide an example only, storage controller 1250 may be designed to select approximately 5% of the captured images for compression and storage. In some embodiments, whenever storage controller 1250 triggers the storage of an image, a window that triggers the storage of imagery surrounding the image is stored.
In some embodiments, the various models may be combined to form a multi-headed model. As one example, the face properties model 1208, the face recognition model 1216, and/or the on-face mirror model 1212 may be merged or otherwise combined to form a multi-head model that receives a single set of inputs and provides multiple outputs.
Fig. 4 depicts a diagram of an example operational state flow, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in fig. 4, the example device may switch between operating states such as a traditional camera mode, a photo kiosk mode, and a photo gallery mode.
Thus, in some embodiments, the kiosk operating mode may be a dedicated mode accessed via the camera application mode switcher. The user is presented with the opportunity to opt-in to the temporary automatic capture as a dedicated mode. In some embodiments, exiting the photo kiosk mode and switching back to the main camera mode may be easy and occur via a single button press.
In some implementations, the transition between the standard camera application and the photo kiosk mode may be seamless and may be represented, for example, by a brief display of a photo kiosk icon that fades the screen to black and/or notifies mode switching. This transition time can be used to load the intelligent model as needed.
In some implementations, when the user is in the photo kiosk mode, the application may provide a live view to help the user catch a scene and understand what is "in view" and/or give the user qualitative feedback from the camera intelligence to help them understand what the phone "sees".
In some embodiments, when the user is in a photo kiosk mode, the user may be made aware that a new clip is being captured as close to "present" as possible in order to provide frequent feedback of camera capture.
In some implementations, viewing the most recent footage may be just one interaction (e.g., button press), and the user may be able to easily delete footage they do not want. The most recently captured thumbnails may represent thumbnails from the current capture session, and these thumbnails may be refreshed on each new instance of the kiosk mode.
In some implementations, the first time the user initiates the photo kiosk mode, the user interface may provide a short tutorial on core concepts, such as: the concept of hands-free capture; briefly introduce what the intelligence "looks for"; recommended usage patterns, such as drop; a current range of permissions; and/or other instructions.
In some implementations, while in the photo kiosk mode, the image capture system can capture motion pictures, selecting both interesting video segments of up to 3s, 30fps, and a single high quality "poster frame". In some implementations, the captured image may include full megapixels output from a front-facing camera sensor for poster frames, HDR +, and/or 30fps/720p video components. The photo booth mode may be adjusted as much as possible for the detected face in view, using standard auto-exposure (AE) and auto-focus (AF) behavior from mainstream camera applications. In some implementations, various portrait mode effects (e.g., shot blur) may be added to the captured portrait photograph.
In some implementations, the user can configure the photo library backup and synchronization settings for content captured in the photo kiosk mode separately from the content in the master catalog. One way to do this is to save the photo kiosk contents in a specific device folder while still presenting these contents in the master photo tab in the library. The user can search, filter and segment out clips captured in the photo kiosk mode in the photo library.
In some implementations, the user may be able to switch the audio capture on/off from the home screen of the photo kiosk mode and/or from a setup menu. Alternatively or additionally, the photo kiosk mode may inherit the mainstream camera options.
Example user interface
Fig. 5A-C depict example user interfaces according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. The example user interface includes a graphical smart feedback indicator 502 at a top edge of a viewfinder portion 504 of the user interface.
As shown in fig. 5A-C, the graphical smart feedback indicator 502 is a horizontally oriented graphical bar. In the example shown, the graphical smart feedback indicator 502 indicates the extent to which the rendered image frame is suitable for use as a group photo. In particular, the size of the graphical intelligent feedback indicator 502 positively correlates with the indication of the measure of suitability for use as a group photo that has been output by the artificial intelligence system.
More particularly, as shown in fig. 5A, none of the subjects within the depicted scene are looking at the camera. As such, the image is relatively less ideal for satisfying the collective photograph of the photographic subject. Thus, the size of the graphical smart feedback indicator 502 is relatively small.
Turning to fig. 5B, one, but not both, subjects within the scene depicted are now looking at the camera. As such, the image is relatively more ideal for satisfying the collective photograph of the photographic subject. Thus, the size of the graphical smart feedback indicator 502 has increased relative to FIG. 5A.
Finally, turning to fig. 5C, now both subjects within the depicted scene are looking at the camera. As such, the image is very suitable for satisfying the collective photographing of the subject. Thus, the size of the graphical smart feedback indicator 502 has again been increased relative to FIG. 5B. Indeed, the graphical smart feedback indicator 502 in FIG. 5C is now sized to fill almost the entire width of the user interface. This may indicate that the device is about to, or is currently, automatically capturing an image. In other words, the line may grow to the edge of the touch display when capture occurs.
The example user interfaces shown in fig. 5A-C may also optionally include some or all of the following controls: a link to a photo library viewer; a moving picture switching control; a zoom control, a user prompt, a manual shutter button control, and/or a mode close control.
In some embodiments, when in the photo kiosk mode, the user may be provided with a simple way to increase or decrease the capture rate of the camera, such as an optional slider setting or alternatively a discrete number of levels. This may be an in-mode user interface separate from the native settings of the camera. Sliders or other interface features may be accessed via a setup menu or may be available directly on the main interface screen.
Fig. 6A-C depict a first example graphical smart feedback indicator 602, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. In particular, the graphical smart feedback indicator 602 shown in FIGS. 6A-C is highly similar to the graphical smart feedback indicator shown in FIGS. 5A-C.
As shown in fig. 6A-C, the graphical smart feedback indicator 602 is a graphical bar having a size that positively correlates to and indicates a respective measure of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by an image frame currently being presented in the viewfinder portion of the user interface. For example, the graphical bar 602 is a horizontal bar at the top edge of the viewfinder portion of the user interface.
The graphical bar 602 has a center point 604 and extends along a horizontal axis. The graphical bar 602 is fixed or pinned at a center point 604 of the graphical bar 602 and increases or decreases in size in two directions along a horizontal axis from the center point 604 of the graphical bar 602 to indicate a change in a respective measure of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by an image frame currently being presented in a viewfinder portion of the user interface. In some embodiments, the entire shape may be filled when capture is activated. In other words, the inner circle may grow to contact the edge of the outer circle when capture occurs.
Fig. 7A-C depict a second example graphical smart feedback indicator 702, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. The graphical smart feedback indicator 702 is a graphical shape, in the example shown a circle. The amount of graphical shape 702 that is filled in positively correlates to and indicates a respective measure of one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by the image frame currently being rendered in the viewfinder portion of the user interface.
The graphical shape (e.g., a circle) 702 may have a center point 704. The amount of the graphical shape (e.g., a circle) 702 that is filled increases and decreases radially from a center point 704 of the shape 702 toward a perimeter of the shape 702 to indicate a respective measured change in one or more properties of a respective scene depicted by an image frame currently being rendered in a viewfinder portion of the user interface.
Fig. 8 depicts a third example graphical smart feedback indicator 802 according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. The indicator 802 provides textual feedback. For example, the text feedback may provide one or more suggestions (e.g., "camera-facing") to improve the measurement of one or more attributes of the respective scene. In some cases, the one or more suggestions may be generated by or based on an output of the artificial intelligence system. Additional example suggestions include "keep the camera still," too dark, "" i do not see any face, "" flash turned off (or on), "light low," "try different lighting," "try different expressions," "move the camera a bit farther," "reduce backlighting," and/or other suggestions. For example, the suggestion may describe a primary reason that artificial intelligence did not capture the image or otherwise provided a relatively low score for the image.
Example method
Fig. 9 depicts a flowchart of an example method performed in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Although fig. 9 depicts the steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods of the present disclosure are not limited to the particular order or arrangement shown. Various portions of the method 900 may be omitted, rearranged, combined, and/or adapted in various ways without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, various portions of method 900 may be performed in parallel, whether so described or not.
At 902, a computing system obtains an image frame from an image capture system.
At 904, the computing system stores the image frame in a temporary image buffer.
At 906, the computing system analyzes the image frame using an artificial intelligence system to determine a measure of one or more properties of a scene depicted by the image frame.
At 908, the computing system displays the image frame in a viewfinder portion of the user interface.
At 910, concurrent with 908, the computing system displays a graphical feedback indicator in a viewfinder portion of the user interface that indicates a measurement of one or more properties of an image frame currently displayed in the viewfinder portion of the user interface.
At 912, the computing system determines whether the image frame satisfies one or more storage criteria. For example, the measure of one or more attributes may be compared to one or more criteria, e.g., criteria may be in the form of a threshold score or condition that must be met. In one particular example, an image may satisfy a storage criterion if a certain percentage (e.g., > 50%) of the faces in the scene are exhibiting positive facial expressions. In another example, the criterion may be considered satisfied if more than a certain number (e.g., 3) of faces included in the scene are exhibiting positive facial expressions.
If it is determined at 912 that the image frame does not meet the storage criteria, the method 900 may return to 902 and obtain the next image frame in the stream of image frames from the image capture system.
However, if it is determined at 912 that the image frame does meet the storage criteria, method 900 may proceed to 914.
At 914, the computing system can store the image frame in a non-temporary memory location.
At 916, the computing system can provide the auto-capture notification in the user interface.
After 916, method 900 may return to 902 and obtain the next image frame in the stream of image frames from the image capture system.
