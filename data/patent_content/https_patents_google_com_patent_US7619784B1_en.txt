Definitions
- the present invention relates generally to scanning bound documents. More specifically, systems and methods for pacing and error monitoring of a manual page turning operator of a system for capturing images of a bound document are disclosed.
- Bound documents include not only books, but also periodicals, manuscripts, pamphlets, brochures, newspapers, manuals, and any other document having a bound edge.
- Many institutions, such as the Library of Congress, universities, bookstores, and private enterprises have vast collections of bound documents. By converting these documents into electronic form, such institutions can reduce the cost of storage, facilitate remote access, enable simultaneous access by multiple users, facilitate search and retrieval of information, and/or protect information in rare or out-of-print works from loss or destruction.
- the recorded image can be manipulated or otherwise processed.
- Digitally recorded bound documents can be reformatted, supplemented with additional information, compressed, and/or processed with OCR (optical character recognition) software, and indexed to facilitate electronic search.
- OCR optical character recognition
- a traditional flat-bed platen scanner scans bound documents in a face-down position.
- a flat-bed scanner typically requires the application of force to the spine or binding region of the bound documents to insure that they come within the scanner's depth of focus. Such force can damage the spine region of the document.
- using the flat-bed platen can be tedious and time-consuming, as the bound documents typically must be lifted and repositioned after each page is scanned. Further, image quality is often poor due to loss of focus, uneven illumination, and distortion caused by page curvature in the vicinity of the binding.
- An alternative to the traditional flat-bed platen scanner is a platen-less scanner that captures image data from a bound document in a face-up position.
- Such scanners typically do not require application of additional stress to the binding region of a bound document, since the document is scanned in its natural, face-up position.
- Some such scanners make use of automatic page turning apparatuses.
- optics and software have been developed for compensating for the image-distortion resulting from the inherently curved surfaces typical of open, edge-bound books that are not subjected to potentially damaging flattening pressure.
- the curvature of a document's pages may be detected using a curvature detector, with a linear light source for defining a brightness distribution. The detected curves of the page can then be used to approximately rectify image signals received from the document scanner.
- a system for scanning images in a bound document generally includes a controller and may implement audio and/or error monitoring to facilitate the scanning of images. For example, music may be played at a tempo to help control the speed at which the operator manually turns the pages. The tempo may be adjusted based on the detected error rate and/or the image capture rate. The tempo may also be limited to a maximum tempo based on the maximum image capture rate.
- error detection may be implemented using optical character recognition (OCR) to determine the printed page numbers in order to track page number sequence and/or using a sensor to detect other errors such as object intrusion into the image frame and insufficient light.
- OCR optical character recognition
- the operator may be alerted of an error with audio signals and may also be signaled to turn back a certain number of pages to be recaptured.
- the tempo can be adjusted in response to the detected operator error rate to reduce operator errors and thus increase the overall throughput of the image capturing system.
- the system for imaging a bound document generally includes a speaker for playing music having a tempo and a controller for controlling the tempo based on an imaging rate and/or a detected error rate.
- the system generally includes an OCR engine for performing OCR processing and a controller which uses the OCR output to determine page numbering of the imaged pages.
- the region on which OCR processing is performed is preferably substantially less than the entire imaged page and may be determined based on the location of a pointer such as a finger of the operator, an image target, or a light or laser pointer.
- the controller may throw an exception if the controller fails to detect page numbers for a certain number of consecutive pages or if the controller detects non-sequential page numbers.
- the method for imaging a bound document generally includes playing music having a tempo through a speaker and controlling the tempo based on an image capture rate and/or an error rate.
- the method generally includes performing OCR processing only on data corresponding to a border region of each imaged page and determining page numbers on the pages being imaged based on the OCR output.
- FIG. 1 is a simplified schematic diagram of an exemplary image capturing system.
- FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating an operator at the image capturing system of FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating additional elements associated with error detection of the image capturing system of FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of illustrative pointers for determining page number location of the imaged pages and illustrative border regions of the imaged pages on which OCR is performed.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a process using audio and error monitoring to facilitate the image capturing of pages in a bound document
- FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of one exemplary embodiment of an image capturing system 20 and FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating an operator 32 at the image capturing system 20 .
- the image capturing system 20 generally includes cameras 22 , such as high resolution cameras, positioned to image or photograph the facing pages 24 A, 24 B of an open bound document, such as a book 24 resting in a cradle 26 . It is to be understood that although a book is used herein in describing the imaging system and process, the system and process may be utilized to and/or adapted to image any other suitable types of bound documents such as periodicals, manuscripts, pamphlets, brochures, newspapers, manuals and/or any other types of documents having a bound edge, typically with a hard or soft cover.
- the cameras 22 are shown as an exemplary image capturing mechanism for the image capturing system 20 , any other image capturing mechanism such as a camera in combination with moving mirrors may be employed.
- the system 20 may include a housing 30 or other structure to house or otherwise support the cameras 22 , lighting mechanism, and/or other components of the image capturing system 20 .
- the operator 32 may use a foot petal 44 , for example, to cause the cameras 22 to capture the images. In particular, the operator 32 may depress the foot petal 44 after each page turn and after the operator is ready for the images to be captured.
- the image capturing system 20 further includes one or more speakers 28 that may also be supported by the housing 30 for playing music and/or other sounds to assist the manual page turning operator 32 .
- music can be played to facilitate the operator 32 in turning pages at a consistently high rate, to reduce boredom, delay fatigue, and/or inattentiveness, thereby maintaining alertness and consistency in the page turning rate for improved productivity.
- the tempo of the music may be used to help control the speed at which the operator 32 manually turns the pages.
- music is played at a tempo of, for example, 120 bpm (beats per minute) such that the operator turns one page turn every 4 beats or at a rate of 30 page turns per minute.
- the tempo of the music may be used to help the operator 32 achieve a manual page turning rate up to but no greater than the maximum image capture rate of the cameras. Limiting the manual page turning to correspond to the maximum image capture rate also reduces camera errors due to overly fast image acquisition.
- external speakers 28 are shown and described herein as the delivery mechanism for sound, it is to be understood that the speakers 28 may be embodied in a personal headset.
- One advantage of using personal headsets is that multiple operators, each listening to pacing music, may be working in a same room without interference from sound delivered to other operators.
- the speakers in conjunction with an error detection system, may be utilized to provide an audio feedback mechanism to signal errors and/or other faults or exceptions to the operator.
- the block diagram of FIG. 3 illustrates additional components of the image capturing system 20 associated with error detection.
- the image capturing system 20 includes a controller or processor 34 that communicates with and/or controls an optical character recognition (OCR) engine 36 , the cameras 22 , the speakers 28 , and/or lights 40 for lighting the facing pages of the book.
- OCR optical character recognition
- the controller/processor 34 may include a sound card to interface with the speakers 28 .
- the OCR 36 may perform optical character recognition on image data received either directly from the cameras 22 as is preferred or from a memory or storage 38 for the cameras (as shown in dashed). The OCR 36 in turn transmits the character data to the controller/processor 34 for further processing.
- the controller/processor 34 preferably uses the data received from the OCR 36 to attempt to determine the page number (if any) printed on each facing page imaged. To reduce computational requirements on the controller/processor 34 and thus reduce processing time, the controller/processor 34 preferably limits the processing for purposes of page number determination to only certain areas of each facing page where the page number is likely to be printed. Minimizing processing time may help increase the overall throughput of the image capturing system 20 . For example, as shown in the schematic of FIG. 4 , the OCR 36 and/or the controller/processor 34 may limit the processing to a border region around a portion or around the entire perimeter of each facing page. Both examples are shown in FIG. 4 .
- the OCR 36 and/or the controller/processor 34 may process the data for the border region around the entire perimeter of the facing page, as shown for the border region 50 A of the left facing page 24 A.
- the OCR 36 and/or the controller/processor 34 may process the OCR data for the border region around only a portion of the perimeter, as shown for border region 50 B of the right facing page 24 B.
- the difference between the border regions 50 A and 50 B is that the border region 50 B does not include a region along the binding (middle) of a book, i.e., between the two facing pages 24 A, 24 B, since page numbering is rarely located near the binding of the book 24 .
- the width of the border regions to be processed for determining the printed page numbers may be determined in any suitable manner.
- the width of the border region may be predetermined, e.g., set to 1.5′′ from the edges of the image frame or from the edges of each facing page.
- the width of the border region may be determined based on the dimensions of each facing page, e.g., as a percentage or other function of the width and/or height of each facing page.
- the width of the border region may be determined using an initially more computationally intensive and/or otherwise time consuming method for the first few pages of each book being scanned until an appropriate width is determined and optimized.
- a method may cause the controller/processor 34 to be a bottleneck in the imaging process, the bottleneck would only occur in the beginning of the imaging process for each book.
- the initial delay may be nonetheless beneficial in that the operator would be allowed more time to become accustomed to the characteristics specific to the particular book being scanned, e.g., thickness of the book, size of each page, resistance to page turning, page thickness and/or other characteristics.
- the optimized width of the border region would enable faster page numbering detection and faster error detection processing during the imaging of the remainder of the book.
- One example of an initially more computationally intensive and/or otherwise time consuming method is to perform OCR on the entire page of each of the first few pages of the book and process all the data from the OCR until a sufficient number of data points as to the areas of the page numbers are ascertained. Once the locations of the page numbers are ascertained, OCR needs to be performed only for the regions around those locations containing the page number. Thereafter, only a minimal amount of processing would be necessary for the OCR and the controller/processor to determine the page number on the each page.
- Another example of an initially more computationally intensive and/or otherwise time consuming method is to have the operator point to the page numbers on the first few pages of the book.
- one finger of the operator's left hand 54 A is pointing to the page number 52 A on the left facing page 24 A.
- the operator may wear a colored or other glove to facilitate the controller/processor in identifying the appropriate page number region.
- a finger of the operator's right hand 54 B may also point to the page number 52 B on the right facing page 24 B, either at the same time or shortly after pointing to the page number 52 A on the left facing page 24 A.
- the controller/processor may then determine the locations to which the operator is pointing and limit the page number processing region to a relatively small portion of each page (including a certain amount as a safety factor).
- any other suitable method may be employed for determining the width of the border regions to be processed. It is to be understood that in the two examples described above, the process need not be limited to nor performed on the very first page(s) of the book as page numbering may not begin until, for example, after the title page. Furthermore, in the case where the operator points to the page number, any other method of facilitating the controller/processor in identifying the appropriate page number region may be employed. For example, instead of wearing a glove, the operator may wear a sheath over the tip of the pointing finger.
- the operator may hold a special image target such as an annular ring 56 over or adjacent to the page number and/or shine a laser pointer or other light pointer (not shown), etc. on or near the page number to facilitate the controller/processor in identifying the appropriate page number region.
- a sensor 42 shown in FIG. 3 ) configured to sense the position to which the operator is pointing may be provided.
- the controller/processor is preferably configured to properly detect various configurations and/or formats of page numbers.
- the page number locations may be approximately the same on every page or may be at mirrored locations on opposing facing pages (as illustrated in FIG. 4 ).
- the page numbering format may change from one section of the book to another, such as the preface, table of contents, main content, and index sections.
- the book may contain one or more page numbering formats such as Arabic numbers, lower case roman numerals, capitalized roman numerals, chapter-section format (e.g., 1.A.a, 2.C-i, etc.) for different sections of the book.
- page numbers may be omitted on certain pages, such as pages with images and/or tables that occupy the entire page.
- an audio feedback mechanism using the speakers is preferably provided to signal errors (including faults and exceptions) to the operator.
- the audio feedback signal may be any suitable sound that is distinguishable from the music that may be played to help maintain the operator's page turning rate, referred to herein as the tempo music.
- the audio feedback signal may be played through or in parallel with the tempo music. For example, a single or multiple beeps or chimes or any combination of signals may be played to signal to the operator that an error has occurred. Signals having different audio characteristics may represent different errors. Visual indicators of errors (such as an LCD display and/or LEDs) may also be provided.
- the controller/processor and the OCR may form one example of an error detection system by tracking the page number sequence of the pages imaged to detect page number sequence errors.
- the error detection system may detect when the operator accidentally turns multiple pages at a time when the page numbers are out of sequence (e.g., pages skipped).
- the error detection system may also throw an exception when it fails to detect page numbers for a maximum or threshold number of pages, e.g., 4 pages.
- a threshold greater than 1 is preferred as there often are certain pages in a book that omit page numbering, such as pages with images and/or tables that occupy the entire page.
- the system would not throw an exception if the system fails to detect a page number for up to the threshold number of pages and then detects a page number on the next page that is equal to what the system is expecting.
- the system would throw an exception if the system fails to detect a page number for more than the threshold number of pages or if the system detects up to the threshold number of pages without a page number and then detects a page number on the next page that is not equal to what the system is expecting.
- the controller/processor and the sensor may form another example of an error detection system by detecting any intrusions into the image, such as the operator's hand or arm.
- the controller/processor may also determine whether the captured images containing the intrusion should be recaptured. For example, the controller/processor may determine the margins of the pages and whether the intrusions were limited to the margins.
- the controller/processor and the sensor may also detect when the light level becomes insufficient so as to notify the operator and pause the scanning process in order to allow the operator to resolve the fault such as by replacing a dimmed or burned out light bulb and/or readjusting the positions of the lights. Preferably, if the light level is decreasing rather than dropped off suddenly, the system notifies the operator in time so as to not require the operator to turn back insufficiently lit pages to be imaged again.
- the audio feedback may generate a number of signals representative of the number of pages of the book that the operator should turn back.
- the operator is signaled to go back and recapture a fixed number of pages (e.g., 10 pages).
- the error can then be automatically fixed based on the sequence of page numbers. Any other suitable way of indicating to the operator the number of pages that the operators needs to turn back can also be implemented.
- the error detection system preferably also tracks the error rate that is or may be attributable to the operator.
- the operator error rate may then be utilized for performance evaluations as well as to dynamically adjust both the tempo of the music being played using digital signal processing (DSP) and the imaging rate.
- DSP digital signal processing
- the music tempo may be increased gradually along with the imaging rate when the operator error rate is low, preferably only up to an upper limit that is at or less than the maximum rate at which the system may capture and process the images.
- the music tempo may be decreased along with the imaging rate when the operator error rate is high or is increasing over time. Decreasing the imaging rate to allow the operator more time between page turnings facilitates in decreasing the operator error rate. Adjusting the music tempo in response to the detected operator error rate helps to reduce operator errors, optimize and thus maximize the imaging rate, and thus increase the overall throughput of the image capturing system.
- FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary process 70 for utilizing audio to facilitate the scanning of images in a bound document.
- tempo music is played at a predetermined initial tempo.
- the predetermined initial tempo may be a standard one for all operators, e.g., 120 bpm, or may be selectively and/or periodically set on operator-by-operator basis, based on, for example, the relative experience levels of the operators and prior performance rates.
- a bound document such as a book, is positioned in the image capturing system, either automatically or manually by the operator into a cradle. Also at step 74 , initialization of the image capturing system may be performed.
- the operator may point to the locations of page numbers to initialize the image capturing system. It is noted that the system may be configured such that the user may choose to point to page numbers from any suitable location within the book rather than from the first pages of the book where page numbering may be absent. Alternatively, the determining of the general regions where the page numbers are located may be performed automatically by the image capturing system without operator intervention.
- the operator turns a page of the book and at step 78 , the camera or cameras capture images of the facing pages of the opening book.
- data from the captured images is stored into memory.
- Optical character recognition (OCR) is performed on at least a portion of image data at step 82 .
- OCR optical character recognition
- results of the OCR may be used to detect the page numbering in order to track page number sequence and perform error detection.
- the locations of the detected page numbers may be used to fine tune subsequent OCR steps 82 by limiting the portion of image data on which OCR is performed.
- the error detection may also include using data from a sensor to detect intrusions into the image frame, to detect insufficient lighting cast on the pages of the bound volume, etc.
- step 90 the process proceeds to step 90 .
- the system determines that there is an error at decision block 86 .
- the process proceeds to step 88 in which the system (i) signals (e.g., an audio signal) the error to the operator so that the operator may correct the error as necessary, (ii) adjusts the tempo of the music being played and/or (iii) signals to the operator the number of pages that needs to be recaptured so that the operator may turn back the appropriate number of pages.
- the operator is signaled to go back and recapture a fixed number of pages (e.g., 10 pages) and the error can then be automatically fixed using the sequence of page numbers.
- the process then proceeds to step 90 .
- step 90 the system determines whether the last page of the book has been reached. If not, the process returns to step 76 in which the operator turns to the next page of the book. If the last page of the book has been reached, then the process returns to step 74 in which the operator positions the next book in the image capturing system and the image capturing system may be initialized for this next book.
- audio may be used in a variety of ways to facilitate the scanning of images in a bound document.
- the controller may adjust the tempo of the music based on the image capture rate.
- the tempo of the music is used to help control the speed at which the operator manually turns the pages.
- error detection may be implemented using OCR to determine page numbers to track page sequence and/or a sensor to detect other errors such as object intrusion in the image and insufficient light cast on the pages of the bound volume.
- the operator may be alerted of an error with audio signals and may be signaled to turn back a certain number of pages to be recaptured.
- the tempo can be adjusted in response to the detected operator error rate to help reduce operator errors and thus increase the overall throughput of the image capturing system.
