Person, recipient, timestamp and message subject) extract message signale part.From the example of the message signale that message content extracts
Including: identify whether content comprises the signal of the one or more words expressing importance, identifies whether content comprises the aobvious of user
Show the signal of title.
In certain embodiments, when the message by being received generates importance score value, from including that at least one is in the early time
The linguistic context of the message (being also referred to as current message herein) received in the thread of message extracts message signale.From at thread
The example of the message signale that the linguistic context of interior message is extracted includes: whether instruction thread is by Client-initiated signal, identification message
Be whether the first message in thread signal, identify user the most replied the signal of the message in thread and one or
Multiple time correlation signals, such as identify the message in the early time (that is, the message received before current message) in thread the most still
It is so user of unread and/user has and reads the message in the early time in thread first or make the message in the early time in thread
The signal of response.
In certain embodiments, the message signale extracted includes the message signale that (516) multiple word is relevant.Word phase
The message signale closed is corresponding to the existence in the message of important word or quantity, and the most important word includes that being confirmed as instruction disappears
The word of breath importance.The example of important word includes: " important ", " please read ", " promptly ", " needing action ", " secret ",
" remind " and the title of relative users.Some important words are applied to multiple user, and some important words are only applied to
Specific user.In certain embodiments, to the important word (example of (such as, source body and/or message subject in) in message
Such as, the word found in one or more important word list) quantity count.In certain embodiments, in message
The counting of important word include the weight in the theme of other message in the theme of the first message in dialogue rather than dialogue
Want word, to avoid identical word is carried out repeat count.Alternatively, the message signale extracted includes multiple signal, and it is every
The particular count of one important word corresponded in received message or count range.Such as, the message signale extracted
May include that an important word；2 important words；3 to 4 important words；5 or more important words；And message master
One or more important word in topic.Alternatively, periodically or constantly, based on the message received recently or based on from last

Newly.
In certain embodiments, the message signale extracted includes the message signale that (518) multiple socialgram is relevant.Social
The example of the message signale that figure is relevant includes: identify user read the percentage of the message of the sender from message signal,
Identify that user reads the signal of percentage of the message of at least one, the knowledge having in the recipient identical with the message received
It is not sent to the signal of the percentage of the message read of the total message of identical recipient group, identifies sending out of message
Whether the person of sending has the signal of the corresponding socialgram weight being associated with user, identifies the signal of the socialgram weight of sender.
Socialgram weight is described above with reference to Fig. 3 B.
In certain embodiments, the message signale extracted includes (514) first many message signales；Alternatively, first
Each in multiple message signales have the overall situation importance forecast model and user's importance forecast model in right
Answer weights of importance.For the corresponding message signal in more than first message signale, it is in overall situation importance forecast model
First (overall) weight is the baseline value of the weights of importance of message signale, and its in user's importance forecast model second
(user) weight represents that user model deviates the degree of world model, in other words, between user model and world model
Difference.Such as, the corresponding message signal in more than first message signale have the overall situation importance forecast model in equal to 0.5
The first weight and in user's importance forecast model equal to-0.2 the second weight, wherein about this corresponding message signal
Difference between world model and user model is quantitatively represented as-0.2.
In certain embodiments, more than first message signale includes (519) one or more combined message signal, wherein group
Close message signale and include the combination of two or more other message signales.In certain embodiments, logical function (example is used
As, AND(with), OR(or), XOR(XOR) ...) be combined to generate combination to two or more message signales
Message signale.Combined message signal by being generated generates weight, and uses described weight to assist in message severities.
Such as, server extracts the first message signale " this message from very important people (VIP): true or false ", and second disappears
Information signal " this message is sent by automated system: true or false ".Logic AND function can be used these two message signale groups
Synthesize a combined message signal；Such as, only as " message is sent by VIP " AND, " message is not by Department of Automation for combined message signal
System sends " time be just determined as very.Advantageously, at combined message signal (such as, by using machine learning) by really
It is set in the case of there is the message severities predictive power bigger than the composition message signale of isolated combination, uses combined message
Signal.
In certain embodiments, each message signale during server system 106 is more than first message signale generates
(520) weights of importance.For corresponding message signal (522), server system 106 uses first (overall) importance to predict mould
Type determines (524) first weights for this corresponding message signal.Server also uses second (user) importance forecast model
(526) second weights are determined for this corresponding message signal.

The operation 522 to 534 of the property wanted weight.In certain embodiments, when determining that (538) have been each in more than first message signale
When message signale generates weights of importance, server system 106 importance generated based on more than first message signale
Weight is that message determines (552) importance score value.In certain embodiments, by by each in more than first message signale
The weights of importance of message signale is added together to determine the importance score value of message.
In certain embodiments, the message signale extracted farther includes (540) second many message signales.At some
In embodiment, each in more than second message signale have only user's importance forecast model rather than the overall situation importance pre-
Survey the corresponding weights of importance in model.In these embodiments, each during server is more than second message signale disappears
Information signal generates (542) weights of importance.For corresponding message signal (544), server system 106 uses second (user) weight
The property wanted forecast model rather than for this corresponding message signal, first (overall) importance forecast model determines that (546) importance is weighed
Weight.Repeat these operations, think that each the corresponding message signal in more than second message signale determines weights of importance
(548).
When determining that (550) have been that each message signale in more than first and second message signale generates weights of importance
Time, server system 106 weights of importance generated based on more than first and second message signales determines for message
(554) importance score value.In certain embodiments, by by each message signale in more than first and second message signales
Weights of importance be added together to determine the importance score value of message.In certain embodiments, server makes in aforementioned manners
Determine importance score value for this message and other message multiple, be then based on its importance score value, to this message and multiple its
He is ranked up message.

The setting put (such as, Fig. 8 C, arrange 834), perform this and selectivity of new mail notice is presented.New by optionally presenting
Mail notification, client device need not be important (such as, according to one or more importance prediction mould for being not yet labeled as
Type or according to other predefined priority criteria, is labeled as important by server system) the notice of message interrupt user.
Above with reference to as described in Fig. 8 F, in certain embodiments, selection to new mail notice based on every account
Property presents and configures.These embodiments are applicable to relative client equipment with multiple e-mail addresses (such as, at server
Multiple user accounts in system 106) it is associated, and be the message sink message letter being addressed to the plurality of e-mail address
Breath.In one example, client device includes arranging, including the most important for the email configuration of first user account
Message (new/unread priority messages) provide the notice of new mail notice to arrange, and the electronics postal for the second user account
Part configuration is arranged, and arranges including the notice providing new mail notice for all new informations.In this example, when with client device
When the first and second user account both of which being associated have new information, the information received from server system includes the
The information (920) of the information of the first message of one user account and the second message of the second user account.Client
Equipment is that the second message presents new mail notice (922)；Conditionally, one or more reading preferentially is included according to the first message
The determination of message, is that the first message presents new mail notice (924)；And conditionally, do not include any according to the first message
The determination of unread priority messages, abandons being that the first message presents new mail notice (926).
More generally, the information received from server system can include being addressed to multiple e-mail address
The information of message, each e-mail address is corresponding to different user accounts.When the information received represents
Message set include having and provide new mail notice not consider the user account that the notice of message severities is arranged for new information
At least one new information time, client device presents new mail notice (922).Represent additionally, work as received information
Message set include having at least one of user account that only unread priority messages provides the notice of new mail notice to arrange
During unread priority messages (such as, be labeled as the message of " important "), client device presents new mail notice (924).Cause
This, selectivity to new mail notice can present and configure based on every account；It can be an e-mail address
Optionally present new mail notice, and can be that another e-mail address presents new mail notice, regardless of newly disappearing
Whether breath includes prioritized messages.
In certain embodiments, the information from server system includes the disappearing of the first message of first user account
The information (928) of the second message of breath information and the second user account.Client device is that the first account determines that first leads to
Know setting (930).Conditionally, arrange according to the first notice and there is the determination of the first value, only when the first message include one or
During multiple unread priority messages, client device is just that the first message presents new mail notice (932)；And conditionally, root
Arrange the determination with the second value according to the first notice, client device is that the first message presents new mail notice (934).Client
Equipment is that the second account determines that the second notice arranges (936).Conditionally, there is the first value really according to the second notice setting
Fixed, only when the second message includes one or more unread priority messages, client device is just that the second message presents new mail
Notice (938)；And conditionally, the determination with the second value is set according to the second notice, client device is the second message
Present new mail notice.As it has been described above, client device can receive is addressed to different e-mail address (user account)
Message, and whether be only new prioritized messages to present new mail notice can be the configurable setting of every account.In client
The first account on equipment and each in the second account have notice and arrange, and include whether that only new prioritized messages shows newly
The setting of mail notification (such as, Fig. 8 C, arrange 834).For proper account, if this setting has the first value and (such as, arranges
834 are activated), the newest prioritized messages presents the new mail notice of this proper account.If this setting has the second value (example
As, arrange 834 disabled), then present the new mail notice of this proper account for new information, whether include excellent regardless of new information
First message.
In certain embodiments, arranging according to priority synchronization, the information received from server system only includes representing
The information (942) of prioritized messages.In these embodiments, client device includes and preferential and non-with server system
Prioritized messages synchronizes relevant priority synchronization and arranges (such as, Fig. 8 E, arrange 850).When priority synchronization arranges and has the first value,
Client device prioritized messages the most synchronize with server system, and when priority synchronization arranges and has the second value, client sets
For making message synchronization, regardless of preferential or importance.In other words, it is configured to only synchronize prioritized messages when priority synchronization is arranged
Time, the information received from server system only includes that the information representing prioritized messages (that is, represents non-preferential message
Information is not included in from the information that server system receives).Such as, it is activated if arranging 850, then works as visitor
When family end equipment 102-c and server system 106 automatic synchronization, client device 102-c receives preferentially from server system 106
The information of message, and do not receive the information of non-preferential message.If arranging 850 disabled, then client device
102-c receives information and the information of non-preferential message of prioritized messages when automatic synchronization from server system 106.
The selectivity of message synchronizes to decrease the power consumption of client device, and decreases transmission bandwidth use (i.e.,
Decrease the communication between client device and server system).When client device is arranged to selective synchronization (pin
To all user accounts or relative users account) time, the non-preferential message in relative users account still at server system,
They can be downloaded from this server system in the time after a while or by different client devices.
In certain embodiments, the information from server system includes the disappearing of the first message of first user account
The information (944) of the second message of breath information and the second user account.Client device is that the first account determines that first is same
Step arranges (946).Conditionally, synchronizing setting according to first and have the determination of the first value, client device is about first user
Account is only that first message (if any) of unread priority messages receives information (948)；And conditionally, root
Synchronizing setting according to first and have the determination of the second value, client device receives the information (950) of the first message, and does not considers
Whether the first message is prioritized messages.Client device is that the second account determines that the second synchronization arranges (952).Conditionally, root
Synchronizing setting according to second and have the determination of the first value, client device is only unread priority messages about the second user account
Second message (if any) receives information (954)；And conditionally, synchronize setting according to second and there is the second value
Determination, client device receives the information (956) of the second message, and does not consider whether the second message is prioritized messages.
As arranged above with reference to the notice described in operation 928-940, can often account configure synchronizing setting.
Such as, for the first account, respective synchronization can be set and arrange so that allow message synchronization regardless of importance；And for
Two accounts, can arrange respective synchronization and arrange so that (during automatic synchronization operates, it is also referred to as automatic synchronization herein
(auto-syncs) or automatic synchronization (auto-sync) operation) allow prioritized messages synchronize, and do not allow non-preferential message synchronization.With
The example that step is arranged is to arrange 850 in Fig. 8 E.Can often account configure arranging 850, in this case, each
User account has different synchronizations and arranges 850.For proper account, it is activated if synchronizing to arrange 850, then sets when client
During the message of standby this proper account of automatic synchronization, make prioritized messages synchronize, and do not make non-preferential message synchronization.If for this phase
Answer account, synchronize to arrange 850 disabled, then when the message of client device this proper account of automatic synchronization, for this corresponding account
Family synchronization message, and do not consider importance.
In certain embodiments, according to predefined user command, client device display expression only meets predefined
The information (958) of the message of importance criteria.According to user command, client device can show excellent on screen
First message, and do not show non-preferential message.Such as, when user activates the message transmission application on client device, message
The default view of transmission application can be predefined preferential inbox user interface (such as, Fig. 8 B, interface 810), Qi Zhongxian
Show prioritized messages, but do not show non-preferential message.As another example, (such as, logical according to predefined user command
Cross user and select to switch to view the operable hint of preferential inbox user interface, in this case, predefined use
Family order is the order showing preferential inbox user interface), message transmission application can be from display prioritized messages and non-preferential
The changing interface of both message becomes preferential inbox user interface.
In certain embodiments, client device, in the locally stored message (960) received from server system, updates institute
The state (962) of message of storage, and according to user command, display represent meet predefined importance criteria
The information (964) of locally stored message.When client device (such as, in simultaneously operating) receives from server system
During message, the message received is stored at client device (such as, in Fig. 4, message database 420).When with clothes
Handle identical message at another client device of business device system communication and (such as, reply or forward message, by " important " label
Or any other label is applied to message etc.) time, manipulation the state of the message produced is changed and sets from this another client
The standby server system that is synchronized to, and be synchronized to message from server system and be stored in client device therein.Use state
Change and the message stored is updated.The excellent of non-preferential message is not shown when client device display display prioritized messages
During first inbox user interface, show in this preferential inbox user interface at locally stored prioritized messages, if having
Words.Above with reference to as described in step 958, in response to predefined user command, (such as, user selects to switch to preferential addressee
The operable hint of case user interface or the transmission application of user's activate message, wherein preferential inbox user interface is arranged to
Default view) and show preferential inbox user interface.
In certain embodiments, according to checking the user command of non-preferential message, client device shows and is unsatisfactory for making a reservation for
Importance criteria one or more in locally stored message (966) of justice.Client device shows predefined user
Interface, it shows non-preferential message, displays that or do not show that prioritized messages is (such as, similar to the user interface shown in Fig. 6 B
Interface, wherein include non-preferential message in 644 times shown message of " Everything Else " title).Promote client
Equipment shows that the example of the user command at the interface with non-preferential message is when user selects from preferential inbox user interface
Switch to the user command generated during the operable hint including the user interface of non-preferential message.
Figure 10 is according to some embodiments, for presenting the flow chart of another process 1000 of new mail notice.Can
To perform process 1000 at client device (such as, Client mobile devices 102-c) place.Although it should be appreciated that reference
Message semantic definition process 1000, but, process 1000 is also similarly applicable for dialogue.
Client device receives information from server system, and this information represents message set (1002).Client

Breath includes representing the information of one or more message.
Client device is responded (1004) by the following reception to information: when performed by client device
When foreground application is not predefined messages application (1006), include one or more unread priority messages really according to message set
Fixed, wherein prioritized messages includes the message meeting predefined importance criteria, and client device presents new mail notice
(1008).Do not include the determination of any unread priority messages according to message set, client device is abandoned presenting new mail notice
(1010).When client device receives information, depend on whether the application run in foreground is predefined message
Transmission application (such as, Fig. 8 B, message transmission application interface 810) and message whether include unread priority messages, its display
Or do not show new mail notice.If message transmission application not in foreground (such as, message transmission application just running background,
Or message transmission application be not activated) and message include one or more unread priority messages, then show new mail notice (example
As, notify 804 shown in Fig. 8 A).If not in foreground, (such as, message transmission application is just on backstage in message transmission application
Run or message transmission application be not activated) and message do not include one or more unread priority messages, the most do not show new stamp
Part notifies.
When the foreground application performed by client device is predefined messages application, then client device is abandoned presenting
New mail notice (1012).If message transmission is applied in foreground, the most not showing new mail notice, no matter whether message includes
Do not read preferential or non-preferential message.In certain embodiments, client device refresh message transmission application shown
Interface, to show unread message, replaces display new mail notice.
In certain embodiments, when the foreground application performed by client device is predefined messages application, client
End equipment presents a part for the information that received consistent with the currently displaying view of predefined messages application, if
If having (1014).In certain embodiments, it is preferential inbox view when the currently displaying view of predefined messages application
Time, (such as, client device presents information by any unread priority messages being included in received information
Messaging list or conversations list) (1016).In one example, preferential inbox view (such as, Fig. 8 B, user interface 810)
Display prioritized messages list (or including the conversations list of prioritized messages), and get rid of non-preferential message.
In certain embodiments, message transmission application includes the other view for showing message or user interface.Such as,
Messages application typically comprises the inbox view (example that display includes the messaging list of prioritized messages and non-preferential message
As, the user interface similar to shown in Fig. 6 B).In another example, message transmission application includes for showing new
Or unread message list (or including at least one new or conversations list of unread message), regard regardless of preferential unread message
Figure；The eliminating of this view has been read message (being typically defined as the message being marked as having read) or has got rid of the most all message
The most read the dialogue of (that is, being marked as reading).In still another example, message transmission application includes being different from aforementioned
The prioritized messages List View of preferential inbox view.In prioritized messages List View (such as, in Fig. 8 B), display bag
