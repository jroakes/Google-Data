Definitions
- the present disclosure relates generally to accessibility platforms, and more particularly, to crowdsourcing data for geographic information systems using an accessibility platform.
- Geographic information systems provide for the archiving, retrieving, and manipulating of data that has been stored and indexed according to geographic coordinates of its elements.
- a geographic information system generally includes a variety of data types, including imagery, maps, tables, vector data (e.g. vector representations of roads, parcels, buildings, etc.), three-dimensional models, and other data. Improvements in computer processing power and broadband technology have led to the development of interactive geographic information systems that allow for the navigating and displaying of geographic imagery, such as map imagery, satellite imagery, aerial imagery, panoramic imagery, three-dimensional models, and other geographic imagery. Users can use a geographic information system to search for, view, receive travel directions to, and otherwise navigate a particular geographic area of interest. Geographic information systems are preferably updated periodically with new information (e.g. new images, new three-dimensional models, new data, etc.) so that the geographic information system can provide a current and accurate representation of the world.
- new information e.g. new images, new three-dimensional models, new data, etc.
- Accessibility platforms can allow a vision impaired user to obtain information about a scene. For instance, a user can capture an image of the scene and can submit the image to the accessibility platform. Content depicted in the scene (e.g. text, landmarks, objects, etc.) can be identified. The content can be converted to an audio format. The content in audio format can then be read back or otherwise provided to the user so that the vision-impaired user can gain information about the scene.
- Content depicted in the scene e.g. text, landmarks, objects, etc.
- the content in audio format can then be read back or otherwise provided to the user so that the vision-impaired user can gain information about the scene.
- One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method of crowdsourcing data for a geographic information system.
- the method includes receiving, by one or more computing devices, a request associated with an image captured of a geographic area. Responsive to the request, the method can include analyzing, by the one or more computing devices, the image to identify content associated with the image. The method can further include generating, by the one or more computing devices, an audio representation of the content and outputting, by the one or more computing devices, an audio representation of the content. The method can further include updating, by the one or more computing devices, the geographic information system based at least in part on the image captured of the geographic area.

- The present disclosure relates generally to accessibility platforms, and more particularly, to crowdsourcing data for geographic information systems using an accessibility platform.
- Geographic information systems provide for the archiving, retrieving, and manipulating of data that has been stored and indexed according to geographic coordinates of its elements. A geographic information system generally includes a variety of data types, including imagery, maps, tables, vector data (e.g. vector representations of roads, parcels, buildings, etc.), three-dimensional models, and other data. Improvements in computer processing power and broadband technology have led to the development of interactive geographic information systems that allow for the navigating and displaying of geographic imagery, such as map imagery, satellite imagery, aerial imagery, panoramic imagery, three-dimensional models, and other geographic imagery. Users can use a geographic information system to search for, view, receive travel directions to, and otherwise navigate a particular geographic area of interest. Geographic information systems are preferably updated periodically with new information (e.g. new images, new three-dimensional models, new data, etc.) so that the geographic information system can provide a current and accurate representation of the world.
- Accessibility platforms can allow a vision impaired user to obtain information about a scene. For instance, a user can capture an image of the scene and can submit the image to the accessibility platform. Content depicted in the scene (e.g. text, landmarks, objects, etc.) can be identified. The content can be converted to an audio format. The content in audio format can then be read back or otherwise provided to the user so that the vision-impaired user can gain information about the scene.
- Aspects and advantages of embodiments of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be learned from the description, or may be learned through practice of the embodiments.
- One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computer-implemented method of crowdsourcing data for a geographic information system. The method includes receiving, by one or more computing devices, a request associated with an image captured of a geographic area. Responsive to the request, the method can include analyzing, by the one or more computing devices, the image to identify content associated with the image. The method can further include generating, by the one or more computing devices, an audio representation of the content and outputting, by the one or more computing devices, an audio representation of the content. The method can further include updating, by the one or more computing devices, the geographic information system based at least in part on the image captured of the geographic area.
- Other aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems, apparatus, tangible, non-transitory computer-readable media, user interfaces and devices for crowdsourcing information for a geographic information system.

In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that aspects of the present disclosure cover such modifications and variations.
- Generally, example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems and methods for crowdsourcing geographic imagery data and other information for use in a geographic information system. Geographic information systems can endeavor to provide an increasingly accurate and current representation of the world. Given the massive volume of information available in certain geographic information systems, it can be costly and time consuming to gather images and other information for keeping the geographic information system current. User generated content, such as photographs of geographic areas captured by a user, can be particularly useful in enhancing the information stored and indexed in a geographic information system.
- According to example aspects of the present disclosure, geographic images and other useful information can be crowdsourced from users via an accessibility platform. More particularly, an application implemented on a user device (e.g. a smartphone) can allow a vision-impaired person to capture an image of a scene and to get information back in audio format spoken to the vision-impaired person in close to real time. Unlike a typical accessibility platform, the image and other information generated by the user is not discarded. Rather, the information is used to update the geographic information system. As a result, a two-way data exchange is established between the user and the system.
- More specifically, a user can capture an image of a scene using an image capture device and can send the image as part of a request to an accessibility platform for content associated with the captured image. The accessibility platform can analyze the image to identify content associated with the image. The content can include textual data depicted in the image and/or can include information associated with one or more points of interest identified in the image. Once the content has been identified, the accessibility platform can generate an audio representation of the content. The audio representation can be provided to the user device where the audio representation of the content can be read to the user.
- The image captured of the scene sent as part of a request to the accessibility platform can be used to update a geographic information system. For instance, the image can be used to construct at least a part of an interactive representation (e.g. an interactive three-dimensional model, an interactive panorama, etc.) of a geographic area in the geographic information system. Alternatively and/or in addition, the identified content associated with the geographic image can be used to enhance the data associated with the geographic information system. For instance, content associated with one or more points of interest depicted in the image can be used to enrich data associated with the one or more points of interest in the geographic information system.
- As an example, a vision impaired person can capture with a smartphone an image associated with a geographic area, such as an image of a storefront from a perspective at or near ground level. The image can be associated with geographic coordinates determined, for instance, by a positioning system associated with the smartphone. The image and associated geographic coordinates can be provided to the accessibility platform over a network. The accessibility platform can analyze the image to identify text in the image, such as text on signage associated with the storefront. The identified text can be converted to audio format and provided to the smartphone as an audio file. The smartphone can then play the audio file for the user so that the user can receive information about the geographic area depicted in the image, namely the content of the text on the signage associated with the storefront.
- The image, identified text, and/or the associated geographic position can be used to update the geographic information system. For instance, the image can be used to update an interactive panorama depicting the storefront. The text identified in the image can be associated with the storefront in the geographic information system. The geographic position associated with the image can be used to update and/or verify geographic positions of points of interest in the geographic information system.
- The information used to update the geographic information system can also be used by the accessibility platform to enhance the functionality and response time of the accessibility platform. For example, the identified text in the image can be associated with particular geographic coordinates in a geographic information system and accessed by the accessibility platform for use in identifying text in future requests. In this way, the two-way data exchange between the accessibility platform and the user provided by example aspects the present disclosure not only enhances the information associated with the geographic information system, but also the user experience with the accessibility platform.

FIG. 1 depicts an overview of anexample system 100 for crowdsourcing information for a geographic information system according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Thesystem 100 can include anaccessibility platform 110. Theaccessibility platform 110 can be any program, system, or service that allows auser 102, such as a vision-impaired user, to obtain information associated with a scene or object. Theaccessibility platform 110 can be implemented or hosted by any suitable computing device, such as a web server. - The
user 102 can interact with theaccessibility platform 110 and other components of thesystem 100 with auser device 120. Theuser device 120 can be any suitable computing device, such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, wearable computing device, display with one or more processors, or other computing device. Theuser device 120 can be in communication with the other components of thesystem 100 over a network (e.g. the Internet). Theuser device 120 can include adisplay 122 and/or other suitable input/output devices (e.g. microphone for voice recognition, speakers, etc.) to allow a user to interact with theuser device 120. Theuser device 120 can include one or moreimage capture devices 125, such as a digital camera. - The
user 102 can request information from theaccessibility platform 110 by first capturing animage 130 of a scene or other object. Theimage 130 of the scene or other object can be captured, for instance, using theimage capture device 125 of theuser device 120 in response to suitable voice commands or other user commands. Theimage 130 can depict various objects and/or features, such as roads, buildings, monuments, businesses, store fronts, signage, textual data (e.g. a menu), and/or other information. Theimage 130 can have metadata indicating the geographic location of the image. The metadata can be manually provided by a user or determined, for instance, using a positioning system. - The
user 102 can send a request to theaccessibility platform 110 for content associated with theimage 130. In response to the request, theaccessibility platform 110 can implement animage analysis module 115. Theimage analysis module 115 can be configured to analyze the image to identify content. For instance, theimage analysis module 115 can identify text presented in the image using text recognition techniques. In addition and/or in the alternative, features can be identified in the image using feature recognition techniques. Content associated with the features can then be accessed using, for instance a search application. In particular embodiments, the content associated with the features can be identified from data stored or indexed in ageographic information system 200. - Once content associated with the
image 130 has been identified, theaccessibility platform 110 can convert the content to audio format. For instance, theaccessibility platform 110 can convert textual information into an audio file using text-to-speech conversion techniques. Theaccessibility platform 115 can then provide theaudio content 128 to theuser device 120 where the user device can play theaudio content 128 for theuser 102. - In exchange for receiving information associated with the
image 130, theuser 102 can provide consent for use of theimage 130 and any associated metadata (e.g. geographic position information) by thesystem 100, for instance, to update ageographic information system 200. In situations in which the systems and methods discussed herein access and analyze personal information about users, or make use of personal information, such as user generated images and associated metadata, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect the information and control whether and/or how to receive content from the system or other application. No such information or data is collected or used until the user has been provided meaningful notice of what information is to be collected and how the information is used. The information is not collected or used unless the user provides consent, which can be revoked or modified by the user at any time. Thus, the user can have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the application or system. In addition, certain information or data can be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user. - The
geographic information system 200 can provide for the archiving, retrieving, and manipulation of geospatial data that has been indexed and stored according to geographic coordinates, such as latitude, longitude, and altitude coordinates, associated with the geospatial data. Thegeographic information system 200 can combine satellite imagery, aerial imagery, panoramic imagery, street level imagery, photographs, maps, three-dimensional models, vector data and other geographic data, and search capability so as to enable a user to view imagery of a geographic area and related geographic information (e.g., locales such as islands and cities; and points of interest such as local restaurants, hospitals, parks, hotels, and schools). Thesystem 200 can further allow the user to conduct local searches and to get travel directions to a location or between two or more locations. Results can be displayed in a two-dimensional (2D), two-and-half dimensional (2.5D), or three-dimensional (3D) representation of the area of interest. The user can pan, tilt, zoom, and rotate the view to navigate a representation of the area of interest or the view can provide an animated tour around the area of interest. - The
geographic information system 200 can include or can be in communication with one ormore databases 210. The one ormore databases 210 can store geospatial data to be served or provided in response to requests for information provided to thegeographic information system 200. The one ormore databases 210 can include image data (e.g. digital maps, satellite images, aerial photographs, street level imagery, etc.), non-image data such as tabular data (e.g. digital yellow and white pages), map layer data (e.g. databases of diners, restaurants, museums, and/or schools; databases of seismic activity; database of national monuments; etc.) and other information. - According to example aspects of the present disclosure, the data in the one or
more databases 210 can be updated based at least in part theimage 130 submitted to theaccessibility platform 110. For example, theimage 130 can be used to construct or improve interactive three-dimensional models of a geographic area and/or interactive panoramic imagery or other imagery of the geographic area. In addition, content associated with the image identified by theaccessibility platform 110 can also be used enrich data associated withgeographic information system 200. For instance, content associated with one or more points of interest depicted in the image can be used to add or enhance data associated with points of interest in the geographic information system. In one example implementation of the present disclosure, theaudio content 128 generated by theaccessibility platform 110 can be associated with a point of interest in thegeographic information system 200 so thatgeographic information system 200 can provide information in audio format. -
FIG. 2 depicts an example method (300) for crowdsourcing data for a geographic information system according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. The method (300) can be implemented by one or more computing devices, such as one or more of the computing device depicted inFIG. 5 . In addition,FIG. 2 depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion. Those of ordinary skill in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will understand that the various steps of any of the methods disclosed herein can be modified, adapted, rearranged, omitted, or expanded in various ways without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. - At (302), the method includes receiving a request for content associated with an image of a geographic area. For instance, the
accessibility platform 110 ofFIG. 1 can receive a request from auser device 110 for content associated with animage 130 captured by theuser device 110. The request for content can be provided in any suitable format. For instance, the request can include the image and any associated metadata, such as geographic location information associated with image. The image can depict one or more features or objects. The features can include, for example, text data, buildings, streets, roads, monuments, or other suitable features. -
FIG. 3 depicts oneexample image 400 that can be received as part of a request for content provided to an accessibility platform. Theimage 400 can be captured by a suitable image capture device, such as an integrated digital camera on a smartphone or wearable computing device. As shown, theimage 400 depicts at least a portion of a geographic area. Various features can be depicted in theimage 400. These features can includetext content 410,street 415, point ofinterest 420, and other features. - The request can seek audio content associated with one or more features depicted in the image. For instance, the request can seek an audio representation of any text depicted in the image. Alternatively and/or in addition, the request can seek information associated with one or more features depicted in the image, such as the names of businesses depicted in the image, an address of a building depicted in the image, information associated with a point of interest depicted in the image, a menu of a restaurant depicted in the image, a street name of a street depicted in the image, a phone number and store hours of a business depicted in the image, etc.
- Referring back to
FIG. 2 at (304), the method can include analyzing the image to identify content associated with the image. For instance, theimage analysis module 115 ofFIG. 1 can analyzeimage 130 received by theaccessibility platform 110 to identify content associated with theimage 130. The identified content can include text content depicted in the image and/or can include information associated with one or more features or objects depicted in the image. - More particularly, in one example implementation of the present disclosure, the image is analyzed to identify text content in the image. For example, image analysis techniques can be performed on the
image 400 ofFIG. 3 to identifytext content 410. Text content can be identified from the image using any suitable text recognition technique, such as optical character recognition techniques or optical word recognition techniques. The text recognition techniques can include identifying patterns in the image and matching those patterns to characters or text. - In another example implementation of the present disclosure, the image can be analyzed to identify content associated with one or more features or objects depicted in the image. The information can be identified, for example, using a visual search application that is configured to analyze the image to identify various features or points of interest and to search for content (e.g. online content or content in a geographic information system) associated with the features or points of interest.
- Referring to the
example image 400 ofFIG. 3 , feature identification techniques can be used to identify point ofinterest 420 in theimage 400. Information relating to point ofinterest 420 can then be obtained, for instance, using a search engine or by accessing information associated with the point of interest stored in a geographic information system. The information relating to the point ofinterest 420 can be extracted as content associated with the image. -
FIG. 4 depicts a flow diagram of an example method (500) for identifying content associated with one or more features depicted in an image according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure.FIG. 4 illustrates one example technique for identifying content associated with an image. Those of ordinary skill in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will understand that other suitable techniques can be used to identify content without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. - At (502), one or more dominant features depicted in the image can be identified. The dominant features can be portions of the image identified using feature detection techniques. Feature detection techniques search the image for locations that are distinctive. Any suitable technique can be used for feature detection. For example, image processing techniques can analyze image gradients to identify distinctive features in each of the plurality of images. Referring to the
example image 400 ofFIG. 3 , points 422 can be identified as dominant features in theimage 400. - At (504) of
FIG. 4 , the identified dominant features can be matched against one or more previously geolocated images stored, for instance, in a geographic information system or database of information. For instance, points 422 ofFIG. 3 can be matched with corresponding features in previously geolocated imagery of the geographic area. The dominant features can be matched using suitable feature matching techniques. Feature matching techniques compare the detected features in the images to determine groups of features that correspond to some fixed point in the scene depicted by the captured images. The features can be matched, for instance, based on appearance or based on feature similarity. In one particular implementation, a rudimentary clustering of the data points into point clusters can be performed to facilitate matching of the features. In particular implementations, metadata providing position information associated with the image can be used as part of the feature matching process. For instance, the position information can be used to narrow a search window for matched features in previously geolocated imagery. - At (506) of
FIG. 4 , one or more points of interest associated with the matched features can be identified. For instance, the matched features in the previously geolocated imagery can be associated with one or more points of interest in a database. The database can be accessed to match the features with the associated points of interest. For example, points 422 ofFIG. 3 can be associated with building 420 in the geographic information system. Building 420 can be identified as a point of interest associated with thepoints 422 depicted in theimage 400. - Information associated with the point of interest can then be accessed or obtained as shown at (508) of
FIG. 4 . For example a search engine can locate information available online associated with point of interest. Alternatively and/or in addition, information associated with the known landmark or point of interest can be extracted from the geographic information system or other database of information. - Referring back to
FIG. 2 , once the content associated with the image has been identified, the method can include generating an audio representation of the content as shown at (306). For example, text content can be converted to audio content using suitable text-to-speech conversion techniques. Similarly, content associated with one or more features depicted in the image can be converted to an audio format. Any suitable audio format can be used without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure, such as a digital audio format. At (308), the system can output the audio content, for instance, to the user. For instance, theaccessibility platform 110 ofFIG. 1 can provide the audio content to theuser device 120. Theuser device 120 can then play the audio content to theuser 102. - At (310) of
FIG. 2 , the method includes updating a geographic information system based at least in part on the image of the geographic area received as part of the request. The geographic information system can be updated based at least in part on the image in various ways. In one example aspect, the image can be used to construct or improve representations of the geographic area provided by the geographic information system. For instance, the image can be used to improve an interactive three-dimensional model of the geographic area. The image can be used to update interactive panoramas or other imagery of the geographic area. In addition, the image can be stored and indexed by geographic position in the geographic information system so that the image itself can be accessed by a user of the geographic information system. In this manner, the geographic information system can provide user generated content obtained using an accessibility platform. - Any content associated with the image can also be used to update the geographic information system. For instance, text content (e.g. signage, menus, etc.) identified by the accessibility platform can be associated with points of interest in the geographic information system. Users of the geographic information system can then access the text content by browsing or searching for information associated with the point of interest in the geographic information system.
- In a particular implementation, the audio content associated with the image generated by the accessibility platform can be used to enrich data associated with the geographic information system. More specifically, audio content associated with a point of interest or feature depicted in the image can be associated with the point of interest or feature in the geographic information system. A user can access then access the audio content when browsing or searching for information about the point of interest in the geographic information system.
- As demonstrated by the above examples, a geographic information system can be updated in various ways based at least in part on the image received as part of a request for content provided to an accessibility platform. The above examples are presented for purposes of illustration and discussion and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.
