- the skip advertisement link or control 410 is a link.
- the skip advertisement link or control 410 may be a button, selectable icon, or some other user-selectable user interface object.
- the ability of a user to skip advertisements may effect the selection of an advertisement to be presented by the advertisement provider 201 .
- a large number of skips for an advertisement may indicate that the advertisement is ineffective or unpopular, and thus can be made less likely to be selected for presentation (e.g., by decreasing its bid in a placement auction or being counted as a negative weighting factor in auctions or towards advertising impressions).
- advertisements that are infrequently skipped may have a positive weighting factor and or have a positive impact toward advertising impressions.
- FIG. 5 illustrates an example process 500 for selecting and delivering advertisements for presentation with a content item.
- the process 500 will be described in reference to a system (e.g., system 200 ) that performs the process.
- a system e.g., system 200
- process 500 will be described with reference to a video content item (e.g., a video stream or file), but it should be appreciated that process 500 is also applicable to other content items, such as audio content items, as well.
- a request for one or more advertisements is received ( 502 ).

- the advertising module 224 sends a request for advertisements to the advertisement provider 201 .
- the request can be for one or more advertisements for presentation with the video.
- the request can specify the type (e.g., computer, mobile phone, etc.) of the user device 205 that sent the request. For example, the request can specify that the user device is a desktop or notebook computer or a mobile phone.
- the request can include metadata associated with the video.
- the metadata can specify preferences on what and how advertisements are presented with the video.
- the preferences can be set by the author of the video, the author of the document in which the video is embedded, or content provider 203 (hereinafter referred to collectively as “content provider preferences”).
- the content provider preferences specify the available positions in which video advertisements can be presented.
- the metadata can specify that the video has two interstitial positions, a pre-roll position, and a post-roll position for advertisements, and that advertisements may be placed in any of these positions.
- the metadata can also include data that provides an indication of the content (e.g., the subject matter) of the video.
- the metadata can include one or more keywords that specify topics or concepts to which the video is relevant.
- the metadata can include one or more categories or verticals (hereinafter referred as “channels”) into which the video can be classified.
- the metadata can also include information referencing one or more playlists or playlist categories on which the content is placed or linked.
- the topical data or the channel data can be used by the advertisement provider 201 to identify advertisements that are relevant to the video. In some other implementations, the topical or channel information of the video can be determined by analyzing the video.
- the metadata can specify other types of content provider preferences as well.
- the metadata can specify whether video advertisements displayed with the video can be skipped or not.
- the metadata can also specify one or more target demographics for the video.
- the metadata can specify the time lengths of advertisement placement positions, the maximum allowable advertisement duration, and/or which types of advertisements (e.g., text ads, overlay ads, banner ads, pop-up ads, video ads, etc.) are allowed.
- the preferences in the metadata include blacklisted keywords or advertisers. An advertisement associated with a blacklisted keyword or advertiser is automatically disqualified from consideration for placement with the video.
- an advertiser in the blacklist is specified by a name and/or a URL associated with the advertiser.
- One or more candidate advertisements are identified ( 504 ).
- one or more advertisements from the advertisements repository 214 are identified by the ad selection module 204 to be candidates in an auction for placement with the video.
- the candidate advertisements are identified based on multiple criteria.
- a criterion for identification of candidate advertisements is advertiser preferences.
- an advertiser can set preferences related to the presentation and targeting of the advertisement.
- the preferences can include preferences related to presentation position (e.g., pre-roll, post-roll, interstitial), capability of being skipped by the user, target demographics, type of device, and so forth.
- the advertiser preferences are matched against the content provider preferences.
- the advertiser can specify a preference as to whether a video advertisement can be presented pre-roll, post-roll, or in an interstitial slot.
- the advertiser can specify a preference as to whether a user viewing a video advertisement can be given the capability to skip it.
- the advertiser can specify a preference as to the target demographics to which the advertisement may be shown.
- the advertiser can specify that the advertisement is best viewed on a desktop/notebook computer or a mobile phone. Other types of preferences are possible.
- the content provider preferences may include a maximum allowable time length per video ad. A video ad may be disqualified if its length is longer than the maximum time length. As another example, the content provider preferences may include restrictions on which types of ads are allowed. If the ad does not belong to one of the allowed types, the ad can be disqualified.
- an advertiser preference can be an absolute preference or a relative preference. If a preference is an absolute preference and it is not satisfied by the video, then the advertisement is disqualified from the auction, regardless of satisfaction of other preferences and relevance of the advertisement to the video or the document. If the preference is a relative preference and it is not completely satisfied, then the advertisement may still be eligible for the auction, subject to other criteria, but the incomplete satisfaction of the preference can be used to modify a bid associated with the advertisement in the auction.
- the advertiser preferences can specify a bid modifier for a preference, in case that preference is not satisfied completely.
- the preferences can include a channel to which the advertisement is targeted.
- An advertiser can target an advertisement to a particular channel. Examples of channels include “news videos” or “action movies.”
- an advertisement targeted to a channel is identified as a candidate advertisement for auctions for placement with videos in that channel.
- an advertisement targeted to a channel can be disregarded with respect to a particular video in the channel if other advertiser preferences for the advertisement are not satisfied by the video. For example, an advertisement can be disregarded if the advertiser specified that the advertisement be presented only as a pre-roll ad but a video only allows interstitial and post-roll advertisements.
- Yet another criterion for identifying candidate advertisements is the content (e.g., subject matter) of the video.
- the video can be associated with metadata specifying one or more topics or concepts.
- a document provided by the content provider e.g., a webpage
- the video can be retrieved by the advertisement provider 201 from the content provider 203 and analyzed by the content analyzer 202 .
- One or more topics or concepts to which the video is relevant can be determined from the analysis.
- the content of the advertisement are compared against the topics or concepts of the video.
- the topics or concepts of the video are compared to the topics and concepts of the advertisement.
- topical keywords of the video are compared to the topical keywords of the advertisement using, for example, keyword analysis, and a score can be determined from the comparison. If the score exceeds a threshold, for example, the advertisement can be identified as a candidate for the auction, pending satisfaction of other criteria, if any. Topics can also be determined from image, audio or video analysis.
- the topical keywords for a video can be determined using search engine data.
- data related to interactions to a video by users who were directed to the video by a search query e.g., the video was a result for the search query
- the video was a result for the search query can be an indication of whether the search query is a good topical keyword for the video.
- Interactions with the video can include watching the video in its entirety, watching the video repeatedly, fast-forwarding or advancing the video, or skipping the video.
- a search engine can collect the query and interaction data anonymously and the advertisement provider 201 can analyze the data to determine if a search query is a good keyword for the video based on the interactions of the users.
- search query can be determined to be a poor keyword for the video.
- search query can be determined to be a good keyword for the video.
- the good keywords are associated with the video and can be compared to the keywords for the advertisements.
- an advertisement can target specific channels.
- a video can be analyzed to determine to which channel the video can be classified, or the channels to which the video can be classified can be specified in the video metadata.
- videos can be classified into channels based on the analysis of the videos, if no channels were pre-specified. If the targeted channels of the advertisement match any of the channels to which the video is classified, the advertisement is identified as a candidate for the auction, subject to satisfaction of other preferences (e.g., satisfaction of content provider preferences regarding placement position).
- advertisements can target categories of playlists or individual playlists based on such categorization.
- a further criterion for identifying candidate advertisements is the surrounding content around the embedded video.
- the surrounding content can include the content of the document in which the video is embedded.
- the surrounding content can also include the use profile of the owner of the document or the user viewing the video. For example, if a video is embedded in a person's page on a social networking site, the user profile of the person owning the page and/or the user profile of the user who is viewing the page and the video are surrounding content.
- the surrounding content module 208 can compare the surrounding content against the topics and concepts of the advertisement using, for example, keyword analysis, and a score can be determined from the comparison. If the score exceeds a threshold, for example, the advertisement can be identified as a candidate for the auction, pending satisfaction of other criteria, if any.
- a “user profile” of a page owner or of a viewer of the video is demographic information associated with the respective user, such as age, gender, education, etc.
- Demographic information of a user can be extracted from the user's profile on a social networking site, for example.
- the demographic information can also be obtained from third parties. The demographic information can be obtained separate from any personally identifiable information.
- a further criterion for identifying candidate advertisements is content of a page that links to the video.
- Hyperlinks to a video can be identified by a web crawler system.
- Content in the pages that contain the hyperlinks can be extracted.
- the anchor text of a hyperlink and text content surrounding the hyperlink can be extracted.
- the extracted text can be compared to the topics and concepts of the advertisements, similar to the comparison of the surrounding content and the advertisement described above.
- the content from the linking page can be weighted higher if the linking page is a high-quality page based on inbound and outbound links, for example.
- the page linking to the video or the page in which the video is embedded can be analyzed to determine if the content in the page is related specifically to the video or includes content related to other videos as well.
- the page can be parsed in a structured way to identify components such as titles, particular blog posts, and so on.
- content related to other videos can be weighted less or disregarded.
- interaction data e.g., skipping, fast-forwarding, watching multiple times, etc.
- the interaction data can be used to determine which hyperlinks and content related to the hyperlinks are more relevant to the video for use in advertisement selection.
- another criterion is a text transcript of speech in the video generated by a speech recognition process applied to the video.
- the transcript can be a source of keywords for the video; keyword analysis can be applied to the transcript to identify keywords for the video.
- the speech recognition process can also determine per-term confidence levels for terms in the transcript, where a term can include words, phrases, numbers, characters, etc.
- the per-term confidence levels measure a confidence of the speech recognition process that the corresponding terms were recognized correctly.
- the confidence levels can be used as weights for terms in the transcript. For example, for two terms in the transcript of approximately equal relevance to the video, the term with the higher confidence level is given more weight, and thus more influence, when matching advertisements to terms in the transcript.
- An example of using speech recognition, including confidence levels for terms, to identify advertisements relevant to content is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/241,834, titled “Using Speech Recognition to Determine Advertisements Relevant to Audio Content and/or Audio Content Relevant to Advertisements,” filed Sep. 30, 2005, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
- the transcript can also be used to verify any publisher-provided metadata regarding the subject matter of the video.
- the publisher of the video can declare in the video metadata that the video is about cars. If the transcript indicates that the video is about baseball (e.g., because the transcript has no mention of “cars”), the video and the publisher can be flagged for further manual review. If the manual review confirms that the video metadata does not accurately describe the subject matter of the video, the publisher can be penalized (e.g., banned from receiving advertisements from the advertisement provider 201 , lesser penalties).
- the comparison with the surrounding content is omitted if the advertisement targets particular channels of videos.
- both the content of the video and the surrounding content can affect the identification of candidate advertisements.
- a video about cars If the video is embedded in a webpage about racing, then advertisements for racing cars or sports cars, for example, can be identified as candidate advertisements. If the video is embedded in a webpage about parenting, then advertisements for family friendly cars (e.g., minivans) or child safety seats, for example, can be identified as candidate advertisements. Advertisements for racing cars or sports cars would be less likely to be identified as candidate advertisements in the second scenario because of the difference in the surrounding content (webpage about parenting vs. webpage about racing). In some implementations, content that is not likely to be relevant to the content of a webpage can be excluded from the targeting.
- an advertisement is compared against both the content of the video and of the surrounding content, and the comparisons are combined in a weighted manner.
- the comparison between the topics of the advertisement and the topics of the video, as determined from an analysis of the video can yield one score
- the comparison between the topics of the advertisement and the content of the document in which the video is embedded yields another score.
- comparison to the user profile of the document owner and/or to the user profile of a user viewing the document can yield respective scores.
- Weights can be specified for each of these types of comparisons.
- the weights can be specified by the author or provider of the video or the owner or provider of the document in which the video is embedded.
- the weights can be specified per provider and/or per content item.
- the weights can serve as an indication of which comparison should play a larger role in affecting which advertisements are candidates.
- the weights can be adjusted over time to optimize the weightings. For example, weights can be determined from experimentation and empirical analysis of performance of advertisements placed using different weights. As another example, a machine learning process can be used to analyze the advertisement performance and adjust weights without manual intervention.
- the scores from the comparisons to the content of the video and of the surrounding content can be combined into a weighted score for the advertisement using, for example, a linear combination.
- a weighted score S can be determined for an advertisement. If the weighted score exceeds a specified threshold, then the advertisement is identified as a candidate advertisement for the auction. Otherwise, the advertisement is disregarded or disqualified.
- One or more of the candidate advertisements are selected ( 506 ).
- the identified candidate advertisements are placed into an auction for presentation with the video.
- Advertisers can enter bids using the ad server 206 , for example.
- the bids can be cost-per-click (CPC) bids or cost-per-thousand impression (CPM) bids.
- CPC cost-per-click
- CPM cost-per-thousand impression
- the CPM bid of an advertisement can converted to an estimate CPC bid by multiplying the CPM bid with a click-through rate of the advertisement.
- the advertisements in the auction are then ordered based on their actual or estimate CPC bids.
- the advertiser can enter a base bid and any number of bid modifiers.
- An example of a bid modifier is a decrease of $0.50 from the bid if the video allows skipping of advertisements.
- Another example of a bid modifier is a decrease of $0.50 from the bid if the video does not allow pre-roll advertisements.
- a bid of an advertisement can also be modified by the advertisement provider 201 based on the performance or quality of the advertisement over time.
- quality measures of an advertisement can include a click-through rate, a conversion rate, a skip rate, the number of times the advertisement was viewed completely vs. the number of impressions, and so forth. Advertisements of low quality based on these measures can have their bids decreased. For example, if the advertisement has a high rate of being skipped by viewers and/or has a low conversion rate, the bid can be decreased.
- the advertisements with the highest bids are selected by the ad selection module 204 to fill the available advertisement placement positions.
- the three advertisements with the highest bids are selected for the positions.
- the advertisements are placed into the positions in their bid order.
- the advertisement with the highest bid is placed in the earliest position, the advertisement with the next highest bid is placed in the next position, and so forth.
- the bid order determines a priority as to which of the selected advertisements will get a desired position. For example, if there are a pre-roll position, an interstitial slot, and a post-roll position, a highest bidding advertisement that prefers an interstitial slot will get the interstitial slot, while the next advertisement in the bid order can be placed in a pre-roll or a post-roll position even if the advertisement also prefers an interstitial slot.
- the selected advertisements are transmitted for presentation with the video ( 508 ).
- the ad server 206 transmits the advertisements to the user device 205 .
- the advertisements are received by the advertising module 224 and are placed into their respective positions.
- the content player module 222 displays the advertisements at their respective positions. For example, the advertisements can be displayed in-stream with a video in the content display region 402 ( FIG. 4 ).
- the user response to the advertisements and the video can be monitored. For example, data on click-throughs of the advertisement, viewing of the respective advertisements in their entirety (or not), viewing of the video in its entirety, and skipping of the advertisements can be collected by the advertisement provider 201 .
- the advertisement provider can use this data to determine the performance of the advertisements, for example.
- the performance data can be used to determine the amount of revenue to which the content provider is entitled.
- An example of a revenue sharing scheme is disclosed in U.S.
- the performance data can be used as a signal to adjust the weights of the scores of comparisons to the video and to the document or to adjust the bids of ads in an auction. For example, if the performance of an ad is good with respect to a particular video, the performance data can be used by the advertisement provider 201 to increase one or more weights with respect to the content provider of the video or with respect to the video. On the other hand, if the performance is poor, the weights can be decreased. As another example, the bid for a poor performing ad can be decreased, and the bid for a well performing ad can be increased.
- the identification of candidate advertisements begins, after receiving the request for advertisements, with the determination of advertisements that are relevant to the video and to the document based on comparisons to the video content and to the document content, as described above.
- An advertisement can be scored using a linear combination, for example, of the scores for the individual comparisons. For example, the score from the comparison to the video content can be weighted by a first weight to yield a first weighted score (e.g., ⁇ A) and the comparison to the document can be weighted by a second weight to yield a second weighted score (e.g., ⁇ B). The two weighted scores are added to yield the score for the advertisement. Ads with scores above a threshold are identified as candidates for further consideration.
- the identified advertisements are then filtered by matching them against the content provider preferences. For example, if the content provider preferences specify a desire for interstitial ads only, and each ad can be at most 30 seconds long, then ads targeted for a pre-roll or post-roll position or that are longer than 30 seconds can be disqualified. As another example, if the content provider preferences specify a desire for video ads only, then non-video ads are disqualified.
- One or more of the non-disqualified ads are selected based on an auction, where each of the non-disqualified ads is associated with a bid.
- the ads with the top bids are selected, subject to length restrictions. For example, if the auction is for one interstitial slot of 1 minute long, and the ad with the high bid is 40 seconds long, then the remaining 20 seconds in the slot can be filled by an ad of 20-seconds or shorter with the next highest bid, or it can go unfilled if there are no 20-second ad in the auction.
- the ads selected from the auction are transmitted to the user device 205 for presentation to the user.
- Data on user responses to the advertisements and the video can be collected.
- the collected data can be used by the advertising provider 201 to adjust the weights in the determination of relevant advertisements and/or adjust the bids of ads in auctions.
