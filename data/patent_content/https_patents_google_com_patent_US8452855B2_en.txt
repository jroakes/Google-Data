- Such information may include, without limitation, temporal information, spatial information, and user information relating to a specific user or hardware device.
- User information may include, without limitation, user demographics, user preferences, user social networks, and user behavior.
- a network is a W4 Communications Network.
- a “W4 Communications Network” or W4 COMN provides information related to the “Who, What, When and Where” of interactions within the network.
- the W4 COMN is a collection of users, devices and processes that foster both synchronous and asynchronous communications between users and their proxies providing an instrumented network of sensors providing data recognition and collection in real-world environments about any subject, location, user or combination thereof.
- the W4 COMN can handle the routing/addressing, scheduling, filtering, prioritization, replying, forwarding, storing, deleting, privacy, transacting, triggering of a new message, propagating changes, transcoding and linking. Furthermore, these actions can be performed on any communication channel accessible by the W4 COMN.
- the W4 COMN uses a data modeling strategy for creating profiles for not only users and locations, but also any device on the network and any kind of user-defined data with user-specified conditions.
- every entity known to the W4 COMN can be mapped and represented against all other known entities and data objects in order to create both a micro graph for every entity as well as a global graph that relates all known entities with one another.
- such relationships between entities and data objects are stored in a global index within the W4 COMN.
- a W4 COMN network relates to what may be termed “real-world entities”, hereinafter referred to as RWEs.
- RWE refers to, without limitation, a person, device, location, or other physical thing known to a W4 COMN.
- each RWE known to a W4 COMN is assigned a unique W4 identification'number that identifies the RWE within the W4 COMN.
- RWEs can interact with the network directly or through proxies, which can themselves be RWEs.
- Examples of RWEs that interact directly with the W4 COMN include any device such as a sensor, motor, or other piece of hardware connected to the W4 COMN in order to receive or transmit data or control signals.
- RWE may include all devices that can serve as network nodes or generate, request and/or consume data in a networked environment or that can be controlled through a network.
- Such devices include any kind of “dumb” device purpose-designed to interact with a network (e.g., cell phones, cable television set top boxes, fax machines, telephones, and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, sensors, etc.).
- RFID radio frequency identification
- non-electronic entities including physical entities, such as people, locations (e.g., states, cities, houses, buildings, airports, roads, etc.) and things (e.g., animals, pets, livestock, gardens, physical objects, cars, airplanes, works of art, etc.), and intangible entities such as business entities, legal entities, groups of people or sports teams.
- “smart” devices e.g., computing devices such as smart phones, smart set top boxes, smart cars that support communication with other devices or networks, laptop computers, personal computers, server computers, satellites, etc.
- RWE Remote Access Protocol
- proxies to interact with the network, where software applications executing on the device that serve as the devices' proxies.
- a W4 COMN may allow associations between RWEs to be determined and tracked.
- a given user an RWE
- RWE e.g., the user's phone for the cell phone service, the user's set top box and/or a location for cable service, or a username and password for the online service
- This explicit association can include the user identifying a specific relationship between the user and the RWE (e.g., this is my device, this is my home appliance, this person is my friend/father/son/etc., this device is shared between me and other users, etc.).
- RWEs can also be implicitly associated with a user based on a current situation. For example, a weather sensor on the W4 COMN can be implicitly associated with a user based on information indicating that the user lives or is passing near the sensor's location.
- a W4 COMN network may additionally include what may be termed “information-objects”, hereinafter referred to as IOs.
- An information object is a logical object that may store, maintain, generate or otherwise provides data for use by RWEs and/or the W4 COMN.
- data within in an IO can be revised by the act of an RWE
- An IO within in a W4 COMN can be provided a unique W4 identification number that identifies the IO within the W4 COMN.
- IOs include passive objects such as communication signals (e.g., digital and analog telephone signals, streaming media and interprocess communications), email messages, transaction records, virtual cards, event records (e.g., a data file identifying a time, possibly in combination with one or more RWEs such as users and locations, that can further be associated with a known topic/activity/significance such as a concert, rally, meeting, sporting event, etc.), recordings of phone calls, calendar entries, web pages, database entries, electronic media objects (e.g., media files containing songs, videos, pictures, images, audio messages, phone calls, etc.), electronic files and associated metadata.
- communication signals e.g., digital and analog telephone signals, streaming media and interprocess communications
- email messages e.g., email messages, transaction records, virtual cards, event records (e.g., a data file identifying a time, possibly in combination with one or more RWEs such as users and locations, that can further be associated with a known topic/activity/significance such as a concert, rally, meeting
- IOs include any executing process or application that consumes or generates data such as an email communication application (such as OUTLOOK by MICROSOFT, or YAHOO! MAIL by YAHOO!), a calendaring application, a word processing application, an image editing application, a media player application, a weather monitoring application, a browser application and a web page server application.
- an email communication application such as OUTLOOK by MICROSOFT, or YAHOO! MAIL by YAHOO!
- a calendaring application such as a word processing application, an image editing application, a media player application, a weather monitoring application, a browser application and a web page server application.
- Such active IOs can or can not serve as a proxy for one or more RWEs.
- voice communication software on a smart phone can serve as the proxy for both the smart phone and for the owner of the smart phone.
- every IO there are at least three classes of associated RWEs.
- the first is the RWE that owns or controls the IO, whether as the creator or a rights holder (e.g., an RWE with editing rights or use rights to the IO).
- the second is the RWE(s) that the IO relates to, for example by containing information about the RWE or that identifies the RWE.
- the third are any RWEs that access the IO in order to obtain data from the IO for some purpose.
- available data” and “W4 data” means data that exists in an IO or data that can be collected from a known IO or RWE such as a deployed sensor.
- sensor means any source of W4 data including PCs, phones, portable PCs or other wireless devices, household devices, cars, appliances, security scanners, video surveillance, RFID tags in clothes, products and locations, online data or any other source of information about a real-world user/topic/thing (RWE) or logic-based agent/process/topic/thing (IO).
- FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of relationships between RWEs and IOs on a W4 COMN.
- a user 102 is a RWE provided with a unique network ID.
- the user 102 may be a human that communicates with the network using proxy devices 104 , 106 , 108 , 110 associated with the user 102 , all of which are RWEs having a unique network ID.
- These proxies can communicate directly with the W4 COMN or can communicate with the W4 COMN using IOs such as applications executed on or by a proxy device.
- the proxy devices 104 , 106 , 108 , 110 can be explicitly associated with the user 102 .
- one device 104 can be a smart phone connected by a cellular service provider to the network and another device 106 can be a smart vehicle that is connected to the network.
- Other devices can be implicitly associated with the user 102 .
- one device 108 can be a “dumb” weather sensor at a location matching the current location of the user's cell phone 104 , and thus implicitly associated with the user 102 while the two RWEs 104 , 108 are co-located.
- Another implicitly associated device 110 can be a sensor 110 for physical location 112 known to the W4 COMN. The location 112 is known, either explicitly (through a user-designated relationship, e.g., this is my home, place of employment, parent, etc.) or implicitly (the user 102 is often co-located with the RWE 112 as evidenced by data from the sensor 110 at that location 112 ), to be associated with the first user 102 .
- the user 102 can be directly associated with one or more persons 140 , and indirectly associated with still more persons 142 , 144 through a chain of direct associations.
- Such associations can be explicit (e.g., the user 102 can have identified the associated person 140 as his/her father, or can have identified the person 140 as a member of the user's social network) or implicit (e.g., they share the same address).
- Tracking the associations between people (and other RWEs as well) allows the creation of the concept of “intimacy”, where intimacy may be defined as a measure of the degree of association between two people or RWEs, For example, each degree of removal between RWEs can be considered a lower level of intimacy, and assigned lower intimacy score.
- Intimacy can be based solely on explicit social data or can be expanded to include all W4 data including spatial data and temporal data.
- each RWE 102 , 104 , 106 , 108 , 110 , 112 , 140 , 142 , 144 of a W4 COMN can be associated with one or more IOs as shown.
- FIG. 1 illustrates two IOs 122 , 124 as associated with the cell phone device 104 .
- One IO 122 can be a passive data object such as an event record that is used by scheduling/calendaring software oil the cell phone, a contact IO used by an address book application, a historical record of a transaction made using the device 104 or a copy of a message sent from the device 104 .
- the other IO 124 can be an active software process or application that serves as the device's proxy to the W4 COMN by transmitting or receiving data via the W4 COMN.
- Voice communication software, scheduling/calendaring software, an address book application or a text messaging application are all examples of IOs that can communicate with other IOs and RWEs on the network.
- IOs may additionally relate to topics of interest to one or more RWEs, such topics including, without limitation, musical artists, genre of music, a location and so forth.
- the IOs 122 , 124 can be locally stored on the device 104 or stored remotely on some node or datastore accessible to the W4 COMN, such as a message server or cell phone service datacenter.
- the IO 126 associated with the vehicle 108 can be an electronic file containing the specifications and/or current status of the vehicle 108 , such as make, model, identification number, current location, current speed, current condition, current owner, etc.
- the IO 128 associated with sensor 108 can identify the current state of the subject(s) monitored by the sensor 108 , such as current weather or current traffic.
- the IO 130 associated with the cell phone 110 can be information in a database identifying recent calls or the amount of charges on the current bill.
- RWEs which can only interact with the W4 COMN through proxies, such as people 102 , 140 , 142 , 144 , computing devices 104 , 106 and locations 112 , can have one or more 10 s 132 , 134 , 146 , 148 , 150 directly associated with them which contain RWE-specific information for the associated RWE.
- IOs associated with a person 132 , 146 , 148 , 150 can include a user profile containing email addresses, telephone numbers, physical addresses, user preferences, identification of devices and other RWEs associated with the user.
- the IOs may additionally include records of the user's past interactions with other RWE's on the W4 COMN (e.g., transaction records, copies of messages, listings of time and location combinations recording the user's whereabouts in the past), the unique W4 COMN identifier for the location and/or any relationship information (e.g., explicit user-designations of the user's relationships with relatives, employers, co-workers, neighbors, service providers, etc.).
- records of the user's past interactions with other RWE's on the W4 COMN e.g., transaction records, copies of messages, listings of time and location combinations recording the user's whereabouts in the past
- the unique W4 COMN identifier for the location e.g., explicit user-designations of the user's relationships with relatives, employers, co-workers, neighbors, service providers, etc.
- IOs associated with a person 132 , 146 , 148 , 150 includes remote applications through which a person can communicate with the W4 COMN such as an account with a web-based email service such as Yahoo! Mail.
- a location's IO 134 can contain information such as the exact coordinates of the location, driving directions to the location, a classification of the location (residence, place of business, public, non-public, etc.), information about the services or products that can be obtained at the location, the unique W4 COMN identifier for the location, businesses located at the location, photographs of the location, etc.
- RWEs and IOs are correlated to identify relationships between them.
- RWEs and IOs may be correlated using metadata.
- metadata For example, if an IO is a music file, metadata for the file can include data identifying the artist, song, etc., album art, and the format of the music data. This metadata can be stored as part of the music file or in one or more different IOs that are associated with the music file or both.
- W4 metadata can additionally include the owner of the music file and the rights the owner has in the music file.
- the IO is a picture taken by an electronic camera
- the picture can include in addition to the primary image data from which an image can be created on a display, metadata identifying when the picture was taken, where the camera was when the picture was taken, what camera took the picture, who, if anyone, is associated (e.g., designated as the camera's owner) with the camera, and who and what are the subjects of/in the picture.
- the W4 COMN uses all the available metadata in order to identify implicit and explicit associations between entities and data objects.
- FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of metadata defining the relationships between RWEs and IOs on the W4 COMN.
- an IO 202 includes object data 204 and five discrete items of metadata 206 , 208 , 210 , 212 , 214 .
- Some items of metadata 208 , 210 , 212 can contain information related only to the object data 204 and unrelated to any other IO or RWE. For example, a creation date, text or an image that is to be associated with the object data 204 of the IO 202 .
- Some of items of metadata 206 , 214 can identify relationships between the IO 202 and other RWEs and IOs.
- the IO 202 is associated by one item of metadata 206 with an RWE 220 that RWE 220 is further associated with two IOs 224 , 226 and a second RWE 222 based on some information known to the W4 COMN.
- some information known to the W4 COMN could describe the relations between an image (IO 202 ) containing metadata 206 that identifies the electronic camera (the first RWE 220 ) and the user (the second RWE 224 ) that is known by the system to be the owner of the camera 220 .
- Such ownership information can be determined, for example, from one or another of the IOs 224 , 226 associated with the camera 220 .
- FIG. 2 also illustrates metadata 214 that associates the IO 202 with another IO 230 .
- This IO 230 is itself associated with three other IOs 232 , 234 , 236 that are further associated with different RWEs 242 , 244 , 246 .
- This part of FIG. 2 could describe the relations between a music file (IO 202 ) containing metadata 206 that identifies the digital rights file (the first IO 230 ) that defines the scope of the rights of use associated with this music file 202 .
- the other IOs 232 , 234 , 236 are other music files that are associated with the rights of use and which are currently associated with specific owners (RWEs 242 , 244 , 246 ).
- FIG. 3 illustrates one embodiment of a conceptual model of a W4 COMN.
- the W4 COMN 300 creates an instrumented messaging infrastructure in the form of a global logical network cloud conceptually sub-divided into networked-clouds for each of the 4Ws: Who, Where, What and When.
- the Who cloud 302 are all users whether acting as senders, receivers, data points or confirmation/certification sources as well as user proxies in the forms of user-program processes, devices, agents, calendars, etc.
- cloud 304 are all physical locations, events, sensors or other RWEs associated with a spatial reference point or location.
- the When cloud 306 is composed of natural temporal events (that is events that are not associated with particular location or person such as days, times, seasons) as well as collective user temporal events (holidays, anniversaries, elections, etc.) and user-defined temporal events (birthdays, smart-timing programs).
- the What cloud 308 is comprised of all known data—web or private, commercial or user—accessible to the W4 COMN, including for example environmental data like weather and news, RWE-generated data, IOs and IO data, user data, models, processes and applications. Thus, conceptually, most data is contained in the What cloud 308 .
- IOs and RWEs can be composites in that they combine elements from one or more clouds. Such composites can be classified as appropriate to facilitate the determination of associations between RWEs and IOs. For example, an event consisting of a location and time could be equally classified within the When cloud 306 , the What cloud 308 and/or the Where cloud 304 .
- a W4 engine 310 is center of the W4 COMN's intelligence for making all decisions in the W4 COMN.
- the W4 engine 310 controls all interactions between each layer of the W4 COMN and is responsible for executing any approved user or application objective enabled by W4 COMN operations or interoperating applications.
- the W4 COMN is an open platform with standardized, published APIs for requesting (among other things) synchronization, disambiguation, user or topic addressing, access rights, prioritization or other value-based ranking, smart scheduling, automation and topical, social, spatial or temporal alerts.
- One function of the W4 COMN is to collect data concerning all communications and interactions conducted via the W4 COMN, which can include storing copies of IOs and information identifying all RWEs and other information related to the IOs (e.g., who, what, when, where information).
- Other data collected by the W4 COMN can include information about the status of any given RWE and IO at any given time, such as the location, operational state, monitored conditions (e.g., for an RWE that is a weather sensor, the current weather conditions being monitored or for an RWE that is a cell phone, its current location based on the cellular towers it is in contact with) and current status.
- the W4 engine 310 is also responsible for identifying RWEs and relationships between RWEs and IOs from the data and communication streams passing through the W4 COMN.
- the function of identifying RWEs associated with or implicated by IOs and actions performed by other RWEs may he referred to as entity extraction.
- Entity extraction can include both simple actions, such as identifying the sender and receivers of a particular IO, and more complicated analyses of the data collected by and/or available to the W4 COMN, for example determining that a message listed the time and location of an upcoming event and associating that event with the sender and receiver(s) of the message based on the context of the message or determining that an RWE is stuck in a traffic jam based on a correlation of the RWE's location with the status of a co-located traffic monitor.
- the IO when performing entity extraction from an IO, can be an opaque object with only where only W4 metadata related to the object is visible, but internal data of the IO (i.e., the actual primary or object data contained within the object) are not, and thus metadata extraction is limited to the metadata.
- internal data of the IO if internal data of the IO is visible, it can also be used in entity extraction, e.g. strings within an email are extracted and associated as RWEs to for use in determining the relationships between the sender, user, topic or other RWE or IO impacted by the object or process.
- the W4 engine 310 can be one or a group of distributed computing devices, such as a general-purpose personal computers (PCs) or purpose built server computers, connected to the W4 COMN by communication hardware and/or software.
- Such computing devices can be a single device or a group of devices acting together.
- Computing devices can be provided with any number of program modules and data files stored in a local or remote mass storage device and local memory (e.g., RAM) of the computing device.
- a computing device can include an operating system suitable for controlling the operation of a networked computer, such as the WINDOWS XP or WINDOWS SERVER operating systems from MICROSOFT CORPORATION.
- RWEs can also be computing devices such as, without limitation, smart phones, web-enabled appliances, PCs, laptop computers, and personal data assistants (PDAs).
- Computing devices can be connected to one or more communications networks such as the Internet, a publicly switched telephone network, a cellular telephone network, a satellite communication network, a wired communication network such as a cable television or private area network.
- Computing devices can be connected any such network via a wired data connection or wireless connection such as a wi-fi, a WiMAX (802.36), a Bluetooth or a cellular telephone connection.
- Local data structures can be stored on a computer-readable medium (not shown) that is connected to, or part of, any of the computing devices described herein including the W4 engine 310 .
- the data backbone of the W4 COMN includes multiple mass storage devices that maintain the IOs, metadata and data necessary to determine relationships between RWEs and IOs as described herein.
- FIG. 4 illustrates one embodiment of the functional layers of a W4 COMN architecture.
- the sensor layer 402 At the lowest layer, referred to as the sensor layer 402 , is the network 404 of the actual devices, users, nodes and other RWEs.
- Sensors include known technologies like web analytics, GPS, cell-tower pings, use logs, credit card transactions, online purchases, explicit user profiles and implicit user profiling achieved through behavioral targeting, search analysis and other analytics models used to optimize specific network applications or functions.
- the data layer 406 stores and catalogs the data produced by the sensor layer 402 .
- the data can be managed by either the network 404 of sensors or the network infrastructure 406 that is built on top of the instrumented network of users, devices, agents, locations, processes and sensors.
- the network infrastructure 408 is the core under-the-covers network infrastructure that includes the hardware and software necessary to receive that transmit data from the sensors, devices, etc. of the network 404 . It further includes the processing and storage capability necessary to meaningfully categorize and track the data created by the network 404 .
- the user profiling layer 410 performs the W4 COMN's user profiling functions. This layer 410 can further be distributed between the network infrastructure 408 and user applications/processes 412 executing on the W4 engine or disparate user computing devices. Personalization is enabled across any single or combination of communication channels and modes including email, IM, texting (SMS, etc.), photobloging, audio (e.g. telephone call), video (teleconferencing, live broadcast), games, data confidence processes, security, certification or any other W4 COMM process call for available data.
- the user profiling layer 410 is a logic-based layer above all sensors to which sensor data are sent in the rawest form to be mapped and placed into the W4 COMN data backbone 420 .
- the data (collected and refined, related and deduplicated, synchronized and disambiguated) are then stored in one or a collection of related databases available applications approved on the W4 COMN.
- Network-originating actions and communications are based upon the fields of the data backbone, and some of these actions are such that they themselves become records somewhere in the backbone, e.g. invoicing, while others, e.g. fraud detection, synchronization, disambiguation, can be done without an impact to profiles and models within the backbone.
- Actions originating from outside the network come from the applications layer 414 of the W4 COMN.
- Some applications can be developed by the W4 COMN operator and appear to be implemented as part of the communications infrastructure 408 , e.g. email or calendar programs because of how closely they operate with the sensor processing and user profiling layer 410 .
- the applications 412 also serve as a sensor in that they, through their actions, generate data back to the data layer 406 via the data backbone concerning any data created or available due to the applications execution.
- the applications layer 414 can also provide a user interface (UI) based on device, network, carrier as well as user-selected or security-based customizations.
- UI user interface
- Any UI can operate within the W4 COMN if it is instrumented to provide data on user interactions or actions back to the network.
- the UI can also be used to confirm or disambiguate incomplete W4 data in real-time, as well as correlation, triangulation and synchronization sensors for other nearby enabled or non-enabled devices.
- the network effects enough enabled devices allow the network to gather complete or nearly complete data (sufficient for profiling and tracking) of a non-enabled device because of its regular intersection and sensing by enabled devices in its real-world location.
- the communications delivery network 416 can be operated by the W4 COMN operator or be independent third-party carrier service. Data may be delivered via synchronous or asynchronous communication. In every case, the communication delivery network 414 will be sending or receiving data on behalf of a specific application or network infrastructure 408 request.
- the communication delivery layer 418 also has elements that act as sensors including W4 entity extraction from phone calls, emails, blogs, etc. as well as specific user commands within the delivery network context. For example, “save and prioritize this call” said before end of call can trigger a recording of the previous conversation to be saved and for the W4 entities within the conversation to analyzed and increased in weighting prioritization decisions in the personalization/use profiling layer 410 .
- FIG. 5 illustrates one embodiment of the analysis components of a W4 engine as shown in FIG. 3 .
- the W4 Engine is responsible for identifying RWEs and relationships between RWEs and IOs from the data and communication streams passing through the W4 COMN.
- the W4 engine connects, interoperates and instruments all network participants through a series of sub-engines that perform different operations in the entity extraction process.
- the attribution engine 504 tracks the real-world ownership, control, publishing or other conditional rights of any RWE in any IO. Whenever a new IO is detected by the W4 engine 502 , e.g., through creation or transmission of a new message, a new transaction record, a new image file, etc., ownership is assigned to the IO.
- the attribution engine 504 creates this ownership information and further allows this information to be determined for each IO known to the W4 COMN.
- the correlation engine 506 can operates two capacities: first, to identify associated RWEs and IOs and their relationships (such as by creating a combined graph of any combination of RWEs and IOs and their attributes, relationships and reputations within contexts or situations) and second, as a sensor analytics pre-processor for attention events from any internal or external source.
- the identification of associated RWEs and IOs function of the correlation engine 506 is done by graphing the available data, using, for example, one or more histograms
- a histogram is a mapping technique that counts the number of observations that fall into various disjoint categories (i.e. bins.). By selecting each IO, RWE, and other known parameters (e.g., times, dates, locations, etc.) as different bins and mapping the available data, relationships between RWEs, IOs and the other parameters can be identified.
- a histogram of all RWEs and IOs is created, from which correlations based on the graph can be made.
- the correlation engine 506 monitors the information provided by RWEs in order to determine if any conditions are identified that can trigger an action on the part of the W4 engine 502 . For example, if a delivery condition has been associated with a message, when the correlation engine 506 determines that the condition is met, it can transmit the appropriate trigger information to the W4 engine 502 that triggers delivery of the message.
- the attention engine 508 instruments all appropriate network nodes, clouds, users, applications or any combination thereof and includes close interaction with both the correlation engine 506 and the attribution engine 504 .
- FIG. 6 illustrates one embodiment of a W4 engine showing different components within the sub-engines described above with reference to FIG. 4 .

- the attention engine 608 includes a message intake and generation manager 610 as well as a message delivery manager 612 that work closely with both a message matching manager 614 and a real-time communications manager 616 to deliver and instrument all communications across the W4 COMN.
- the attribution engine 604 works within the user profile manager 618 and in conjunction with all other modules to identify, process/verify and represent ownership and rights information related to RWEs, IOs and combinations thereof.
- the correlation engine 606 dumps data from both of its channels (sensors and processes) into the same data backbone 620 which is organized and controlled by the W4 analytics manager 622 .
- the data backbone 620 includes both aggregated and individualized archived versions of data from all network operations including user logs 624 , attention rank place logs 626 , web indices and environmental logs 618 , e-commerce and financial transaction information 630 , search indexes and logs 632 , sponsor content or conditionals, ad copy and any and all other data used in any W4 COMN process, IO or event. Because of the amount of data that the W4 COMN will potentially store, the data backbone 620 includes numerous database servers and datastores in communication with the W4 COMN to provide sufficient storage capacity.
- the data collected by the W4 COMN includes spatial data, temporal data, RWE interaction data, 10 content data (e.g., media data), and user data including explicitly-provided and deduced social and relationship data.
- Spatial data can be any data identifying a location associated with an RWE.
- the spatial data can include any passively collected location data, such as cell tower data, global packet radio service (GPRS) data, global positioning service (GPS) data, WI-FI data, personal area network data, IP address data and data from other network access points, or actively collected location data, such as location data entered by the user.
- Temporal data is time based data (e.g., time stamps) that relate to specific times and/or events associated with a user and/or the electronic device.
- the temporal data can be passively collected time data (e.g., time data from a clock resident on the electronic device, or time data from a network clock), or the temporal data can be actively collected time data, such as time data entered by the user of the electronic device (e.g., a user maintained calendar).
- Logical and IO data refers to the data contained by an IO as well as data associated with the IO such as creation time, owner, associated RWEs, when the IO was last accessed, the topic or subject of the IO (from message content or “re” or subject line, as some examples) etc.

- Media data can be used, for example, to deduce activities information or preferences information, such as cultural and/or buying preferences information.
- Relationship data can include data relating to the relationships of an RWE or IO to another RWE or IO.
- the relationship data can include user identity data, such as gender, age, race, name, social security number, photographs and other information associated with the user's identity.
- User identity information can also include e-mail addresses, login names and passwords.
- Relationship data can further include data identifying explicitly associated RWEs.
- relationship data for a cell phone can indicate the user that owns the cell phone and the company that provides the service to the phone.
- relationship data for a smart car can identify the owner, a credit card associated with the owner for payment of electronic tolls, those users permitted to drive the car and the service station for the car.
- Relationship data can also include social network data.
- Social network data includes data relating to any relationship that is explicitly defined by a user or other RWE, such as data relating to a user's friends, family, co-workers, business relations, and the like.
- Social network data can include, for example, data corresponding with a user-maintained electronic address book.
- Relationship data can be correlated with, for example, location data to deduce social network information, such as primary relationships (e.g., user-spouse, user-children and user-parent relationships) or other relationships (e.g., user-friends, user-co-worker, user-business associate relationships). Relationship data also can be utilized to deduce, for example, activities information.
- Interaction data can be any data associated with user interaction of the electronic device, whether active or passive. Examples of interaction data include interpersonal communication data, media data, relationship data, transactional data and device interaction data, all of which are described in further detail below. Table 1, below, is a non-exhaustive list including examples of electronic data.
- Interaction data includes communication data between any RWEs that is transferred via the W4 COMN.

- Media such as music, videos, movies, images, books and publications help define and shape human consciousness.
- Media may evoke deep seated memories and create a picture, an impression, a feeling, of a time or place, a person or a group of persons, or even an abstract idea. So little is within the compass of direct experience, yet through the lens of recorded media, a person can glimpse a flash of another place or time, may in fact, be able to enter the thoughts of another person.
- the past and the present, and the far reaches of the world carry on an unbroken dialogue through media.
- the user when a user is requesting a playlist, the user may be said to have a specific context in mind.
- the user's context can be defined as a set of criteria that describe or circumscribe one or more related ideas.
- the criteria can be conceptually divided into four categories: Who, What, When and Where.
- “Who” criteria are persons, devices, or proxies who are related to the ideas embodied in the context. “Who” may be a known person, such as the user or a specific person known by the user. “Who” may also be a list of specific persons, such as the contact list stored on the PDA of a user, or persons listed on a user's social network profile as friends. Alternatively, “Who” can be a general description of persons of interest, such as persons who are interested in surfing.
- “What” criteria are objects or topics related to the ideas embodied in the context. “What” may be the form of media the user is interested in, such as music or videos. “What” may be a genre of music or video, such as country or rock. “What” may be subject matter addressed in media, such as love songs or even specific lyrical phrases. Alternatively, “What” may be a mood or atmosphere, such as happy, sad, energetic, or relaxed.
- “When” criteria are dates and times which are related to the ideas embodied in the context. “When” may be the current date and time. “When” may also be a specific date and time in the past or the future, or a range of dates and times in the past or the future. “When” may be an offset from a specific date, for example, ten days in the past. Alternatively, “When” can be an event on a calendar, such as a birthday, a season or a holiday, or an event in the news, such as the last time a favorite sports team won a championship.
- “Where” criteria are physical locations. “Where” may be a user's current location. “Where” may be specific place, such as a country, a state, a city, a neighborhood. “Where” may be defined as the location of an event, such as a concert or some other newsworthy occurrence. Alternatively, “Where” can be a general description of places of interest, such as blues or jazz clubs.
- W4 COMN The embodiments of the present invention discussed below illustrate application of the present invention within a W4 COMN. Nevertheless, it is understood that the invention can be implemented using any networked system that is capable of collecting, storing accessing and/or processing user profile data, as well as temporal, spatial, topical and social data relating to users and their devices.
- W4 COMN is used herein for convenience to describe a system and/or network having the features, functions and/or components described herein throughout.
- a W4 COMN can provide a platform that stores media files and enables the selection and presentation of such files related using queries based on complex contexts containing who, what, when, and where criteria, allowing a user to experience or re-experience the media of a specific combination of time, place and social network by mining historical and current W4 data, and combining it with, among other things, charts of popular media at the specific time and place specified.
- FIG. 7 illustrates one embodiment of a data model showing how a W4 COMN can store media files and relate such files to RWEs, such as persons and places, and IOs, such as topics and other types of metadata.
- media is stored as media objects 710 .
- Media objects are passive IOs relating to media files containing audio content, visual content, or both.
- Such media files can contain content such as songs, videos, pictures, images, audio messages, phone calls, and so forth.
- the media objects themselves contain metadata 712 .
- metadata may relate to basic file properties such as creation date, text or an image that is associated with a media file to which an IO relates.
- Allmusic database (formerly the All Music Guide, owned by All Media Guide) provides metadata which includes:
- databases that can be used as sources for metadata relating to songs and video include:
- Metadata originating from such databases can extracted from source databases and embedded 712 in the media objects 710 themselves.
- the media objects may be related to IOs that contain or relate to metadata 740 .
- Metadata can include one or more keywords or topics that describe or classify data.
- a IO relating to metadata can be an topics that relates to all songs within a genre, such as rock, or all songs performed at a specific festival, such as Woodstock.
- Topic or IOs relating to metadata can be associated with IOs relating to higher level topics 742 .
- a composer may be associated with a topic such as baroque music, which is itself associated with a higher-level IO for classical music.
- a metadata server with its associated databases can be defined as an RWE 722 within the W4 COMN, and media objects and other IOs can be associated with the RWE 722 .
- metadata relating to a media object can then be retrieved on demand, rather than being stored in static metadata or in a persistent IO. Metadata retrieved on demand can be chosen based on needs of users who have a potential interest in the media object. For example, a user who initially selects a media object based on a topic can then retrieve metadata on demand relating to tone or mood of the music associated with the media object.
- a metadata server which is capable of providing such information can be queried to retrieve a list of such songs.
- the list of songs can be used to create an IO relating to a topic, such as IO 740 , by associating media objects relating to the list of songs with a newly created IO.
- such an IO is created by a correlation engine within a W4 engine (see above and FIGS. 4 through 6 , for example). The IO can then be used in subsequent queries.
- media objects are associated with other RWEs, such as musical rights holders 730 (i.e. owners and licensees), and interested listeners 750 .
- an owner 730 of a media object can be identified
- an attribution engine within a W4 engine tracks the real-world ownership, control, publishing or other conditional rights of any RWE in any media IO whenever a new object is detected.
- users 750 , 752 , and 754 can be identified as having an interest in a specific song 710 or a topic IO 740 or 742 by a correlation engine within a W4 engine.
- the correlation engine identifies relationships between user RWEs and media or IOs relating to metadata by creating a combined graph of the RWEs and IOs and their attributes, relationships and reputations. For example, a user can explicitly state in a user profile that they have an interest in a specific musical artist.
- the correlation engine can determine a user's interest in a topic or a song or view based on the content of the user's interaction data, sensing attention events from any internal or external source.
- the W4 COMN builds a profile of a user over time by collecting data from the user or from information sources available to the network so as to gain an understanding of where they were born, where they have lived, and where they live today. Using social data, the W4 COMN can also create an overlapping social network profile which places the user in a temporal, geographic and social graph, thus determining where a user lived when and with whom. User RWEs can be also be associated with other RWEs through interaction data. Users who are interested in the same time/place can declare their interests and be connected to a topic based social network through, for example, an IO relating to a topic. In the illustrated embodiment in FIG. 7 , users 750 and 752 are identified as being within a social network, 760 .
- media objects can be stored and associated with temporal, spatial, social network and topical data derived from, without limitation, traditional metadata sources, user profile data, social networks, and interaction data, building a network of relationships across the universe of media and users. Such relationships may be built on demand, if necessary. Such relationships can then enable queries for media that satisfy the criteria of simple or complex contexts.
- FIG. 8 illustrates one embodiment of a process 800 of how a network containing temporal, spatial, and social network and topical data for a plurality of users, devices, and media (such as a W4 COMN), can be used to enable customized music delivery for complex user contexts having who, where, when, and what criteria.
- a network containing temporal, spatial, and social network and topical data for a plurality of users, devices, and media such as a W4 COMN
- the process begins when a user enters a context criteria 820 using a user proxy device such as, for example, a portable media player, PDA, computer, or cell phone.
- a user proxy device such as, for example, a portable media player, PDA, computer, or cell phone.
- Data relating to the context can be any combination be any who, what, when, or where criteria.
- the criteria can be related to one another using standard relational or set operators.
- the query can be stated as a natural language query
- the context is used to formulate a query based on the context criteria so as to search, via the network, for user profile data, social network data, spatial data, temporal data and topical data that is available via the network 842 and relates to the context and to media files so as to identify at least one media file that is relevant to the context criteria.
- the criteria are interpreted to take advantage the best available data within the network.
- a context may be defined in general terms, but the proper data and access paths may not be apparent to an end user. For example, assume a user enters a query “Play the favorite music of surfers in Hawaii in 1974.”
- the query could search for users known to the network whose profile or interaction data indicate have surfing as a hobby or interest and who lived in Hawaii in 1974.
- the musical preferences of such users such as musical genre, favorite artists, or favorite songs could then be used to search for media objects for songs relating to such genre, artists, or songs and which were released in 1974.
- the query results are then used to assemble a playlist 860 that, in certain embodiments, can be stored on a computer readable medium 862 referencing one or more media objects or files relevant to the context.
- the playlist 862 is then used to download, stream, or otherwise deliver media 880 on the playlist to one or more user devices associated with the requesting user.
- a query may be recursively executed 890 and the results delivered based on a trigger condition, for example, if the physical location of the end user changes or if the user arrives at a predetermined location, or at a specific time of day or day of the week.
- FIG. 9 further illustrates how the process illustrated in FIG. 8 can be supported by one embodiment of a W4 COMN or other network providing similar data and processing capabilities.
- a context query engine 912 resides on a server 910 within the W4 COMN.
- the context query engine 912 can be defined to the W4 COMN as an RWE, or alternatively, an active IO.
- the context query engine can be a component of a W4 engine, or, alternatively, may use services provided by components of a W4 engine or any of its constituent engines.
- the context query engine 912 provides a user interface on a user's portable media player 924 (known to the network as a user proxy RWE 926 ) or other media capable device or application, that enables a user 920 (known to the network as an RWE 922 ) to enter a context.
- the end user device 924 may contain positioning or other sensors that detect various aspects of the physical environment surrounding the user 920 , such as, for example, the user's geographical location. Sensors can also include other environmental sensors such as temperature and lighting sensors, or can also include biometric sensors. Sensed data can be included in the context automatically, or some or all can be included by explicit user selection or by system selection.
- the context query engine 912 can use the context data entered on the media player 924 to create an IO 930 relating to the context data owned by the proxy RWE 926 associated with the media player 924 .
- the IO 930 may alternatively or additionally be owned by the user RWE 922 .
- the IO 930 is input to the context query engine 912 which searches the W4 COMN databases and assembles a playlist IO 940 which references media objects 950 , 952 , 954 , and 956 which the context query engine has identified as relevant to the query IO 930 .
- the context query engine 912 can identify media objects of interest using relationships existing in the W4 COMN databases. Examples include: media 950 directly related to the user RWE 922 (e.g. a user's favorite song); media 952 related to a IO relating to a topic 945 ; media 945 related to another user 955 ; and media 956 identified based on metadata embedded within the media object. In one embodiment, such relationships between entities and data objects are stored in a global index within the W4 COMN databases and the context query engine 912 uses the global index to identify media objects of interest.
- the user's 920 media player 922 or a software application provided by the media player can use the playlist 930 to request delivery of the media in the playlist to the media player from, for example, a media server or media provider or streaming media server (not shown).
- the query engine can send the playlist directly to a media server or media provider or streaming media server for delivery of the media to the user's 920 media player 922 .
- FIG. 10 illustrates the components of one embodiment of a context query engine 1000 .
- the context query engine is a component of a W4 engine 502 within a W4 COMN, such as the context query engine 912 shown in FIG. 9 .
- the context query engine 1000 is a standalone application that has access to one or more databases containing temporal, spatial, social network and topical data relating to one or more users.
- the context query engine 1000 includes: a context entry module 1200 that provides a user interface for entry of criteria for contexts; a query module 1300 that searches network databases 1320 for media related to context criteria; a playlist generation module 1400 that generates playlists 1420 using the search results produced by the query module 1300 ; and a media delivery module 1500 that delivers the media referenced in the playlist to a device associated with the requesting user.
- a context entry module 1200 that provides a user interface for entry of criteria for contexts
- a query module 1300 that searches network databases 1320 for media related to context criteria
- a playlist generation module 1400 that generates playlists 1420 using the search results produced by the query module 1300
- a media delivery module 1500 that delivers the media referenced in the playlist to a device associated with the requesting user.
- Any of the aforementioned modules or the communications between modules may be stored on computer readable media, for transient, temporary or permanent stage.
- the interface provided by the context a context entry module 1200 may be a graphical user interface displayable on computers or PDAs, including HTTP documents accessible over the Internet. Such an interfaces may also take other forms, including text files, such as emails, and APIs usable by software applications located on computing devices.
- the criteria can be related to one another using standard relational or set operators.
- temporal and spatial data obtained from sensors within user devices can be included in the context criteria. For example, the current location of a device associated with a user can be automatically identified and included in the context. The user creating the context can be automatically identified through the association of the proxy device with a user within the network and automatically included in the context.
- the context can further specify that the context be processed at a future point in time, periodically, or on the occurrence of a specific event.
- a context may specify that the context be reprocessed on the occurrence of a trigger condition, such as hourly, when the physical location of a user associated with the context changes, when a calendared event occurs (e.g. an anniversary), or when a news event occurs (e.g. a favorite sports team wins a game.)
- a context can be associated with an advertisement.
- a context is entered and processed to generate a playlist which relates to the context, such as a specific era or other topic, and which may further take into account the user's temporal, spatial, social, and topical associations.
- an advertisement may supplement basic ad content with media tailored for a specific user.
- an advertisement for a sports car may be associated with a context specifying the users favorite musical artist and songs with a fast tempo or explicit references to speed, or the year 1975 when the user last owned a sports car.
- the query module 1300 searches one or more network databases 1320 , for user profile data, social network data, spatial data, temporal data and topical data that is available via the network and relates to the context and to media files so as to identify at least one media file that is relevant to the context criteria. Such searches are performed using the capabilities of the network databases 1320 and their supporting infrastructure.
- the query module can, without limitation, parse query terms, identify entities and attributes of entities within the query and further identify relationships between entities and their attributes, as well as relationships to fixed data, such as times, places, and events. Entities and attributes within the query can then be cross referenced against the network databases for correspondence to entities, objects, and attributes within the network database.
- the criteria are interpreted to take advantage the best available data within the network.
- the query module can execute a series of SQL statements for retrieving data from a relational database or a procedural language containing embedded SQL. Queries may be nested or otherwise constructed to retrieve data from one set of entities, and to use the result set to drive additional queries against other entities, or to use recursive data retrieval.
- the context request can be stored as an IO.
- Such an IO may itself be comprised of a cluster of linked IOs relating to topics, each IO relating to one or more context criteria.
- the query module is a component of a correlation engine of a W4 engine.
- An IO relating to a context request can be mapped and represented against all other known entities and data objects in order to create both a micro graph for every entity as well as a global graph that relates all known entities with one another, and media objects relevant to the context are thereby identified.
- such relationships between entities and data objects are stored in a global index within the W4 COMN.
- query criteria relate to simple descriptive matter, such as date and time of creation
- relationships can be identified using metadata embedded in media objects.
- criteria relate to a topic, such as a genre of music
- relationships can be identified through IOs (whether currently existing or dynamically generated) relating to the topic which may then be used to identify media objects associated with the topic.
- the media search module can further determine if the user or a user proxy creating the context is permitted to access the content of the media file using ownership data in or associated with the media object.
- a user could enter a context into their media player specifying Motown, music, and 1967.
- the query engine could search for IOs relating to a topics related to Motown and select media objects associated with that IO where metadata within related media objects indicates the music was released in 1967.
- the system would also search for metadata within media objects for “Motown” and “1967.”
- the resulting playlist would enable the user to listen to Motown music from 1967.
- the user could enter a context into their media player specifying music and Manhattan.
- the query engine could search a lyric database, which in one embodiment is defined to the W4 COMN as a RWE, for music which portrays New York in a positive light. Additionally or alternatively the query engine could search for an IO associated with “Manhattan” and select media objects associated with that IO. If no such IO was present, the system could search for metadata within media objects for “Manhattan.”
- the user could enter a context into their media player specifying, for example, either “summer of love” or a date range (the summer of 1967) and a location (San Francisco). If the “summer of love” was entered, the W4 query engine could search for an IO related to that topics and select media objects associated with that IO. If no such IO was present, the system could search for metadata within media objects for “summer of love.” If a date range and location was entered, W4 query engine could search metadata within media objects for “San Francisco” and a date within the specified range. The resulting playlist would contain music, videos or both that would enable the requester to experience the media of the “summer of love” as if they were actually experiencing that era.
- the user would create a context for a year and a place and, possibly a genre, such as popular music using a W4 interface, for example, a W4 URL.
- the query engine would search W4 databases for media objects related that time and place. For example, the query engine could search for publications that publish record charts such as Billboard magazine, or other song or album charting or rating services, erg. Sound Scan from the Nielson Company for the top 40 songs at the time of the user's prom and then locate media objects corresponding to those songs. The user can then listen to the music that would probably have been played at their senior prom.
- the user would create a context specifying his college, a specific year and the group of friends he socialized with at that time.
- the query engine could determine from profile, social networking, and interaction data for the user and for any of his friends who are known to the W4 COMN what kind of music they listen to, who their favorite artists are, and what their favorite songs are.
- the query engine could then search, for example, using IOs relating to topics and metadata within media objects for songs by favorite artists for the user and his friends that were released that specific year.
- the query engine could further search, for example, metadata within media objects for references to the user's college, for Los Angeles, or any of his friends.
- the resulting playlist would contain music, videos or both that would enable the requester to experience the media of his college days.
- the user would create a context specifying surfing, Hawaii, and 1974.
- the query engine could search for users known to the W4 COMN whose profile or interaction data indicate have surfing as a hobby or interest and who lived in Hawaii in 1974.
- the musical preferences of such users such as musical genre, favorite artists, or favorite songs could then be used to search IOs relating to such topics or metadata within media objects for songs relating to such genre, artists, or songs which were released in 1974.
- the resulting playlist would allow the user to experience listen to the music that was probably the favorite music of surfers in Hawaii in 1974.
- a user wishes to listen to the favorite music of persons who attended (or are attending) a specific concert
- the user would create a context specifying the name, date, and time of the concert and specifying persons who attended the concert.
- the query engine could search the W4 COMN for users whose interaction data indicates they attended the concert.
- the musical preferences of such users such as musical genre, favorite artists, or favorite songs could then be used to search IOs relating to such topics or metadata within media objects for songs relating to such genre, artists, or songs.
- the resulting playlist would contain music, videos or both that would enable the requester to sample music preferred by persons who attended a specific concert.
- a user wishes to create family playlist of the favorite songs for his family relating to when each of his family members was 11 years old
- the user would create a context specifying his family, favorite songs, and age 11.
- the query engine could then search the users profile and interaction data to determine who his immediate family members are.
- the query engine would then determine if the users family members are known to the W4 COMN and determine the birthday and musical preferences of such users, such as musical genre, favorite artists, or favorite songs.
- Such preferences could then be used to search IOs relating to topics or metadata within media objects for songs relating to such genre, artists, or songs which fall in a year in which a specific family member was age 11.
- the resulting playlist would allow the user to experience the favorite music of his immediate family when they were children.
- Real time location data from a users device can also be used to enhance the user experience. For example, assume a user is currently walking through the Haight Ashbury district of San Francisco with a media player whose physical location can be sensed. The user could enter a context specifying a specific year and the user's current location. The query engine could then search W4 databases, for example, using object metadata or IOs relating to such topics, for music released in the selected year and relating to (e.g. written or produced in or performed by artists that reside in or resided in) Haight Ashbury or San Francisco and a playlist relating to that time and place is created. As the user walks from one area of the city to another, the users device detects the change in location and changes the context to reflect the user's new location. The new context is then use to create a new playlist and a different set of music plays that relates to the user's current location. As the user leaves the area and walks or otherwise travels further, the playlist of music may change again to relate to the new location.
- an ad for Viagra could be associated with a context whose criteria includes 1958, popular music, and energetic music.
- Such an ad could also be tailored to a user, for example, a context could be defined containing criteria including the current user, the year the user was 1 8 , and the user's favorite music.
