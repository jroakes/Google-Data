- Some search engine and social networking websites provide a widget in the form of a graphical user interface (GUI) button to webmasters for inclusion in a webpage (e.g., a webpage which can be accessed with a Uniform Resource Locator or URL) on a website external to the search engine website or the social networking website. Among other things, this GUI button allows a user to interact with a webpage by publicly recommending the webpage to other users by clicking on the button.
- In an example embodiment, a processor-executed method is described for associating user acknowledgements with an entity. According to the method, software at a social networking website verifies a hyperlink in an entity webpage displayed by a social networking website. The hyperlink links to an external entity webpage. The software also verifies a hyperlink in the external entity webpage. This hyperlink links to the entity webpage displayed by the social networking website. The software receives user acknowledgements from users viewing the entity webpage on the social networking website. And the software receives user acknowledgements from users viewing the external entity webpage. The software then calculates a sum of any user acknowledgements of the social-network entity webpage and any user acknowledgements of the external entity webpage. And the software causes the sum to be displayed on both the social-network entity webpage and the external entity webpage. Receipt of a user acknowledgement from a user who is a member of the social networking website does not add the entity to any access control list associated with the user at the social networking website.
- This and other embodiments can include one or more of the following features. The acknowledgement can be received through a graphical user interface (GUI) button on the webpage. The acknowledgement can be confirmed with a GUI dialog box indicating that a user is acknowledging the entity, not the webpage being viewed by the user. Verifying a link can include verifying that the link is operational and that the webpage linked by the link is owned or controlled by the entity. Further, the software might display an image associated with a user who makes an acknowledgement, where the image is displayed on the first webpage, the second webpage, or both webpages. And the software might provide the sum for display in any search results that include the first webpage or the second webpage.
- In another example embodiment, an apparatus is described, namely, a computer-readable storage medium that persistently stores a program for associating user acknowledgements with an entity. The program might be part of the software at a social networking website. The program verifies a hyperlink in an entity webpage displayed by a social networking website. The hyperlink links to an external entity webpage. The program also verifies a hyperlink in the external entity webpage. This hyperlink links to the entity webpage displayed by the social networking website. The program receives user acknowledgements from users viewing the entity webpage on the social networking website. And the program receives user acknowledgements from users viewing the external entity webpage. The program then calculates a sum of any user acknowledgements of the social-network entity webpage and any user acknowledgements of the external entity webpage. And the program causes the sum to be displayed on both the social-network entity webpage and the external entity webpage. Receipt of a user acknowledgement from a user who is a member of the social networking website does not add the entity to any access control list associated with the user at the social networking website.
- Again, this and other embodiments can include one or more of the following features. The acknowledgement can be received through a graphical user interface (GUI) button on the webpage. The acknowledgement can be confirmed with a GUI dialog box indicating that a user is acknowledging the entity, not the webpage being viewed by the user. Verifying a link can include verifying that the link is operational and that the webpage linked by the link is owned or controlled by the entity. Further, the program might display an image associated with a user who makes an acknowledgement, where the image is displayed on the first webpage, the second webpage, or both webpages. And the program might provide the sum for display in any search results that include the first webpage or the second webpage.
- In another example embodiment, another processor-executed method is described for associating user acknowledgements with an entity. According to the method, software at a social networking website verifies a hyperlink in an entity webpage displayed by a social networking website. The hyperlink links to an external entity webpage. The software also verifies a hyperlink in the external entity webpage. This hyperlink links to the entity webpage displayed by the social networking website. The software receives user acknowledgements from users viewing the entity webpage on the social networking website. The software also receives user acknowledgements from users viewing the external entity webpage. And the software receives user acknowledgements associated with an ad relating to the entity. The software then calculates a sum of any user acknowledgements of the social-network entity webpage, any user acknowledgements of the external entity webpage, and any user acknowledgements associated with the ad. And the software causes the sum to be displayed on the social-network entity webpage, on the external entity webpage, and proximate to the ad. Receipt of a user acknowledgement from a user who is a member of the social networking website does not add the entity to any access control list associated with the user at the social networking website.
- This and other embodiments can include one or more of the following features. The acknowledgement can be received through a graphical user interface (GUI) button on the webpage. The acknowledgement can be confirmed with a GUI dialog box indicating that a user is acknowledging the entity, not the webpage being viewed by the user. Verifying a link can include verifying that the link is operational and that the webpage linked by the link is owned or controlled by the entity. Further, the software might display an image associated with a user who makes an acknowledgement, where the image is displayed on the first webpage, the second webpage, or both webpages. And the software might provide the combination for display in any search results that include the first webpage or the second webpage.

The servers might also be connected (e.g., by a storage area network (SAN)) to persistent storage that might include a redundant array of independent disks (RAID). In an alternative example embodiment, the servers inwebsite 104 and/or their volatile and persistent storage might be hosted wholly or partially off-site in the cloud, e.g., as a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) or an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). The servers atwebsites - In an example embodiment, users of
client devices website 104. Further, persistent storage atwebsite 104 might be used to store data related to user acknowledgements as described below, along with other webpage data and social networking data (e.g., profile data, stream data, access control lists or ACLs, etc.). And in an example embodiment, software running on one or more of the servers atwebsite 104 might execute some or all of the process operations described below. -
FIG. 1B is an architectural diagram, in accordance with an example embodiment. As depicted in this figure, one or more client devices (102 or 103) are displayingwebpages webpages - In an example embodiment,
webpage 107 might be a webpage displayed by or on behalf of an entity (e.g., an online retailer).Webpages Webpage 110 might be a webpage that is (1) associated with the entity and (2) that is displayed by a social networking website, e.g.,website 104. - In an example embodiment, software running on
website 104 might (a) sum user indications of acknowledgment, endorsement, disapproval, rating, sharing, etc. (such as a GUI-button click) fromwebpages Internet 101, and (c) store the sum for later updating inpersistent storage 112, using an internal network (e.g., a storage area network or SAN). In an example embodiment,website 104 might receive the user indications over theInternet 101 directly from software (e.g., a web browser or web-browser plugin) running on the client device or client devices displaying the webpages. In an alternative example embodiment,website 104 might receive the user indications over theInternet 101 or over an internal network (e.g., a local area network or LAN) in aggregated or disaggregated form from software running on another website 111 (e.g., a search engine website). -
FIG. 2 is a software diagram, in accordance with an example embodiment. As depicted in this diagram, a web browser orapp 201 running on a client device (e.g.,personal computer 102 or mobile device 103) communicates with afrontend 202 running on a web server at a social networking website. In an example embodiment, web browser orapp 201 might display a webpage (e.g., served up byserver 106 or server 108) that contains a GUI button (e.g., a “+1” button). In an example embodiment, the GUI button might be associated with a GUI tooltip that contains a textual message (e.g., “Click to +1”). If a user clicks on such a GUI button in web browser orapp 201, the click might be communicated to thefront end 202 and might cause all or part of the webpage to be redrawn to reflect the click (e.g., the GUI button might change color). Additionally, the GUI tooltip associated with the button might change its textual message (e.g., “Click to remove your +1.”) - Further, as depicted in
FIG. 2 ,frontend 202 communicates with a backend processor 203 (which is software and is also running on a server), using an Application Programming Interface (API). In an example embodiment, thebackend processor 203 might enforce policies related to the social networking website, e.g., a policies which distinguish between (1) users who are real persons and (2) users who are entities who have promotional interests that are adverse to the privacy interests of users who are real persons. Also, in an example embodiment,backend processor 203 might have access to persistent storage (e.g., persistent storage 105) which stores data related to both users who are real persons and users who are entities. For either type of user, that data might include (a) a user profile, (b) posts made by the user to a stream associated with the profile, and (c) access control lists (ACLs) and associated GUI widgets (e.g., implementing drag-and-drop functionality) which control access rights to the stream. -
FIG. 3 is a flowchart diagram of a process for displaying a user-acknowledgement count on a social networking webpage and an entity webpage, in accordance with an example embodiment. In an example embodiment, one or more of the operations in this process might be performed by software running on the servers atwebsite 104, e.g.,frontend 202 andbackend processor 203. Other operations might be performed by client software running onpersonal computer 102 ormobile device 103, e.g., web browser orapp 201. - As depicted in
FIG. 3 , the software (e.g., running on servers at website 104) verifies a hyperlink in an entity webpage displayed by a social networking website, inoperation 301. The hyperlink links to an external entity webpage for an entity such as an online retailer that engages in promotional activities. In an example embodiment, verification of the hyperlink might include a verification as to: (1) operability, e.g., the URL associated with the hyperlink is functional and loads the external entity webpage; and/or (2) identity, e.g., the external entity webpage is owned or controlled by the entity. In an example embodiment, verification as to identity might include parsing the URL to obtain a host and checking the host against an internal or external lookup table. Alternatively, verification as to identity might include transmitting the URL to a human verifier (e.g., on staff at the social networking website or working on a piecemeal basis through a crowdsourcing marketplace) and receiving a positive indication, e.g., as part of an online active learning system or other machine learning system. In another example embodiment, verification as to identity might make use of computer security software, e.g., anti-phishing software. - In other example embodiments, verification as to identity might be accomplished by verifying the hosting on the external website of a file specified by the social networking website. Or the software running on the social networking website might receive verification as to identity from an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system or some similar automated system that receives a PIN that is entered by the entity that owns or controls the social-network entity webpage. In another alternative example embodiment, verification as to identity might be accomplished through automated analysis of the content (including anchor, title, text, etc.) of the social-network entity webpage, the external entity webpage, or other webpages, possibly in conjunction with other web signals and/or search signals. Or verification as to identity might be accomplished through automated analysis of data maintained by software running on the social networking website, e.g., profiles for the social-network entity webpage and other users (e.g., real persons and/or entities), postings to the streams associated with those profiles, and/or social signals such as mentions that are associated with those postings.
- In
operation 302, the software performs a similar verification as to operability and identity on a hyperlink in the external entity webpage. This hyperlink links to the entity webpage displayed by the social network website. It will be appreciated that the two hyperlinks described inoperations - In
operation 303, the software receives user acknowledgements for the entity (e.g., an online retailer) from users viewing the entity webpage displayed by the social networking website. In an example embodiment, the user acknowledgement might result from a user clicking on a GUI button as described above. Further, the click might cause a confirmation dialog box to appear, indicating to the user that the user is acknowledging the entity, not the webpage that the user is viewing. In an alternative example embodiment, the entity webpage itself might indicate that clicking on the GUI button results in a user acknowledgement for the entity rather than the webpage that the user is viewing. Or a tooltip widget might indicate that clicking on the GUI button results in a user acknowledgement for the entity rather than the webpage that the user is viewing. In any case, receipt of a user acknowledgement from a user who is member of social networking website does not add the entity to any access control list (ACL) associated with the user at the social networking website. However, in an example embodiment, the confirmation dialog box described above or another dialog box might allow the user to add the entity to such an ACL. - In
operation 304, the software receives user acknowledgements for the entity (e.g., an online retailer) from users viewing the external entity webpage (e.g., the webpage displayed by an online retailer). Here again, in an example embodiment, the user acknowledgement might result from a user clicking on a GUI button as described above. Further, the click might cause a confirmation dialog box to appear, indicating to the user that the user is acknowledging the entity, not the webpage that the user is viewing. In an alternative example embodiment, the webpage itself might indicate that clicking on the GUI button results in a user acknowledgement for the entity rather than the webpage that the user is viewing. Or a tooltip widget might indicate that clicking on the GUI button results in a user acknowledgement for the entity rather than the webpage that the user is viewing. In any case, receipt of a user acknowledgement from a user who is member of social networking website does not add the entity to any access control list (ACL) associated with the user at the social networking website. However, in an example embodiment, the confirmation dialog box described above or another dialog box might allow the user to add the entity to such an ACL. - In
operation 305, the software calculates a sum of user acknowledgements from users viewing the social-network entity webpage and from users viewing the external entity webpage (e.g., displayed by an online retailer). Then inoperation 306, the software causes the sum to be displayed on the social-network entity webpage and on the external entity webpage, e.g., through a transmission to a web browser displaying one of the webpages. In an example, the sum might be displayed along with profile images of the acknowledging users, using a GUI widget, on either the social-network entity webpage, the external entity webpage, or both webpages. - In an example embodiment, user acknowledgements might include both approving user acknowledgements and disapproving user acknowledgements. In such an embodiment, the sum calculated in
operation 305 might involve treating approving user acknowledgements as positive values in the sum and treating disapproving user acknowledgements as negative values in the sum. -

Further, the click might cause a confirmation dialog box to appear, indicating to the user that the user is acknowledging the entity, not the webpage that the user is viewing. In an alternative example embodiment, the entity webpage itself might indicate that clicking on the GUI button results in a user acknowledgement for the entity rather than the webpage that the user is viewing. Or a tooltip widget might indicate that clicking on the GUI button results in a user acknowledgement for the entity rather than the webpage that the user is viewing. In any case, receipt of a user acknowledgement from a user who is member of social networking website does not add the entity to any access control list (ACL) associated with the user at the social networking website. However, in an example embodiment, the confirmation dialog box described above or another dialog box might allow the user to add the entity to such an ACL. - In
operation 404, the software receives user acknowledgements for the entity (e.g., an online retailer) from users viewing the external entity webpage (e.g., the webpage displayed by an online retailer). Here again, in an example embodiment, the user acknowledgement might result from a user clicking on a GUI button as described above.

Further, the click might cause a confirmation dialog box to appear, indicating to the user that the user is acknowledging the entity, not the webpage that the user is viewing. In an alternative example embodiment, the entity webpage itself might indicate that clicking on the GUI button results in a user acknowledgement for the entity rather than the webpage that the user is viewing. Or a tooltip widget might indicate that clicking on the GUI button results in a user acknowledgement for the entity rather than the webpage that the user is viewing. In any case, receipt of a user acknowledgement from a user who is member of social networking website does not add the entity to any access control list (ACL) associated with the user at the social networking website. However, in an example embodiment, the confirmation dialog box described above or another dialog box might allow the user to add the entity to such an ACL. - In
operation 504, the software receives user acknowledgements for the entity (e.g., an online retailer) from users viewing (1) the external entity webpage (e.g., the webpage displayed by an online retailer) or (2) an entity ad (e.g., an ad that promotes the entity). In an example embodiment, the entity ad might be presented as a display ad in a webpage displayed by an email website, proximate to a GUI button as described above. Here again, in an example embodiment, the user acknowledgement might result from a user clicking on a GUI button as described above. Further, the click might cause a confirmation dialog box to appear, indicating to the user that the user is acknowledging the entity, not the webpage or ad that the user is viewing. In an alternative example embodiment, the webpage itself might indicate that clicking on the GUI button results in a user acknowledgement for the entity rather than the webpage or ad that the user is viewing. Or a tooltip widget might indicate that clicking on the GUI button results in a user acknowledgement for the entity rather than the webpage or ad that the user is viewing. In any case, receipt of a user acknowledgement from a user who is member of social networking website does not add the entity to any access control list (ACL) associated with the user at the social networking website. However, in an example embodiment, the confirmation dialog box described above or another dialog box might allow the user to add the entity to such an ACL. - In
operation 505, the software calculates a sum of user acknowledgements from users viewing the social-network entity webpage, from users viewing the external entity webpage (e.g., displayed by an online retailer), and users viewing the ad. Then inoperation 506, the software causes the sum to be displayed on the social-network entity webpage and on the external entity webpage, e.g., through a transmission to a web browser displaying one of the webpages. In an example, the sum might be displayed along with profile images of the acknowledging users, on the social-network entity webpage, the external entity webpage, or both webpages. And inoperation 507, the software causes the sum to be displayed proximate to the ad, e.g., through a transmission to a web browser displaying the webpage with the ad. - In an example embodiment, user acknowledgements might include both approving user acknowledgements and disapproving user acknowledgements. In such an embodiment, the sum calculated in
operation 505 might involve treating approving user acknowledgements as positive values in the sum and treating disapproving user acknowledgements as negative values in the sum. -
FIG. 6 shows an entity webpage displayed by a social networking website, in accordance with an example embodiment. As depicted in this figure,entity webpage 601 is a webpage created by or on behalf of an entity (e.g., an online retailer), using text, images, video, sound, etc., which promote the entity. It will be appreciated thatentity webpage 601 is displayed by the social networking website. It is not displayed by the entity's website, e.g., online_retailer.com. It will be appreciated thatentity webpage 601 corresponds to the social-network entity webpage described inoperations operations - As shown in
FIG. 6 ,entity webpage 601 includes aGUI button 602 which allows a user to acknowledge (e.g., “+1”) the entity (e.g., an online_retailer).Entity webpage 601 also includes acount 603 of the number of user acknowledgements that the entity has received. As explained in detail above, count 603 will reflect clicks on theGUI button 603 and clicks on similar GUI buttons (e.g., GUI buttons that allow for user acknowledgement of the entity, as opposed to a webpage) on webpages displayed by the entity (e.g., at online_retailer.com). In an example embodiment, count 603 might also reflect clicks on similar buttons (e.g., GUI buttons that allow for user acknowledgement of the entity, as opposed to a webpage) proximate to an entity ad, e.g., on a webpage displayed by an email website. - With the above embodiments in mind, it should be understood that the disclosures might employ various computer-implemented operations involving data stored in computer systems.
