- Sharing photos has become an increasingly popular activity. For example, people attending the same event often share photos taken at the event with each other. People can share photos by using an online service (e.g., a social network), passing around memory cards, or via messaging (e.g., email, text message or the like). Social network systems often enable users to upload photos and to create photo albums containing the uploaded photos. Some social network systems may enable a user to apply tags such as captions or labels to photos.

- one or more predetermined criteria may include one or more image quality characteristics, one or more visual quality scores or the like.
- a user may wish to search a photo album or photo library for particular photos. For example the user may search for particular photos using a search query. In other implementations, user may search for particular photos by clicking on or selecting a label associated with given photos.
- system 102 may suggest a group of one or more labels (“suggested labels”) from the one or more labels to use as search terms in a search query.
- system 102 suggests labels based on one or more predefined suggestion criteria.
- system 102 implements the one or more predefined suggestion criteria to suggest labels that would most likely be interesting and/or useful to the user.
- system 102 uses the predefined suggestion criteria to suggest labels, where the labels may have varying degrees of relevancy to the user.
- system 102 may determine a relevancy score for each label based on various relevancy factors (e.g., the frequency with which the label is associated with given photos, how recently the label was associated with given photos, etc.). Example implementations directed to relevancy factors and other factors are described in more detail below.
- predefined suggestion criteria may include frequency criteria.
- system 102 may determine a label frequency count for one or more labels based on the number of times one or more labels is automatically associated with the photos.
- the system 102 may determine a label frequency count for one or more labels based on the number of times the label is manually associated by users with the photos. For example, system 102 may determine “#Shared” is a frequently used label based on frequency criteria, and accordingly suggest “#Shared” as a search term for a search query.
- predefined suggestion criteria may include temporal criteria.
- system 102 may determine how recently one or more labels were associated with the photos. For example, the user may have just recently applied the given label “#Dog” to particular photos. System 102 may then determine the suggested label “#Dog” as the search term for a search query to search the photos.
- predefined selection criteria may include interest criteria.
- system 102 may determine an interest level of one or more labels associated with the photos. For example, system 102 may assign a higher relevancy score to one or more labels corresponding to famous landmarks. For example, system 102 may determine the suggested label “#EmpireStateBuilding” based on a high relevancy score assigned to this famous landmark.
- predefined suggestion criteria may include user added criteria. For example, system 102 may assign a higher relevancy score to one or more labels manually added by the user versus one or more labels automatically added by system 102 .
- the predefined suggestion criteria may include social affinity criteria.
- the social affinity criteria may include whether the name of a friend or family member or the name of a social network group of the user is used as a given label (e.g., “#Joe,” “#Family,” etc.).
- System 102 may determine whether names used in one or more labels are friends or family members of the user based on a social graph of the user.
- System 102 may rank suggested labels based on the one or more predefined suggestion criteria. For example, system 102 may rank the suggested labels based on scores associated with relevance (e.g., frequency, temporal, interest, social affinity, or the like).
- relevance e.g., frequency, temporal, interest, social affinity, or the like.
- system 102 in block 206 may provide for presentation the suggested labels, based on predefined suggestion criteria to the user in a user interface.
- the user interface is a search interface provided for searching photos (e.g., in a photo album, photo library, social network system, or the like).
- User search queries may be processed using search techniques to generate search results of given photos.
- system 102 may present suggested labels that may be used as search terms, before the user even begins to initiate a search query in the user interface.
- system 102 may present interesting suggested labels or suggested labels with a high rank in the user interface.
- the user interface may include a text box, and the user may enter a search query into a text box.
- the user may select (e.g., click or tap) on the suggested labels presented in the user interface and system 102 then adds the selected labels as search terms in a text box.
- the user may then add additional terms manually to the text box prior to initiating a search.
- system 102 may suggest search terms for a search query based on initial characters, words, and/or phrases entered by the user into text box. For example, in some implementations, the user may enter “E” and system 102 may then suggest the “#EmpireStateBuilding” label as the search term.
- system 102 may suggest search terms using an autocomplete technique. For example, the user may enter “Emp” into the text box and system 102 may cause to display “ire State Building,” immediately adjacent to “Emp,” which if accepted by the user will cause system 102 to populate the text box with the suggested label “#Empire State Building.”
- suggested labels are provided for display in the user interface, by system 102 in an arrangement or manner that is based on a ranking of suggested labels according to one or more suggested criteria. For example, if label “#AutoBackUp” is associated more frequently with given photos than the label “#Email,” system 102 may cause “#AutoBackUp” to display in a higher position in a list of suggested labels in a user interface. In some implementations, system 102 may indicate a higher rank for a given suggested label by changing the manner of presentation of the given suggested label (e.g., highlight, underline, change color, or the like).
- the user may manually enter a search term into a user interface, and system 102 determines that the manually entered search term corresponds to an automatically associated label. Accordingly, system 102 may then suggest the automatically associated label to the user as a search term. For example, the user may be searching for images stored in a cloud drive or shared drive that the user manually previously tagged with the word “drive.” Accordingly, the user types the word “drive.” System may then suggest the suggested label “#Drive,” which was previously automatically associated by system 102 with all photos uploaded to the cloud drive or shared drive. If the user includes the suggested label “#Drive” as a search term, system 102 will return all photos associated with the label “#Drive.”
- relevancy scores and corresponding ranks of suggested labels may be partially based on the use and selection of suggested labels in the user search interface.
- system 102 may increase the rank of suggested labels or modify the rank based on selection and use of particular suggested labels in the user search interface.
- system 102 may increase the rank of suggested labels that the user enters or clicks on more frequently in the user search interface.
- suggested labels could be provided for display in any suitable type of user interface that displays the photos.
- the user may be viewing the photos in a photo library or photo album.
- System 102 may cause suggested labels to be displayed on or near the photos. See, e.g., FIG. 4 and corresponding description below.
- actions that a user takes with respect to one or more labels while viewing photos may be used to modify the rank of suggested labels. For example, if a user selects a given suggested label to be associated with the photos, system 102 may increase the rank of that selected suggested label. In some implementations, if the user deletes or removes a label from given photos, system 102 may decrease the rank of the corresponding suggested label.
- system when the user performs or executes a search using suggested labels, system will return corresponding search results of photos associated with the labels.
- Implementations described herein provide various benefits. For example, implementations may facilitate the labeling or tagging of photos.

FIG. 5 is a diagram of an example user interface for providing labels for photos in accordance with some implementations. - Implementations described herein relate to providing labels for photos. As described in more detail below, in some implementations, a system receives photos from users (e.g., users of a social network system). The system then associates one or more labels with the photos based on one or more predetermined criteria. For example, in some implementations, the predetermined criteria may include a determination that photos have been automatically backed up to a photo library. The system may then associate a label (e.g., “#AutoBackup”) with the photos. Other example implementations of predetermined criteria are described in more detail below.
- In some implementations, the system suggests labels from the one or more labels to be used as search terms. The system may then present the suggested search terms in a user interface. The system may associate a “#” or hashtag character with the label. The “#” can be used with any label, and assist in making the label searchable by providing a common identifier so that labels can be searched in groups. For example, a user may search for photos based on one or more labels, and the system may suggest “#PhotosofMe” as a search term. In an example implementation, when the user selects “#PhotosofMe” the system performs a search of the photos and returns given photos associated with the label “#PhotosofMe.”

FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of anexample network environment 100, which may be used to implement the implementations described herein. In some implementations,network environment 100 includes asystem 102, which includes acomputing device 104 and asocial network database 106. In various implementations, theterm system 102 and phrase “social network system” may be used interchangeably.Network environment 100 also includesclient devices system 102.Network environment 100 also includes anetwork 150. - For ease of illustration,
FIG. 1 shows one block for each ofsystem 102,computing device 104, andsocial network database 106, and shows four blocks forclient devices Blocks network environment 100 may not have all of the components shown and/or may have other elements including other types of elements instead of, or in addition to, those shown herein. - In various implementations, users U1, U2, U3, and U4 may communicate with each other using
respective client devices respective client devices -
FIG. 2 illustrates an example simplified flow diagram for providing labels for photos, according to some implementations. Referring to bothFIGS. 1 and 2 , a method is initiated inblock 202, wheresystem 102 receives photos.System 102 may receive the photos from one or more users (e.g., users of a social network system). In various implementations, the photos may be received when a given user uploads photos tosystem 102 or after the user adds the photos to photo albums and/or photo libraries. In some implementations,system 102 may enable a camera device (e.g., a camera-equipped smart phone) of the user to automatically upload photos tosystem 102 as the camera device captures photos. - In
block 204,system 102 associates labels sometimes referred to as tags, and/or hash tags (“#’) with the photos. In various implementations,system 102 automatically associates labels with photos based on one or more predetermined criteria. For example, one or more predetermined criteria may be based on the source of given photos. For example, in various implementations the source of given photos may be an automatic backup from a device.System 102 may then associate the label “#AutoBackup” with the photos. - In some implementations, the source of given photos may be a shared drive on a server.
System 102 may then associate the label “#Drive” with the photos. In some implementations, the source of given photos may be that the photos were received via email from another user.System 102 may then associate the label “#Email” with the photos. - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos are attached to a post, and that a user is associated with the post. In some implementations, the user may be associated with the post by being a recipient of the post and/or being mentioned in the post. In some implementations, the user may be associated with the post by being in one or more photos attached to the post. In some implementations,
system 102 may utilize a recognition algorithm to determine if the user is in one or more of the photos.System 102 may then associate the label “#FromPosts” with the photos. - In some implementations the source of given photos may be a particular device.
System 102 may then associate the label of the type and/or brand of the device with the photos (e.g. “#FromMobile,” “#FromWearable,” “#FromBrandCamera,” or the like).System 102 may also associate a label representing one or more camera details (e.g., make, model, lens type or the like) with a photo. A user could then search photos by clicking (or tapping) on the name of a camera (or camera detail) in a photo details user interface (e.g.,FIG. 5 ). - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may be based on the visibility of given photos. For example, in various implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos are directly shared with the user, and wherein the one or more photos are shared by one or more other users who have a social affinity that meet a predetermined social affinity threshold.
System 102 may then associate the label “#Shared” with the photos. - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos are not shared with other users.
System 102 may then associate the label “#Unshared” with the photos. - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that a user has manually associated a label with one or more photos. For example,
system 102 may provide for display (e.g., on a user device) a user interface that allows the user to enter text for label and thensystem 102 associates the label with the given photos.System 102 may then associate the label “#UserLabel” with the photos, in addition to the existing label that the user created. This enables a user to search all photos that are labeled by the user. - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos are attached to a post and the user is tagged in one or more of the attached photos.
System 102 may then associate the label “#Tagged” with the photos. - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may be based on the ownership of given photos. For example, in various implementations the user and other users may upload photos to a shared album. In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that the user uploaded the photos, and
system 102 may then associate the label “#MyPhotos” with the photos. In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that other users uploaded the photos to the shared album, andsystem 102 may then associate the label “#FromContacts” with the photos. In some implementations, the other users are part of a social network group andsystem 102 may then also associate the label “#FromGroups” with the photos. - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may be based on the editing and/or image processing of given photos. For example, in various implementations the user (or an image processing system) may edit, enhance, crop or change photos. In
various implementations system 102 may then associate corresponding labels with photos (e.g., “#Edited,” “#Enhanced,” “#Cropped,” or the like). - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that the photos were captured during an event, and that the user attended the event. In various implementations, an event may be any meeting or gathering of people in a geographic location, or at or around a given date and time. Such events may include conventions, parties, meetings, online video conferences or the like.
- In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that the photos do not include any user applied labels or automatically associated labels.
System 102 may then associate the label “#Unlabeled” with the photos. In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that one or more photos include an associated label, andsystem 102 may then associate the label “#Labeled” with the photos. The automatically associated labels may be taken from a “whitelist” of preapproved labels. - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination to apply a general label to all the photos (e.g., “#All”).
- In various example implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that the photos show images of the user. In some implementations,
system 102 may utilize a recognition algorithm to determine if the user is in a given photo. In an implementation,system 102 may then associate the label “#PhotosOfMe” with photos that show an image of the user. - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include a determination that the photos show particular features, objects, colors, and/or landmarks based on a recognition algorithm. In an implementation,
system 102 may then associate labels corresponding to recognized features (e.g., “#Tree,” “#Car,” “#EmpireStateBuilding”). - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include location information about where the photos were captured. In some implementations, location information may be obtained from a device (e.g., based on global positioning system (GPS) or other location determining capabilities of a device) that automatically updates
system 102 with device location. In one implementation,system 102 may determine device location based on a user's social check-in data. In some implementations,system 102 may detect location information based on geotagging, landmark recognition, or any other suitable means. - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include temporal information about the time where the photos were captured. In some implementations time may be obtained from a device, from
system 102, based on GPS capabilities of a device, social check-in data, or any other suitable means. - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include calendar data about the particular day the photos were captured. In some implementations the photos may have been captured on a holiday. In some implementations,
system 102 may automatically associate tags related to the holiday (e.g., “#Halloween,” “#Christmas,” “#Thanksgiving,” or the like). - In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include whether a photo is a featured content photo, a social engagement measure (e.g., a high popularity score, received a lot of attention on a social network, has been re-shared or re-posted a given amount or the like). In some implementations, one or more predetermined criteria may include one or more image quality characteristics, one or more visual quality scores or the like.
- In some implementations, a user may wish to search a photo album or photo library for particular photos. For example the user may search for particular photos using a search query. In other implementations, user may search for particular photos by clicking on or selecting a label associated with given photos.
- In
block 206,system 102 may suggest a group of one or more labels (“suggested labels”) from the one or more labels to use as search terms in a search query. In some implementations,system 102 suggests labels based on one or more predefined suggestion criteria. In various implementations described herein,system 102 implements the one or more predefined suggestion criteria to suggest labels that would most likely be interesting and/or useful to the user. - In various implementations,
system 102 uses the predefined suggestion criteria to suggest labels, where the labels may have varying degrees of relevancy to the user. In various implementations,system 102 may determine a relevancy score for each label based on various relevancy factors (e.g., the frequency with which the label is associated with given photos, how recently the label was associated with given photos, etc.). Example implementations directed to relevancy factors and other factors are described in more detail below. - For example, in some implementations predefined suggestion criteria may include frequency criteria. In various implementations,
system 102 may determine a label frequency count for one or more labels based on the number of times one or more labels is automatically associated with the photos. In other implementations, thesystem 102 may determine a label frequency count for one or more labels based on the number of times the label is manually associated by users with the photos. For example,system 102 may determine “#Shared” is a frequently used label based on frequency criteria, and accordingly suggest “#Shared” as a search term for a search query. - In some implementations, predefined suggestion criteria may include temporal criteria. In various implementations,
system 102 may determine how recently one or more labels were associated with the photos. For example, the user may have just recently applied the given label “#Dog” to particular photos.System 102 may then determine the suggested label “#Dog” as the search term for a search query to search the photos. - In some implementations, predefined selection criteria may include interest criteria. In various implementations,
system 102 may determine an interest level of one or more labels associated with the photos. For example,system 102 may assign a higher relevancy score to one or more labels corresponding to famous landmarks. For example,system 102 may determine the suggested label “#EmpireStateBuilding” based on a high relevancy score assigned to this famous landmark. - In some implementations, predefined suggestion criteria may include user added criteria. For example,
system 102 may assign a higher relevancy score to one or more labels manually added by the user versus one or more labels automatically added bysystem 102. - In various implementations, the predefined suggestion criteria may include social affinity criteria. For example, the social affinity criteria may include whether the name of a friend or family member or the name of a social network group of the user is used as a given label (e.g., “#Joe,” “#Family,” etc.).
System 102 may determine whether names used in one or more labels are friends or family members of the user based on a social graph of the user. -
System 102 may rank suggested labels based on the one or more predefined suggestion criteria. For example,system 102 may rank the suggested labels based on scores associated with relevance (e.g., frequency, temporal, interest, social affinity, or the like). - Referring again to
FIG. 2 ,system 102 inblock 206 may provide for presentation the suggested labels, based on predefined suggestion criteria to the user in a user interface. In some implementations, the user interface is a search interface provided for searching photos (e.g., in a photo album, photo library, social network system, or the like). User search queries may be processed using search techniques to generate search results of given photos. - In some implementations,
system 102 may present suggested labels that may be used as search terms, before the user even begins to initiate a search query in the user interface. For example,system 102 may present interesting suggested labels or suggested labels with a high rank in the user interface. For example, the user interface may include a text box, and the user may enter a search query into a text box. In some implementations, the user may select (e.g., click or tap) on the suggested labels presented in the user interface andsystem 102 then adds the selected labels as search terms in a text box. In some implementations, the user may then add additional terms manually to the text box prior to initiating a search. - In some implementations, the user may simply select (e.g., click or tap) on the suggested labels presented in the user interface and
system 102 immediately initiates a search based on the selected suggested labels and returns given photos in the search results. In some implementations,system 102 may suggest search terms for a search query based on initial characters, words, and/or phrases entered by the user into text box. For example, in some implementations, the user may enter “E” andsystem 102 may then suggest the “#EmpireStateBuilding” label as the search term. - In some
implementations system 102 may suggest search terms using an autocomplete technique. For example, the user may enter “Emp” into the text box andsystem 102 may cause to display “ire State Building,” immediately adjacent to “Emp,” which if accepted by the user will causesystem 102 to populate the text box with the suggested label “#Empire State Building.” - In some implementations, suggested labels are provided for display in the user interface, by
system 102 in an arrangement or manner that is based on a ranking of suggested labels according to one or more suggested criteria. For example, if label “#AutoBackUp” is associated more frequently with given photos than the label “#Email,”system 102 may cause “#AutoBackUp” to display in a higher position in a list of suggested labels in a user interface. In some implementations,system 102 may indicate a higher rank for a given suggested label by changing the manner of presentation of the given suggested label (e.g., highlight, underline, change color, or the like). - In some implementations, the user may manually enter a search term into a user interface, and
system 102 determines that the manually entered search term corresponds to an automatically associated label. Accordingly,system 102 may then suggest the automatically associated label to the user as a search term. For example, the user may be searching for images stored in a cloud drive or shared drive that the user manually previously tagged with the word “drive.” Accordingly, the user types the word “drive.” System may then suggest the suggested label “#Drive,” which was previously automatically associated bysystem 102 with all photos uploaded to the cloud drive or shared drive. If the user includes the suggested label “#Drive” as a search term,system 102 will return all photos associated with the label “#Drive.” - In various implementations, relevancy scores and corresponding ranks of suggested labels may be partially based on the use and selection of suggested labels in the user search interface. For example,
system 102 may increase the rank of suggested labels or modify the rank based on selection and use of particular suggested labels in the user search interface. For example,system 102 may increase the rank of suggested labels that the user enters or clicks on more frequently in the user search interface. - In some implementations, suggested labels could be provided for display in any suitable type of user interface that displays the photos. For example, the user may be viewing the photos in a photo library or photo album.
System 102 may cause suggested labels to be displayed on or near the photos. See, e.g.,FIG. 4 and corresponding description below. - In some implementations, actions that a user takes with respect to one or more labels while viewing photos may be used to modify the rank of suggested labels. For example, if a user selects a given suggested label to be associated with the photos,
system 102 may increase the rank of that selected suggested label. In some implementations, if the user deletes or removes a label from given photos,system 102 may decrease the rank of the corresponding suggested label. - In various implementations, when the user performs or executes a search using suggested labels, system will return corresponding search results of photos associated with the labels.
- Implementations described herein provide various benefits. For example, implementations may facilitate the labeling or tagging of photos. Implementations may enable users to expedite searches for photos with minimal effort by users Implementations may enable users to more efficiently organize photos. Implementations may enable users to obtain relevant search results when searching photo libraries and albums. Implementations described herein may also increase overall engagement among users in a social networking environment. Implementations described herein may increase the ease of tagging photos on mobile devices or wearable computers.
- Although implementations generally describe labels aiding users in searching photos, other uses for labeling are possible, such as systems automatically grouping and/or displaying like-labeled photos together. While image files are described in these implementations, other types of files are also possible (e.g., video files). Although the steps, operations, or computations in the method implementations described herein may be presented in a specific order, the order may be changed in particular implementations. Other orderings of the steps are possible, depending on the particular implementation. In some particular implementations, multiple steps shown as sequential in this specification may be performed at the same time. Also, some implementations may not have all of the steps shown and/or may have other steps instead of, or in addition to, those shown herein.
- While
system 102 is described as performing the steps as described in the implementations herein, any suitable component or combination of components ofsystem 102 or any suitable processor or processors associated withsystem 102 may perform the steps described. - In various implementations,
system 102 may utilize a variety of image recognition algorithms to recognize faces, landmarks, objects, etc. in photos. Such recognition algorithms may be integral tosystem 102.System 102 may also access recognition algorithms provided by software that is external tosystem 102 and thatsystem 102 accesses. - In various implementations,
system 102 may be configured to enable users of the social network system to specify and/or consent to the use of personal information, which may include thesystem 102 using their faces in photos or using their identity information in recognizing people identified in photos. For example,system 102 may provide users with multiple selections directed to specifying and/or consenting to the use of personal information. For example, selections with regard to specifying and/or consenting may be associated with individual photos, all photos, individual photo albums, all photo albums, etc. The selections may be implemented in a variety of ways. For example,system 102 may cause buttons or check boxes to be displayed next to various selections. In one implementation,system 102 enables users of the social network to specify and/or consent to the use of their photos for facial recognition in general. -

FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an example machine learning process for providing labels in accordance with some implementations. Processing begins at 402, where an indication of one or more user actions with respect to photo labels is received. The indication can represent a user action of adding a label, deleting an automatically selected label, or modifying an automatically selected label. Indications can be collected from multiple users and aggregated to provide a statistical view of user actions related to photo labels. Processing continues to 404. - At 404, automatic labeling techniques and/or parameters are updated based on the user action statistical information. For example, the user action statistical information can be provided to a machine learning system. The automatic photo labeling system can be tuned using output from the machine learning system in order to better select labels for photos. The aggregating of user action indications and updating of the automatic labeling system can be performed periodically in order to help improve the accuracy of the photo labeling system.
-
FIG. 5 is a diagram of anexample user interface 500 for providing labels for photos in accordance with some implementations. Theuser interface 500 includes amap portion 502 showing a selected photo 504 (as a thumbnail image) and plurality ofother photos 506 on the map. Theuser interface 500 also includes alabel section 508 having one ormore labels 510 and anedit element 512. In operation, a user can view the automatically selected labels (e.g., 510) in thelabel section 508 and then select (e.g., click or tap) theedit element 512 in order to edit thelabels 510. Editing operations can include adding new labels, deleting a label or modifying a label. Also, when one of thelabels 510 is selected by a user (e.g., by clicking or tapping), the system can search photos for any having the selected label. - The user interface also includes an
album name section 514 listing names of any albums the selected photo belongs to. Theuser interface 500 also includes anauthor section 516 listing the author's name and any comments from the author that accompanied the posting of the image, and acommenter section 518 listing comment information (e.g., name, comment or snippet of comment, date/time of comment or the like). - The
user interface 500 can also include information sections for date image was captured 520,image filename 522 and camera model information (e.g., make, model, lens, settings or the like) 524. - The
user interface 500 can provide a user experience that combines automatic photo labeling with manual labeling. For example, a user can add or remove labels and can also edit to make corrections or additions to automatically selected labels. The system can receive indications of the manual actions of the users with respect to the labels. Using these indications, the system can perform machine learning (e.g., unsupervised, semi-supervised or supervised) to adapt techniques used for labeling photos for specific users and/or in general. - When performing searches or displays of labels, the system can be configured to show a group of labels (e.g., 4 or 5 labels) to a user that have been determined by the system to be of particular interest to the user. Thus, there can be a given number of labels (e.g., 4 or 5) presented that can include labels that are likely candidates for searching photos by the user. For example, if a photo is determined by the system to include a person, it may be advantageous to continue on to identify the person if possible and include a label of the person's name rather than just a generic label (e.g., #person).
- In another example, if a user takes a photo of a landmark at a park that includes an image of the sky, the system can determine that a label including the name of the landmark or the park may be more descriptive and a better label for searching than a generic label (e.g., #sky).
- Also, in some implementations, photos can be labeled or tagged as a batch. When performing batch labeling, the user can be given an option to remove individual photos from the batch before the label is applied. For example, the system has determined that a group of photos can be tagged as snow based on the photo characteristics, but the 4th image is a white sheet and the 10th image is a wedding dress. The user can be provided with an interface that permits the user to exclude the 4th and 10th images from having the label “#snow” applied by the system.
- Although the description has been described with respect to particular embodiments thereof, these particular embodiments are merely illustrative, and not restrictive. Concepts illustrated in the examples may be applied to other examples and implementations.
- Note that the functional blocks, methods, devices, and systems described in the present disclosure may be integrated or divided into different combinations of systems, devices, and functional blocks as would be known to those skilled in the art.
