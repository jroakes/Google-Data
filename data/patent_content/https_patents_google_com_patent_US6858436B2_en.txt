Definitions
- the present invention generally relates to spectroscopy and chromatography. More particularly, the present invention concerns a system and method for near-field transform detection of non-propagative evanescent phenomena.
- NF Near-field radiation
- FF far-field radiation
- all illuminated objects have both NF and FF components; however, most conventional spectroscopic methods generally avail themselves to diffraction-limited propagative components in the FF.
- Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscopes (e.g., SNOM or NSOM) generally use sharp (e.g., sub-wavelength) probe tips in order to image at sub-wavelength optical resolution.
- sharp (e.g., sub-wavelength) probe tips in order to image at sub-wavelength optical resolution. See, for example, D. W. Pohl et al., “ Optical ⁇ ⁇ Sthetoscopy ⁇ ⁇ Image ⁇ ⁇ Recording ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ With ⁇ ⁇ Resolution ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ 20 ” , Appl Phys. Lett. 44, 651-653, 1984.
- The, spatial resolution that may be achieved is generally defined by the size and shape of the probe tip.
- SPM also more generally includes a growing number of high resolution surface microscopy techniques (including NSOM) that use non-metrically sharp probe tips maintained very close to or even touching the sample surface and scanned in the xy plane of the sample using a combination of, for example, piezoelectric transducers, stepper motors and/or the like.
- NSOM surface microscopy techniques
- NF light generally may not be used to directly image a sample
- the interaction of NF light on a sample with a sharp sub-wavelength probe may be exploited to “scan” an image of the sample's surface.
- the sample is illuminated with FF light, either from the top surface (or, alternatively, with back-side illumination) which produces a NF on the top surface of a transparent sample. See, for example, F. Zenhausern et al., “Apertureless Near Field Optical Microscope”, Appl. Phys. Lett., 65(13), 1623, 1994.
- FF light from a surface area approximately equivalent to the terminal cross-sectional area of the probe tip.
- the scattered FF light propagates away from the probe site for subsequent detection by, for example, interferometric means. If the probe size is smaller than the wavelength of the light incident on the sample and the probe is xy scanned at a correspondingly fine scale over the sample surface, an image having finer resolution than the wavelength may be “built-up”. If the probe is made with a tip having a terminal cross-sectional diameter on the order of about 100 nm and scanned at 100 nm intervals, in principle, 100 nm optical resolution may be achieved—much better than conventional FF light-optical techniques. See, for example, E. Betzig and J. K. Trautmais, Science, 257, 189, 1992.
- imaging e.g., detection
- FF spectrochemical techniques such as absorbance, fluorescence and chemiluminescence methods, have been generally well known in the art with the vast majority of these methods adapted for single-point detection at or near the end of a chromatographic column.
- the separation mechanisms generally operate over a duration of time and length of column (e.g., chromatographic field) such that the sample is resolved into component analytes which may then be interrogated by a detector, usually at a fixed position in the column-flow based on, for example, the physical and/or chemical properties desired in order to yield an analyte signal recorded over the separation.
- the analyte output is thus collected in a chromatographic domain (e.g., “time domain”), such as the signal obtained, for example, in an electropherogram and/or the like.
- the chromatogram is a convolved reducible expression of the detection function F(d) (in most cases, a Dirac delta function ⁇ ) in combination with the separation function F(s).
- Prior art spectroscopic methods have generally employed means for detecting small scale phenomena that typically involve the reduction of incident wavelength (DeBroglie or otherwise) in order to achieve enhanced spectroscopic resolution. While these approaches may be acceptable in certain FF (e.g., “radiatively propagative”) systems, the broader application of chromatographic and spectroscopic technologies presents previously unresolved problems, for example, with respect to imaging below the diffraction limit of available FF methods. Accordingly, a representative limitation of the prior art concerns inter alia the effective and efficient NF detection of sub-diffraction-limited scale phenomena in, for example, a convolved G (F(d),F(s)) detection/separation domain.
- FF e.g., “radiatively propagative”
- the present invention provides a system and method for near-field spectroscopic interrogation of sub-diffraction-limited scale phenomena.

- the present invention also provides for increased sample throughput, with the utilization of multiplex detection and time-to-frequency transform methods, as well as single-molecule detection sensitivity.
- Other exemplary embodiments include detection systems and/or methods suitably adapted to employ apertureless NF generation.
- a system is configured to transform time-domain signal input into frequency-domain output in order to achieve sub-diffraction-limited scale detection or imaging of analytes within a heterogeneous multi-component sample without requiring inter alia pre-conditioning of the initial starting conditions at the time of sample loading.
- Near-field transform spectroscopy also provides for a new regime of analyte-specific information by exploiting higher frequency information in the localized region of non-propagative evanescent fields.
- the disclosed system and method may be readily adapted for parallel processing of samples and may be optionally implemented with cyclic chromatography to increase resolution in conjunction with faster separations.
- the disclosed system and method may also be optionally coupled with, for example, DNA micro-arrays and on-chip light sources.
- the present invention may further embody an integrated module for real-time monitoring and quantification of, for example: biomolecular reporters; chemical, luminescent, and/or magnetic tags, etc.; nucleic acid concentrations; PCR kinetics; flow-velocities; analyte mobilities and various epigenomic applications and/or the like.

- the terms “near-field”, “NF”, “diffraction-limited”, “small scale”, “sub-diffraction-limited”, “evanescent” and “forbidden light”, or any variation or combination thereof, are generally intended to include anything that may be regarded as at least being susceptible to characterization as generally referring to: (1) radiation that does not propagate away from a sample, but rather is localized near the surface of the sample; (2) non-propagative radiation that oscillates in a localized vicinity near the surface of an object; (3) spatial constraints at least on the order of magnitude corresponding to the localized areas described in either of the immediately preceding elements (1) or (2) vide supra; (4) effective resolution on the order of magnitude corresponding to the localized areas described in either of the immediately preceding elements (1) or (2) supra; wherein said radiation comprises at least one of particle beam radiation, particle radiation (e.g., DeBroglie radiation), wave radiation, wave-packet radiation, electromagnetic radiation and/or any other radiative energy now known or hereafter derived or otherwise described by those skilled in the art.
- the terms “radiative” and “propagative” are generally not used interchangeably, unless otherwise indicated.
- “radiative” energy may be generally understood to comprise NF and FF components, whereas “propagative” energy may be generally understood as referring to FF radiation.
- chromatography and “separation”, or any contextual or combinative referents or variants thereof, are generally intended to include any method, technique, process, apparatus, device or system suitably adapted to separate or otherwise process at least one sample comprising at least one analyte in order to inter alia produce or otherwise condition the spatial and/or temporal distribution of any component analyte and/or combination of analyte components in said sample.

- NF transform spectroscopy may be employed to ascertain and/or realize any number of other benefits associated with NF transform spectroscopy such as, but not limited to: improvement of signal averaging; improvement of S/N; reduced preparation and/or preconditioning of heterogeneous samples; improved sample loading; improvement in sample throughput; sample multiplexing and/or parallel sample processing; utilization of cyclic chromatography; faster analyte separation; integration with micro-array assay techniques and/or systems; improved detection sensitivity; access to new spectral information; increased resolution; real-time monitoring and/or analyte detection; particle velocimetry; microfluidic sample transport; single-molecule detection; mass data media storage; in situ monitoring of a chemical polishing process (i.e., CMP); and any other applications now known or hereafter developed or otherwise described in the art.
- CMP chemical polishing process
- FF optical systems employing lenses or mirrors are intrinsically limited in terms of spatial—resolution even with highly optimized designs.
- This limit is commonly known as the diffraction limit or “Abbé's limit”, after the 19 th Century optical researcher who first described the optical imaging process in terms of the diffraction of light waves.
- Reducing the wavelength ⁇ can improve the resolution, as can using oil/solid immersion lenses with larger indices of refraction (e.g., n>1.0). See, for example, S. M. Mansfield and G. S. Kino, Appl. Phys. Lett., 57, 2615, 1990. It should be noted, however, that the actual experimental FF resolution is often lower than the theoretical diffraction limit due to inter alia aberrations caused by non-ideal optical elements.
- Optimal resolutions may usually be obtained by scanning confocal microscopy where the image of an illuminating aperture in the sample plane coincides with a “back-focused” image of the exit aperture.
- the size of the illumination and detection spots are generally diffraction limited, the effective resolution obtained by the combination of the two is typically enhanced by a factor of about ⁇ square root over (2) ⁇ .
- the illumination spot may be scanned, for example, by translating the sample.
- confocal FF microscopy also permits imaging of planes at varying depths within the sample.
- the light field at the surface of an object typically contains more information (e.g., higher spatial frequencies) than may be imaged with conventional optical techniques.
- Spatial frequencies that reach the imaging lens e.g., propagative low-frequency energy passing through the numerical aperture
- higher spatial frequencies exist at the sample surface, but decay exponentially within a distance generally less than that of the incident wavelength.
- These high spatial frequencies are termed the “near-field” (NF); which is to say that the detector must be very near to the probe region in order to measure them.
- NF near-field
- the process of low-frequency light propagating away from the sample surface generally filters out the fine near-field details.
- FF far-field
- light waves propagate in a direction normal to the sample surface or through an aperture larger than the wavelength for detection at a distance >> ⁇ .
- FF light comprises wave vectors k z with real components in the propagation direction z, called homogeneous waves or “allowed” light.
- the graph 105 in FIG. 1 illustrates the relationship between the parallel wavenumber vectors k 81 120 and the field strength E 110 ; with the wavelength/aperture in reciprocal units 1 ⁇ (increasing from left to right on the abscissa).
- FF radiation generally refers to propagative radiation 230 as illustrated, for, example, in FIG. 2 .
- an aperture grating 208 is exposed to a source of radiant energy 200 wherein the grating's aperture width a FF 205 is generally larger than the incident wavelength ⁇ 210 .
- the resulting energy pattern 230 that develops on the opposing surface of the grating 208 propagates away from the grating in what is termed the “far-field”.
- the effective FF resolution 250 is typically on the order of magnitude of the wavelength ⁇ . Accordingly, in FF processes, the wavelength ⁇ generally defines the minimum resolvable spatial resolution (e.g., the diffraction limit of optical and spectroscopic resolution).
- NF radiation comprises radiation 240 that does not propagate through space, but rather is localized “near” the surface of objects.
- a NF aperture grating 218 is exposed to a source of radiant energy 202 wherein the grating's aperture width a NF 215 is generally smaller than the incident wavelength ⁇ 220 .
- the resulting energy pattern 240 that emerges on the opposing surface of the grating 218 is localized to a relatively small area in which the energy oscillates back and forth in what is referred to as the “near-field”.
- the effective resolution 255 in the NF regime typically corresponds to the order of magnitude of the near-field aperture a NF 215 .
- NF light has wave vectors with imaginary k z components 170 perpendicular to the apertures 102 , 103 and 104 which do not propagate in that direction, but may still propagate parallel to it.
- the waves decay in the parallel direction within a short space, e.g., less than the wavelength ⁇ , and are accordingly called “evanescent” or “forbidden”. Detecting them requires working in this small “near-field region” near the sample.
- the volume of FF light traveling through a large aperture 150 is generally much larger than the NF light that travels through a sub-wavelength aperture 160 : notice the area under the curve 190 (e.g., the profile for a NF aperture a NF 160 ) as compared to the area under the curve 185 (e.g., the profile for an aperture a 0 155 having dimensions on the order of the wavelength ⁇ ) and the area under the curve 180 (e.g., the profile for a FF aperture a FF 150 ); all to the right of k 0 130 , corresponding to the imaginary components of k z 170 in the NF.
- the area under the curve 190 e.g., the profile for a NF aperture a NF 160
- the area under the curve 180 e.g., the profile for a FF aperture a FF 150
- Physically constrained light involved in the imaging and/or detection of sample features smaller than ⁇ generally comprises a spectrum of waves with wavenumber vectors (e.g., spatial frequencies) smaller in real space than the wavelength or aperture elements themselves.
- wavenumber vectors e.g., spatial frequencies
- the k 0 “cut-off” 130 (corresponding to an aperture dimension a 0 155 on the order of the wavelength ⁇ as shown, for example, in 104 ) is generally not distinct due to the overlap between the FF and NF regions.
- the NF may be said to comprise the regime of “less than a wavelength” 145 while the FF generally corresponds to the regime of “more than a wavelength” 140 .
- NF phenomena sub-diffraction limited localized oscillations of high spatial frequencies
- Any energy emission, whether in the form of field fluctuations or localized matter-wave packets having finite, non-zero momentum (i.e., DeBroglie matter waves) may be shown to demonstrate propagating FF components that carry energy away from the source/sample as well as asymptotically decaying NF evanescent components confined to the close vicinity of the source/sample.
- any energy transport process may be used to produce localized near-fields, to include, but not limited to: electromagnetic radiation, monochromatic radiation, polychromatic radiation, polarized radiation, circularly-polarized radiation, coherent radiation, incoherent radiation, particle beams, visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, radio waves, microwaves, x-rays, gamma-rays and such other energy transport processes (generally termed “radiation”) now known or hereafter derived or otherwise described by those skilled in the art.
- electromagnetic radiation monochromatic radiation, polychromatic radiation, polarized radiation, circularly-polarized radiation, coherent radiation, incoherent radiation, particle beams, visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, radio waves, microwaves, x-rays, gamma-rays and such other energy transport processes (generally termed “radiation”) now known or hereafter derived or otherwise described by those skilled in the art.
- the electromagnetic field of an oscillating electric dipole may be considered.
- the 1 R 2 ⁇ ⁇ and ⁇ ⁇ 1 R 3 terms may be neglected to the extent that they are generally dominated by the 1 R contribution.
- the R 2 and R 3 terms dominate, representing the NF high spatial frequencies. Accordingly, it is relatively straightforward to demonstrate that the corresponding surface integral of the NF Poynting vector over a sphere of radius R vanishes in the limit of R ⁇ . Of particular interest is that this integral does not vanish at finite radius, which means that non-propagative energy transport, in fact, does take place. However, since none of the high spatial frequency energy propagatively emanates from the source, the NF energy oscillates back and forth within a region termed the “NF zone”. It is also of interest to note that unlike the FF, the NF does not vanish along the dipole axis.
- the resulting electromagnetic fields may be much more complicated to calculate.
- Light propagation behind objects i.e., apertures, gratings, etc.
- scalar diffraction theory e.g., Fourier optics
- the scalar amplitude of the electric and magnetic fields are treated and the vectorial nature of the electromagnetic field is generally neglected.
- the existence of evanescent waves in the NF may be generally modeled, at least qualitatively, by scalar Fourier optic theory.
- z ⁇ e.g., the Fraunhofer diffraction limit
- U ⁇ ( x , y , z ⁇ ⁇ ) 1 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ A 0 ⁇ ( k ⁇ x z , k ⁇ y z ) .
- These components may be regarded as qualitative metrics of the NF comprising information of sub-wavelength structures in the object plane.
- the information about these structures is, in fact, lost.
- Tswett employed the technique to separate various plant pigments (i.e., chlorophylls and xanthophylls) by passing solutions of samples through a glass column packed with finely divided calcium carbonate. The separated solutes appeared as colored bands on the column, which accounts for the name Tswett gave for the technique from the Greek chroma meaning “color” and graphein meaning “to write”.
- chromatography comprises a diverse and important group of methods that permit separation of analyte components of complex mixtures, where many of these separations may be impossible or otherwise prohibitively difficult by other means.
- sample is dissolved in a mobile phase, which may be a gas, a liquid or a supercritical fluid.
- the mobile phase is then forced through an immiscible stationary phase, which is fixed in place in either a column or on a solid surface.
- the two phases are chosen so that the components of the sample distribute themselves between the mobile and stationary phases to varying degrees.
- Those analyte components that are strongly retained by the stationary phase move slowly with respect to the flow of mobile phase.
- analyte components that are weakly held by the stationary phase travel more rapidly.
- analyte components separate into discrete bands that may be analyzed qualitatively and/or quantitatively.
- flow velocities e.g., mobilities
- analyte components separate into discrete bands that may be analyzed qualitatively and/or quantitatively.
- chromatography is typically divided into five broad categories based on the mechanism of interaction between solute analytes and the stationary phase of the chromatographic field: adsorption chromatography; partition chromatography; ion-exchange chromatography; molecular exclusion chromatography; and affinity chromatography.
- Adsorption chromatography is generally regarded as the oldest form of chromatography and makes use of a solid stationary phase with a liquid or gaseous mobile phase. Solutes are usually adsorbed onto the surface of stationary phase particles, while equilibration between the stationary phase and the mobile phase accounts for separation of solute analytes.
- Partition chromatography involves a liquid stationary phase formed on a thin film on the surface of a solid support. Solute equilibrates between the stationary liquid and the mobile phase. In adsorption and partition chromatography, a substantially continuous equilibration of solute between the mobile and stationary phases occurs. Columns may be packed with stationary phase or may be open tubular with stationary phase coated on the inner walls.
- Ion-exchange chromatography utilizes anions (i.e., SO 3 ⁇ ) or cations (i.e., N(CH 3 ) 3 + ) that are covalently attached to the solid stationary phase (i.e., usually a resin) and the mobile phase is typically a liquid. Analyte solute ions of opposite charge are attracted to the stationary phase by coulombic forces.
- Molecular exclusion chromatography separates molecules by size, with larger analyte solutes passing through the chromatographic field more quickly than smaller ones.
- chromatographic field there is generally no attractive interaction between the stationary phase and the analyte solute; rather, the liquid or gaseous mobile phase passes through a porous gel.
- the pores are generally small enough to exclude larger molecules, but not smaller ones. Smaller molecules usually take longer to pass through the column because they enter the gel pores and therefore must flow through a larger volume before leaving the column.
- the fraction of stationary-phase volume available to solute generally decreases as the size of the solute molecules increase.
- Affinity chromatography is generally believed to be the most selective type of chromatography—employing specific interactions between one kind of analyte molecule and a second covalently attached (e.g., immobilized) to the stationary phase.
- the immobilized molecule may be an antibody to a particular protein.
- Affinity chromatography generally relies on chemically specific, non-covalent interactions between the stationary phase and at least one analyte solute in a heterogeneous sample.
- the speed of the mobile phase passing through a chromatographic field is expressed either as a volume flow rate or as a linear flow rate.
- a volume flow rate or as a linear flow rate.
- Analytes eluting from a chromatographic field may be observed with a variety of detectors, such as, for example: thermal conductivity detectors; flame ionization detectors; electron capture detectors; flame photometric detectors; alkali flame detectors; sulfur chemiluminescence detectors; atomic emission detectors and the like.
- the trace of the detector response as a function of elution time is known as a chromatogram.
- the retention time t r for each component is the time needed after injection of the sample onto the chromatographic field until the corresponding analyte is detected. Unretained mobile phase travels through the column in a minimum time t m .
- the relative retention of two components is given as a quotient of the corresponding adjusted retention times.
- the capacity factor for a single component is the adjusted retention time divided by the elution time for the solvent. Capacity factor generally describes the ratio of time spent by solute in the stationary phase to time spent in the mobile phase.
- Relative retention is generally independent of flow rate and can therefore be used to help identify peaks when the flow rate changes.
- concentration at point x of analyte solute component G be [G] at time t.
- the flux of solute particles J diffusing inside the chromatographic field comprises motion in response to a thermodynamic force arising from a concentration gradient; (2) that the analyte particles reach a steady-state drift speed s when the thermodynamic force is matched by the viscous drag; (3) that the drift speed s is proportional to the thermodynamic force ; (4) that the solute particle flux J is proportional to the drift speed; and (5) that the thermodynamic force is proportional to the spatial concentration gradient d [ G ] d x .
- the pressure velocity is faster with increasing temperature and slower with decreasing temperature; (3) the pressure velocity is slower with heavier solute particles and faster with less massive particles; (4) the pressure velocity is faster with increasing surface area of the chromatographic field and slower with decreased surface area; and (5) the pressure velocity is slower with increasing volume of the chromatographic field and faster with decreasing volume.
- eluent e.g., solvent and sample
- an additional diffusion coefficient ⁇ circumflex over (D) ⁇ ⁇ (a,b,c . . . ) may be included to account for various permeability metrics such as, for example: the number of chromatographic theoretical plates, chromatographic plate height, stationary phase adsorption, non-uniform porosity; anisotropic transport along different dimensions; hydrophobicity; capillary defects; etc.
- this expression relates the concentration of the biomolecular component at any point within the chromatographic field (or otherwise porous barrier) ⁇ to the three dimensional variation of biomolecular component concentration at that point; which is to say that will passively diffuse through a chromatographic field so as to move down its concentration gradient from volume elements comprising higher concentration to volume elements comprising relative lower concentration.
- the biomolecular analyte solute will generally: (1) elute more rapidly at higher operating temperatures and more slowly at lower temperatures; (2) elute more rapidly with increased back-side pressure of and more slowly with decreased back-side pressure; (3) elute more rapidly with chromatographic fields having increased porosity and more slowly with decreased porosity; and (4) elute more rapidly with porous chromatographic fields having decreased linear transport distances (e.g., shorter columns) and more slowly with increased transport distances.
- Plate height H ⁇ 2 x , where ⁇ is the standard deviation and x is the linear transport distance along the flow-path, is a measure of how well chromatographic bands of analyte solute may be separated on a particular chromatographic field.
- Resolution of neighboring peaks becomes the difference in retention time divided by the average width w measured at the baseline. Resolution is proportional to ⁇ square root over (N) ⁇ and also generally increases with relative retention and capacity factor. Accordingly, doubling the length of a chromatographic field generally increases resolution by a factor of approximately ⁇ square root over (2) ⁇ .
- the van Deemter equation describes band broadening on a chromatographic field as: H ⁇ A + B u x + Cu x where H is the plate height, u x is the linear flow rate along the linear transport path of the chromatographic field, and A, B and C are constants: A representing irregular flow paths, B representing longitudinal diffusion and C representing the finite rate of transfer of analyte solute between mobile and stationary phases for a given column.
- the optimum flow rate which generally minimizes plate height, is faster for gas chromatography than for liquid chromatography.
- the number of plates and the optimal flow rate usually increases as the stationary-phase particle size is decreased. Open tubular columns typically provide higher resolution and shorter analysis times than packed columns. In general, bands spread not only on the chromatographic field but also during sample injection as well as during component analyte detection. Overloading and tailing may be corrected by inter alia using smaller sarhples or by masking strong adsorption sites on the stationary phase. Additionally, there are several underlying processes that may impact the plate height, such as, for example: longitudinal diffusion; resistance to mass transfer in the mobile and/or stationary phase; and eddy diffusion.
- chromatographic field may be understood to include any system and/or method for electrophoretic separation as well.

- the function g( ⁇ ) is termed the “integral transform” of f(t) by the kernel operator K( ⁇ ,t).
- the operation may also be described as “mapping” a function ⁇ ( ⁇ dot over (t) ⁇ ) in t-space into another function g( ⁇ ) in ⁇ -space.
- Transformation is generally based on the real and imaginary parts of the kernel e i ⁇ t taken separately: cos( ⁇ t) and sin( ⁇ t). Because these kernels correspond to functions used to describe waves, Fourier transforms frequently appear in the study of wave mechanics and the analysis of information embedded in wave data; particularly when phase information is desired. For example, the electron distribution in an atom may be obtained from a Fourier transformation of the amplitude of scattered X-ray data.
- ⁇ overscore (F) ⁇ (x) F(x) at points of continuity.
- x represents data in time-space
- ⁇ represents data in frequency-space
- ⁇ overscore (F) ⁇ (x) may be used to produce, for example, frequency-domain output from time-domain input.
- Chemical noise arises from a variety of generally uncontrollable variables that affect the chemistry of the analyte system. Examples include inter alia undetected variations in temperature or pressure that affect the position of chemical equilibria, fluctuations in humidity that cause changes in the moisture content of samples, vibrations that lead to stratification of powdered solids, and changes in light intensity that affect photosensitive materials.
- Instrumental noise arises from the design and/or use of the analytical instrument itself.
- Noise is usually associated with each component of an analytical instrument, for example: the source, input transducers; signal-processing elements; output transducers, etc.
- Certain types of instrumental noise include, for example: thermal noise (e.g., Johnson noise); shot noise; flicker noise; and environmental noise.
- Thermal noise is generally caused by thermal disturbance of electrons or other charge carriers in resistors, capacitors, radiation detectors, electrochemical cells and/or other resistive elements in an instrument. This agitation of charged particles is usually random and periodically creates charge inhomogeneities, which in turn create voltage fluctuations that may appear in the detector trace as noise. It is important to note that thermal noise is present even in the absence of any current in a resistive element at any temperature above absolute zero.
- ⁇ rms the root-mean-square noise voltage residing in a frequency bandwidth ⁇
- k the Boltzmann constant
- T the temperature
- R the resistance of the circuit element.
- the rise time t r corresponding to the instrument's response time to abrupt changes in input.
- the rise time is taken as the time required for the output to increase from about %10 to about 90% of the final value.
- the bandwidth is about 100 Hz. Accordingly, thermal noise may be decreased by narrowing the bandwidth; however, as the bandwidth narrows, the instrument becomes slower to respond to a signal change thereby generally requiring more time to obtain a reliable signal measurement.
- Thermal noise may also be reduced by lowering the electrical resistance of circuit elements and/or by lowering their temperature. For example, lowering the temperature of a detector from room temperature (298K) to the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77K) will reduce the noise by about 50%. It is important to note that thermal noise, although generally dependent upon the frequency bandwidth, is typically independent of frequency itself. Accordingly, thermal noise is sometimes termed “white noise” by analogy to white light, which contains all visible frequencies.
- Shot noise may be encountered when a current involves the movement of electrons or other charged particles across a junction.
- these junctions are found at p and n interfaces; in photocells and vacuum tubes, the junction consists of the evacuated space between the anode and cathode.
- the currents in such devices typically concern a series of quantized events—namely, the transfer of discrete electrons across the junction.
- Flicker noise is characterized as having a magnitude that is inversely proportional to the frequency of the signal being observed and is sometimes termed “ 1 f ⁇ ⁇ noise ” as a consequence.
- the causes of flicker noise are generally not well understood, however, the ubiquitous presence of flicker noise is typically recognizable by its frequency dependence. Flicker noise becomes significant at frequencies lower than about 100 Hz.
- the long-term drift observed in, for example: DC amplifiers; meters; and galvanometers is generally believed to be a manifestation of flicker noise.
- Flicker noise may be reduced significantly by using inter alia wire-wound or metallic film resistors rather than the conventional composition type.
- Environmental noise is generally a composite of noises arising from the surroundings. Much of this type of noise occurs because each conductor in an instrument is potentially an antenna capable of picking up radiation and converting it to a signal in the detection domain.
- Multiplex analytical instruments are generally single-channel devices in which signal elements are usually observed simultaneously.
- the term “multiplex” comes from data communications theory where it has been used to describe systems in which multiple information sets are transported substantially simultaneously.
- an analyte signal may be modulated in a fashion that permits subsequent decoding of the signal to yield information embedded therein. It is important to note, however, that use to the term “multiplexing” is not intended to be restricted to description of systems in which all signal elements are observed simultaneously; for example, the term “multiplexing” may also be used to indicate any system or method in which any number of independent signals may be encoded and/or transmitted over a substantially single data traffic medium.
- Multiplex instruments depend on, for example, Fourier transformations for signal decoding and are consequently often termed “Fourier transform instruments”. Indeed, Fourier transform devices have been developed for a wide variety of analytical methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy as well as for certain types of electro-analytical measurements. In optical spectroscopy, de-convolution of modulated data has also been performed with the so-called Hadamard and/or Hilbert transforms as well; however, these techniques have generally found less widespread application to date.
- Fourier transform spectroscopy was first developed by astronomers in the early 1950's in order to study the infrared spectra of distant stars. The first chemical applications of Fourier transform spectroscopy, reported approximately a decade later, were in the energy-starved far-infrared region. By the late 1960's, Fourier instruments for chemical studies in both the far-infrared (10 cm ⁇ 1 -400 cm ⁇ 1 ) and the ordinary infrared regions became commercially available. For a more detailed discussion of Fourier transform spectroscopy, see, for example, A. G. Marshall and F. R. Verdon, Fourier Transform in NMR, Optical, and Mass Spectrometty, 1990; P. R.
- the first is the Jaquinot advantage, which is realized because transform instruments have fewer optical elements than their dispersive counterparts (e.g., the power of radiation reaching the detector is generally much greater).
- a second advantage of transform instruments is improved wavelength accuracy and precision arising from inter alia signal averaging, thereby improving S/N.
- the third advantage often called the Fellgett advantage, is achieved as a result of substantially simultaneous data signal detection, thereby making it possible to acquire an entire spectrum in a brief period (often 1 second or less).
- an experimentally derived spectrum as being made up of m individual transmittance measurements at equally spaced frequency or wavelength intervals called “resolution elements”.
- the quality of the spectrum e.g., the amount of spectral detail
- m may be made larger.
- increasing the number of resolution elements correspondingly increases the time required for acquiring a spectrum with, for example, a scanning instrument.
- S x and N x are the averaged signal and the averaged noise, respectfully.
- the application of signal averaging to dispersive spectroscopy is typically costly in terms of acquisition time.
- to improve the S/N ratio by a factor of 2 would generally require averaging at least 4 spectra, which accordingly would then generally require about 50 minutes of signal acquisition time.
- Transform spectroscopy differs from conventional dispersive spectroscopy in that the resolution elements for a spectrum are generally measured simultaneously, thereby dramatically reducing the time required to derive a spectrum for any given S/N ratio.
- An entire spectrum of about 1500 resolution elements may be recorded in about the time typically required to observe a single element with dispersive instruments.
- the corresponding savings in acquisition time is often employed to enhance the S/N of the analyte signal; for example, in the 12.5 minutes required to derive a spectrum in the earlier example, 1500 transform spectra generally may be recorded and averaged.
- the improvement in S/N would in principle be on the order of about ⁇ square root over (1500) ⁇ (e.g., a factor of approximately 39).
- This representative advantage of transform spectroscopy was first recognized by P. Feligett in 1958. It is worth noting here that the theoretical ⁇ square root over (n) ⁇ improvement of S/N is seldom realized in practical application; however, significant improvements in S/N have generally been observed with transform spectroscopic
- frequency domain spectroscopy
- time domain spectroscopy
- E electronic describes the electronic energy of the molecule arising from electronic states populated by the electrons
- E vibrational refers to the energy associated with the inter-atomic vibrational states
- E rotational refers to the energy contribution of rotational motions of the molecule
- E translational corresponds to the net momentum of the molecule.
- This separation is generally approximate (except for translation) because the modes are usually not completely independent.
- the separation of the electronic and vibrational motions, for example, is justified by the well-known Born-Oppenheimer approximation, while the separation of the vibrational and rotational modes is generally valid where the molecule may be considered to be a rigid rotor.
- various energy absorption mechanisms may occur to induce intramolecular state-to-state transitions within the available energy manifolds: for example, electronic transitions; vibrational transitions; rotational transitions; etc.
- absorbed energy may subsequently be released from the molecule to the external environment in order to stabilize or otherwise lower the total energy of the system.
- various analytical techniques have been adapted to monitor or otherwise detect endergonic intra-molecular transitions (e.g., absorption spectroscopies) as well as exergonic transitions (e.g., emission spectroscopies).
- the coefficient B 0 ⁇ 1 is thus termed a “rate constant”, and is commonly referred to as the Einstein absorption coefficient or “Einstein B coefficient”.
- a photon of energy h ⁇ 10 incident from the external radiation density ⁇ ⁇
- a two-level system may generally be described by lower and upper state wavefunctions ⁇ 0 and ⁇ 1 , corresponding to the ground state and the excited state respectively.
- the molecule of interest generally comprises nuclei and electrons at positions r i possessing charges q i .
- a 0 and a 1 are time-dependent coefficients.
- All atomic and molecular states are understood to have definite parity (either even or odd) with respect to inversion in the space-fixed coordinate system such that: ( ⁇ 0
- ⁇ 0 ) ( ⁇ 1
- ⁇ 1 ) 0 Accordingly, the immediately preceding coupled equations may be reduced to: i ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ a .
- the system is observed to be coherently cycled (i.e., no abrupt changes in the phases or amplitudes of the wavefunctions) between the ground and the excited states by the application of radiation.
- the effect of collisions and other relaxation phenomena is generally to dampen coherent cycling of the excited system (e.g., Rabi oscillations).
- Rabi oscillations may be observed in any quantum system simply by increasing the intensity of the radiation so that at some point the Rabi cycling frequency exceeds the relaxation frequency, ⁇ R >> ⁇ relaxation , and coherent behavior will be observed to develop. This may easily be achieved, for example, in NMR experiments where spin relaxation processes are slow and many watts of radio frequency power may be applied to the system. In the infrared and visible region of the spectrum, relaxation processes are much faster and Rabi oscillations are normally dampened. For example, a real system would oscillate briefly when a strong field is applied suddenly to it, but quickly loses coherence and saturates. When the system is saturated, half of the molecules in the system are in the lower state and half are in the upper state. The rate of stimulated emission matches the rate of absorption.
- the case of weak electromagnetic radiation, for example, interacting with the system is also common.
- the weak-field case was applied to all regions of the spectrum except in the radio-frequency and microwave regions, where powerful coherent sources were generally available.
- the weak-field case there is a negligible buildup of population in the excited state, so that a 1 ⁇ 0, a 0 ⁇ 1, wherein the time derivative becomes a .
- ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ 1 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ t in frequency space; which certainly may not be understood as being monochromatic.
- a pulse of radiation 10 ns in duration has an intrinsic width of at least 160 MHz in frequency space. Accordingly, before the transition probability expression may be used, the effects of the finite frequency spread of the radiation must be included.
- the molecular absorption line shape changes from a Dirac delta function ⁇ ( ⁇ 10 ) that is generally infinitely sharp and infinitely narrow (but with unit area) to a real molecular line shape.
- fluorescence and phosphorescence are alike in that excitation generally occurs as a result of absorption of photons. As a consequence, fluorescence and phosphorescence are often referred to by the more general term “photoluminescence”. Fluorescence differs from phosphorescence in that the electronic energy transitions do not typically involve a change in electron spin. Additionally, fluorescence is usually relatively short-lived with luminescence ceasing almost immediately (i.e., on the order of ⁇ 10 5 seconds).
- Phosphorescence on the other hand, involves a change in electron spin with luminescence typically enduring for a readily detectable time after termination of irradiated excitation—often several seconds or more. In most instances, photoluminescent emissions are generally longer in wavelength than the radiation used for the corresponding excitation.
- the third type of luminescence, chemiluminescence is based upon the emission spectrum of an excited species that is formed in the course of a chemical reaction.
- the excited particles are the products of a reaction between the analyte and a suitable reagent (usually a strong oxidant such as ozone or hydrogen peroxide); the result is a spectrum characteristic of the oxidation product of the analyte rather than the analyte itself.
- the analyte is not directly involved in the chemiluminescence reaction; instead, it is the quenching effect of the analyte on a chemiluminescence reaction that serves as the analytical detected parameter.
- Measurement of the intensity of photoluminescence or chemiluminescence permits the quantitative determination of a variety of important inorganic and organic chemical species—often in trace amounts.
- the number of fluorometric methods has been somewhat larger than the number of applications of phosphorescence and chemiluminescence techniques to date.
- luminescence methods One of the most attractive features of luminescence methods is the inherent sensitivities corresponding to the techniques; with detection limits often being one to three orders of magnitude smaller than those encountered in, for example, absorption spectroscopy. Typical detection limits are in the parts-per-billion (ppb) range for conventional FF applications. Another advantage of photoluminescent methods is the ability to use large linear concentration ranges, which are often significantly greater than those encountered in, for example, absorption methods. Finally, the selectivity of luminescence procedures is often better than that of absorption methods. Conventional luminescence methods, however, are much less widely applicable than absorption methods because of the relatively limited number of chemical systems that may be made to demonstrate luminescence. See, for example, S.
- Raman scattering which is generally well understood, demonstrates that the Raman phenomenon results from quantized vibrational changes similar to those that may be observed with infrared absorption spectroscopy.
- the difference in wavelength between the incident and scattered radiation corresponds to wavelengths in the mid-infrared region.
- the Raman spectrum and infrared absorption spectrum for a given compound often resemble one another quite closely.
- the infrared method is a superior technique; whereas for others, the Raman procedure produces more useful spectra.
- Raman spectroscopy lies in the fact that water generally does not cause interference; indeed, Raman spectra may be obtained from aqueous solutions.
- glass or quartz cells may be employed, thus avoiding the inconvenience of working with sodium chloride or other atmospherically unstable windows.
- Raman spectroscopy was not widely employed by chemists for structural studies until lasers became available in the 1960's, which made spectra substantially easier to obtain.
- Raman spectra are typically obtained by irradiating samples with a powerful laser source of visible or infrared monochromatic radiation. During irradiation, the scattered radiation is measured at some angle (usually 90 degrees) with a suitably adapted spectrometer. The intensities of Raman lines are generally on the order of 0.001% of the intensity of the source; as a consequence, detection and measurement are often difficult. An exception to this is noted with resonance Raman spectroscopy.
- E the electric field of the radiation
- ⁇ ⁇ 0 + ( ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ r ) ⁇ r m ⁇ cos ⁇ ( 2 ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ v ⁇ t ) .
- the first term in this equation ⁇ 0 E 0 cos(2 ⁇ ex t) represents Rayleigh scattering, which occurs at the excitation frequency ⁇ ex .
- Raman scattering requires that the polarizability of a bond vary as a function of distance ( e . g . , ⁇ ⁇ ⁇ r
- the Raman activity of a given vibrational mode may generally differ substantially from its corresponding infrared activity.
- a homonuclear molecule such as molecular nitrogen, has no net dipole moment either in its equilibrium position or when engaged in a stretching vibrational mode.
- absorption of radiation for this vibrational mode and frequency generally is not observed to occur.
- the polarizability of the bond between the two atoms varies periodically in phase with the stretching vibration; reaching a maximum at the greatest separation and a minimum at closest approach. A Raman shift corresponding in frequency to the vibrational mode accordingly results.
- Raman spectroscopy may be understood to include Raman scattering, Rayleigh scattering, resonance Raman spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and nonlinear Raman spectroscopy as well.
- SERS surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy

- a representative process and method, in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, is depicted, for example, in FIG. 4 for the collection of near-field, time-domain data 460 for subsequent transformation 468 to near-field, frequency-domain data 470 .
- Near-field aperture array 400 is exposed to incident radiation 430 to generate evanescent field regions 435 .
- no sample loading has yet occurred.
- sample 335 is loaded onto chromatographic field 330 and at least one analyte component 440 begins to move through the sample flow-path along the aperture field 400 .
- analyte component 440 enters a near-field zone 435 where analyte 440 is excited and subsequently produces, for example, a photon of energy h ⁇ 445 (i.e., fluorescence). Photon 445 may thereafter be detected by detector 350 to produce a signal 465 indexed at time t 2 415 , as shown, for example, in time-domain chromatogram 460 .
- analyte particle 440 enters an area between near-field zones 435 such that no excitation occurs and signal, therefore, is generally not produced.
- analyte 440 continues to flow through sample flow-path of chromatographic field 330 , analyte 440 enters another near-field region 435 at time t 4 425 to produce a correspondingly indexed signal 466 as shown in the time-domain chromatogram.
- This process continues to occur over the length of the sample flow-path and/or near-field aperture array until the sample traverses the detection region.
- the time-domain chromatogram 460 provides signal data 462 (e.g., the ordinate) as a function of time index 464 (e.g., the abscissa) which is characteristic for the sample—in this case, a sample comprised of a single analyte 440 .
- frequency-domain plot 470 is obtained wherein the Fourier signal 472 is given as a function of frequency 474 . Accordingly, frequency ⁇ 1 480 corresponds to Fourier signal 485 representing the “blink frequency” of analyte 440 as it moves through the detection field.
- the time-domain chromatographic signal data 510 may be substantially more complex.
- the chromatographic separation of a multi-component sample may be continuously interrogated at a number of evenly spaced intervals along the chromatographic field simultaneously by a single detector, such that the resulting signal trace represent the summation of analyte signals measured from interval points along the detection field.
- each analyte band progresses along the chromatographic field at an analyte-specific velocity to produce a series of evenly spaced Gaussian peaks; wherein, the detection signal trace comprises the accumulation of these several n Gaussian peaks for n analytes.
- the detection signal trace represents the time-domain chromatogram, which may be considered as a Shah convolution of the point detection function.
- a Fourier transformation may be employed to transform the time-domain signal into the frequency domain and will thus reveal the frequency components embedded in the time-domain signal data.
- a Fourier transformation to the time-domain chromatogram, a frequency-domain plot is obtained in which each individual series of Gaussian peaks (convolved in the time domain) produces a characteristic frequency peak.

- a near-field aperture array may be suitably fabricated by nanoimprint lithography, as representatively illustrated, for example, in FIG. 6 .
- An aperture array master mold 620 is generally formed by deposition of PMMA 615 (or other suitably adapted negative resist) on, for example, a silicon substrate 609 followed by e-beam writing 605 , development 650 , etching 652 and resist stripping 654 to produce an aperture master mold 620 having negative imprint features corresponding to the desired aperture specifications and tolerances.
- aperture master mold 620 may be engaged with an imprint die comprising a PMMA (or other negative resist) layer 640 deposited on aluminum 642 over silicon 644 .

- the present invention may be readily multiplexed for parallel processing of samples and may also be optionally implemented with cyclic chromatography to increase resolution in conjunction with faster separations without requiring pre-conditioning of the initial starting conditions at the time of sample loading.

- the present invention may be employed to obtain novel information about, for example, a biochemical compound by exploiting higher frequency information of non-propagating evanescent fields and is more preferable for high-throughput applications than conventional NF methods employing scanning probes (i.e., AFM, NSOM, etc.) over immobilized samples.

- IC's The production of IC's generally begins with the creation of high-quality semiconductor wafers. During the IC fabrication process, the wafers typically undergo multiple deposition, masking and etching process steps. After each deposition, a layer may be etched to create circuit component features. Because of the high precision required in the manufacturing of IC's, an extremely planar surface is generally needed on at least one side of a semiconductor wafer to ensure proper accuracy and performance of the microelectronic structures created at the wafer surface.
- the outermost surface of the substrate becomes increasingly non-planar. This occurs because the distance between the outer surface and the underlying substrate is greatest in regions of the wafer substrate where the least lithographic etching has occurred, and least in regions where the greatest etching has occurred.
- these surface variations comprise a series of peaks and valleys where the vertical differential between the highest peak and lowest valley may be on the order of several thousand Angstroms. With the construction of multiple circuit layers, this vertical differential accumulates and becomes increasingly divergent—reaching several microns and perhaps eventually resulting in the production of defective IC devices.
- CMP chemical mechanical planarization
- An exemplary wafer substrate for lithographic etching of circuit patterns may be constructed by coating, for example, a circular, flat, silicon wafer with a film of metal such as aluminum. A layer of photoresist may then be placed over the metal layer. Thereafter, a photolithographic apparatus is typically employed to expose the photoresist to electromagnetic or particle-beam radiation to produce a patterned photoresist layer. Exposed portions of the metal layer are then chemically etched leaving behind circuit component features. The remaining photoresist is then removed to permit further wafer processing. A second layer of circuit componentry may then be created, for example, by depositing an insulative layer (i.e., silicon dioxide) over the previously developed circuit features.
- an insulative layer i.e., silicon dioxide
- the outer surface of the second insulative layer topologically conforms to the variations created by the etching of the underlying circuit pattern. This creates a series of peaks and valleys on the outermost surface of the second (e.g., insulative) layer. The resulting complexity and variation of topological features tends to increase with the exposure and etching of multiple component layers.
- Photolithographic techniques used to pattern the photoresist typically have a depth of focus of about 0.2 to 0.4 microns for sub-half-micron features. If the photoresist layer is sufficiently non-planar (e.g., if the maximum vertical differential of any peak and any valley on the outer surface is greater than the depth of focus of the imaging device), then it generally may not be possible to properly focus the image onto the wafer to create the pattern for the next layer of componentry.
- the imaging apparatus may be adapted to accommodate for the non-planarity created by any single patterned layer within the range of the device's depth of focus, after the deposition of a sufficient number of circuit layers, the maximum vertical differential will eventually exceed the imaging apparatus' depth of focus and, therefore, compromise its ability to accommodate for the non-planarity.
- CMP machines have been developed to polish or planarize silicon wafer surfaces to the flat condition desired for manufacture of various IC components and the like.
- Chemical mechanical polishing or planarizing of a surface of an object may be desirable for several reasons.
- chemical mechanical polishing is often used in the formation of microelectronic devices to provide a substantially smooth, planar surface suitable for subsequent fabrication processes such as photoresist coating and pattern definition.
- Chemical mechanical polishing may also be used to form microelectronic features.
- a conductive feature such as a metal line or a conductive plug may be formed on a surface of a wafer by forming trenches and vias on the wafer surface, depositing conductive material over the wafer surface and into the trenches and vias, and removing the conductive material on the surface of the wafer using chemical mechanical polishing, leaving the vias and trenches filled with the conductive material.
- a typical chemical mechanical polishing apparatus suitable for planarizing the semiconductor surface generally includes: a wafer carrier configured to support, guide, and apply pressure to a wafer during the polishing process; a polishing chemistry such as a slurry containing abrasive particles and chemicals to assist removal of material from the surface of the wafer; and a polishing surface such as a polishing pad.
- the polishing apparatus may include an integrated wafer cleaning system and/or an automated load and unload station to facilitate automatic processing of wafers and/or component dies.
- one side of a silicon wafer is attached to a flat surface of a wafer carrier or chuck with the other side of the wafer pressed against a flat polishing pad.
- the exposed surface of the pad incorporates an abrasive such as, for example, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide, fumed/precipitated silica, or other particulate abrasives
- the underlying support material may be formed of various commercially available compositions such as, for example, a blown polyurethane (i.e., the IC, SUBA IV and GS series of polishing pads generally available from Rodel Products, Scottsdale, Ariz., USA) or such other materials that are well known in the art.
- the workpiece e.g., wafer
- the pad rotates about its principle axis in the presence of a polishing chemistry.
- the wafer is placed in the carrier such that the surface to be polished is typically placed in contact with the polishing surface.
- the wafer is generally moved relative to the polishing surface while slurry is supplied to the area between the wafer and the polishing surface.
- the wafer may also be rotated about its principal axis and oscillated over both the inner and outer radial surfaces of the polishing pad.
- the hardness and density of the polishing pad depends on the material comprising the workpiece to be polished and the degree of precision required in the polishing process.
- polishing slurry i.e., an abrasive and at least one chemically reactive agent
- polishing slurry is generally spread on the polishing pad to provide an abrasive chemical solution at the interface between the pad and wafer substrate.
- At least one chemically reactive agent in the slurry reacts with the outer surface of the substrate to form reactive sites.
- polishing pad and abrasive particles results in polishing of the wafer substrate—that is to say, chemical mechanical planarization (or polishing) occurs when pressure is applied between the polishing pad and the workpiece being polished where the mechanical stresses and the abrasive particles within the slurry create mechanical strain on the chemical bonds on or near the surface being polished, rendering the chemical bonds more susceptible to chemical attack or corrosion (e.g., stress corrosion).
- planarization need only be performed when necessary to prevent the peak-to-valley differential from exceeding the depth of photolithographic focus; or, alternatively, any time a new layer is deposited over a developed circuit layer.
- a suitably adapted and effective CMP process may generally be considered as one that provides a high polishing rate which generates a substrate surface that is both finished (e.g., lacks small-scale roughness) and flat (e.g., lacks large-scale topographic differentials).
- the desired polishing rate, finish and flatness has conventionally been controlled or otherwise modified, for example, by selection of: the pad and slurry combination; the relative speed between the substrate and pad; the force pressing the substrate against the pad; and the method of introducing the slurry to the pad/wafer interface.
- each developed circuit layer should generally be polished under substantially reproducible conditions so that each IC is substantially indistinguishable from any other IC produced from a different wafer lot.
- another exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a system and method for optimization of polishing throughput while providing for improved surface planarity and finish by controlling or otherwise actuating the distribution and chemistry of the polishing slurry at any given time in the polishing cycle in order to permit a higher degree of planarization and uniformity of material removed over substantially the entire surface of a processed workpiece.
- the disclosed system and method for near-field transform spectroscopy may be employed to analyze the composition of any in situ slurry chemistry and/or slurry chemistry waste in order to monitor the progress of a chemical polishing process.
- Detection of a concentration and/or chemical activity of a particular component may be used to actuate certain polishing process steps, such as, for example: elimination of waste slurry; introduction of fresh slurry; modification of the chemical composition of the slurry; discontinuation of a first polishing mode and engagement of a second polishing mode; distribution of polishing slurry components to predetermined and/or user-selectable regions of the polishing interface; termination of the polishing process and any other chemical polishing process steps now known or hereafter derived or otherwise described in the polishing art.
- Certain exemplary implementations of the present invention may be applied to any polishing process utilizing chemically reactive slurry polishing agents.
- Certain representative implementations may include, for example, the polishing and/or planarization of: semiconductor wafers; integrated circuit wafers; integrated circuit dies; magnetic data storage media, including computer hard drives, floppy drives, and other magnetic mass storage media; optical data storage media including CD-ROM's, DVD's and other optical mass storage media; optical waveguides; interferometric components; electromagnetic detectors and any other object having a surface requiring a high degree of planarity.

Abstract
Description
Appl Phys. Lett. 44, 651-653, 1984. The, spatial resolution that may be achieved is generally defined by the size and shape of the probe tip. SPM also more generally includes a growing number of high resolution surface microscopy techniques (including NSOM) that use non-metrically sharp probe tips maintained very close to or even touching the sample surface and scanned in the xy plane of the sample using a combination of, for example, piezoelectric transducers, stepper motors and/or the like. See, for example, F. Zenhausern et al., “Scanning Interferometric Apertureless Microscopy: Optical Imaging at 10 Angstrom Resolution”, Science 269, 1083-85, 1995; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,646,731 issued to Wickramasinghe et al. on Jul. 8, 1997.
spatial frequencies limits. In practical terms however, as the probe size decreases, the volume of NF light asymptotically decays to zero with a corresponding trade-off between resolution and sensitivity. Practical high-resolution NF microscopy methods thus require robust optical techniques as well as good probe designs.
wherein n is the refractive index of the medium between the sample and objective lens (i.e., ambient air corresponds to n=1.0), θ is the acceptance angle of the lens and n sin θ is the lens numerical aperture. Reducing the wavelength λ (i.e., from red to blue) can improve the resolution, as can using oil/solid immersion lenses with larger indices of refraction (e.g., n>1.0). See, for example, S. M. Mansfield and G. S. Kino, Appl. Phys. Lett., 57, 2615, 1990. It should be noted, however, that the actual experimental FF resolution is often lower than the theoretical diffraction limit due to inter alia aberrations caused by non-ideal optical elements.
However, non-scanning coherent light microscopy is generally difficult since the images are often superimposed with diffraction patterns that originate from small structures in the optical path. Optimal resolutions may usually be obtained by scanning confocal microscopy where the image of an illuminating aperture in the sample plane coincides with a “back-focused” image of the exit aperture. Although the size of the illumination and detection spots are generally diffraction limited, the effective resolution obtained by the combination of the two is typically enhanced by a factor of about √{square root over (2)}. For recording images of a sample, the illumination spot may be scanned, for example, by translating the sample. In addition to high lateral resolution, confocal FF microscopy also permits imaging of planes at varying depths within the sample.
from that of a standard confocal microscope. For example, with an objective having a numerical aperture of 0.8, the effective numerical aperture would be 1.6 for n=2 (i.e., for solid immersion lenses) and the theoretical half-power width of a confocal microscope would accordingly be
(where n sin θ again is the numerical aperture) corresponding to about 93 nm for a wavelength λ=405 nm.
(increasing from left to right on the abscissa).
In polar coordinates, the solution of Maxwell's equations for this representative system are, for example:
is the retarded value of the time-dependent amplitude, c is the speed of light, ER is the electric field along the R coordinate, E8 is the electric field along the θ coordinate, and Hφ is the magnetic field along the φ coordinate. Two regions may accordingly be distinguished: the FF region where
(with
representing the optical wavelength corresponding to the oscillation frequency ω), and the NF region of the dipole where
terms may be neglected to the extent that they are generally dominated by the
contribution. The resulting expression corresponds to the well-known dipole-radiation field (e.g., the FF):
E R=0
energy is observed to emanate (e.g., propagate) away from the dipole. This can be demonstrated by taking the integral of the Poynting vector
representing the rate at which energy flows through a unit surface area perpendicular to the flow vector, over the surface of a sphere of radius R. The resulting expression may be shown to be finite and independent of R. However, one of the characteristics of propagative dipole radiation is that generally no emanations occur along the dipole axis:
region of the dipole, the R2 and R3 terms dominate, representing the NF high spatial frequencies. Accordingly, it is relatively straightforward to demonstrate that the corresponding surface integral of the NF Poynting vector over a sphere of radius R vanishes in the limit of R→∞. Of particular interest is that this integral does not vanish at finite radius, which means that non-propagative energy transport, in fact, does take place. However, since none of the high spatial frequency energy propagatively emanates from the source, the NF energy oscillates back and forth within a region termed the “NF zone”. It is also of interest to note that unlike the FF, the NF does not vanish along the dipole axis.
wherein A(kx,ky) is called the angular spectrum. The propagation of the field along z is given by the scalar wave equation ΔU+k2U=0 with
By applying the scalar wave equation to the plane wave equation, the propagation of the angular spectrum may be obtained as:
A(k x ,k y ;z)=A 0(k x ,k y)e iz√{square root over (k
wherein A0(kx,ky)−A(kx,ky;z=0). Combining the propagation of the angular spectrum with the plane wave equation yields:
Thus, U may be considered as a superposition of three-dimensional plane waves with the amplitude of the scalar wave vectors
For z→∞ (e.g., the Fraunhofer diffraction limit), the following well-known expression may be obtained:
for k∥>k.
where the diffraction limit dmin is related to the wavelength of light λ and the numerical aperture n sin θ. Accordingly, it may be seen that information concerning sub-wavelength structures may be effectively obtained by measuring the radiation field distribution in the NF zone.

expresses how much volume of solvent per unit time travels through the chromatographic field. The linear flow rate
tells how many unit distances of column length are traveled per unit time by the solvent system. In the instant example, because 1 cm of column length contains 0.0565 mL of mobile phase, 0.3 mL would occupy
of column length. Accordingly, the linear flow rate corresponding to
where t′r2>t′r1, corresponding to α>1. The greater the relative retention, the greater the separation between the analyte components. Relative retention is generally independent of flow rate and can therefore be used to help identify peaks when the flow rate changes. For each peak in a chromatogram, the capacity factor k′ is given as
which is to say that the capacity factor is the ratio of the time the solute spends in the stationary phase relative to the time the solute spends in the mobile phase. Accordingly, the longer a component is retained by the chromatographic field, the greater the capacity factor. This gives rise to the partition coefficient
which corresponds to the ratio of solute concentration in the stationary phase Cs relative to the concentration in the mobile phase Cm. Accordingly, the greater the ratio of partition coefficients between mobile and stationary phases, the greater the separation between two components of a mixture.
Consider also an out-bound flux of solute particles at the x+l surface of the chromatographic field which may be similarly derived as
Therefore, the net time-rated change of concentration (e.g. the ‘concentration velocity’) may be expressed as:
The resulting chain of proportionalities J∝s, s∝, and
implies that the solute particle flux J is proportional to the concentration gradient
which will be apparent to skilled artisans as corresponding to ‘Fick's First Law of Diffusion’. The constant of proportionality is given as the diffusion coefficient in the equation
for diffusion restricted to a single dimension x. Therefore, the expression J−J′ taken from the expression for the diffusive concentration velocity becomes
Substitution of the linear accumulation of solute particle concentration over the length of the chromatographic field yields
which further reduces to
This expression may then be substituted back into the concentration velocity expression to give:
which will be apparent to skilled artisans as the time dependent diffusion equation according to ‘Fick's Second Law of Diffusion’ and relates the concentration velocity at any point to the spatial variation of the concentration at that point. More generally, this may be appreciated as a physical basis for the typically observed behavior of diffusing chemical species translating away from areas of relative high concentration to areas of relative lower concentration (e.g., “moving down the concentration gradient”).
After taking the partial derivative with respect to time at constant temperature and volume, the following expression for the pressure velocity may be obtained:
where Zw is the collisional frequency associated with the mean free path of the solute particles and Ao is the area of the opening that the solute particles have available for elution from the chromatographic field. The collisional frequency is related to the partial pressure of the solute particles p, the mass of the particles m and the temperature of the system T by the equation
Substitution of this relation back into the expression for the pressure velocity yields
which integrates over time to
From this expression for the pressure velocity, the following may generally be observed: (1) if the eluent (e.g., solvent and sample) is not replenished, the pressure decreases exponentially to zero; (2) the pressure velocity is faster with increasing temperature and slower with decreasing temperature; (3) the pressure velocity is slower with heavier solute particles and faster with less massive particles; (4) the pressure velocity is faster with increasing surface area of the chromatographic field and slower with decreased surface area; and (5) the pressure velocity is slower with increasing volume of the chromatographic field and faster with decreasing volume.
If the ratio of the area of the aggregate void-volume to the aggregate surface area of the chromatographic field is taken to be a dimensionless quantity θ corresponding to the porosity of the chromatographic field, a composite expression for elution of biomolecular component becomes:
and relates the pressure of that elutes through the chromatographic field (or otherwise porous barrier) Ξ to: the back-side pressure of the biomolecular component p ; the temperature T; the mass of the biomolecular component m ; the linear transport distance of the chromatographic field l; and the porosity of the chromatographic field θΞ. Accordingly, the biomolecular analyte solute will generally: (1) elute more rapidly at higher operating temperatures and more slowly at lower temperatures; (2) elute more rapidly with increased back-side pressure of and more slowly with decreased back-side pressure; (3) elute more rapidly with chromatographic fields having increased porosity and more slowly with decreased porosity; and (4) elute more rapidly with porous chromatographic fields having decreased linear transport distances (e.g., shorter columns) and more slowly with increased transport distances.
where σ is the standard deviation and x is the linear transport distance along the flow-path, is a measure of how well chromatographic bands of analyte solute may be separated on a particular chromatographic field. The number of plates for a Gaussian peak is generally given as
where tr is the retention time and w is the peak width (typically taken as four standard deviations at the baseline; e.g., 4σ). Resolution of neighboring peaks becomes the difference in retention time divided by the average width w measured at the baseline. Resolution is proportional to √{square root over (N)} and also generally increases with relative retention and capacity factor. Accordingly, doubling the length of a chromatographic field generally increases resolution by a factor of approximately √{square root over (2)}.
where H is the plate height, ux is the linear flow rate along the linear transport path of the chromatographic field, and A, B and C are constants: A representing irregular flow paths, B representing longitudinal diffusion and C representing the finite rate of transfer of analyte solute between mobile and stationary phases for a given column. The optimum flow rate, which generally minimizes plate height, is faster for gas chromatography than for liquid chromatography. The number of plates and the optimal flow rate usually increases as the stationary-phase particle size is decreased. Open tubular columns typically provide higher resolution and shorter analysis times than packed columns. In general, bands spread not only on the chromatographic field but also during sample injection as well as during component analyte detection. Overloading and tailing may be corrected by inter alia using smaller sarhples or by masking strong adsorption sites on the stationary phase. Additionally, there are several underlying processes that may impact the plate height, such as, for example: longitudinal diffusion; resistance to mass transfer in the mobile and/or stationary phase; and eddy diffusion.
wherein the function g(α) is termed the “integral transform” of f(t) by the kernel operator K(α,t). The operation may also be described as “mapping” a function ƒ({dot over (t)}) in t-space into another function g(α) in α-space. It is generally believe that there are an infinite number of such transform operators; one of the most useful and best known of which is the Fourier transform:
the Hankel (e.g., Fourier-Bessel) transform
and the Mellin transform
Indeed, as previously stated, it is believed that an infinite number of such transforms exist.
where c1 and c2 are constants and ƒ1(t) and ƒ2(t) are functions for which the transform operation is defined. Substituting the operator for the linear integral transform, the following expression may be obtained: g(α)=ƒ(t). Accordingly, an inverse operation −1 (e.g., a “de-convolution operator”) is hypothesized to exist in an infinitely-dimensional Hilbert space such that ƒ(t)=−1g(α).

The rise time tr corresponding to the instrument's response time to abrupt changes in input. Normally, the rise time is taken as the time required for the output to increase from about %10 to about 90% of the final value. Thus, if the rise time is 0.01 seconds, the bandwidth is about 100 Hz. Accordingly, thermal noise may be decreased by narrowing the bandwidth; however, as the bandwidth narrows, the instrument becomes slower to respond to a signal change thereby generally requiring more time to obtain a reliable signal measurement.
as a consequence. The causes of flicker noise are generally not well understood, however, the ubiquitous presence of flicker noise is typically recognizable by its frequency dependence. Flicker noise becomes significant at frequencies lower than about 100 Hz. The long-term drift observed in, for example: DC amplifiers; meters; and galvanometers is generally believed to be a manifestation of flicker noise. Flicker noise may be reduced significantly by using inter alia wire-wound or metallic film resistors rather than the conventional composition type.
where Sx and Nx are the averaged signal and the averaged noise, respectfully. Unfortunately, the application of signal averaging to dispersive spectroscopy is typically costly in terms of acquisition time. Thus, in the example previously considered wherein 12.5 minutes were required to obtain a spectrum of 1500 resolution elements—to improve the S/N ratio by a factor of 2 would generally require averaging at least 4 spectra, which accordingly would then generally require about 50 minutes of signal acquisition time.
where Eelectronic describes the electronic energy of the molecule arising from electronic states populated by the electrons, Evibrational refers to the energy associated with the inter-atomic vibrational states, Erotational refers to the energy contribution of rotational motions of the molecule, and Etranslational corresponds to the net momentum of the molecule. This separation is generally approximate (except for translation) because the modes are usually not completely independent. The separation of the electronic and vibrational motions, for example, is justified by the well-known Born-Oppenheimer approximation, while the separation of the vibrational and rotational modes is generally valid where the molecule may be considered to be a rigid rotor.
are generally related by the expression
wherein hυ10=E1−E0. Skilled artisans will appreciate this expression as corresponding to the well-known Boltzmann distribution for thermal equilibrium.
in which B1→0 is the stimulated emission coefficient. Finally the system in the excited state may spontaneously emit a photon at a rate generally corresponding to
Solving for ρυ yields
however, ρυ(υ10) also finds expression in the Planck relation corresponding to
In order for both expressions for the radiation density ρυ(υ10) to be valid, B0→1=B1→0 and
Accordingly, the rate constants for absorption and stimulated emission—two ostensibly different physical processes—are identical. Moreover, the spontaneous emission rate (e.g., the “excited state lifetime”) may be determined from the absorption coefficient. Note, however, that the factor υ10 3 plays an important role in the competition between induced and spontaneous emission processes.

where x, y and z are the coordinates of the particles relative to the center of mass for the molecule. The interaction of the radiation with the molecular system is taken into account by the addition of a time-dependent perturbation to the Hamiltonian operator Ĥ according to:
In the absence of the perturbation Ĥ′, the two time-dependent solutions are:
The wavefunction for the perturbed system may be given by the linear combination of the complete set of functions Ψ0 and Ψ1:
where a0 and a1 are time-dependent coefficients. Substitution of the immediately preceding solution into the time-dependent Shrödinger equation yields:
i({dot over (a)} 0ψ0 e −iω
If the time-dependent perturbation Ĥ′ is taken as −μE cos (ωt) in the electric-dipole approximation, then Ĥ′ is observed to have odd parity. In other words, Ĥ′ is an odd function since μ=ez, while the products |ψ1|2 or |ψ0|2 are even functions; therefore, the integrands ψ*1Ĥ′ψ1 and ψ*0Ĥ′ψ0 are odd functions. All atomic and molecular states are understood to have definite parity (either even or odd) with respect to inversion in the space-fixed coordinate system such that:
(ψ0 |Ĥ′|ψ 0)=(ψ1 |Ĥ′|ψ 1)=0
Accordingly, the immediately preceding coupled equations may be reduced to:
as the Rabi frequency, which in combination with the identity relation
is resonant or nearly resonant with the optical angular frequency ω=2πυ. The terms ei(ω
where Ω=√{square root over (ωR 2+Δ2)}. Skilled artisans will further appreciate that these solutions may be readily verified by straightforward substitution.
while the corresponding time-dependent probability that the system will be found in the ground state takes the form
At resonance, Δ=0 and Ω=ωR so that in this case:
while off-resonance there is a reduced probability for finding the system in the excited state.
which may be readily integrated to yield:
which assumes monochromatic radiation and short interaction times; these requirements, of course, being inconsistent with one another due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle as expressed by ΔEΔt≧ or
If monochromatic radiation is applied to the system for a time Δt, then the system “sees” radiation of width
in frequency space; which certainly may not be understood as being monochromatic. For example, a pulse of radiation 10 ns in duration has an intrinsic width of at least 160 MHz in frequency space. Accordingly, before the transition probability expression may be used, the effects of the finite frequency spread of the radiation must be included.
The total transition probability is given by integrating over all frequencies:
in which ρ(ω) is assumed to be slowly varying near ω10 so that it may be discarded from the integration. This is the case because
is sharply peaked at ω=ω10. The absorption rate per molecule is thus given by
in which N≈N0 for the weak-field case. Dividing by N yields the transition probability per molecule
A factor of three (3) is missing from
has been derived using isotropic radiation traveling in the x, y and z directions, while
has been derived using a plane wave traveling along the z coordinate. Since only the z component of the isotropic radiation is considered effective in inducing a transition, and since ρ(υ)=2πρ(ω),the resulting expression becomes:
where ∫B0→1dυ=B0→1 and ∫A1→0dυ=A1→0.
where ξ0 is the polarizability of the bond at the equilibrium internuclear distance req and r is the internuclear separation. The change in internuclear separation
varies with the frequency of the vibration υν according to r−req=rm cos(2πυνt), where rm is the maximum internuclear separation relative to the equilibrium position. Accordingly, the following relation may be derived via substitution:
Using the trigonometric identity
this expression becomes:
and third term
correspond to the Stokes and anti-Stokes frequencies (υex−υν) and (υex+υν) respectively; wherein the excitation frequency has been modulated by the vibrational frequency of the bond. It is important to note that Raman scattering requires that the polarizability of a bond vary as a function of distance
A Fourier transformation may be employed to transform the time-domain signal into the frequency domain and will thus reveal the frequency components embedded in the time-domain signal data. Upon application of a Fourier transformation to the time-domain chromatogram, a frequency-domain plot is obtained in which each individual series of Gaussian peaks (convolved in the time domain) produces a characteristic frequency peak. De-convolution of the
