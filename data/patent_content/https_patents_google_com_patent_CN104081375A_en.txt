III. for the example process of e-mail management message
Fig. 2 diagram is used for according to the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure 200 of social network information filtering electronic mail message.This process 200 therein this system receives in the piece 201 of user's request and starts, with based on social groups filtering electronic mail message.For example, user can select, for example, to filter his/her email message (email message in his/her inbox).This filtrator can be to be applied to the filtrator of the email message entering, or for receiving and be presented to the filtrator of user's email message (for example, at the email list sorting by time of reception).Then this user can identify the one or more social groups that are associated with the user account of user at one or more social networking service place.
In piece 202, this system is based on generating filtrator by the indicated social groups of user.In one example, the social networking service of each in can inquiry maintenance social groups of this system, and the list of the All Contacts in request social groups and/or the associated person information (for example email message) that for example, is associated with contact person's (storing in contact profile or account) in this social groups.After receiving this information from social networking service, this system can be by suitable license (for example: the other associated person information (for example e-mail address) that the license of customer's approval mandate or system authorization) further retrieval is associated with these contact persons from addressable one or more other sources of this system.For example, this system can receive the profile information relevant to each contact person from social networking service, and this profile information comprises the means (for example title, contact person ID, contact email addresses) for identifying contact person.This system can be identified this contact person with profile information, and can search other e-mail addresses that contact identifier is associated with the contact person who finds out in one or more other contacts lists of being safeguarded with the one or more service by except social networking service.For example, other resources can comprise the contacts list safeguarded by E-mail service, the contacts list being associated with user in other E-mail service place or safeguard addressable other sources of system (having suitable license) about identified contact person's associated person information.Then this system can be used detected e-mail address to generate e-mail filter.The example process 300 that is used for generating based on social groups e-mail filter in hereinafter with reference Fig. 3 more detailed description.
Next, in piece 203, this system is applied to the e-mail filter generating in piece 202 user's email message (for example Email Information in user's mailbox) and generates the email list being filtered.For example, this system can be selected one or more email messages, abandons one or more email messages and/or the email message of sequence in user's mailbox, to generate the list being filtered.
In piece 204, this system can determine whether to exist the other order standard of the further sequence that is filtered list that can be used for piece 203.In one example, this system can be accessed the one or more order standards for the email message that sorts.For example, this order standard can be provided or can be comprised by user the standard of machine learning.For example, this order standard can comprise the priority of distributing to one or more social groups or one or more particular contact or e-mail address.In addition, order standard can comprise and distributes to the priority of particular topic (for example in the theme of email message or content appointment), e-mail context (time or date that email message is sent out and/or the receives) electronic mail features similar with other or preferably.These priority can be distributed clearly by user, or can by system based on about be associated with in one or more social groups each, the historical information of the user interactions of the email message of contact person or specific email address (for example listing the email message as one or more contact persons of sender or addressee's social groups) distributes.Determining in piece 204 can depend on whether whether available and/or this user of such information has carried out the clearly request for the other sequence of email list.
If in piece 204, determine additional order standard can with (for example do not have order standard can with or user do not ask other sequence), this process proceeds to piece 206.Otherwise this process proceeds to piece 205 and according to the order standard email message (that is the email message, being filtered) that sorts.To be described in more detail according to the example process 400 of order standard sequence email message at hereinafter with reference Fig. 4.After sequence email message, this process proceeds to piece 206.In piece 206, this system provides the mail tabulation being filtered and/or be sorted, to be shown to user.
In one embodiment, once this list has offered user, this system can further provide the dynamic order (or filtration) of email message.For example, this system for example can receive, about the indication of the user action of email message (email message outside message, order of preference of deleting an e-mail, email message is moved down in this list), and can dynamically generate (or other) sequence (or filtration) standard of renewal, to further organize the mail tabulation that is shown to this user.This system can be applied to shown list by the order standard being updated, and the email list of renewal is offered to user.
Fig. 3 diagram is for generating the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure 300 of e-mail filter based on social groups.In piece 301, this system receives the indication of the one or more social groups that are associated with the account of user at social networks website place.For example, user can select for filtering one or more social groups of his/her email list.In another example, this system can have for being associated with the precedence information of one or more social groups of user, and can identify this social groups with the email message of filter user (for example, based on user or system setting) automatically.In piece 302, this system is determined and each one or more contact person that are associated in one or more social groups.In one example, this social groups can be maintained in the socialgram of social networking service, and this system can inquire about social networking service (for example by the API Calls to social networking service), to identify contact person, is associated with social groups.Determined one or more contact person can comprise the All Contacts who is associated with social groups, or for example, in response to those of authorized suitable license that can be identified of inquiry (: by the inquiry of this system).One or more contact persons of this user can be identified in response to the request of social networking service is selected to exit.In addition, social networking service can allow user to add can for example, by one or more application identifications (system of filtering for email list) herein.
In piece 303, this system is determined the one or more e-mail addresses (or other similar associated person informations) that are associated with one or more contact persons.For example, this system can send to social networking service by request, to receive the one or more e-mail addresses that are associated with contact person's account of contact person.In another example, this request can be sent out together or as its part with the inquiry of associated contact person for sending at piece 302.In addition identification that, this system can be from one or more other sources (contacts list of for example being safeguarded by E-mail service, the contacts list being associated with user in other E-mail service or by addressable other sources of this system of suitable license) belongs to identified contact person's other e-mail address.In one example, in piece 303, this system can generate the list of e-mail address, and wherein, in piece 301, each contact person of one or more social groups of identification is associated with one or more e-mail addresses.
Next, in piece 304, this system generates the e-mail filter that is included in all e-mail addresses of identification in piece 303.In one example, the e-mail filter generating can comprise e-mail address, and wherein, some or all of in e-mail address are given certain preferred or priority.These priority can clearly be distributed by user, or can be user action (for example, in social networking service or E-mail service), contact person or the individual e-mail addresses based on about each social groups or list the priority as the machine learning of addressee or sender's contact person's email message.
Fig. 4 diagram for example, for the process flow diagram of the instantiation procedure 400 of the email message (, in subscriber mailbox) that sorts according to order standard.This process starts in the piece 401 of the one or more email messages of this system identification therein.Email message can comprise the email message entering or be provided to be shown to user's email message.Next, in piece 402, the one or more order standards of this system identification.For example, order standard can be provided and/or can be comprised by user the order standard of machine learning.This order standard can comprise the priority of distributing to one or more " e-mail component ".E-mail component can comprise with for example, such as netwriter's (e-mail address, contact person's account or the social groups relevant to this sender), mail reception people's (e-mail address, contact person's account or and TO:, CC: or BCC: the social groups that the addressee in territory is associated), E-mail subject (for example capable according to Email Header or determine by analyzing E-mail content) and e-mail context information (for example: the time, date, place) the various elements that email message is associated.
In one example, order standard can comprise the priority that is assigned to one or more social groups or one or more particular contact or one or more e-mail addresses.In addition, order standard can comprise priority or the preference that is assigned to particular topic (for example: in the theme of email message or content appointment), e-mail context (time or date) Email characteristic similar with other.These priority can clearly be distributed by user, or the user interactions based on email message or email list (for example with from each in one or more social groups, the user interactions of the email message of contact person, specific email address, the email message that sends about the email message of particular topic or on special time or date) distributes by system.
Above-described can for example, for generating the user interactions of order standard (priority or preference) can be based on user action, and can comprise one or two historical information and about relating to the user's of the email list that is shown at present user the information of action.Can comprise that this user wherein selects the order (for example first selecting the email message from certain addressee) of the email message in read electric mail tabulation for generating the example user action of order standard (being the order standard of machine learning).User and the time disappearing before the corresponding frequency of contact person or group, corresponding life-span (that is, the length of email thread), user's response.In addition, user can manually push to email message or push in list, therefore increases or reduce the priority of email message.The indication of the change of priority can be for generating the order standard for the email message that sorts.
In piece 403, system sorts with the one or more email messages to identification according to identified order standard application order standard.For example, system determines and each e-mail address being associated, contact person and/or social groups in one or more email messages, and according to the priority of distributing to social groups, contact person or e-mail address by these one or more email message ranks.In one example, system also (is for example determined theme and/or contextual information for each email message, time and date), and according to the priority that is dispensed to various themes or contextual information by these one or more email message ranks.
In one example, request or the setting of the request that order standard can be based on user or setting, E-mail service are applied to these one or more email messages (for example, user's inbox), or can automatically be applied by system.In one example, order standard can also depend on the time and date of carrying out sequence.For example, sequencing information can depend on time or date, makes system browse the time and date of his/her email message and apply different order standards based on user's request.The email list that order standard can be applied to show (for example, with the user action based on historical or nearest by the email list dynamic order showing), or the email message that can be applied to enter, or before email list is shown to user.In one example, in above-mentioned order standard one or more (for example, priority or preference) can (for example, by system or user) be assigned with weight, and this sequence can be based in order standard one or more, wherein said order standard each weight being associated based on one or more standards.
In piece 404, provide the email list of sequence, to show to user.In one example, the email list that wherein order standard is applied to having shown, the email list of this sequence is used to upgrade or replace the existing email list that forward user shows.As described above, in one example, about the user interactions of email message, can receive and analyze by system, to generate or new sorting criterion more.Therefore, in one example, after providing for the email message showing, in piece 405, system for example receives, for the indication of the user action about email list the action of the one or more email messages in email list (, about).In piece 406, system is used the indication receiving to generate new order standard or upgrade existing order standard (for example, being dispensed to the weight of particular sorted standard).In one example, system can further be used the indication of the user action of reception, to dynamically update the email list being provided to user's demonstration in piece 404, or the indication of this reception can be stored as to historical information.
