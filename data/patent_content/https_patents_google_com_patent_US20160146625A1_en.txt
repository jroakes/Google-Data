Definitions
- the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for guided navigation. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to navigation systems and methods for generating enhanced search query results when operating navigation systems.
- Navigation systems are known for identifying and displaying a desired geographic location, as illustrated on a map, as well as computing a route from a current location to a desired location. These systems are commonly found on automotive vehicles as well as encompassed within hand-held devices. It is often the case that navigation systems provide information relating to points of interest (POI), such as shopping, food, and business related locations. However, voluminous search query results are typically generated, which is inefficient and often ineffective for providing information relating to POIs. It would be advantageous for a navigation system to efficiently provide enhanced search query results for more effective searching. It would be further advantageous for a navigation system to provide sub-searching capabilities for refining search results and therefore providing more effective searching.
- POI points of interest
- a navigation system in one aspect of the disclosure, includes a graphical user interface configured for receiving input and displaying content, a database containing travel related data, and a processor for executing a search engine to provide search query results.
- the processor may be configured to receive, via the graphical user interface, an input for a destination location, initiate a search query based on the destination location, identify, from the travel related data in the database, a list of results based upon the search query, and identify a set of sub-search categories associated with the list of results.
- the processor is further configured to cause the graphical user interface to display the list of results, receive a keyword via the graphical user interface, associate the keyword with one of the set of sub-search categories, identify a refined list of results of the list of results according to the one of the set of sub-search categories, and cause the graphical user interface to display the refined list of results in the graphical user interface.
- a computer-implemented method for conveying enhanced search query results includes initiating a search query, by accessing a database storing geographic related information, based at least in part upon a final destination, identifying a list of destination results based at least in part upon the search query, identifying a set of sub-search categories associated with the list of destination results, and displaying, in a graphical user interface, the list of destination results.
- the method further includes receiving a keyword via the graphical user interface, associating the keyword with one of the set of sub-search categories, identifying a refined list of results of the list of destination results according to the one of the set of sub-search categories, and displaying the refined list of results in the graphical user interface.
- a computer-implemented method of conveying search query results includes initiating a search query based at least in part upon a final destination, identifying, from a database, a list of intermediary destination results based at least in part upon the search query, displaying the list of intermediary destination results in a graphical interface, identifying a set of sub-search categories associated with the list of intermediary destination results, and displaying, in the graphical interface, the list of intermediary destination results.
- the method further includes receiving a keyword via the graphical user interface, associating the keyword with one of the set of sub-search categories, initiating a sub-search based at least in part upon the one of the set of sub-search categories to identify a list of destination results, and displaying the list of destination results in the graphical user interface.

- the navigation system 10 includes a user interface 12 , a travel database 14 , and a search engine 16 .
- the system 10 can be a smart phone, mobile computing device, affixed within a vehicle, or another suitable configuration.
- the interface 12 has a graphic display 18 and manual data entry keypad 20 , which is generally known in the art and suitable for the present system 10 .
- the interface 12 can have a touch screen, QWERTY style keypad, wireless data entry, or voice activation and recognition.
- the travel database 14 is a relational database accessed by the search engine 16 .
- the travel database 14 includes travel related information, including, but not limited to maps, destinations, attractions, historical travel information and other travel related data.
- the search engine 16 is a processing device that is configured to execute computer executable code.
- the search engine 16 is a microprocessor.
- the database 14 includes information relating to geographical roadways and routes.
- a variety of commercially available databases containing map and atlas related information are suitable. It is contemplated that the database 14 includes additional information that is relevant to the user and previously performed search queries.
- additional information can include sociological data, such as neighborhood crime rates, ethnicity demographics and average household incomes, and industrial data, such as type of businesses, shopping related data, and potentially hazardous industrial locations.
- the generation of sociological and industrial profiles for neighborhoods or geographic regions is contemplated. Values assigned to various data within each profile can affect the prioritization and ranking of search query results.
- the search engine 16 can perform a reverse address search to identify businesses and other points of interest (POI) within close proximity of the current location.
- POI points of interest
- the interface 12 can be programmed to prompt a user to identify the current location by the POI visited. If a user identifies one or more POIs the information is updated within the database 14 . Alternatively, results having a higher ranking than the result chosen by a user are also recorded in the database 14 and can be assigned a lower ranking if the same search query is subsequently performed.
- the database 14 can also include information relating to previous travel and other behavior selections and circumstances encountered by one or more users in the past. Such information can be conceptually identified as separate, including geographic travel related historical data and contextual travel related historical data.
- the contextual travel related data includes information selected from the group including frequency of destination visits, search query time, time-of-day associated with previous search queries, current directional travel, weather conditions, traffic conditions, current time of day and frequency of current route.
- Contextual travel related historical data can also include information stored within the database 14 that represents associations and/or inferences extrapolated from historical and non-historical related data.
- the historical database can include information selected from the group comprising previous search queries, prior travel routes, prior locations visited, type of prior location visited and deviation distance from route for previously chosen locations.
- the database 14 can include previous destination specific information, which can affect the ranking and prioritization of that particular result.
- the operating hours of a previously visited business is stored in the database 14 . If the search query is performed outside of the business' operating hours, or the estimated time of travel to the destination added to query time would be outside of the operating hours, then the destination is given a lower rank or removed from the results completely.
- Travel database 14 data can also be harvested from a mobile device, such as cell phones, smart phones, PDAs, computers, and other electronic data storing devices.
- a wireless connection such as Bluetooth, or wired connection provides access to information for use in prioritizing search queries.
- previously dialed numbers and frequency of calls made and received can be stored in the database 14 and used for prioritizing search results.
- location and travel information from calls made or received from a mobile phone is contemplated. Higher call frequency associated with a particular number and location can affect the prioritization by assigning a higher rank to results in closer proximity to that particular location.
- the database 14 can generate associations between different types of data and generate inferences, which can affect prioritization of search results, based upon the associations.
- a search for “Motorola Phone” resulted in a user traveling to “Best Buy”. If the same search is performed at a subsequent time, results similar to “Best Buy” will be prioritized based upon the inference made from the previous search.
- a mobile device such as a Bluetooth enabled cell phone, can be used to identify a user, which the system 10 associates with stored historical data. Alternatively, a user can input their identity manually through the interface 12 .
- the system 10 is initiated at step 22 and a user provides a desired final destination to the interface 12 at step 24 .
- a route from the present location to the final destination is generated at step 26 , based at least in part upon information from the travel database 14 .
- a destination search query is initiated by a user.
- the system 10 accesses the database 14 at step 30 .
- the system 10 can access more than one database concurrently or in sequence and/or on a repeated basis for generating a list of POIs.
- a list of intermediary search results is generated at step 32 .
- the generated list is then prioritized at step 34 and displayed at step 36 .
- a decision whether to select one of the intermediary destinations in the list is performed at step 38 . If an intermediary destination is chosen at step 38 , then an intermediary route is generated at step 38 and the process terminates at step 42 . In the event that a selection is not made, a determination whether to initiate a sub-search occurs at step 44 . If a sub-search is not initiated, then the process reverts to step 28 . If a sub-search is initiated then a sub-search category is selected at step 46 and a POI/destination list is generated at step 48 based at least in part upon the particular category selected.
- an enhanced route based at least in part upon the category selection, is generated at step 52 and the process is terminated at step 42 .
- the process reverts to step 46 . If the process reverts to step 46 and a different category is selected, the new list is generated based at least in part upon the second category selected and not based upon the first category selection.
- sub-search categories are a unique method of refining navigation system search queries that provide even more pertinent results for users based upon their inputs, desired travel and POI destinations. After a search has been performed, sub-search categories are made available as input buttons 20 on the display 18 . Alternatively, categories can be provided in a variety of known methods through the display 18 .
- the first exemplary interface ( FIG. 3 ) represents a search for “Libertyville, Ill.” and all restaurants within a 10 mile radius. As indicated, there are 21 results that are listed on the interface. After selecting Libertyville, Ill. as the current location the restaurant category icon 54 was selected, resulting in the search results shown.
- the exemplary interface 12 includes a restaurant icon 54 , a fuel source icon 56 , a parking location icon 58 , and arts and entertainment icon 60 and a lodging icon 62 .
- the restaurant icon 54 when selected, provides a sub-search that refines search results and presents a list of restaurants and eating establishments within a default radius.
- the default radius can be changed based upon a user's preferences.
- the parking icon 58 provides a refined search, which focuses the search results based upon parking locations in close proximity to the search selection, or all of the results in the search list.
- the arts and entertainment icon 60 provides a refined sub-search, when selected, for POIs that pertain to performing arts, entertainment and traditional art POIs.
- Pre-determined icons can be associated with various search results such that the search list includes one or more icons displayed along side, or in proximity to, the search result in the list.
- the interface 12 includes a home selector 64 , a scroll up selector 66 and a scroll down selector 68 .
- the home selector 64 returns to a main or home screen when selected.
- the scroll up selector 66 and the scroll down selector 68 allow a user to scroll up and down, respectively, through the list of search results.
- an additional keyword search is performed for the term “Risto” (See FIG. 4 ). Of the 21 restaurants in the search list, only 2 meet the criteria searched. This refinement step enables a user to further focus and refine search queries to more effectively and quickly find the most pertinent search results. After a user finds and selects the preferred search result, the system generates a navigational route to the selected search result.
- the interface 12 includes the search results with a representative icon to the left of each search result in the list.
- the icon is representative of the category within which the search result is associated.
- a next list icon 70 is provided, which allows a user to view additional category icons for sub-search refinement.
- additional icons are provided, including a religious worship icon 72 , an educational institution icon 74 and a medical services icon 76 . Each of these icons provided added refinement for search queries.
- Search categories include any named element within the travel database 14 .
- named categories can include streets, subdivisions, neighborhoods, parks, lakes, rivers and alternative categories.
- categories defined in the taxonomy as POIs in the database 14 are included.
- meta-categories that are encompassing multiple existing categories can be searched.
- “Asian Food” is a meta-category that can include Chinese, Japanese and Thai food.
- an alternative method of search refinement includes obtaining focused or refined search results after sub-searching a category or multiple categories.
- the combination of multiple categories can be based upon data elements within the database 14 that have a logical relationship or belong to more than one category.
- the relationship between data elements can be spatial, such as the physical proximity between two destinations.
- a relevancy factor can be applied to the destinations based upon their relative proximity.
- a user can conduct a sub-search through pre-defined or user-selected keywords.
- the system 10 includes a look-up table as part of the database 14 that associates the keyword with a particular category or meta-category search. This is particularly useful as users often loosely mix the content of the search criteria, such as “Wine & Liquor Store” or “Bread & Bakery”.
- the search results can include both direct matches as well as substitution matches. Direct matches have a higher priority, and therefore substitution matches by default, which can be changed, are shown when there are a limited number of direct matches.
- the method is initiated at step 78 and a user provides a desired final destination to the interface 12 at step 80 .
- the search query is initiated at step 82 .
- a search query list is displayed on the interface 12 at step 84 .
- a sub-search is then initiated at step 86 .
- a decision whether to select a search category from the default list is performed at step 88 . If a default category is not selected, then the next list icon 70 is selected at step 90 and a category from an additional list is identified at step 92 .
- a sub-search category is selected at step 94 . In the event that a default category is desired, then the category is selected at step 94 .
- a list of refined search query results is generated at step 96 .
- sub-search categories can be selected for searching purposes.
- a user can utilize the sub-searching categories to highly refine a search query based upon particular and specific searching criteria and desired results.
- mixed categories can be predefined or created on the fly by a user and/or the system 10 .
- a mixed category such as “Gas Station” and “Food” could be automatically generated by the system 10 based upon a previous proximity search for a gas station and restaurant.
- the final destination route can be analyzed based upon contextual information, such as the approximate distance or estimated length of time and type of driving (By example, Interstate, County Highway, or City Roadway).
- Query results are prioritized based at least in part upon the route context and sub-search categories selected.
- a longer route on the Interstate can prioritize fast-food restaurants located proximal to the Interstate higher than a five-star restaurant located distal to the Interstate. If a lodging sub-search category was selected, then the results would be further prioritized based upon lodging proximity and predetermined lodging specifics.
- An intermediary destination is a location other than a location at the time of generating the search and the final destination.
- the intermediary location can be located proximal or distal to the final destination route. Once an intermediary location is selected and a route is generated, the final destination route is recalculated based upon the intermediary location. Traffic information, road construction, preferred routes, and alternative roadway information can be utilized in generating prioritized route.
- a user can optionally select alternative methods of transportation, such as walking or bicycle travel, which can alter the route accordingly.
- a method of conveying search query results includes initiating a search query based at least in part upon a final destination.
- the final destination is selected by a user.
- a travel database is accessed.
- the database includes historical travel related information and contextual travel related information.
- a list of intermediary destination results is generated based at least in part upon the search query, historical travel related information, contextual travel related information and sub-searching categories.
- the intermediary results are displayed within a graphical interface, such as one provided by a mobile navigation system.
- the user can select any of the intermediary destinations, which are distinct from a current location and the final destination.
- the database can be accessed remotely, such as through a GPS or other wireless method, or the database can be integral to the navigation system. Databases integral to a navigation device can be regularly updated through wired or wireless communication with a supplied database (not shown).
- the database 14 information is logically associated with the respective sub-search categories.
- the system 10 allows a user to provide a search query to the interface 12 representing a combination of search criteria.
- the query is proofed by the search engine 16 for typos or misspellings, and alternative keywords are suggested if a discrepancy is discovered.
- the combined search query can be compared with more than one database sequentially or concurrently.
- a list of POIs are provided based in part upon the keywords selected, proximity metrics to a final destination and the structure associated with the databases.
- the search query can be referred to as an unstructured search query, which provides flexibility and greater ease of use.
- a user enters a vehicle in downtown Chicago, Ill. and enters a search query including the keyword “Fast food” and selects an option for close proximity to a final destination, which is identified as “work”.
- the search engine identifies the search query and compares the query to historical query information contained within one or more databases. After the comparison is complete the search engine generates a prioritized list of fast food destination within close proximity to the user's preferred route to work. “Dunkin Donuts” is at the top of the list, followed by several other fast food restaurants, as well as additional Dunkin Donut locations. The user presses the sub-searching icon that represents available parking in close proximity to the query results.
- a new list is generated that refines the list based upon available parking.
- the search engine also identified the user's contextual information, including location upon query initiation, time of day, day of week and season. After comparing the database with the user's query and contextual information, it was identified that the user had traveled to Dunkin Donuts 12 previous times during the work week, at approximately 6:00 A.M., during the winter while on his way to work after initiating the same or similar query. The user had previously traveled to “Starbucks” only 3 times, and therefore this location had been assigned a lower priority value. In the immediate case, a Dunkin Donut location without available parking was placed towards the bottom of the list, even though it was closer to the desired route. The user selects a Dunkin Donut location that is closest to the desired route and that has convenient available parking in close proximity.
- a search is initiated containing the keywords “Restaurants in Chicago.” After initiating the query a database is accessed and a comparison of the keywords is performed with respect to information contained within a database having historical travel data.
- a list of restaurants in Chicago is provided ranked by the frequency of visits to a particular restaurant, the day of week and time of day associated with the current query and prior visits to the results.
- Traffic data can be collected based upon the time of day and day of week to minimize the travel time to a location, and the list can be prioritized based upon the estimated travel time.
- Combination of historical, contextual and traffic information relating to a particular search query can provide a list of enhanced search results.
- the search results represent a list of potential intermediary destinations. The user selects an arts and entertainment icon to further refine the list.
- performing arts and entertainment venues in close proximity to the restaurants in the search list are provided.
- a user is then able to select a performing arts venue that is conveniently located in close proximity to the Chicago restaurant they desire. It is conceived that an initial and final destination are one in the same, while the intermediary destination is a target destination within a round-trip travel sequence.
- a search query is initiated for a brand of navigation systems, such as “Motorola.”
- the search is performed and a generated list of possible businesses offering Motorola® navigation systems for sale is provided.
- the businesses can include electronic stores, department stores, travel-specific businesses, and alternative locations that carry Motorola® products. Businesses are prioritized based upon frequency of visit, location proximity, and other contextual and historical information. Searching for a preferred brand, such as Motorola® navigation systems, will return businesses that are associated with selling and servicing the preferred product brand.
- a user can further refine the search results based upon the need to obtain fuel for their vehicle.
- a fuel source icon is selected, which focuses the results list based upon fuel sources that are in close proximity to the user's current location and that provide the most efficient route to the search results on the list.

The method includes initiating a search query, by accessing a database storing geographic related information, based at least in part upon a final destination, identifying a list of destination results based at least in part upon the search query, identifying a set of sub-search categories associated with the list of destination results, and displaying, in a graphical user interface, the list of destination results. The method further includes receiving a keyword via the graphical user interface, associating the keyword with one of the set of sub-search categories, identifying a refined list of results of the list of destination results according to the one of the set of sub-search categories, and displaying the refined list of results in the graphical user interface.
- In yet another aspect of the disclosure, a computer-implemented method of conveying search query results is provided. The method includes initiating a search query based at least in part upon a final destination, identifying, from a database, a list of intermediary destination results based at least in part upon the search query, displaying the list of intermediary destination results in a graphical interface, identifying a set of sub-search categories associated with the list of intermediary destination results, and displaying, in the graphical interface, the list of intermediary destination results. The method further includes receiving a keyword via the graphical user interface, associating the keyword with one of the set of sub-search categories, initiating a sub-search based at least in part upon the one of the set of sub-search categories to identify a list of destination results, and displaying the list of destination results in the graphical user interface.

database 14 includes information relating to geographical roadways and routes. A variety of commercially available databases containing map and atlas related information are suitable. It is contemplated that thedatabase 14 includes additional information that is relevant to the user and previously performed search queries. By example, additional information can include sociological data, such as neighborhood crime rates, ethnicity demographics and average household incomes, and industrial data, such as type of businesses, shopping related data, and potentially hazardous industrial locations. Additionally, the generation of sociological and industrial profiles for neighborhoods or geographic regions is contemplated. Values assigned to various data within each profile can affect the prioritization and ranking of search query results. Utilizing thedatabase 14, thesearch engine 16 can perform a reverse address search to identify businesses and other points of interest (POI) within close proximity of the current location. Theinterface 12 can be programmed to prompt a user to identify the current location by the POI visited. If a user identifies one or more POIs the information is updated within thedatabase 14. Alternatively, results having a higher ranking than the result chosen by a user are also recorded in thedatabase 14 and can be assigned a lower ranking if the same search query is subsequently performed. - The
database 14 can also include information relating to previous travel and other behavior selections and circumstances encountered by one or more users in the past. Such information can be conceptually identified as separate, including geographic travel related historical data and contextual travel related historical data. The contextual travel related data includes information selected from the group including frequency of destination visits, search query time, time-of-day associated with previous search queries, current directional travel, weather conditions, traffic conditions, current time of day and frequency of current route. Contextual travel related historical data can also include information stored within thedatabase 14 that represents associations and/or inferences extrapolated from historical and non-historical related data. The historical database can include information selected from the group comprising previous search queries, prior travel routes, prior locations visited, type of prior location visited and deviation distance from route for previously chosen locations. Additionally, thedatabase 14 can include previous destination specific information, which can affect the ranking and prioritization of that particular result. By example, the operating hours of a previously visited business is stored in thedatabase 14. If the search query is performed outside of the business' operating hours, or the estimated time of travel to the destination added to query time would be outside of the operating hours, then the destination is given a lower rank or removed from the results completely. -
Travel database 14 data can also be harvested from a mobile device, such as cell phones, smart phones, PDAs, computers, and other electronic data storing devices. A wireless connection, such as Bluetooth, or wired connection provides access to information for use in prioritizing search queries. By example, previously dialed numbers and frequency of calls made and received can be stored in thedatabase 14 and used for prioritizing search results. Additionally, location and travel information from calls made or received from a mobile phone is contemplated. Higher call frequency associated with a particular number and location can affect the prioritization by assigning a higher rank to results in closer proximity to that particular location. Thedatabase 14 can generate associations between different types of data and generate inferences, which can affect prioritization of search results, based upon the associations. By example, a search for “Motorola Phone” resulted in a user traveling to “Best Buy”. If the same search is performed at a subsequent time, results similar to “Best Buy” will be prioritized based upon the inference made from the previous search. It is contemplated that a mobile device, such as a Bluetooth enabled cell phone, can be used to identify a user, which the system 10 associates with stored historical data. Alternatively, a user can input their identity manually through theinterface 12. - Now referring to
FIG. 2 an exemplary process is provided for execution of enhanced sub-search queries. The system 10 is initiated at step 22 and a user provides a desired final destination to theinterface 12 at step 24. A route from the present location to the final destination is generated atstep 26, based at least in part upon information from thetravel database 14. At step 28, a destination search query is initiated by a user. Based upon the search query, the system 10 accesses thedatabase 14 at step 30. Alternatively, the system 10 can access more than one database concurrently or in sequence and/or on a repeated basis for generating a list of POIs. After accessing the database at step 30, a list of intermediary search results is generated atstep 32. The generated list is then prioritized atstep 34 and displayed atstep 36. A decision whether to select one of the intermediary destinations in the list is performed atstep 38. If an intermediary destination is chosen atstep 38, then an intermediary route is generated atstep 38 and the process terminates atstep 42. In the event that a selection is not made, a determination whether to initiate a sub-search occurs at step 44. If a sub-search is not initiated, then the process reverts to step 28. If a sub-search is initiated then a sub-search category is selected at step 46 and a POI/destination list is generated at step 48 based at least in part upon the particular category selected. If a POI/destination is selected from the list, then an enhanced route, based at least in part upon the category selection, is generated atstep 52 and the process is terminated atstep 42. In the event that a POI/destination is not selected at step 50, then the process reverts to step 46. If the process reverts to step 46 and a different category is selected, the new list is generated based at least in part upon the second category selected and not based upon the first category selection. - Employing sub-search categories is a unique method of refining navigation system search queries that provide even more pertinent results for users based upon their inputs, desired travel and POI destinations. After a search has been performed, sub-search categories are made available as
input buttons 20 on thedisplay 18. Alternatively, categories can be provided in a variety of known methods through thedisplay 18. - Now referring to
FIGS. 3-6 ,exemplary interfaces 12 are provided. As an example, the first exemplary interface (FIG. 3 ) represents a search for “Libertyville, Ill.” and all restaurants within a 10 mile radius. As indicated, there are 21 results that are listed on the interface. After selecting Libertyville, Ill. as the current location therestaurant category icon 54 was selected, resulting in the search results shown. Theexemplary interface 12 includes arestaurant icon 54, afuel source icon 56, aparking location icon 58, and arts andentertainment icon 60 and alodging icon 62. Therestaurant icon 54, when selected, provides a sub-search that refines search results and presents a list of restaurants and eating establishments within a default radius. The default radius can be changed based upon a user's preferences. Similarly, theparking icon 58 provides a refined search, which focuses the search results based upon parking locations in close proximity to the search selection, or all of the results in the search list. The arts andentertainment icon 60 provides a refined sub-search, when selected, for POIs that pertain to performing arts, entertainment and traditional art POIs. Pre-determined icons can be associated with various search results such that the search list includes one or more icons displayed along side, or in proximity to, the search result in the list. - Additionally, the
interface 12 includes ahome selector 64, a scroll upselector 66 and a scroll downselector 68. Thehome selector 64 returns to a main or home screen when selected. The scroll upselector 66 and the scroll downselector 68 allow a user to scroll up and down, respectively, through the list of search results. - Based upon the search list provided in
FIG. 3 , an additional keyword search is performed for the term “Risto” (SeeFIG. 4 ). Of the 21 restaurants in the search list, only 2 meet the criteria searched. This refinement step enables a user to further focus and refine search queries to more effectively and quickly find the most pertinent search results. After a user finds and selects the preferred search result, the system generates a navigational route to the selected search result. - Referring to
FIG. 5 , a query including the search term “Main St” was performed. Theinterface 12 includes the search results with a representative icon to the left of each search result in the list. The icon is representative of the category within which the search result is associated. In the present exemplary interface 12 anext list icon 70 is provided, which allows a user to view additional category icons for sub-search refinement. Referring toFIG. 6 , additional icons are provided, including areligious worship icon 72, aneducational institution icon 74 and amedical services icon 76. Each of these icons provided added refinement for search queries. - Search categories include any named element within the
travel database 14. By example, named categories can include streets, subdivisions, neighborhoods, parks, lakes, rivers and alternative categories. Additionally, categories defined in the taxonomy as POIs in thedatabase 14 are included. Furthermore, meta-categories that are encompassing multiple existing categories can be searched. By example, “Asian Food” is a meta-category that can include Chinese, Japanese and Thai food. - It is contemplated that the navigation system 10 search refinement can be obtained in several different processes. By example, an alternative method of search refinement includes obtaining focused or refined search results after sub-searching a category or multiple categories. The combination of multiple categories, by example, can be based upon data elements within the
database 14 that have a logical relationship or belong to more than one category. Alternatively, the relationship between data elements can be spatial, such as the physical proximity between two destinations. A relevancy factor can be applied to the destinations based upon their relative proximity. - In an alternative embodiment, a user can conduct a sub-search through pre-defined or user-selected keywords. The system 10 includes a look-up table as part of the
database 14 that associates the keyword with a particular category or meta-category search. This is particularly useful as users often loosely mix the content of the search criteria, such as “Wine & Liquor Store” or “Bread & Bakery”. The search results can include both direct matches as well as substitution matches. Direct matches have a higher priority, and therefore substitution matches by default, which can be changed, are shown when there are a limited number of direct matches. - Referring to
FIG. 7 , an alternative embodiment of the process is provided. The method is initiated atstep 78 and a user provides a desired final destination to theinterface 12 at step 80. The search query is initiated at step 82. A search query list is displayed on theinterface 12 atstep 84. A sub-search is then initiated at step 86. A decision whether to select a search category from the default list is performed atstep 88. If a default category is not selected, then thenext list icon 70 is selected atstep 90 and a category from an additional list is identified at step 92. A sub-search category is selected at step 94. In the event that a default category is desired, then the category is selected at step 94. A list of refined search query results is generated at step 96. A determination is made at step 98 whether to select one of the destinations in the list. If a result is not selected, then the process reverts to step 82. In the event that a result is selected then a determination is made whether to further refine the search query list with a second category atstep 100. If a second category is selected, then a new list is generated at step 102 and the user selects one or more destinations from the revised list atstep 104. An enhanced route is generated at step 106, based at least in part upon the sub-searching categories selected. The process terminates at step 108. - It is contemplated that more than two sub-search categories can be selected for searching purposes. A user can utilize the sub-searching categories to highly refine a search query based upon particular and specific searching criteria and desired results. Alternatively, mixed categories can be predefined or created on the fly by a user and/or the system 10. As an example, a mixed category such as “Gas Station” and “Food” could be automatically generated by the system 10 based upon a previous proximity search for a gas station and restaurant.
- The final destination route can be analyzed based upon contextual information, such as the approximate distance or estimated length of time and type of driving (By example, Interstate, County Highway, or City Roadway). Query results are prioritized based at least in part upon the route context and sub-search categories selected. By example, a longer route on the Interstate can prioritize fast-food restaurants located proximal to the Interstate higher than a five-star restaurant located distal to the Interstate. If a lodging sub-search category was selected, then the results would be further prioritized based upon lodging proximity and predetermined lodging specifics.
- An intermediary destination is a location other than a location at the time of generating the search and the final destination. The intermediary location can be located proximal or distal to the final destination route. Once an intermediary location is selected and a route is generated, the final destination route is recalculated based upon the intermediary location. Traffic information, road construction, preferred routes, and alternative roadway information can be utilized in generating prioritized route. A user can optionally select alternative methods of transportation, such as walking or bicycle travel, which can alter the route accordingly.
- Alternatively, a method of conveying search query results includes initiating a search query based at least in part upon a final destination. The final destination is selected by a user. After selecting the target or final destination a travel database is accessed. The database includes historical travel related information and contextual travel related information. A list of intermediary destination results is generated based at least in part upon the search query, historical travel related information, contextual travel related information and sub-searching categories. After the intermediary results have been generated they are displayed within a graphical interface, such as one provided by a mobile navigation system. The user can select any of the intermediary destinations, which are distinct from a current location and the final destination. The database can be accessed remotely, such as through a GPS or other wireless method, or the database can be integral to the navigation system. Databases integral to a navigation device can be regularly updated through wired or wireless communication with a supplied database (not shown). The
database 14 information is logically associated with the respective sub-search categories. - In an alternative embodiment, the system 10 allows a user to provide a search query to the
interface 12 representing a combination of search criteria. The query is proofed by thesearch engine 16 for typos or misspellings, and alternative keywords are suggested if a discrepancy is discovered. The combined search query can be compared with more than one database sequentially or concurrently. A list of POIs are provided based in part upon the keywords selected, proximity metrics to a final destination and the structure associated with the databases. The search query can be referred to as an unstructured search query, which provides flexibility and greater ease of use. - To further consider the system and methods described herein, several search query examples are provided. These are merely exemplary and not intended to limit the scope of the claims provided herein. It is further contemplated that the disclosure can encompass a variety of other scenarios.
- At approximately 6:00 A.M. on a Wednesday during the winter a user enters a vehicle in downtown Chicago, Ill. and enters a search query including the keyword “Fast food” and selects an option for close proximity to a final destination, which is identified as “work”. The search engine identifies the search query and compares the query to historical query information contained within one or more databases. After the comparison is complete the search engine generates a prioritized list of fast food destination within close proximity to the user's preferred route to work. “Dunkin Donuts” is at the top of the list, followed by several other fast food restaurants, as well as additional Dunkin Donut locations. The user presses the sub-searching icon that represents available parking in close proximity to the query results. A new list is generated that refines the list based upon available parking. The search engine also identified the user's contextual information, including location upon query initiation, time of day, day of week and season. After comparing the database with the user's query and contextual information, it was identified that the user had traveled to
Dunkin Donuts 12 previous times during the work week, at approximately 6:00 A.M., during the winter while on his way to work after initiating the same or similar query. The user had previously traveled to “Starbucks” only 3 times, and therefore this location had been assigned a lower priority value. In the immediate case, a Dunkin Donut location without available parking was placed towards the bottom of the list, even though it was closer to the desired route. The user selects a Dunkin Donut location that is closest to the desired route and that has convenient available parking in close proximity. - A search is initiated containing the keywords “Restaurants in Chicago.” After initiating the query a database is accessed and a comparison of the keywords is performed with respect to information contained within a database having historical travel data. A list of restaurants in Chicago is provided ranked by the frequency of visits to a particular restaurant, the day of week and time of day associated with the current query and prior visits to the results. Traffic data can be collected based upon the time of day and day of week to minimize the travel time to a location, and the list can be prioritized based upon the estimated travel time. Combination of historical, contextual and traffic information relating to a particular search query can provide a list of enhanced search results. The search results represent a list of potential intermediary destinations. The user selects an arts and entertainment icon to further refine the list. In the present case, performing arts and entertainment venues in close proximity to the restaurants in the search list are provided. A user is then able to select a performing arts venue that is conveniently located in close proximity to the Chicago restaurant they desire. It is conceived that an initial and final destination are one in the same, while the intermediary destination is a target destination within a round-trip travel sequence.
- A search query is initiated for a brand of navigation systems, such as “Motorola.” The search is performed and a generated list of possible businesses offering Motorola® navigation systems for sale is provided. The businesses can include electronic stores, department stores, travel-specific businesses, and alternative locations that carry Motorola® products. Businesses are prioritized based upon frequency of visit, location proximity, and other contextual and historical information. Searching for a preferred brand, such as Motorola® navigation systems, will return businesses that are associated with selling and servicing the preferred product brand. A user can further refine the search results based upon the need to obtain fuel for their vehicle. A fuel source icon is selected, which focuses the results list based upon fuel sources that are in close proximity to the user's current location and that provide the most efficient route to the search results on the list.
- It is specifically intended that the present disclosure not be limited to the embodiments and illustrations contained herein, but rather that the present disclosure also include modified forms of those embodiments including portions of the embodiments and combinations of elements of different embodiments as come within the scope of the following claims.
