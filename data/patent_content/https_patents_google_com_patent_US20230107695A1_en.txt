- Gating has been used as a technique in recurrent structures to fuse information.
- gating has been used in RNN-Ts to fuse acoustic and text representations by allowing each element in a representation vector to be scaled with a different weight before being integrated via, for example, vector addition. This allows, for example, the relative fusing of acoustic and text representations to be adjusted.
- the D joint dimensional fused representation h t,u joint generated by the joint network can be expressed mathematically as follows:

- text representation i.e., dense representation
- acoustic representation i.e., first higher order feature representation
- the prediction network of an RNN-T may converge faster than the audio encoder of the RNN-T. This may result in the joint network of the RNN-T becoming overly reliant on the text representations generated by the prediction network over the acoustic representations generated by the audio encoder when performing ASR on training utterances.
- the joint network of the RNN-T may overly depend on h u pred output by the prediction network when computing h t,u joint .
- the audio encoder may be less well trained to encode the audio samples that are associated with higher prediction network scores.

- novel combination structure e.g., see EQN (11) below
- Example prediction network regularization routines disclosed herein reduce the gradients back-propagated into the prediction network during training in order to optimally balance the fusing of h t enc and h u pred by the joint network. For example, during training, the prediction network regularization routines re-compute the dense representation h u pred using a scaling factor and a stop gradient function having an input tensor with zero gradients.

Description
- This U.S. Patent Application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application 63/262,184, filed on Oct. 6, 2021. The disclosure of this prior application is considered part of the disclosure of this application and is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
- This disclosure relates generally to recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) models and, more particularly, to improving the fusing of acoustic and text representations in an RNN-T model.
- Modem automated speech recognition (ASR) systems focus on providing not only high quality (e.g., a low word error rate (WER)), but also low latency (e.g., a short delay between the user speaking and a transcription appearing). Moreover, when using an ASR system today there is a demand that the ASR system decode utterances in a streaming fashion that corresponds to real-time or even faster than real-time. To illustrate, when an ASR system is deployed on a mobile phone that experiences direct user interactivity, an application on the mobile phone using the ASR system may require the speech recognition to be streaming such that words appear on the screen as soon as they are spoken. Here, it is also likely that the user of the mobile phone has a low tolerance for latency. Due to this low tolerance, the speech recognition strives to run on the mobile device in a manner that minimizes an impact from latency and inaccuracy that may detrimentally affect the user's experience.
- One aspect of the disclosure provides an automated speech recognition (ASR) model including an encoder network, a prediction network, and a joint network. The encoder network is configured to receive, as first input, a sequence of acoustic frames characterizing an input utterance; and generate, at each of a plurality of output steps, a higher order feature representation for a corresponding acoustic frame in the sequence of acoustic frames. The prediction network is configured to receive, as second input, a sequence of non-blank symbols output by a final Softmax layer; and generate, at each of the plurality of output steps, a dense representation. The joint network is configured to receive, as third input, the dense representation generated by the prediction network at each of the plurality of output steps and the higher order feature representation generated by the audio encoder at each of the plurality of output steps, and generate, at each of the plurality of output steps, a probability distribution over possible speech recognition hypotheses. The joint network includes a combination structure that stacks gating and bilinear pooling to fuse the dense representation generated by the prediction network and the higher order feature representation generated by the audio encoder.
- Implementations of the disclosure may include one or more of the following optional features. In some implementations, a regularization method is applied to the prediction network during training by recomputing the dense representation using a scaling factor and a stop gradient function having an input tensor with zero gradients. In some examples, the joint network is not a fully connected layer.
- In some implementations, the audio encoder includes a stack of self-attention blocks. In these implementations, the stack of self-attention blocks may include a stack of conformer blocks, or a stack of transformer blocks. In some examples, the stack of conformer blocks includes a stack of 12 encoder blocks having 8-head self-attention.
- In some implementations, the prediction network includes a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based prediction network. Alternatively, the prediction network may include a V2 embedding look-up table. In some examples, the prediction network includes a stateless prediction network.
- Another aspect of the disclosure provides a computer-implemented method that, when executed on data processing hardware, causes the data processing hardware to perform operations. The operations including receiving a sequence of acoustic frames characterizing an input utterance. The operations further including, at each of a plurality of time steps generating, by an audio encoder of a speech recognition model, a higher order feature representation for a corresponding acoustic frame in the sequence of acoustic frames, and generating, by a prediction network of the speech recognition model, a dense representation for a corresponding sequence of non-blank symbols output by a final Softmax layer of the speech recognition model. The operations at each of the plurality of time steps further include generating, by a joint network of the speech recognition model that receives the higher order feature representation generated by the audio encoder and the dense representation generated by the prediction network, a probability distribution over possible speech recognition hypotheses. The joint network includes a combination structure that stacks gating and bilinear pooling to fuse the dense representation generated by the prediction network and the higher order feature representation generated by the audio encoder.
- Implementations of the disclosure may include one or more of the following optional features. In some implementations, the a regularization method is applied to the prediction network during training by recomputing the dense representation using a scaling factor and a stop gradient function having an input tensor with zero gradients. In some examples, the joint network does not include a fully connected layer.
- In some implementations, the audio encoder includes a stack of self-attention blocks. In these implementations, the stack of self-attention blocks may include a stack of conformer blocks, or a stack of transformer blocks. In some examples, the stack of conformer blocks includes a stack of 12 encoder blocks having 8-head self-attention.
- In some implementations, the prediction network includes a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based prediction network. Alternatively, the prediction network may include a V2 embedding look-up table. In some examples, the prediction network includes a stateless prediction network.

- A recurrent neural network-transducer (RNN-T) architecture is an end-to-end solution (e.g., a single neural network model) that can be used for streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) of streaming audio, among other uses. An RNN-T may be part of a speech recognition model or system. To estimate output distributions over word or subword units, an RNN-T includes a joint network to fuse (i) higher order feature representations (also referred to generally as acoustic representations) generated by an audio encoder with (ii) dense representations (also referred to generally as text representations) generated by a prediction network based on previously decoded text using a recurrent structure between the previous and current text in an output text sequence. The audio encoder receives, as input, a sequence of acoustic frames characterizing an input utterance, and generates, at each of a plurality of output steps, the higher order feature representation for a corresponding acoustic frame in the sequence of acoustic frames. The prediction network receives, as input, a sequence of non-blank symbols output by a final Softmax layer of the RNN-T, and generates, at each of the plurality of output steps, a dense representation. The joint network receives, as input, the dense representation generated by the prediction network at each of a plurality of output steps and the higher order feature representation generated by the audio encoder at each of the plurality of output steps, and generates, at each of the plurality of output steps, a probability distribution over possible speech recognition hypotheses. An output layer (e.g., a final Softmax layer) selects, based on the probability distribution, as an output transcription, the candidate transcription or hypothesis having the highest likelihood score of accurately representing the sequence of acoustic frames characterizing the input utterance.
- In more particularity, the RNN-T performs ASR by finding the most probable text sequence y given a sequence of acoustic frames x1:Γ. According to Baye's rule, decoding may follow a maximum a posteriori rule to search over each possible hypothesized text sequence y using, for example, the following mathematical expression:
-
P(y|x 1:T)∝p(x 1:T |y)P(y) (1) - where P(x1:T|Y) is estimated by the audio encoder and represents the likelihood that x1:T was spoken given y, and P(y) is estimated by the prediction network using a language model (LM) that represents an underlying probabilistic distribution of the text. RNN-T models P(y|x1:T) use a single end-to-end model (e.g., a single neural network). Assuming y=y1:U, where U is the number of subword units in y, then for streaming audio data without any look ahead frames or time reduction, a Denc dimensional higher order feature representation ht enc generated by the audio encoder at time t, a Dpred dimensional dense representation hu pred of the uth subword unit generated by the prediction network, and a Djoint dimensional fused representation ht,u joint generated by the joint network can be expressed as follows:
-
h t enc=AcousticEncoder(x 1:t) (2) -
h u pred=PredictionNetwork(y 1:u-1) (3) -
h t,u joint=JointNetwork(h t enc ,h u Pred) (4) -
P(ŷ i =k|y 0:u-1 ,x 1:t)=Softmax(W out h t,u joint) k (5) - where y0 refers to a special start of sentence symbol, and k and Wout are, respectively, the kth node and weights of the output layer.
- In some examples, the AcousticEncoder in EQN (2) includes a conformer encoder with a fixed number of look ahead frames and a fixed time reduction rate, the PredictionNetwork in EQN (3) includes a multi-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and the JointNetwork in EQN (4) includes a fully connected (FC) layer, where
-
h t,u joint=tanh(W 1 joint h t enc +W 2 joint h u pred) (6) - and W1 joint and W2 joint are weight matrices. When ht enc is ignored in EQN (6), the prediction network, joint network, and output layer jointly form an LSTM language model (LM) that may be referred to as an internal LM. However, studies show fusing the acoustic representations and text representations can improve ASR accuracy.
- Gating has been used as a technique in recurrent structures to fuse information. For example, gating has been used in RNN-Ts to fuse acoustic and text representations by allowing each element in a representation vector to be scaled with a different weight before being integrated via, for example, vector addition. This allows, for example, the relative fusing of acoustic and text representations to be adjusted. In more particularity, with gating, the Djoint dimensional fused representation ht,u joint generated by the joint network can be expressed mathematically as follows:
-
h t,u gate =g t,u gate⊙ tanh(W 1 joint h t enc)+1−g t,u gate)⊙ tanh(W 2 joint h u pred) (7) - where gt,u gate is a gating vector that can be expressed mathematically as follows:
-
g t,u gate=σ(W 1 gate h t enc +W 2 gate h u pred) (8) - where σ( ) is a sigmoid function, and W1 gate and W2 gate are weight matrices of the gating layer.
- An even more powerful, albeit more computationally expensive, technique of fusing information, such as the acoustic and text representations, is bilinear pooling. Bilinear pooling combines the representation vectors using a bilinear form, which can be expressed as follows:
-
h t,u,d joint=(h t enc)T W d bi h u pred (9) - where Wd bi is a Denc×Dpred dimensional matrix, and ht,u,d joint is the dth element of ht,u joint. Considering all elements in ht,u joint, [W1 bi, . . . , WD
joint bi] is a Denc×Dpred×Djoint dimensional weight tensor, and fusing of ht enc and ht pred using bilinear pooling can be mathematically expressed as follows: -
h t,u,d joint=([Vector(W 1 bi), . . . ,Vector(W Djoint bi)])TVector(h t enc ⊗h u pred) (10) - where Vector and ⊗ refer, respectively, to vectorization and outer product. Compared to gating, bilinear pooling first computes the outer product of the two representation vectors to capture the multiplicative interactions between all possible element pairs in a more expressive Denc×Dpred dimensional space, and then projects that into a Djoint dimensional vector space.
- Implementations herein are directed toward combining the use of gating and bilinear pooling in the joint network of an RNN-T to balance and improve the fusion of higher order feature representations (also referred to generally as acoustic representations) encoded by the audio encoder from input acoustic frames and dense representations (also referred to generally as text representations). Disclosed herein are novel structures for the joint network of an RNN-T that include gating and bilinear pooling to improve the fusion of acoustic and text representations. By combining gating with bilinear pooling, resultant joint networks leverage the respective strengths and complimentary features of gating and bilinear pooling while fusing the text representation (i.e., dense representation) generated by the prediction network and the acoustic representation (i.e., first higher order feature representation) generated by the audio encoder.
- It has been observed that, because text priors are often easier to learn than acoustic features, the prediction network of an RNN-T may converge faster than the audio encoder of the RNN-T. This may result in the joint network of the RNN-T becoming overly reliant on the text representations generated by the prediction network over the acoustic representations generated by the audio encoder when performing ASR on training utterances. For example, the joint network of the RNN-T may overly depend on hu pred output by the prediction network when computing ht,u joint. In such situations, the audio encoder may be less well trained to encode the audio samples that are associated with higher prediction network scores. In order to reduce these training imbalances, prediction network regularization routines may be applied, for example, at the start of training the RNN-T model. Implementations herein are further directed toward using prediction network regularization routines with the joint network having the novel combination structure (e.g., see EQN (11) below) that stacks gating and bilinear pooling to fuse the dense representation generated by the prediction network and the higher order feature representation generated by the encoder network, or with joint networks configured with other structures capable fusing acoustic and text representations (e.g., see EQN (6), EQN (7), EQN (9), or EQN (10)). Example prediction network regularization routines disclosed herein reduce the gradients back-propagated into the prediction network during training in order to optimally balance the fusing of ht enc and hu pred by the joint network. For example, during training, the prediction network regularization routines re-compute the dense representation hu pred using a scaling factor and a stop gradient function having an input tensor with zero gradients.

FIG. 1 is an example of aspeech environment 100. In thespeech environment 100, a user's 104 manner of interacting with a computing device, such as auser device 10, may be through voice input. The user device 10 (also referred to generally as a device 10) is configured to capture sounds (e.g., streaming audio data) from one ormore users 104 within thespeech environment 100. Here, the streaming audio data may refer to a spokenutterance 106 by theuser 104 that functions as an audible query, a command for thedevice 10, or an audible communication captured by thedevice 10. Speech-enabled systems of thedevice 10 may field the query or the command by answering the query and/or causing the command to be performed/fulfilled by one or more downstream applications. - The
user device 10 may correspond to any computing device associated with auser 104 and capable of receiving audio data. Some examples ofuser devices 10 include, but are not limited to, mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, etc.), computers, wearable devices (e.g., smart watches), smart appliances, vehicle infotainment systems, internet of things (IoT) devices, vehicle infotainment systems, smart displays, smart speakers, etc. Theuser device 10 includesdata processing hardware 12 andmemory hardware 14 in communication with thedata processing hardware 12. Thememory hardware 14 stores instructions that, when executed by thedata processing hardware 12, cause thedata processing hardware 12 to perform one or more operations. Theuser device 10 further includes an audio system 16 with an audio capture device (e.g., microphone) 16, 16 a for capturing and converting spokenutterances 106 within thespeech environment 100 into electrical signals and a speech output device (e.g., a speaker) 16, 16 b for communicating an audible audio signal (e.g., as output audio data from the device 10). While theuser device 10 implements a single audio capture device 16 a in the example shown, theuser device 10 may implement an array of audio capture devices 16 a without departing from the scope of the present disclosure, whereby one or more capture devices 16 a in the array may not physically reside on theuser device 10, but be in communication with the audio system 16. - In the
speech environment 100, anASR system 118 implementing an ASR model, such as an RNN-T model 200, and anoptional rescorer 180 resides on theuser device 10 of theuser 104 and/or on a remote computing device 60 (e.g., one or more remote servers of a distributed system executing in a cloud-computing environment) in communication with theuser device 10 via anetwork 40. Theuser device 10 and/or theremote computing device 60 also includes anaudio subsystem 108 configured to receive theutterance 106 spoken by theuser 104 and captured by the audio capture device 16 a, and convert theutterance 106 into a corresponding digital format associated with inputacoustic frames 110 capable of being processed by theASR system 118. In the example shown, the user speaks arespective utterance 106 and theaudio subsystem 108 converts theutterance 106 into corresponding audio data (e.g., acoustic frames) 110 for input to theASR system 118. Thereafter, the RNN-T model 200 receives, as input, theaudio data 110 corresponding to theutterance 106, and generates/predicts, as output, a corresponding transcription 120 (e.g., recognition result/hypothesis) of theutterance 106. In the example shown, the RNN-T model 200 may perform streaming speech recognition to produce an initialspeech recognition result rescorer 180 may update (e.g., rescore) the initial speech recognition result 120 a to produce a finalspeech recognition result server 60 includesdata processing hardware 62, andmemory hardware 64 in communication with thedata processing hardware 62. Thememory hardware 64 stores instructions that, when executed by thedata processing hardware 62, cause thedata processing hardware 62 to perform one or more operations, such as those disclosed herein. - The
user device 10 and/or theremote computing device 60 also executes a user interface generator 107 configured to present a representation of thetranscription 120 of theutterance 106 to theuser 104 of theuser device 10. As described in greater detail below, the user interface generator 107 may display the initial speech recognition results 120 a in a streaming fashion duringtime 1 and subsequently display the finalspeech recognition result 120 b during time 2. In some configurations, thetranscription 120 output from theASR system 118 is processed, e.g., by a natural language understanding/processing (NLU/NLP) module executing on theuser device 10 or theremote computing device 60, to execute a user command or respond to a query specified by theutterance 106. Additionally or alternatively, a text-to-speech system (TTS) (not shown) (e.g., executing on any combination of theuser device 10 or the remote computing device 60) may convert thetranscription 120 into synthesized speech for audible output by theuser device 10 and/or another device. - In the example shown, the
user 104 interacts with a program or application 50 (e.g., the digital assistant application 50) of theuser device 10 that uses theASR system 118. For instance,FIG. 1 depicts theuser 104 communicating with thedigital assistant application 50 and thedigital assistant application 50 displaying adigital assistant interface 18 on a screen of theuser device 10 to depict a conversation between theuser 104 and thedigital assistant application 50. In this example, theuser 104 asks thedigital assistant application 50, “What time is the concert tonight?” This question from theuser 104 is a spokenutterance 106 captured by the audio capture device 16 a and processed by audio systems 16 of theuser device 10. In this example, the audio system 16 receives the spokenutterance 106 and converts it intoacoustic frames 110 for input to theASR system 118. - Continuing with the example, the RNN-
T model 200, while receiving theacoustic frames 110 corresponding to theutterance 106 as theuser 104 speaks, encodes theacoustic frames 110 and then decodes the encodedacoustic frames 110 into the initial speech recognition results 120 a. Duringtime 1, the user interface generator 107 presents, via thedigital assistant interface 18, a representation of the initial speech recognition results 120 a of theutterance 106 to theuser 104 of theuser device 10 in a streaming fashion such that words, word pieces, and/or individual characters appear on the screen of theuser device 10 as soon as they are spoken. In some examples, first look ahead audio context is set equal to zero. - During time 2, the user interface generator 107 presents, via the
digital assistant interface 18, a representation of the finalspeech recognition result 120 b of theutterance 106 to theuser 104 of theuser device 10 rescored by therescorer 180. In some implementations, the user interface generator 107 replaces the representation of the initial speech recognition results 120 a presented attime 1 with the representation of the finalspeech recognition result 120 b presented at time 2. Here,time 1 and time 2 may include timestamps corresponding to when the user interface generator 107 presents the respectivespeech recognition result 120. In this example, the timestamp oftime 1 indicates that the user interface generator 107 presents the initial speech recognition result 120 a at an earlier time than the finalspeech recognition result 120 b. For instance, as the finalspeech recognition result 120 b is presumed to be more accurate than the initial speech recognition results 120 a, the finalspeech recognition result 120 b that is ultimately displayed as thetranscription 120 may fix any terms that may have been misrecognized in the initial speech recognition results 120 a. In this example, the streaming initial speech recognition results 120 a output by the RNN-T model 200 displayed on the screen of theuser device 10 attime 1 are associated with low latency and provide responsiveness to theuser 104 that his/her query is being processed, while the finalspeech recognition result 120 b output by therescorer 180 and displayed on the screen at time 2 leverages an additional speech recognition model and/or a language model to improve the speech recognition quality in terms of accuracy, but at increased latency. However, because the initial speech recognition results 120 a are displayed as the user speaks theutterance 106, the higher latency associated with producing, and ultimately displaying thefinal recognition result 120 b is not noticeable to theuser 104. - In the example shown in
FIG. 1 , thedigital assistant application 50 may respond to the question posed by theuser 104 using natural language processing (NLP). NLP generally refers to a process of interpreting written language (e.g., the initial speech recognition results 120 a and/or the finalspeech recognition result 120 b) and determining whether the written language prompts any response or action. In this example, thedigital assistant application 50 uses NLP to recognize that the question from theuser 104 regards the user's schedule and, more particularly, a concert on the user's schedule. By recognizing these details with NLP, the automated assistant returns aresponse 19 to the user's question, where theresponse 19 states, “Venue doors open at 6:30 PM and concert starts at 8 pm.” In some configurations, NLP occurs on aremote server 60 in communication with thedata processing hardware 12 of theuser device 10. -
FIG. 2 is a schematic view of an example RNN-T model 200 that fuses higher order feature representations (also referred to generally as acoustic representations) 224 output by the audio encoder network 220 and dense representations (also referred to generally as text representations) 232 output by theprediction network 230. In particular, the RNN-T model 200 includes a noveljoint network 210 that combines gating with bilinear pooling to improve the fusion of the acoustic andtext representations joint network 210 leverages the respective strengths and complimentary features of gating and bilinear pooling. - As shown, the RNN-
T model 200 includes an encoder network 220, a prediction/decoder network 230, thejoint network 210, and a finalSoftmax output layer 240. The encoder network 220 (e.g., an audio encoder), which is roughly analogous to an acoustic model (AM) in a traditional ASR system, receives a sequence of feature vectors (e.g., theacoustic frames 110 ofFIG. 1 ) x=(x1, x2, . . . , xt) 222, where xi ∈ - In the example shown, the prediction/
decoder network 230 includes an LSTM-based prediction network that, like a language model (LM), processes a sequence of non-blank symbols y0, . . . ,y u-1 242 output so far by theSoftmax layer 240 into adense representation h u pred 232, where y0 represents a special start of sequence symbol. - The
joint network 210 fuses therepresentations h t enc 224 andh u pred 232 produced, respectively, by the encoder network 220 and theprediction network 230. Thejoint network 210 generates P(ŷi|xt, y0, . . . , yu-1), which is a distribution over the next candidate output symbol. Stated differently, thejoint network 210 generates, at each output step (e.g., time step), a probability distribution over possible speech recognition hypotheses 212. Here, the “possible speech recognition hypotheses” correspond to a set of output labels each representing a word/wordpiece/symbol/character in a specified natural language. For example, when the natural language is English, the set of output labels may include twenty-seven (27) symbols, e.g., one label for each of the 26-letters in the English alphabet and one label designating a space. Accordingly, thejoint network 210 may output a set of values indicative of the likelihood of occurrence of each of a predetermined set of output labels. This set of values can be a vector and can indicate a probability distribution over the set of output labels. In some cases, the output labels are graphemes (e.g., individual characters, and potentially punctuation and other symbols), but the set of output labels is not so limited. For example, the set of output labels can include wordpieces and/or entire words, in addition to or instead of graphemes. The output distribution of thejoint network 210 can include a posterior probability value for each of the different output labels. Thus, when there are 100 different output labels representing different graphemes or other symbols, the output yi of thejoint network 210 can include 100 different probability values, one for each output label. The probability distribution can then be used to select and assign scores to candidate orthographic elements (e.g., graphemes, wordpieces, and/or words) in a beam search process (e.g., by the final Softmax output layer 240) for determining thetranscription 120. - The
joint network 210 includes a novel structure that combines gating with bilinear pooling to improve the fusion of the higher orderfeature representation h t enc 224 and thedense representation h u pred 232 received by thejoint network 210 at each of the plurality of output steps when performing speech recognition on an utterance 106 (FIG. 1 ). In the example shown, thejoint network 210 includes abilinear pooling layer 250 and agating layer 260. In some examples, thebilinear pooling layer 250 is stacked on top of thegating layer 260. In these examples, the stacking of thebilinear pooling layer 250 and thegating layer 260 can be expressed mathematically as follows: -
h t,u joint =W proj(tanh((W 1 gate)T h t enc))⊙(tanh((W 2 gate)T h t,u gate)) (11) - where ht,u gate refers to the joint representation of EQN (7), and W1 gate and W2 gate are weight matrices of the
gating layer 260. - The
Softmax layer 240 may employ any technique to select the output label/symbol with the highest probability in thedistribution ĥ t,u joint 232 as the next output symbol predicted by the RNN-T model 200 at the corresponding output step. In this manner, the RNN-T model 200 does not make a conditional independence assumption. Instead, the prediction of each symbol is conditioned not only on the acoustics but also on the sequence of labels output so far. The RNN-T model 200 does assume an output symbol is independent of futureacoustic frames 110, which allows the RNN-T model 200 to be employed in a streaming fashion. In some examples, theSoftmax layer 240 is composed of a unified word piece or grapheme set that is generated using all unique word pieces or graphemes in a plurality of training data sets. - In some examples, the feature vectors x 222 include 80-dimensional log-Mel filter bank features formed by stacking three 32 millisecond (ms) acoustic frames with a 10 ms shift to form a 240-dimensional input representation with a 30 ms frame rate, which are then transformed using a first linear projection to a 512-dimensional representation with added positional embeddings. Continuing with this example, the encoder network 220 may include twelve conformer encoder blocks with 8-head self-attention and a convolution kernel size of 15 to further transform the stacked features. Here, the encoder network 220 performs a concatenation operation after the third conformer block to achieve a time reduction rate of two. A fourth conformer block transforms the resulting 1024-dimensional vectors, and then the encoder network 220 projects them back to 512-dimensional using a second linear transform. The remaining eight conformer blocks follow the second linear transformation, followed by a final linear normalization layer to make the dimension Denc=512 for the higher order
feature representation h t enc 224. While the encoder network 220 described has a stack of multi-head attention layers/blocks that include conformer layers/blocks (e.g., twelve conformer blocks), the present disclosure is not so limited. For instance, the encoder network 220 may include a stack of transformer layers/blocks or other type of multi-head attention layers/bocks. The encoder network 220 may include a series of multi-headed self-attention, depth-wise convolutional and feed-forward layers. Alternatively, the encoder network 220 may include a plurality of long-short term memory (LSTM) layers in lieu of multi-head attention layers/blocks. - Continuing with the example, the
prediction network 230 is an LTSM-based network including two layers of 2,048-dimensional LSTM with a 640-dimensional linear projection to make Dpred=640 for thedense representation h u pred 232. The dimension Djoint of the fusedrepresentation ĥ t,u joint 232 is also set to 640. In some examples, thejoint network 210 includes hidden units. Additionally or alternatively, thejoint network 210 does not include a fully connected (FC) layer. - Alternatively, the encoder network 220 includes a stack of self-attention layers/blocks. Here, the stack of self-attention blocks may include a stack of transformer blocks, or a different stack of conformer blocks.
- Alternatively, the
prediction network 230 may include a stack of transformer or conformer blocks (or other type of multi-head attention blocks). Theprediction network 230 may also be replaced with an embedding look-up table (e.g., a V2 embedding look-up table) to improve latency by outputting looked-up sparse embeddings in lieu of generating dense representations. In some implementations, theprediction network 230 is a stateless prediction network. - As discussed above, the
prediction network 230 may converge faster than the encoder network 220 during training, which may result in thejoint network 210 becoming overly reliant on thedense representations h u pred 232 generated by theprediction network 230 over the higher orderfeature representations h t enc 224 generated by the encoder network 220 when performing ASR on training utterances. In order to reduce such training imbalances, prediction network regularization routines may be applied, for example, at the beginning of training the RNN-T model 200. More specifically, training of the RNN-T model may include using the prediction network regularization routines together with the joint network having the novel combination structure (e.g., see EQN (11)) that stacks gating and bilinear pooling in order to balance the fusing of thedense representations 232 generated by theprediction network 230 and the higherorder feature representations 224 generated by the encoder network 220, or with joint networks configured with other structures capable fusing acoustic and text representations (e.g., see EQN (6), EQN (7), EQN (9), or EQN (10)). In some examples, the prediction network regularization routines reduce the gradients back-propagated into theprediction network 230 during training in order to optimally balance the fusing ofh t enc 224 andh u pred 232 by thejoint network 210. For example, applying the prediction network regularization routines during training may re-compute thedense representation h u pred 232 using a scaling factor and a stop gradient function having an input tensor with zero gradients. For instance, re-computing thedense representation h u pred 232 can be expressed as follows: -
h u pred =a m h u pred −sg((a m−1)h u pred) (12) - where m is the index in the current training step, am is a scaling factor, and sg( ) is the stop gradient functions whose input tensor will have zero gradients. In this example, when 0≤am≤1, the value of hu pred is not changed, but the corresponding gradients that are back-propagated into the
prediction network 230 will be reduced by a factor of am. This slows down the convergence of theprediction network 230, and allows for balancing the fusing of theh t enc 224 andh u pred 232 by thejoint network 210 during training. In some examples, the prediction network regularization routine selects the value of am using a piece-wise linear schedule as follows: -
- where m1 and m2 are two pre-defined parameters. Notably, applying the prediction network regularization routine is different from initializing the RNN-
T model 200 with a pre-trained connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model, even when m=0, because theprediction network 230 provides a random but fix-valued projection through which the RNN-T model 200 is still able to obtain yu-1. Compared to other conventional training techniques, training thejoint network 210 with the prediction network regularization routine improves the integration of the internal LM during both training and test-time by initially discounting the internal LM during training. Notably, thejoint networks 210 and/or prediction network regularization routines are applicable to stateless RNN-T models in which the LM history embedded in theprediction network 230 is limited and/or reset for each utterance. -
FIG. 3 is a schematic view of anexample conformer block 300 that can be used to implement one of the conformer blocks in the stack of conformer blocks of the encoder network 220 ofFIG. 2 . Theconformer block 300 includes a first half feed-forward layer 310, a second half feed-forward layer 340, with a multi-head self-attention block 320 and aconvolution layer 330 disposed between the first and second half feed-forward layers concatenation operators 305. The first half feed-forward layer 310 processes the inputaudio data 102 including an input Mel-spectrogram sequence. Subsequently, the multi-head self-attention block 320 receives the inputaudio data 102 concatenated with the output of the first half-feed forward layer 310. Intuitively, the role of the multi-head self-attention block 320 is to summarize noise context separately for each input frame that is to be enhanced. Theconvolution layer 330 subsamples the output of the multi-head self-attention block 320 concatenated with the output of the first half feedforward layer 310. Thereafter, the second half-feed forward layer 340 receives a concatenation of theconvolution layer 330 output and the multi-head self-attention block 320. Alayernorm module 350 processes the output from the second half feed-forward layer 340. Theconformer block 300 transforms input features x, using modulation features m, to produceoutput features y 360, which can, for example, be mathematically expressed as: -

FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an exemplary arrangement of operations for a computer-implementedmethod 400 of improving the fusion of acoustic and text representations in an RNN-T model, such as the RNN-T model 200. Data processing hardware 510 (e.g., thedata processing hardware 12 of thedevice 10 and/or thedata processing hardware 62 of thecomputing system 60 ofFIG. 1 ) may execute the operations for themethod 400 by executing instructions stored on memory hardware 520 (e.g., thememory hardware 14, 64). - At

Themethod 400 performsoperations operation 404, themethod 400 includes generating, by an encoder network 220 of the RNN-T model 200, a higher orderfeature representation h t enc 224 for a correspondingacoustic frame 222 in the sequence ofacoustic frames 222. - At
operation 406, themethod 400 includes generating, by aprediction network 230 of the RNN-T model 200, adense representation h u pred 232 for a corresponding sequence of non-blank symbols (y0, . . . , yu-1) 242 output by a final Softmax output layer (e.g., the Softmax layer 240). Here, y0 may represent a special start of sequence symbol. - At
operation 408, themethod 400 includes generating, by ajoint network 210 of the RNN-T model 200 that receives the higher orderfeature representation h t enc 224 and the dense representation hu pred 232 aprobability distribution ĥ t,u joint 212 over possible speech recognition hypotheses ŷu. For example, thejoint network 210 may generate theprobability distribution ĥ t,u joint 212 using abilinear pooling layer 250 stacked on agating layer 260, as discussed above in connection with thejoint network 210 ofFIG. 2 . For example, atoperation 408, themethod 400 can use EQN (11) to compute theprobability distribution ĥ t,u joint 212 as output from thejoint network 210. -

high speed controller 540 manages bandwidth-intensive operations for thecomputing device 500, while thelow speed controller 560 manages lower bandwidth-intensive operations. Such allocation of duties is exemplary only. In some implementations, the high-speed controller 540 is coupled to thememory 520, the display 580 (e.g., through a graphics processor or accelerator), and to the high-speed expansion ports 550, which may accept various expansion cards (not shown).

computing device 500 may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as astandard server 500 a or multiple times in a group ofsuch servers 500 a, as alaptop computer 500 b, or as part of arack server system 500 c. - Various implementations of the systems and techniques described herein can be realized in digital electronic and/or optical circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.

As used herein, the terms “machine-readable medium” and “computer-readable medium” refer to any computer program product, non-transitory computer readable medium, apparatus and/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term “machine-readable signal” refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and/or data to a programmable processor.
- The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors, also referred to as data processing hardware, executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).

Other kinds of devices can be used to provide interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input. In addition, a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user; for example, by sending web pages to a web browser on a user's client device in response to requests received from the web browser.
- Unless expressly stated to the contrary, “or” refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, “A, B, or C” refers to any combination or subset of A, B, C such as: (1) A alone; (2) B alone; (3) C alone; (4) A with B; (5) A with C; (6) B with C; and (7) A with B and with C. Similarly, the phrase “at least one of A or B” is intended to refer to any combination or subset of A and B such as: (1) at least one A; (2) at least one B; and (3) at least one A and at least one B. Moreover, the phrase “at least one of A and B” is intended to refer to any combination or subset of A and B such as: (1) at least one A; (2) at least one B; and (3) at least one A and at least one B.
- A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.
