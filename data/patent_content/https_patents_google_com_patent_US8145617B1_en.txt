Definitions
- the present invention relates to an information retrieval system for generating snippets of documents in a large scale corpus, such as the World Wide Web.
- search engines are now an essential tool for finding information in large scale, diverse, and growing corpuses such as the World Wide Web.
- search engines create an index that relates documents (or “pages”) to the individual words present in each document.
- a document is retrieved in response to a query containing a number of query terms, typically based on having some number of query terms present in the document.
- the retrieved documents are then ranked according to other statistical measures, such as frequency of occurrence of the query terms, host domain, link analysis, and the like.
- the retrieved documents are then presented to the user, typically in their ranked order, and without any further grouping or imposed hierarchy.
- a selected portion or snippet of text of a document is presented to provide the user with a preview of the content of the document.
- the snippet may not provide useful information to the user to assess the relevance of the document to the query.
- the present invention includes a system and methodology for generating snippets of documents retrieved during a search based on query terms.
- the snippet is generated based on the location of the query terms in the document.
- the paragraphs including the query terms are scored based on the length of the paragraph and the distance of the paragraph from a location of the document, such as the beginning of the document.
- a snippet is generated using a paragraph selected based on the score of the paragraph, such as the highest score.
- a snippet generating algorithm is selected based on the type of a query.
- the selected snippet generation algorithm generates a snippet of the document.
- the query type may be based on the form of the query terms or the location of query terms in the document. Thus, depending on the type of query, different snippet generation algorithms will be selected, and different types of snippets generated.
- FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the software architecture of a search system according to the present invention.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary methodology for generating a snippet according to the present invention.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a screenshot of the search system of FIG. 1 .
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating another exemplary methodology for generating a snippet according to the present invention.
- the present invention includes a system and methodology for generating snippets of documents that are retrieved during a search based on the query terms for the search.
- the snippets may be generated based on the type of the query or the location of the query terms in the document.
- the search system 100 includes an indexing system 110 , a search system 120 , a presentation system 130 , and a front end server 140 .
- the indexing system 110 identifies words or terms in documents, and indexes documents according to the words or terms, by accessing various websites 190 and other document collections.
- the front end server 140 receives queries from a user of a client 170 , and provides those queries to the search system 120 .
- the search system 120 searches for documents relevant to the search query (search results), including identifying any query terms in the search query, and then ranking the documents in the search results using the presence of query terms to influence the ranking order.
- the search system 120 provides the search results to the presentation system 130 .
- the presentation system 130 modifies the search results, generates snippets of documents, and provides the modified search results back to the front end server 140 , which provides the results to the client 170 .
- the system 100 further includes an index 150 that stores the indexing information pertaining to documents and a data repository 160 of the indexed documents.
- “documents” are understood to be any type of media that can be indexed and retrieved by a search engine, including web documents, images, multimedia files, text documents, PDFs or other image formatted files, and so forth.
- a document may have one or more pages, partitions, segments or other components, as appropriate to its content and type.
- Equivalently a document may be referred to as a “page,” as commonly used to refer to documents on the Internet. No limitation as to the scope of the invention is implied by the use of the generic term “documents.”
- the search system 100 operates over a large corpus of documents, such as the Internet and World Wide Web, but can likewise be used in more limited collections, such as for the document collections of a library or private enterprises.
- the documents are typically distributed across many different computer systems and sites. Without loss of generality then, the documents generally, regardless of format or location (e.g., which website or database) will be collectively referred to as a corpus or document collection.
- Each document has an associated identifier that uniquely identifies the document; the identifier is preferably a URL, but other types of identifiers (e.g., document numbers) may be used as well.
- URLs to identify documents is assumed.
- the document collection may include scholarly literature, such as journal articles, conference articles, academic papers and citation records of journal articles, conference articles, and academic papers. Because works of scholarly literature are subject to rigorous format requirements, such documents have metadata information describing the content and source of the document.
- the document metadata includes names of authors, title, publisher, publication date, publication location, citation information, article identifiers such as Digital Object Identifier, PubMed Identifier, SICI, ISBN, and the like, network location (e.g., URL), number of references, number of citations, language, and the like.
- the presentation system 130 generates a snippet of a document for display as part of the user interface screen with the search results.
- the presentation system 130 generates snippets based on the type of query or the location of the query terms in the document.
- the presentation system 130 uses a plurality of different snippet generation algorithms to generate snippets responsive to different query types.
- the presentation system 130 may generate snippets based on an analysis of the location of the query terms in the document.
- FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary methodology for generating a snippet according to the present invention.
- the front end server 140 receives 202 queries from a client 170 , and provides the query to the search system 120 .
- the search system 120 conducts a search 204 and generates a list of documents relevant to the search query and provides the search results to the presentation system 130 .
- the presentation system 130 determines 206 the location of query terms in each of the documents.
- the query may include the words “theory”, “relativity”, “space”, and “travel.”
- the presentation system 130 generates 208 a snippet based on the location of the query terms in the document.
- the presentation system 130 selects a paragraph or a portion of the paragraph as a snippet based on the length and distance of the paragraph from the start of the document. For example, this may be used to find an abstract of the document.
- each paragraph that includes the query terms is given a score based on the length of the paragraph and the distance of the paragraph from a predetermined location in the document, such as the beginning or the end of the document.
- the beginning of the document may be used for the types of documents that include abstracts, executive summaries or comprehensive introductions, at the beginning of the document.
- the end of the document may be used for other types of documents that include a conclusion or summarization at the end of the document.
- the scoring function may be non-linear.
- the scoring function also includes language dependent rules on the content of the paragraphs and formatting rules.
- the language dependent rules may be, for example, how much of the paragraph are punctuation characters, whether the paragraph ends with a punctuation or proposition, or whether any of the words in the paragraph is overly long.
- the formatting rules may be, for example, the number of bold or italicized words in the paragraph.
- the scoring may include the summation of one or more of the following scores:
- PositionFactor a position factor or constant
- MaxParagraphLen maximum paragraph length
- Each paragraph of the document is scored in this manner, and one of the paragraphs is selected on the basis of the score. The selection of a paragraph may be based on the paragraph having the highest score, or may be the first paragraph to score above a threshold amount. From the selected paragraph, the snippet is generated.
- the snippet may be, for example, a predetermined number of words of the selected paragraph, such as the first predetermined number of words of the paragraph (e.g., 25 words), the first one or more sentences of the paragraph (e.g., 3 sentences), a middle portion (e.g., 50 words) containing at least one of the query terms, or the entire paragraph.
- a predetermined number of words of the selected paragraph such as the first predetermined number of words of the paragraph (e.g., 25 words), the first one or more sentences of the paragraph (e.g., 3 sentences), a middle portion (e.g., 50 words) containing at least one of the query terms, or the entire paragraph.
- FIG. 3 illustrates a user interface screen of an illustrative embodiment of search results.
- the presentation system 130 generates a page illustrating a plurality of search result elements for documents retrieved by the search.
- Each search result element includes a link 301 to the document from the search result (e.g., “Clock paradox problem resolution in relativity theory, considering space travel effects on time” by M. Sachs and published in Physics Today in 1971).
- the search result element further includes a snippet 302 of portions of the document with the query terms, a link 304 to a page of documents citing the search result document, and a link element 305 for a web search for the document.
- FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating another exemplary methodology for generating a snippet according to the present invention.
- the front end server 140 receives 402 a query.
- the presentation system 130 determines 404 the type of query.
- the type of query may be based on the form of the query.
- the form of the query may be determined from query terms, information that is the metadata, such as author, title, or journal name, a request for specific information, such as a patent, a movie, or location information, or a query including specific terms.
- the type of query may be based on the location of query terms in the document.
- the location and frequency of search terms and sequences of the search terms are determined, and a region of the document is selected as a snippet based on this determination.
- the system 100 may determine the type of the query by using the search system 120 to track the regions of the document or metadata matching the query terms.
- the presentation system 130 aggregates information from such matches from all results and uses the results to label the query. For example, if most of the results or more than a threshold number of results include the query terms in the author field, the query can be marked as an “author” query. A similar determination may be done for other metadata fields.
- the presentation system 130 selects 406 the snippet algorithm.
- the snippet may be generated based on query terms in first or second predetermined portions of the document based on whether the query term is a first or second type, respectively.
- the first predetermined portion may be an abstract and the second predetermined portion may be the body of the document.
- the query type is a query for information that is in the metadata, and the snippet is generated from the body text, and not the metadata.
- the presentation system 130 generates 408 a snippet using the selected algorithm.
- the selected algorithm for the generation of the snippet from the body text may include scoring each paragraph and selecting the paragraph according to score, such as described above.
- the snippet may be displayed in a user interface screen such as shown in FIG. 3 .
- Certain aspects of the present invention include process steps and instructions described herein in the form of an algorithm. It should be noted that the process steps and instructions of the present invention could be embodied in software, firmware or hardware, and when embodied in software, could be downloaded to reside on and be operated from different platforms used by a variety of operating systems.
- the present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein.
- This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.
- a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.
- the computers referred to in the specification may include a single processor or may be architectures employing multiple processor designs for increased computing capability.
