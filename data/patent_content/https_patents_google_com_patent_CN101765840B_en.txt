Embodiment
General introduction
Described software and/or hardware unit can be associated one or more words (word) of the content in the digital content user with note.Capture client allows the user to create note, and each note is related with the text chunk in the content that the user checks, and text section is called " subject text (subjecttext) " of this note.Store explicitly note by comment server and subject text.As user subsequently during viewing content, this device is compared the content of checking with the comment title text of storing.If find the subject text of note and the content matching of checking, then display client is shown to the user with the note of association with the content of checking.
In various embodiments, this device makes in various manners each note " grappling " to the subject text that is associated.In certain embodiments, when the sign of the position in the appended document of note is all known, this device is this note of grappling by the position of storage the document sign and the document, for example by storing apart from the position that the document is stored in the word offset (word offset) of the document section start.
In certain embodiments, particularly in document identification and position not in the situation of all-knowingness, this device is used for the anchor text of new note and this note of grappling by storage.The anchor text that is used for note generally includes the subject text for this note.In certain embodiments, this anchor text extends beyond subject text in one or two direction.In these embodiments, because the note of storing is related with the anchor text chunk, rather than with original contents or with related from the related identifier of the original contents of its identification text section, so note can be applied to the arbitrary content that will utilize the text section future.For example, if document is copied by integral body, or copy the sections of document, then all will suitably be placed in future with these all notes that copy partial association, because this note is related with the text chunk in the document rather than related with document itself.Therefore, disclosed device has improved the dirigibility of using note in digital content significantly.In certain embodiments, provide the presentation layer capture client to allow the user that note is added in the content no matter the form of the content that the user just checks how.For example, can be on the webpage, in the word processing document, in the PDF document, as image or with other figures or textual form content be shown to the user.Be not as possible to each design interfaces of these content formats, this device depends on catches the demonstration of describing this content and uses optical character identification (OCR) technology to convert captured images to text.Alternatively, described device is communicated by letter with various elements or is intercepted and captured from the text of various elements and reproduce (text-rendering) order in certain embodiments, and described text reproduces order so that reproduce text at user's display.In many embodiment of these embodiment, do not need rear reproduction OCR or other recognition technologies (Fig. 8).When described device used the data of reproducing, this device was caught all or part of screen buffer of the equipment of checking of user's use.Then, the content with screen buffer offers OCR or other image recognition assemblies, the corresponding text (for example, ASCII value) that the image that described OCR or the processing of other image recognition assemblies capture and generation are included in any character in this image.This device is selected the user on the display automatically for the note purpose any content map is to the OCR text of this device identification.In this way, the form of this content is how no matter this device allows any content of user comment.
In certain embodiments, hand-held optical scanner (randomly, also having the phonetic entry ability) can be used as capture client.In order to create note with such capture client, the user comes optical acquisition or speech capturing subject text carrying out note with this hand held scanner, and then says or the content of the note of typewriting out.This device randomly uses speech recognition technology that the note of oral account is converted to its symbol text equivalent, and then this device is associated this symbol text equivalent with the subject text of catching.
In certain embodiments, provide the presentation layer display client with permission note to be superimposed upon on any content that is presented on the user display, and no matter the source format of content how, also no matter be responsible for creating or how reproduce the application of the content that shows or other system assembly.When the user checks on the equipment viewing content, randomly catch all or part of screen buffer that this checks equipment by this device.The content of screen buffer is offered OCR or other image recognition assemblies, the corresponding text that the image that described OCR or the processing of other image recognition assemblies capture and generation are included in any character in this image.One or more text fragments in the text that this device identification captures, and the expression of text fragments is transferred to the comment server assembly---its can be local (for instance, on user's personal computer) or long-range (for example, on network).The content of any reproduction on the user display that the text chunk that this comment server assembly (105) represents the text fragments that receives to represent to compare with the text chunk of storage, and the identification coupling---or approaching coupling---stores on the comment server represents.Represent corresponding note by this device identification and be transferred to display client with the text fragments of coupling.Display client is based on the appropriate location of location positioning note of the text fragments of coupling, and shows this note in the semitransparent layer on overlapping the user and just check the content of (2).In this way, can show to the user note of arbitrary content---no matter how the form of the content of checking how, also originates regardless of it.
In certain embodiments, application at operating system and/or demonstration text provides programmatic interface to be used for supplying current just shown text, in the situation of shining upon between shown text and its display position etc., this device avoids identifying with the OCR technology expense of text and the display position thereof of demonstration with these interfaces.Similarly, can be used for identifying in programmatic interface in the situation of a part of just shown document or current display document, this device uses the information obtained by these interfaces that the text of demonstration is associated with electronic document and the position of bottom.
In certain embodiments, this device is supported the additional annotations that polytype is related that comprises except the plain text note related with the each several part of electronic document.In various embodiments, the support of this device creates, shows these notes and mutual with these notes with number of mechanisms, and described number of mechanisms comprises here in conjunction with described those mechanism of plain text note.By association and the note of supporting that these are general, that this device provides is abundant, stride the interactivity of document and cross-platform level other and electronic document.In certain embodiments, this device for the similar or identical note of the User support of text capture device with related.In these embodiments, this device provides abundant, common experience for the reader who reads papery and electronic document.
In certain embodiments, this device comes for the user safeguards that general reading is historical with the observation of the text that it is caught to the text that shows at monitor and by hand-held text capture device, and this reads all texts that historical potentially recording user reads and the indication of reading the time of the text.In certain embodiments, it is historical that this device provides visual user interface to probe into this reading, such as the directory information of the document of the historical series of document thumbnail or relevant each reading.In certain embodiments, the user's document that can probe into them is read the vision figure in time (visualmap) of the each several part of the historical document of reading with the close examination user, how long order and the user that the user reads them has spent in the various piece of the document.
In certain embodiments, in capture client (160) and display client (170), provide security component, so that do not provide the user of the content that the user checks to identify (user-identifiable) details to comment server.On the contrary, the text chunk of just checking with comment server user that transmit to encrypt, hash or otherwise protection or the form (205b) of text fragments or store text chunk that user this encryption, hash or otherwise protection just checks or the form (205b) of text fragments by comment server.The form of security of storage text has guaranteed not exist the user's who is safeguarded by comment server content to check user's readable record of custom.This security component helps to prevent to use this device in the mode that may be considered to invade privacy of user.Depend on that desirable note distributes, note itself (205b) also may be transmitted and store with form that encrypt, hash or otherwise protection.By the storage note related with text chunk and anchor text, this note separates with the sign of its original source content of adding to effectively.For example, if the user add of the digital copies of books note, then when comment server is stored this note, with regard to the sign of unnecessary these books of storage.When identical user or its other party were checked the digital copies of these books in the future, the text that text chunk and the anchor text by the contrast storage is evaluated at these books that present on the user display was identified any note of user's storage.Disclosed annotation storage method therefore from the traditional method that note and particular document is related or with in application, need particular technology need the particular document form store or the method for association annotation significantly different.
The character of " note "
Device described herein had both allowed to create note, and also permission is mutual with note, as presenting at dynamic display.Some aspects of described device relate to that a user creates that note is checked for other users or are mutual with it.Other aspects of described device relate to by the various notes of the automatic establishment of described device itself.The additional aspect of described device relates to the mutual of user and note---those notes that existing other users create, those notes that also have device itself to create.Notice that it is helpful having the establishment aspect related with note and mutual aspect.And in some cases, with the establishment that may cause alternately additional annotations of a note.
The note related with target material and/or anchor material (both describing hereinafter) can be any object that energy is directed, indicate, call etc.Note is clicked the vision indication of note at device users with mouse usually, or the keyboard by the user or mouse are selected or call when selecting the menu item related with this note.Here employed note can comprise for any position on the dynamic display or zone and the action that dynamically (programming) produces or static (manually) produces---described position or zone or by user selection, or installed by this and to indicate.Usually working as the user clicks a position or highlights/select a zone with mouse on its display, the menu that then may move to eject (bring up) with its mouse right click, and final one of them that select to present be when moving to call it, and invoke user is selected the note of form.
Some examples in many possibility examples of note are included in the link of additional text or graphic contents, pointer or link to another document, the text comment, link to discussion group or forum, (for example arrive the link of website, blog or other web contents, the audio or video montage of hyperlink), perhaps when selecting note, playing.Additional notes examples include: - Start with the display in the person referred to Internet chat session - start displaying content sent to the author's e-mail - e-mail sent to a user selection of the display or copy - participation for the display or selection of the voting - to confirm the user has read and / or agree with the displayed content - start Internet search - will paste the contents of the selected display or to the user's blog - left to the user's blog back new chain (track -back) Notes - Notes purchased in e-commerce sites or selected items - in the user 's calendar entry or highlight selected date or time or event information - in the user's contact database entry contact information - on Wikipedia or another a dictionary or encyclopedia website for display or selected word or phrase - Name / read out the selected content - creating the indicated telephone number and telephone connection between the user's telephone - the content indicated by the user Bookmark - the contents of the instructions to the user's files in the captured content - user-selected areas on the underlined or highlighted ( ie , create a new static visual notes ) - added with the indicated location or choose a new voice annotation associated - the selected contents copied to the user 's clipboard - the user's web browser directed to the indicated URL or web site - the user's personal information filled in the form - will be able to purchase items to add to the possible purchase of the user wishes list - purchase articles or products indicated - confirm later displayed or selected articles or products - registered user to indicate interest in the product or service - to display or select the relevant product or service to the user additional information - display about the instructions or selection of other users comments or comments - display instructions / select individuals, organizations and other contact information - will be selected content translated into another language - check the display or selected word spelling - when this word / phrase that appears on the display when the user highlight the word / phrase all occurrences - forwarded via e-mail that contains a copy of the document display content - purchase display content that contains a copy of a document - the document that contains the display or change notify the user - or contained in the display content to notify the user is further comment - content is displayed in the indicated user is presented to other advertising - play for indicating position or sync to the audio or video - display images related to the content and instructions
It should be noted that, although some in these movable and functions are available in now obtainable many software application and equipment, but described device makes these movable and function is all available for the content of any demonstration, and no matter whether application-specific supports this activity, and need not clearly support or cooperation from this application or user's operating system.
Can have visual representation with the note of the relevance that presents at dynamic display.For example, can be by icon or the specific properties that is different from adjacent text attribute that has by presenting on the display the text filed note of indicating of---underscore, highlight etc.---.
Anchor material and target material
" anchor material " is the content related with note, and it can be used for presenting of triggering note and trigger the indication that has note.The anchor material can randomly comprise the theme of note itself, and it can randomly comprise around or near content---the material that just generally includes before the note target material and/or occur afterwards.
" target material " (here sometimes referred to as " target " or " theme (subject) ") is certain material that note plans to be applied to or that the note plan is related with it.Target material can be ad-hoc location, the geographic area in the document or the range of text zone in continuous (contiguous) scope of text or a set of keyword (randomly have specific order or in specific range each other), image or image sets, the document, whole document, about the set of the content of particular topic or document etc.
A kind of purposes of anchor material and motif material is when the motif material itself of note and not exclusively visible or be the indication of current this note of triggering or present.As an example, the user is with narrative text and link: [buy this at Amazon | http://www.amazon.com/item:CAPS-A520] be associated with motif material " Canon PowerShot A520 digital camera ".Also related with this note is that pre-anchor (pre-anchor) " the beginning digital photography: this bag comprises " and rear anchor " with SELPHY CP510 photo printer, add the accessory that all need ".As an example, website caller roll its webpage view so that the part of pre-anchor and target material (" the beginning digital photography: this bag comprises Canon PowerShot ") on its display as seen, but the remainder of this anchor and motif material is still invisible.However, related note correctly occurs.
In some cases, the target material of note or anchor material difference present middle may slight modification, but the user may wish she or he note for these changes some or all and occur.Therefore the subject text of note may be with appearance such as different punctuation marks, capitalization, spelling, font, colors.In certain embodiments, described device allows the user to specify which change should trigger user's note and which should be ignored.
It is to specify limited " editing distance " that a kind of effective description specific reproduction must have the modes that approach with the original object material more, and it is that the known of similarity of two samples of text measured.Randomly, the user can specify the change of whether accepting punctuation mark, capitalization, spelling etc. and therefore trigger presenting of specific comments.
The note context
Here " context selection " refers to such process: rely on the user of the described device of this process to set up note that they wish them and appear at wherein specific context or environment.Context is selected to comprise certain volume, phase, version or the copy that will show the article of this note to it, allow specific user or user's group of this note of access, check or access this note must payment money or expense, make the note can be with the anchor text of required existence and target material etc.
In certain embodiments, described device is indicated other documents and context to the user, and described document comprises user-selected target and/or has identical anchor text with context---namely, will call those documents of note during demonstration.Among these embodiment some also allow the user to browse these optionally to be occurrence context to understand the note specifically occur them in which context/situation.Some embodiment also allow user selection or cancellation to select them want to allow or do not want to allow their note appear at wherein context.
In certain embodiments, logical operation and combination selected to comprise in context.For example, the note that the user may want is above mentioned " [buy this at Amazon | http://www.amazon.com/item:CAPS-A520] " only just presents when appearing in the non-commercial context at motif material " CanonPowerShot A520 digital camera "---for example, if comprise that this webpage of quoting does not comprise that key word " is bought " or " purchase " in any and do not comprise that any direct link to e-commerce website just presents note yet.
The further application of application context is the user of described device specifies needs how many (if necessary) anchor texts or near text for the note that shows topics ability.In the situation of user comment single character or short language, described device allows them to select to be only to want the note that them whenever all occur of this short language occurring, their note still only to occur in some document, their note etc. occurs in the situation of particular anchor text.
Additional detail
Below describe and provide concrete details in order to thoroughly understand each embodiment of present technique and make it possible to describe this each embodiment.It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the many details that need not in these details just can realize this technology.In some cases, known 26S Proteasome Structure and Function and not shown or describe description with the embodiment that avoids unnecessarily bluring present technique in detail.Be contemplated that employed term should explain that with its most wide in range reasonable manner use also is like this even if its detailed description with some embodiment of present technique combines in the following description that provides.Although below may emphasize some term, any term that expection is explained in any restricted mode all will be disclosed ground and be limited to like this particularly in this detailed description part.
Fig. 1 makes it possible to create and the hardware of demonstration note and/or the block diagram of software service in plurality of kinds of contents.This device comprises the comment server 105 that is coupled to data storage 110.The comment server managing annotation is with the related of text chunk and transmit relevant note to show in terms of content.As described in more detail in this, text chunk be stored in the text database 115 and annotation storage in annotations database 120.Each note in annotations database is related with one of them text chunk in being stored in text database.Provide one or more index 125 to make comment server can search for rapidly text database 115 and annotations database 120 so that text chunk or the note that identification is wished.Although comment server 105 is depicted as individual server, it being understood that comment server can comprise a plurality of servers and as described hereinly functionally can copy or be dispersed in these a plurality of servers.Similarly, although data storage 110 is indicated as the individual data reservoir that comprises some databases, it being understood that and to store the data that this device is accessed with one or more data storage.And term " database " should be interpreted as storing up the also structured way of visit data at calculator memory with its most wide in range meaning.
This comment server 105 communicates by network 145 and note capture client 130 and note display client 135 and 140, and described network is for example as the public or private network of the Internet or Intranet.This note capture client 130 creates note in user's the equipment of checking operation in terms of content with the permission user.This checks that equipment can be computing machine, portable computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, E-book reader or any other equipment with the interface that allows user and content exchange.In certain embodiments, hand-held optics and audio capturing equipment are used for creating note, as at U.S. Patent application No.60/653, described in 899, the full content of this patented claim is incorporated into for your guidance at this.As used herein, content refers to any audio-visual content that comprises text or can be exchanged into text, include but not limited to document, webpage, image, lantern slide, speech, video, Email, spreadsheet, SMS information, threaded discussion (threaded discussion), chatroom, etc.As described in more detail, note capture client 130 allows users to create note and the text chunk that comprises in this note and the content that the user checks is associated.In certain embodiments, the two functional of at least some client executing note capture client and note display client.
Fig. 2 is the screenshot capture that for example can present to user's representative user interface 200 when viewing content.Although the content of describing among Fig. 2 only has text, but the content that should be understood that demonstration can comprise text, figure, video, animation, photo and any other audio frequency, vision or audio-visual content-namely, has the feature that can identify and any content that therefore can be used for theme or anchor content.Five note 2 05a, 205b, 205c, 205d, 205e and 205f are depicted as and are added to this content.The first note 2 05a be with this content in a voice annotated that sentence is associated, such as the record voice or music.This voice annotated can be by clicking or otherwise selecting this note to visit.The second note 2 05b be with content in two text annotations that word is associated, and comprise hyperlink or other links or the pointer that points to additional information.The 3rd note 2 05c is the text annotation that is associated with position in the content, but does not identify with any specific word in the content.The 4th note 2 05d is the text annotation that is associated with phrase in the content, and comprises button 210, and this button presents additional notes content to the user when selected.The 5th note 2 05e is the vision indication of note, when the user selects this note by clicking or otherwise hovering on the 5th note, can check its content.The 6th note 2 05f is the discussion clue (discussion thread) that is associated with the phrase of content.The user can put up the comment that can be checked by other users discussing.Can check additional content of the discussions by clicking " more " buttons, this button can be linked to the user discusses ejection or other variations that plate maybe can cause demonstration, and described ejection or variation allow the user to check more discussion clue.The note of describing provides some indications of note form and type, but only is example and never to plan be restrictive.Note can comprise text, image, film, sound, chat, URI, ballot, advertisement, purchasing opportunities etc. (tabulating referring near the part 24 and 450 sections).Note can be presented at the blank space around the text, can be superimposed upon on the text, can be presented on the screen different from content, perhaps can any combination in the above described manner present.Various other changes of note form and type will be apparent for those skilled in the art.
In order to allow the user to create and to store note, capture client 130 comprises optical character identification (OCR) or other recognizer components 150, note register 155 and privacy component 160.The operation of each of these assemblies of process prescription that below will set forth about Fig. 3 A and 3B.
Fig. 3 A and 3B be for allow the user to create and storage to the note of any type content process flow diagram by the acquisition procedure 300 of this device enforcement.No matter when the user wishes that the certain content section that it is just checked adds one or more notes, and this device can be carried out this acquisition procedure.One of the challenge that creates the cross-platform capture client of available any type content operation is the variation of the form that the user can viewing content.For example, even one section general content also can represent by various forms as document, comprise MicrosoftWord, Adobe PDF, Corel Word Perfect, OpenDocument and other form.Although can create each content of interface and these forms docks, guaranteeing the wide in range applicability of note capture client 130, but the image of the content that this client randomly shows with the forward user carries out mutual rather than carries out alternately with the bottom format content of using defined of checking of being used by the user.Yet under (such as using API by inquiry) can obtain those situations about the information of displaying contents, described system option ground used this information to replace own carries out image analysis of content to demonstration.In piece 305, there be not API to can be used to describe in the situation of the content that is just presenting on the user display, caught all or part of screen buffer of the content that comprises forward user demonstration by this device.In piece 310, identify the text that the forward user shows thereby process the screen buffer data that capture by OCR/ recognizer component 150.As the part of identifying, data, figure and display format (display formatting) can be identified and randomly as theme or anchor material, perhaps it can be abandoned.By from the user be check or the demonstration of any application that operating content uses output extract text, capture client 130 can needn't with identification content in the situation that the API of the application of each displaying contents docks in all texts, and its processing does not have such API to use---namely not about the situation of the Information Availability of displaying contents.Although the OCR/ recognizer component is depicted as in the presentation layer capture client 130 of user's the equipment of checking, those skilled in the art will understand, can carry out some or all OCR/ identifying processings by remote service.For example, this device can be carried out at the capture client place initial treatment, and whole or some parts of the content images of the data that section processes can be crossed or the screen buffer data of catching are sent to can be carried out the long-range OCR/ identification that OCR similar or more resource-intensive processes (for example, the images match of sign and trade mark, sane OCR process, the processing of rare or sytlized font etc.) and serve.Teleprocessing has removed some or all of computation burden from subscriber equipment, allows simultaneously to carry out more complicated OCR/ identifying processing.
Be identified in case be included in text in the content that the user just checks (and randomly, other distinct elements), just allow this user to use note register 155 to add one or more notes to the text.In piece 315, this device receives the indication about the position of the note in this content from the user.Note can with content in point, with content in one or more words, with how much or geographic area (rectangular box that for example, comprises text and/or figure), be associated with the document elements of returning such as sentence, paragraph, page or leaf, sections, chapter etc.Any input equipment (for example, mouse, pen, cursor, touch-screen etc.) that user's the equipment of checking is supported, the user can specify position or the physical extent of the note in the displaying contents.This position can be point, single character or some characters, single character or some words (for example, sentence or paragraph) or their any combination.The user can come assigned address with any common position indicating mechanism, and described position specification mechanism for example clicks, clicks and draw, hover and click right etc.
In certain embodiments, this device relies on the text chunk with sufficient length to guarantee the suitable placement of note when showing in the future.If the user only is identified as the point in the content position of note, if perhaps the user has identified curtailment to guarantee note at the text chunk of accurate placement in the future, this device identification additional text is to be associated with this note so.Alternatively, the user may wish specific comments to occur for each appearance of particular text section, does not need in the case the text size that adds.In piece 320, this device determines that the user is the position that the text chunk in the content is identified as note, still only the point in the content is identified as the position of note.In piece 330, this device determines whether text chunk has enough length to guarantee that this note is in accurate placement in the future.If the indication of the test in piece 320 and 330 note needs further text in accurate placement in the future, if and the user only indicates, and this example of text chunk should receive note, so in piece 325, this device identification can be used for guaranteeing the anchor text of the suitable placement of note.For example, about Fig. 2, five example 210a, 210b, 210c, 210d and the 210e with dashed lines of anchor text are depicted.The first anchor text example 210a extends in each side of the user selection text chunk related with note 2 05b " Norwegian Blue ".This Array selection anchor text 210a comes to provide more multi-context for the text chunk of selecting, and the accurate placement of note 2 05b in future may be lacked very much and can not be guaranteed to the text chunk that wherein is comprised of two words (word) only.This device is selected anchor document 210b the user for each side of the position of placing note 2 05c and selecting.Similarly, this Array selection anchor text 210c is because it is before the position of note 2 05e.In piece 325, if the curtailment of the text chunk of user selection is to guarantee that note is at accurate placement in the future, so this Array selection anchor text.
In certain embodiments, two sections of this device identification anchor text.Be right after the first paragraph of identification anchor text before the location of annotated information of in content user identification.The location of annotated information that is right after user's identification in content is identified the second segment of anchor text afterwards.Each section of anchor text be the separately suitable placement of sufficient to guarantee associated annotation all.For example, in Fig. 2, note 2 05f has two relative anchor text examples.The first example 210d of anchor text extended before the position of note, and the second example 210e of anchor text extends after the position of note.Select each example of anchor text, so that the combination of the text of user selection and anchor text guarantees that note is in suitable placement in the future.Only to identify and use two groups of anchor texts with single note in those situations of one group of anchor text also be useful to this device when attempting suitably to place note, as will be in greater detail at this.
In certain embodiments, this device can provide instruction to guide user selection accurately to locate enough texts of note to the user, rather than this Array selection anchor text.That is to say that when the position of user selection note, if the position of selecting is not enough at accurate location note in the future, this device can provide vision or audible indication so.This vision or audible indication can remain to the user and select till enough texts.For example, originally this device can show red icon at screen when the user begins highlight text for the purpose of placing note, and this device can transfer this icon to green when the user has selected enough texts reliably to locate note.This vision or audible indication are served as and are guaranteed that the user provides the feedback of sufficient positional information for this device.
Identified after the position of note and this device selected any anchor text the user, this device receives note from the user in piece 335.Note can be any form (for example, text, audio frequency, video, image, link and URL, dynamic action etc.) and can use suitable input mechanism (for example, keyboard, shearing and stickup, with microphone or video recorder record etc.) to carry out typing by the user.Note can be taked can be by the equipment of the checking demonstration of user's use, any form of pointing to or calling.
After this device received note, it may be important covering in some cases the content of note or note associated text chunk and the content of anchor text before being sent to comment server.For example, capture client 130 may may be to pass through common network away from comment server 105 and any communication between the two.Therefore other security of certain level may be suitable for guaranteeing that the communication between client and the comment server can not intercepted and not captured.As another example, thereby anyone privacy of note service is used in the content protection of may be importantly covering note or text chunk when note or text chunk are stored in comment server 105.Under these circumstances, in piece 340, the sign of note and/or text chunk and anchor text can be encrypted or otherwise be covered to security component 160.According to the protection level of hope and the preference of user or this device operator, can use various technology security is provided.For example, the note cryptographic algorithm that can use public-key is encrypted, and is sent to comment server, and wherein note can keep encrypting in comment server and only can be checked by the people who has corresponding private cipher key.As another example, the verification of text chunk and anchor text and can be calculated and be sent to together comment server with note.As what from following discussion, can understand, can be by identical verification being provided to comment server and visiting note.Yet, since comment server only store verification and and do not store and verification and related actual text, so only have note itself for what people that can the access annotations server can determine easily.By use verification and, it is hiding that the actual content related with note will keep.Transmitting safely and store the indication of text chunk and the additive method of note is apparent for those skilled in the art.
In piece 345, capture client 130 is sent to comment server 105 with the indication of note, anchor text and text chunk.If by the party concerned's access annotations except the user of capture client, so whole note is sent to comment server.Allow subsequently note to be distributed to the user who uses display client 135 or 140 at comment server storage note.On the contrary, if only have user's access annotations of capture client, note can be stored in this locality of capture client so.In certain embodiments, whole text chunk and anchor text are sent to comment server.In certain embodiments, only transmit the expression of text chunk and anchor text.Such expression can be verification and, hashed value, encrypted code or other unique identification text chunks and anchor text and need not the value of the actual content of open text chunk and anchor text.Note and relevant information can be sent by capture client when the user creates note, perhaps can and periodically be sent to comment server by the capture client buffer memory.Can be by the network availability regulation that transmits to the timetable (schedule) of the transmission of comment server, perhaps can stipulate to minimize the traffic between the various device assemblies by communication efficiency.
In piece 350, received the indication of note and text chunk and anchor text by comment server 105.Comment server is the note that arrives of storing received in some way, and this mode allows subsequently based on all or part text chunk that is associated with note and anchor text and identifies this note.In certain embodiments, note can be stored in the annotations database 120, and text chunk represents to be stored in the text database 115 with the anchor text representation.In text database before storage text chunk and the anchor text, in piece 335, whether Already in this device search text database identify text segment table and show or anchor text representation in the text database.If the unidentified text chunk of this device and anchor text in decision block 360 add text chunk and anchor text to text database so in piece 365.In piece 370, in annotations database, store note, the note of storing has to being stored in quoting or other links of text chunk in the text database and anchor text.In certain embodiments, the text related with text chunk and anchor text together with which part of storage text stored corresponding to the indication of anchor text corresponding to text chunk and which part.In this way, can identify that the definite text (corresponding to text chunk) by user selection, and all the text (corresponding to text chunk and anchor text) of storage can be used for guaranteeing correctly to recover note.If this device identifies text chunk and the anchor text has been stored in the text database in decision block 360, the processing of this device can proceed to piece 370 so, store note in piece 370, the note of storing has quoting or other links to text chunk and anchor text.In this way, by the database of this device structure text chunk and anchor text, each is associated with one or more notes.
In certain embodiments, the text chunk that is received by comment server 105 represents and the anchor text representation choose and one or more documents of comparing to identify text chunk and anchor text corresponding to the expression of the electronic documents of storing in a large number and being derived from.The exercise question that on April 19th, 2005 submitted to is the U.S. Patent Application Serial Number No.11/110 of " PROCESSINGTECHNIQUES FOR VISUAL CAPTURE DATA FROM A RENDEREDDOCUEMENT ", 353 disclose a kind of method of the text that receives being correlated with for identifying related one or more documents, and its full content is incorporated in this as a reference.Can be installed by this sign of one or more documents that storage is associated with text chunk, anchor text and note.
Thereby the note related with text chunk is in case just can accessedly present to the user by this device storage.In order to promote timely access annotations, one or more index that are stored in the index data base 125 can periodically be set up or upgrade to this device.Display client can be optimized these index provides real-time or nearly real-time note to search.Those skilled in the art will understand, have the various technology that can be used for optimizing to the access of note and text database.
Get back to Fig. 1, after having stored note with text chunk and anchor text-dependent, this device is so that check that the user of the content that comprises arbitrarily the text chunk that is associated with note can access annotations with joining.In order to allow user's access annotations, note display client 135 and 140 can operate at user's the equipment of checking.Text based note display client 135 comprises text resolution device 165, security component 170 and format and display module 175.Presentation layer note display client 140 comprises text resolution device 165, security component 170 and format and display module 175, and comprises in addition optical character identification (OCR) or other image recognition assemblies 180.Generally speaking, each display client just will be resolved content by user's access so that identification is included in the one or more text fragments in this content.The expression of the text fragments of checking is sent to comment server 105, any note that is associated with these text fragments of comment server 105 identifications.Comment server is sent to display client with the note of correspondence, at the display client place described note is shown to the user.The operation of each assembly in the note client 135 and 140 all is described with reference to the procedure for displaying of setting forth among Fig. 4 A and the 4B.
Fig. 4 A and 4B are for allowing note that user's access is associated with content that the user just checks by the process flow diagram of the procedure for displaying 400 of this device enforcement.When the user wished to check the note that certain content section one or more and that the user just checks is associated, this device just can be carried out this procedure for displaying.Originally this device identifies the text that comprises in the content that the user just checks.Text based note display client 135 can be used for following situation: the content of wherein just being checked is to identify the form of the text fragments in the content with a kind of can the acquisition easily (for example, the API Calls by the source is used).Presentation layer note display client 140 can be used for following situation: the content of wherein just being checked is the form with a kind of text fragments that can not obtain easily to identify content (for example, the source is used and do not exported the API that describes its content that is just presenting at user display).Procedure for displaying 400 is described the operation of presentation layer display client 140, and the below will speak of the difference between presentation layer display client and the text based display client.
In the mode similar to the operation of capture client 130, display client carries out alternately with the image that just is shown to user's content, rather than carry out alternately with the bottom format content of using defined of checking of being used by the user, can operate by various forms in order to guarantee display client, the user can be with described various form viewing content.In piece 405, this device is caught and is just comprised all or part of at user's the screen buffer of checking on the equipment content that shows to the user.In piece 410, OCR assembly 180 is processed the screen buffer data of catching and is identified the text that the forward user shows.As the part that OCR processes, distinguish and abandon unwanted data, figure and display format.By from being used for checking or text is extracted in the demonstration output of any application of operating content, display client 140 can be identified the text in the content that the user checks and needn't understand and check to use with each content and directly dock necessary API.
In case identified the text that the user just checks, this device attempts to identify one or more notes that are associated with the text.In piece 415, thereby the content that text resolution device 165 parsing users check is identified one or more text fragments.Text fragments is included in the one or more continuous word in the content.Those skilled in the art will understand, can resolve text and identify which text fragments with various algorithms will send to comment server to be used for purpose relatively.In certain embodiments, for purpose relatively, the expression of each word of the text in the content can be sent to comment server.In certain embodiments, for purpose relatively, can be only the expression of distinguished word or word group be sent to comment server.Equally, also can implement for other algorithms that only text fragments of selecting are sent to comment server.
In piece 420, the sign of text fragments can be encrypted or otherwise be covered to security component 170.According to the protection level of expectation and the preference of user or this device operator, can use various technology security is provided.For example, text fragments can be encrypted with public key encryption algorithm, and is sent to comment server, uses private cipher key that it is deciphered at the comment server place.As another example, comment server can be calculated and be sent to the hashed value of text fragments.By only transmitting hashed value, anyone who intercepts and captures this transmission can't determine what text fragments the user checks.The additive method that transmits safely text fragments will be apparent for those skilled in the art.
In piece 425, this device will be sent to comment server to the identification of each text fragments, itself and the text that is stored in the text database can be compared at the comment server place.This device can be separately or is transmitted in groups text fragments, and can be termly or not timing ground transmit.For example, when the user checks document for the first time, can transmit the full text fragment of whole document, perhaps can only transmit the text fragments of those documentation sections of just checking corresponding to the user when the user checks an every when part.As another example, when user selection is some content start annotation when functional, perhaps when the user asks to receive note into the certain content section for certain, can send text fragments.
In piece 430, comment server 105 receives the indication of text fragments from display client 140.In piece 435, this device compares the indication of the text fragments that receives with being stored in text chunk in the text database 115 and the database of anchor text, in order to the text that receives and the text of storage are complementary.If the text fragments that receives is textual form, this this device can travel through the text that receives and its text with storage is compared with search tree so.If the text fragments that receives represents with coding form, the hash that for example is associated with text fragments or other values, this device can compare the coding form that receives and the encoded radio table that represents the storage text so, in order to identify text chunk and the anchor text of any correspondence.This device can utilize the one or more index that are stored in the index data base 125 to guarantee to finish comparison in quick and efficient mode.This device can require accurate coupling for the text of the text that will receive and storage compares the algorithm that uses, and perhaps can allow relative or approaching coupling.Because when the user can catch text fragments during scroll forward and backward in document, so use two groups rather than one group of anchor text can have some superiority.By before note and all store afterwards the position that enough texts are accurately identified note, when rolling anchor text on screen, can identify rapidly this note.For example, when the user rolls forward in document, place anchor text before with at first being identified in note, and when the user rolls in document backward, will at first be identified in note and place anchor text afterwards.Even also do not detect second group of anchor text (for example working as second group of anchor text keeps being hidden in outside the edge of visual display unit), this device also allows to show corresponding note to the detection of first group of anchor text.
In piece 440, this device tests to determine whether one or more text fragments that receive are complementary with the text that is stored in the text database.If do not have text fragments and the text that is stored in the text database to be complementary, indicating to display client transmission information in piece 445 does not so have note to show.Display client can provide the indication that does not have note for the content of just being checked to the user, lacks icon or the message of note such as indication.Alternatively, display client can only continue to show not content with note to the user, and wherein the user just shows when only understanding when note that the content of finding and check is complementary in the situation of note and operates.
If one or more text fragments that comment server receives are complementary with the text that is stored in the text database, the note that this device identification is associated with text fragments in piece 450 so.Such note is identified with the related of storage between the note in annotations database 120 by relying on text chunk in the text database 115 and anchor text by this device.For being found to be each text chunk and the anchor text that mates with text fragments, the identification note is to be sent to display client.In piece 455, this device is sent to display client with note and the associated text section that is associated with this note and/or anchor text.As described in more detail below, transmit text chunk and anchor text and suitably locate note with the permission display client, and any note highlights in the content that shows.Understand, if the text fragments that receives mates text section and anchor text exactly, if and the association of this device management between the result of the text fragments of each transmission and the search undertaken by comment server, then can only note be sent to display client and omit text section and the transmission of anchor text.
In piece 460, display client 140 receives related text chunk and indication and the note of anchor text from comment server 105.In piece 465, display client is determined the position of the content that note is just checked with respect to the user.The mapping of the position of the viewing content of the correspondence that the text that is produced by OCR assembly 180 is derived to the text is by this device maintenance.Therefore by comparing with the text of being identified by the OCR assembly to text chunk and anchor text that each note receives, then determine where the OCR text that mates appears in the content, determines the exact position of each note.
In case determined the position of each note, the position that this device identifies in content in piece 470 shows note.Display client is by inserting note in for the display layer on the existing application program of viewing content usefulness and show note overlapping the user.Display layer is the hyaline layer that the scope of examination is checked application in the All Ranges that allows the zone that comprises note except those.By being inserted into, note checking to use and separate in the display layer of controlling that this device can add note in the content format of wide region more with content.Fig. 2 has described such note and how to have manifested representative illustration to the user on covering content of text the time.
As the part of various Show Options, allow user's specified control how to show some parameters of note.For example, can allow the user to specify and whether should show the anchor text to the user.If show, then can with from be used for showing that different the highlighting of highlighting of text chunk presents the anchor text so that the user can distinguish the two.As another example, can allow the user to specify note is should be presented to compare identical context, similar context or be presented in the different contexts from the context that wherein records at first note.Identical context is the exactly context of matched text fragment of text chunk and anchor text.Similarly context be text chunk exactly the matched text fragment a part but the anchor text is the context of appropriateness (but not accurately) coupling.Different contexts is the exactly part of matched text fragment but the anchor text context of the remainder of matched text fragment not of text chunk.By specifying the type of coupling, user's energy Indirect method is to the quantity of the note of user's demonstration.The user can also set various parameters to determine how visually note to be shown to the user.For example, this device can allow the user to indicate icon (rather than note itself) to be presented at and indicate on one section content to have note.Clickable icon or otherwise hover over and then can cause showing note on the icon.In another example, can not indicate note in terms of content, unless one section text of user selection (for example, paragraph) and request show note.In another example, can be configured to show note to the only part of the visible display of user.For example, the Lower Half of display can be configured to show note, and the first half of display can not be configured to show note.When the user rolls and text when entering the viewing area, will show note in document.When text leaves the viewing area, just remove note.Other Show Options also is apparent to those skilled in the art.
Although the process 400 of describing among Fig. 4 A and the 4B is to describe for the operation of presentation layer note display client 140, most of process equally also can be applicable to text based note display client 135.The text based display client operates in following environment: wherein the textual form of content can easily be determined by display client.In such environment, representedly in needn't execution block 405 and 410 catch the step with OCR.Except these two steps, from piece 415 beginning and proceed to the end of process, text based note display client 135 can be implemented the process 400 identical with presentation layer note display client 140.
Except showing note to the user, when the note that presents of forward direction user had changed in the ban, this device can also provide notice to the user.For example, this device can be safeguarded the annotated record that has shown to the user.If for example by adding to text in the note or deleting text and revised one of note that has shown to the user from note, then this device can be informed the modification that the user is such.This notice can for example send the user to Email, instant message or other notifying changed forms immediately by this device.This notice can also or be transmitted to the user alternatively when the user checks note next time.For example, if the user checks the content with previous note that has presented to the user, then note can be shown by this mode of installing to highlight the modification that note is made, and described modification and last user check that note compares.The text that changes can be in every way such as such as by showing that with runic, the mode such as highlight the text is shown to the user.
Understand, can provide application programming interface (API) so that catching of providing of equipment and this device, demonstration and storage capacity are mutual.For example, interface can be provided so that portable scanning equipment can the sweep test text and text, sound or voice notes appended to the part of scanning.The part of such scanning and relevant note then can be sent to comment server and store.Typical portable scanning equipment can be at U.S. Patent Application Serial Number No.11/209 that submit to, that be entitled as " A PORTABLE SCANNING ANDMEMORY DEVICE " on May 11st, 2006, finds in 333, and its full content is incorporated in this as a reference.As another example, can merge the text display client functionality with access and show the note that is stored in the annotation data storage area such as the word processor of Microsoft Word.
Although the note that the user produces is considered in the discussion here, the modification of this device can operate with the note that device produces.The note that device produces can occur with various forms.In one form, this device can comprise network crawl (crawling) assembly, and it creeps to locate the text resource such as article, blog and other guide in the network such as the internet.When the network crawl assembly had been located quoted passage in the content of obtaining of creeping, title, authors' name, URL or other unique character strings, then this device can be caught the text related with this uniqueness character string and with the text of the catching note as this uniqueness character string.For example, if the network crawl component recognition comprise the blog of the quotation " Ich bin ein Berliner " of John F.Kennedy, then this device can be stored text around this quotation as the note related with this quotation.Therefore blog entries just becomes the note that can check when no matter where showing this quotation.
The another kind of optional form of note is the advertisement note to commodity or service advertisement.The advertisement note can be such as by wanting the user that advertisement is related with specific phrase to carry out user's placement.For example, the user can be with flying to angle the advertisement of travelling that phrase " rainbow salmon (rainbow salmon) " is carried out note.The advertisement note can also be that system places.For example, the user who seeks to sell inflatable boat can submit ad-request to this device.Use matching algorithm, this device can show the advertisement note with the inflatable boat that is described in the relevance that drifts about on the river.The advertisement note can also install automatically and a certain relevance by this.For example, can always have such as the exabyte of " Amazon.com " and link with its related providing or the note of the advertisement of other relevant companies.
1. the character of system
Have the reproduction document of electronics homologue (counterpart) for each, in reproducing document, have the information of the discrete amount that can identify this electronics homologue.In certain embodiments, this system identifies and locates the electronics homologue of the document with the sample of the text of for example catching with hand held scanner or other scanning techniques from reproduce document.As a rule, this amount of installing required text is very little, because usually just can be as the identifier of reproduction document with the link of accomplishing its electronics homologue from the text of several words of document.In addition, this system can identify position in document and the document with those several words.
Therefore, reproduction document and their digital homologue can use in this system of discussing and carry out association in multiple useful mode.And reproducing document can also be associated with metadata and other document relevant with reproducing document.
1.1 following scans fast
In case this system is with one section text in reproducing document and the optional network specific digit entity associated of having set up, then this system just can set up in this association a large amount of functional.
Increasing situation is, most documents that reproduce have on WWW or from some other online database or document sets is addressable or can make it such as in response to defrayment or subscription and addressable electronics homologue.So, on the simplest aspect, when the several word in the scanning input reproduction document, this electronic document or its certain part can be retrieved by this system, perhaps it are shown, it is issued someone with Email, buy this electronic document, print this electronic document or publish on the webpage.As additional example, scan someone the several words in institute's reading nationality in breakfast and can make the audio frequency book edition in this people's automobile when he/her drives to go to work, begin to read aloud from that point, or the sequence number of scanning on ink-cases of printers just can initiation command the process of replacing.
These of this System Implementation " reproduce document/digital integration " and many other examples, and do not require and change the active procedure of writing, print and publish document, reproduce document for such tradition brand-new digital function layer is provided.
1.2 term
The typical case of this system uses from using optical scanner scanning from the text of paper document or device display, but is important to note that the additive method of catching from the other types document is applicable equally.Therefore this system is described to sometimes from reproducing file scanning or catching text, and wherein those term definitions are as follows:
The document that reproduces is the document of printing or the document that shows at display or monitor.It is the perceptible documents of people, no matter is permanent form or temporary transient the demonstration.
Scanning or catching is that systems inspection is with the process from reproduction document obtaining information.This process can comprise the optical acquisition of using scanner or camera (for example camera in the cell phone), the crawl display (for example, OCR to screen/screen buffer, or otherwise from the document that shows, extract document information, referring to the 12.2.4 joint) or it can comprise reading aloud the audio capturing equipment or at keypad or keyboard from document and key in.For more example, referring to 15 joints.
2. system introduction
This joint is described some equipment, process and systems of making up the system that is used for reproduction document/digital integration.In each embodiment, this system sets up service miscellaneous and application in this bottom core that basic functionality is provided.

As the example of a kind of use of scanner 302, the reader can be scanned a certain text with scanner 302 from newspaper article.By scanner head 308 text scanning is bitmap images.Logic 326 makes this bitmap images be stored in the storer 330 with stamp correlation time that reads from clock unit 328.Logic 326 can also scan aftertreatment to convert thereof into text to this bitmap images execution optical character identification (OCR) or other.Logic 326 can be randomly extracted signature from this image, for example come repeating of location character, symbol or object by the process of carrying out similar convolution, and determines distance between these repeat elements or the quantity of other characters, symbol or object.Then the reader can upload this bitmap images (or text or other signature, if the processing after the scanning is carried out by logic 326) to the computing machine of association by interface 316.
As the example of another use of scanner 302, the reader can catch a certain text as audio file as the microphone 310 of acoustics capture-port from article by using.Logic 326 makes audio files storage in storer 328.Logic 326 can also be to the processing after this audio file execution speech recognition or other scanning to convert thereof into text.As mentioned above, then the reader can upload this audio file (or the text that produces by the scanning aftertreatment of being carried out by logic 326) to the computing machine of association by interface 316.
Second portion---core system each side general introduction
Become more general along with reproducing document/digital integration, a lot of aspects of prior art can both be changed to utilize better this integrated or can implement more efficiently.This joint is emphasized some problems in those problems.
3. search
Even if collected works are huge as WWW, but for the domestic consumer that constructs the search inquiry that sends to search engine with keyboard, search document collected works have become very general.This joint and next joint are discussed by from the structure of the inquiry of catching initiation of reproducing document with process two aspects of search engine of this inquiry.
3.1 scan/say/typewrite as search inquiry
The use of described system typically starts from using and comprises that those any methods in some methods of mentioning in 1.2 joints above catch a small amount of word from reproduce document.The document collected works need certain to explain to be converted in the situation of text in input, for example in the situation of OCR or speech input, in this system, may have end to end feedback, so that can be used for strengthening identifying.Can use end-to-end feedback by following steps: carry out the approximate of identification or explanation, identify the set of one or more candidate matches documents, then use from the information that may mate in the candidate documents and further improve or limit this identification or explanation.Candidate documents can be weighted according to their possible correlativitys (for example, based on other users' of scanning those documents quantity, or they are in the popularization on the Internet), and these weights can be applied in the identifying of this iteration.
3.2 the search of brief phrase
Because when the relative position of known a small amount of word, be able to remarkable enhancing based on the selective power of the search inquiry of these words, so only need catch the text position of a small amount of text to allow in these system identification collected works.The most at large, input text will be continuous word sequence, for example short phrase.
3.2.1 from short catching, find out the position in document and the document
This system can identify the position in the document and can take action based on this knowledge except location source of phrases document certainly.
3.2.2 find out the additive method of position
This system also can adopt the additive method of finding document and position, for example by reproducing document use watermark or other special markings.
3.3 merge other factors in the search inquiry
Except the document of catching, other factors (namely, information with user identity, profile and context-sensitive) can form the part of search inquiry, the knowledge of the time of for example catching, user's identity and geographic position, user habit and Recent Activity, etc.
Document identification and other and a part of before catching relevant information and can form search inquiry, if especially they be quite recently all the more so.
User's identity can be determined from the unique identifier that is associated with capture device and/or biometric or other supplementarys (voice mode, fingerprint, etc.).
3.4 the knowledge of the unreliability character in the search inquiry (OCR mistake etc.)
Can consider that the type of error that may occur constructs search inquiry in used specific catching method.An example like this is to indicate suspicious mistake when the identification specific character; In the case, search engine can with these characters as asterisk wildcard, perhaps distribute lower priority to them.
3.5 for performance/off-line uses index is carried out local cache
Sometimes, capture device may not communicate with search engine or collected works when data capture.For this reason, help the information of the off-line use of this equipment can download in advance this equipment, perhaps download to certain entity that this equipment can communicate with.In some cases, can download all or quite a few index of being associated with collected works.This topic also will further be discussed at 15.3 joints.
3.6 the inquiry of quovis modo can be recorded and after a while it be processed
If possible have delay or the cost relevant with transmitting inquiry or reception result, then this preloaded information can improve the performance of local device, reduces communications cost, and in time useful user feedback is provided.
In the situation that can not obtain to communicate by letter (local device " off-line "), these inquiries can be saved and be sent to the remainder of this system when recovering communication.
In these cases, it may be very important inquiring about the delivery time stamp with each.In the explanation of inquiry, the time of catching may be key factor.For example, 13.1 joints are about previously catching the importance that capture time is discussed.Be important to note that the time of catching is always not identical with the time of carrying out inquiry.
3.7 parallel search
For performance reason, can send successively or concurrently in response to single trapping multiple queries.For example when to catching when adding new word, can send in response to single trapping some inquiries, perhaps inquire about concurrently a plurality of search engines.
For example, in certain embodiments, this system to the special index of current document, on the local machine search engine, on company's network search engine and send inquiry to the remote search engines on the Internet.
The possibility of result of specific search recently is given higher priority from those results of other search.
It is unnecessary can indicating other inquiries undetermined to the response of given inquiry; These inquiries undetermined can be cancelled before finishing.
4. reproduce document and search engine
Usually expectation is that the search engine of processing traditional online query is also processed the inquiry that those are derived from the reproduction document.Thereby conventional search engine can be enhanced in many ways or revise and make them more be suitable for described system.
Other assemblies of search engine and/or this system can create and safeguard the index with different or additional features.This system can revise the inquiry of the reproduction document that comes from introducing or change the mode of processing inquiry in resulting search, therefore distinguish these come from the inquiries of reproducing document with from those inquiries of keying in the inquiry in web-browsing device and other sources.And, when being derived from the search return results that reproduces document, comparing with those search from other sources, this system will take different actions or different options will be provided.The below discusses each method in these methods.
4.1 index
Usually, can search for identical index with coming from inquiry or traditional inquiry of reproducing document, thereby but can strengthen in every way this index is used for current system.
4.1.1. about reproducing the knowledge of document form
Extra field be introduced in this index, and described extra field is with helpful in based on the situation of the search of reproducing document.
The index entry of the document availability of document form is reproduced in indication
The first example is the field that the indication known document exists or distributes to reproduce document form.If inquiry is from reproducing document, then this system can give this document higher priority.
Reproduce the knowledge of document form ubiquity
In this example, relevant (and randomly with the ubiquity of reproducing document, relevant with the subregion in these documents) statistics---for example scanning activity amount, circulation of being provided by publisher or other sources etc.---be used for giving these documents higher priority, thereby (for example promote digital homologue document, be used for inquiry or web search based on browser) priority, etc.
Reproduce the knowledge of form
Another important example can be that record is about the information of the specific reproduction layout of document.
For example, for the particular version of books, index can comprise and where occur entering a new line and paging, use the relevant information of which font and any unusual capitalization.
Index also can comprise the information about the proximity of other (such as image, text box, form and advertisements) on the page.
The use of the semantic information in the original paper
At last, semantic information also can be recorded in the index, and but this semantic information can infer from source marking not be apparent during reproducing document, refers to the fact that the item that will sell or certain paragraph comprise program code such as the particular text section.
4.1.2. carry out index in the situation of catching method knowing
The second factor that can revise index character is the knowledge of catching type that possible use.If the character be confused easily considered in index in the OCR process, perhaps comprise some knowledge of the font of using in the document, the search that is started by optical scanning so may be benefited.Similarly, if inquiry from speech recognition, so can be by efficiently searching more based on the index of similar sounding phoneme.Can affect the additive factor that index uses in described pattern is the importance of iterative feedback during identifying.If search engine can provide feedback from index when catching text, it can increase the accuracy of catching greatly so.
Use skew to carry out index
In certain embodiments, if possible come search index with what describe in the 9th joint based on skew/auto-correlation OCR method, this system stores suitable skew or signing messages in index so.
4.1.3. cumulative index
At last, in described system, search implemented in a lot of index may be very general.Can safeguard index at some machines of company's network.Partial index can download to capture device, perhaps downloads to the machine near capture device.Can for have special interests, custom perhaps can user or customer group create independent index.Index can exist for each file on each file system, each catalogue even the user's hard disk.Index is announced and is subscribed to by user and system.Therefore it will be important constructing the index that can distribute efficiently, upgrade, merge and separate.
4.2. process inquiry
4.2.1 know that catching is from reproducing document
When search engine recognized that search inquiry is derived from the reproduction document, this search engine can be taked different actions.For example, this engine may can tolerate that more the mode that may appear at the type of error in certain catching method processes inquiry with certain.
It may infer this in certain designator (for example the mark of character is caught in indication) from be included in inquiry, and perhaps it can itself infer this (for example, it can identify typical fault or the uncertainty of OCR process) from inquiring about.
Alternatively, compare from those inquiries from other sources and can arrive engine by different passages or connectivity port or type from the inquiry of capture device, and can distinguish in this way.For example, some embodiment of this system will arrive search engine to query routing by dedicated gateway.Therefore, search engine knows that all inquiries by dedicated gateway all are derived from the reproduction document.
4.2.1 contextual use
Below the 13rd joint describe be positioned at catch outside the text itself but may play to identifying document the various different factors of important help.These factors comprise that history such as nearest scanning, specific user's long-term reading habit, user's geographic position and user are to the thing the nearest use of particular electronic document.Such factor is referred to herein as " context ".
Some contexts can be processed by search engine itself, and are reflected in Search Results.For example, search engine can be followed the tracks of user's scanning history, and also can the inquiry based on keyboard that this scanning is historical with conventional mutually contrast.In this case, compare with most routine search engine, more status informations about each individual consumer are safeguarded and used to this search engine, and compare with typical case now, can think alternately with each of search engine and extend in several search and longer time section.
Some contexts can be sent to search engine (the 3.3rd joint) in search inquiry, and may be stored in this engine and sentence just and work in the inquiry in future.At last, some contexts are preferably in other local processing, and therefore become wave filter or the secondary search that is applied to from the result of this search engine.
Data stream input to search
To the important input of search procedure be user community how with the more widely context of the reproduction version of document mutual (for example, which document is read the most widely and by whom read).Have similar part with web search, the most frequent page that is linked to or those page of frequent selection from Search Results is in the past returned in described web search.About more discussion of this topic, referring to the 13.4th and 14.2 joints.
4.2.3. document subregion
Described system can not only send and use the information about document integral body, but also sends and use about the document subregion, even down to the information of each word.A lot of existing search engines are only paid close attention to location document or the file relevant with ad hoc inquiry.To provide important benefits for described system to those search engines that work than fine granularity (grain) and identify the position in the document.
4.3. return results
The result that search engine can use its other information of safeguarding now to return with impact.
This system only also can return the user owing to have just addressable some document (the 7.4th joint) of paper-copy.
Search engine also can provide the new element that is suitable for described system or the option except the simple retrieval text.
5. mark, note and metadata
Catch-search for except carrying out-retrieving, described system also is associated additional functionality with document, and is associated with ad-hoc location or text chunk in the document especially.Phase is related to be associated with this reproduction document this additional functionality frequent (but not being exclusively) by answering with the electron pair that reproduces document.As example, when the printout of scanning webpage, the hyperlink in this webpage can have identical functional.In some cases, this is functional not to define in electronic document, but in other local storages or generate.
Functional being referred to herein as " mark " of this layer interpolation.
5.1. the overlapping layer of Static and dynamic
A kind ofly see that mode to be marked is to think that it is " overlapping layer " on the document, it provides the further information about document or its certain part---and the action that can appointment be associated with document or its certain part.Mark can comprise human-readable content, but often invisible and/or plan for machine to the user.Example comprises when the user catches text from the given zone of reproducing document rendering preferences in the popup menu on the display nearby, and the audio samples of the pronunciation of particular phrase perhaps is described.
5.1.1. may be from several layers in several sources
Any document all may have a plurality of overlapping layers simultaneously, and these overlapping layers may derive from various positions.Flag data can create or provides by document author or by the user or by certain its other party.
Flag data can be attached to electronic document or embed wherein.It can find in rotine positioning (for example, but in identical place with different filename suffix from document).Flag data can be included in the Search Results of the inquiry of locating original document, perhaps can find by the separately inquiry to identical or another search engine.Flag data can find with the original text and other capturing informations or contextual information of catching, and perhaps it can find with the inferential information relevant with document with the position of catching.Even mark itself is not included in the document, flag data also can the specified location in the document find.
In other embodiments, can extract the part (for instance, text, image etc.) of document and it is submitted to long-range comment server determine whether to exist any mark/note.These parts of document can be used as expressly (clear) separately/in groups fragment or hash/the summary info textual portions separately/fragment sends to comment server in groups.In certain embodiments, may there be the comment server of communicating by letter with the document reproducer more than one/service.For example, the user can have the local note service that moves for their individual note; Their company can move enterprise's comment server and can have the one or more public comment server that can use by such as the network of the Internet.
Note and mark may major parts to be static and to be that document is distinctive, and the link that is similar on traditional html webpage often is embedded into mode in the html document as static data, but mark also can dynamically generate and/or be applied in the large volume document.Dynamically labeled example is the information that is attached to the up-to-date share price of the company that being included in of document mention in the document.The example of the mark of widespread use is translation information, and it is auto-available on a plurality of documents or document sections with language-specific.
5.1.2. individual people " plug-in unit " layer
Be used for also can installing or subscribe to specific flag data source, therefore personalized this system is to specific response of catching.
5.2. key word and phrase, trade mark and logos
Some elements in the document can have based on himself characteristic rather than its position in particular document, associated with it specific " mark " or functional.Example comprises and pure be printed on the special marking in the document in order to scan purpose and the user can be linked to logos and trade mark about the more information of related tissue.This is equally applicable to " key word " or " key phrase " in the text.Tissue can be registered associated with it or be wished the particular phrase related with it, no matter and where scan all obtainable a certain marks of this phrase for they add.
Any word, phrase etc. can the related marks of tool.For example, no matter when the user catches the title of word " book " or book or the topic of relevant book, and this system can add some to popup menu (arriving for instance, the link of online bookstore).In some embodiment of this system, digital homologue document or index are consulted to determine to catch near the title or the topic about book that whether appears at word " book " or book---and this proximity of foundation and key word element is revised system action.In aforementioned exemplary, Care Mark is so that the data of catching from non-commercial text or document can trigger business transaction.
5.3 the content that the user provides
5.3.1. comprise multimedia user comment and note
Note is the electronic information that another kind can be associated with document.For example, the user can add him/her the audio file of the idea of particular document is retrieved as voice annotated later on being used for.As another example of multimedia note, the photo in the place that the user mentions in can attached document.The user provides note to document usually, but this system can related note (for example, other users in the working group can share note) from other sources.
5.3.2. the note from check and correction
The important example that derives from user's mark is the note as the reproduction document of the part of check and correction, editor or review process.
5.4. third party content
As previously mentioned, flag data may often be provided by third party (such as other readers of document).Online discussion and to check be good example is as with particular job, the translation that provides voluntarily with explain the relevant community management information.Other illustrative examples comprise various objects (object), such as text, image, film, sound, chat sessions, discussion/BBS (Bulletin Board System) (BBS), poll, URL, " note ", footnote, marginal not, inline text, to another document (perhaps arrive the part of another document) link, text bubble (text bubble), indicate icon (for example, revolve stop checking whole notes) and/or the execution script of more notes.These third party's mark/notes can be individualities anonymous or that be tied to this note of generation.Such annotation system has the comment server that is suitable for providing in response to the expression of the textual portions (anchor) of submitting document to note usually.
In further modification, papery business prototype described here (paper commercemodel) also can be applied to note.When reproduction comprises the document that can buy article a part of, can describe to indicate the note that where can buy these article.Such model can effectively be combined in the note adapter of describing in following the 5.8th joint, and wherein the businessman will slowly seek (crawl for) to the mentioning of some article, and add link to buy this article in their shop.
In one embodiment, note can change based on its use.For example, have document few or that do not have to exchange (traffic) and notes and commentary and can have text based " comment " as related.Exchange (trafficked) more document and can have the threaded discussion tabulation as note, can have the online chatting session as the annotation object of association and exchange more document.Notice that these notes can be compatible, so that the note change of format still keeps previous note as the part of format simultaneously when exchanging increase, and like this equally when the interchange of document descends.
In addition, by the increase that monitoring exchanges, might determine in real time more welcome note point, so that note can be as the further tolerance of the welcome property of determining topic and/or content (that is, numerous users current interested what is).
Another example of third party's mark is provided by advertiser.These advertisements to mark/text of note can be (the context sensitive) of context-sensitive or can be context-sensitive to mark/note.
Except mark reproduces the textual portions of document, the text path of also may the mark user following, independent word/phrase (referring to the 5.2nd joint), whole sentence, paragraph, chapter return, sections, page or leaf, document, people's (talking with in the document many people).On the contrary, what sometimes may expect is certain part of document to be registered as " can not note ", wherein stops the OCR/ note to institute's registering section.
Usually, third party content not all is to have equal quality (caliber).Therefore, in certain embodiments, can give note and mark classification, rank and/or classification.The note quantity that can check, edit by the colleague classification, create based on the third party etc. is come to scope (ranging) classification.In one example, readers ' reading or rank are more, and the grade of note just increases.Having such annotation metadata allows the reader based on their rank or other standards (for example, sex of language or note, date range, geography, scholiast's age, scholiast etc.) search/filtration note.In certain embodiments, even may filter based on scholiast's identity, for example to find out " famous person " note.
Not all document all will have similar size, and in certain embodiments, reproducing document can occur with greater or lesser size.For example, sign, notice board and outdoor advertising are not suitable for usually on small display or hand held scanner is used.Therefore, in one embodiment, can use " coming back (headsup) " display, so that can be for reproducing file scanning and showing note, no matter and size.
Equally, the user is not the interested document of total energy monitoring.Therefore some embodiment comprise the note notice of call user's attention annotation activity (the document note of for example, being made by particular person, to the note of particular document, to the note of any customer documentation, to the note of any user comment/response etc.)/warn.
5.5. dynamically labeled based on other users' data stream
Data by several or all users that analyze by this system catch from document can generate mark based on activity and the interest of group.Example can be to create the mark of in fact telling user's " liking the people of this this book also to like ... " or the online bookstore of note.This mark can less anonymity, and can tell the user that in his/her contacts list who also read this document recently.Other examples of data-flow analysis are included in the 14th joint.
5.6. the mark based on external event and data source
Mark is often based on external event and data source, such as from the input of company database, from the information of public the Internet or by the statistic of local operation systematic collection.
Data source also can be more localized, and the context about the user particularly can be provided---his/her identity, position and movable information.For example, this system can and provide mark layer with user's mobile phone communications, and this mark layer provides someone option that document is sent to that the user converses at phone recently to the user.
5.7. comment server
As mentioned above, each embodiment can adopt comment server to process third party's notes content.But the user will submit one or more identification divisions (as the plaintext text or as eap-message digest) of document and the note that server is associated the location to.This server also can provide additional ability.For example, this server can operate to promote the cooperation between the user of note.This cooperation can be taked various ways, such as the promotion (facilitation) to Email Information, chat sessions, agent communication (brokered communicaiton) etc.The user that the cooperation of these types may be suitable for having cooperated, for example BBS, group, club, class, company, corporate department, chat group, individual social network, etc.In fact, when reading similar books as the user and/or making similar note, group can dynamic formation to cooperate around annotation activity.
5.8. note adapter
In certain embodiments, (one or more) note can exist for reproducing document, but it can be obtained by reproducing document interface.For example, about the blog entries of documentation section, this blog entries has the still not link from the document part to blog entries of link of returning the document part.The note adapter will create connection between document (part) and note.In one embodiment, the note adapter " is creeped " blog entries to add from suitable reproduction document with the document (documentation section) of locating any link and with note and is got back to the piece clauses and subclauses.To carry out similar action to notes and commentary in discussion group, other documents etc.
Other embodiment also can use conversely, for example makes note and indicates subsequently this note should be fitted in scholiast's the blog entries.Equally, comments class can be shifted onto the seed (feed) of blog entries and " subscription " specific comments person's note.
5.9. mobile note
Not all reproduction document is all available with the display of appropriate size.Therefore, the mobile device that has small displays and an imaging capability can be used for browsing document and seeking and can be retrieved be used to the indication of the note of checking.Similarly, may with the mobile phone pictures taken also (for example, by Multimedia Message transmitting-receiving service " MMS ") this image sent to comment server receive answer message with any note.
6. authentication, personalization and security
Under many circumstances, user's identity will be known.For example, this can be " anonymous identity " sometimes, only identifies the user by the sequence number of capture device in the case.Yet usually, be contemplated that this system will have the more detailed knowledge about the user, these knowledge can be used for making system's personalization and allow to carry out activity and transaction with user's name.
6.1 the user is historical and " life storehouse (life library) "
One of simple but the most useful function that this system can carry out is exactly for the user preserves the record of the text that he/her catches and catches relevant any further information with this, comprises the details of any document of discovery, the position in the document and so any action of taking.
The history of this storage is all useful to user and system.
6.1.1 for the user
" life storehouse " (record of anything that he/her reads and catches) can be provided to the user.This can only be for personal interest, but can be for example in the library for the scholar of the bibliography material of collecting its next chapter paper.
In some cases, the user may wish the storehouse open, such as by with the similar mode of blog it is published on the net, so that other people can see that he/her is reading and find interested is what.
At last, catching certain text and this system the user can not catch this immediately and (for example take action, because the electronic version of document is still unavailable) situation under, this is caught and can be stored in the storehouse and can automatically or in response to user's request process after a while.The user can also subscribe to new mark service and the scanning that they are applied to before catch.
6.1.2 for system
The record that the user catches in the past concerning this system also of great use.A lot of aspects of this system's operation can both be by reading habit and historical enhancing of knowing the user.The simplest example is that any scanning that the user carries out all more may come from the recently document of scanning of user, and if especially in previous scanning a few minutes in the past, then it probably comes from identical document.Similarly, more likely, document is read with order from the beginning to the end.Like this, for English document, equally more likely, scanning afterwards is with the more following appearance in the document.Such factor can help this system to establish the position of catching in unclean situation, and can reduce the amount of text that need to catch.
6.2. the scanner as payment, sign and authenticating device
Because acquisition procedure starts from certain type equipment (being generally optical scanner or voice recorder) usually, so this equipment can be used as the key (key) of identifying the user and authorizing some action.
6.2.1 scanner is related with phone or other accounts
This equipment can be embedded in the mobile phone or in certain other modes and be associated with the mobile phone account.For example, can be by will the SIM card related with account being inserted in the scanner and this scanner and mobile telephone account is related.Similarly, this equipment can be embedded in credit card or other the Payment Card, or has and such device that connects that links.Therefore this equipment can be used as payment token, and by starting financial transaction from reproducing catching of document.
6.2.2 the scanner input is used for authentication
Scanner can also be related with this user or account by the process of certain mark, symbol or text related with specific user or account of scanning.In addition, for example by scanning user's fingerprint, scanner can be used for bio-identification.In the situation based on the capture device of audio frequency, the speech pattern that this system can be by match user or by requiring the user to say specific password or this user identified in phrase.
For example, scan quoted passage and be provided when buying the option of this book from online retailer from book the user, the user can select this option, and then is prompted to scan his/her fingerprint and confirms transaction.
In addition referring to the 15.5th and 15.6 joints
6.2.3 security sweep equipment
When capture device is used for identification and authenticated and representative of consumer startup transaction, be safe in other parts of this system and the communication between this equipment importantly.It is also important that situation about preventing such as another equipment is disguised oneself as scanner and so-called " go-between " attack (communication between this equipment and other assemblies is intercepted and captured in the case).
The in the art fine understanding of technology of the security that is used for providing such; In various embodiments, other local hardware and softwares all are configured to implement such technology in this equipment and this system.
7. publish model and element
Described advantage of system is to need not to change establishment, printing or publish the conventional procedure of document in order to obtain a lot of benefits of this system.The founder or the publisher that but have document---are designated hereinafter simply as " publisher "---and may wish to create functional a lot of reasons of supporting described system.
This section relates generally to publishes document itself.For the information relevant with other relevant business transactions (such as advertisement), be the 10th joint of " P-commercial (P-Commerce) " referring to title.
7.1 the electronics companion of document printing
This system allows the related electronics of document printing tool to exist.Routinely, CD-ROM often loads and transports with book in publisher, and this CD-ROM comprises further numerical information, instructs film and other multi-medium datas, sample code or document or other reference material.In addition, some publishers safeguard the website related with niche publication, the information that this website provides such material and can upgrade after publication, such as errata, further comment, the data source that the reference material of renewal, bibliography are relevant with other and arrive other translations.Online forum allows the reader to contribute it about the comment of publication.
Described system allows this material than more closely being tied to the reproduction document in the past, and allow the user can easier discovery they and mutual with them.By from document, catching a part of text, this system can automatically connect the user to related with the document and more particularly with the related digital material of the specific part of the document.Similarly, the user can be connected to the on-line communities that text selections are discussed, and perhaps is connected to other readers' note and notes and commentary.In the past, this information need to can find by searching for the specific page number or Zhang Huicai usually.
Such exemplary application is in the field of academic textbook (the 17.5th joint).
7.2 " subscription " to document printing
Some publishers may have Mailing list, if the reader wish to be apprised of new relevant issues maybe when the redaction of book is published the reader wish to be apprised of, the reader can subscribe to this Mailing list.Utilize described system, the user can more easily register the interest to particular document or documentation section, in some cases in addition publisher consider to provide any so functional before.Reader's interest can be presented to publisher, may affect its about when and where provide renewal, further information, to verified be in the existing books the interested topic of people in addition completely newly publish or the decision of redaction.
7.3 have particular meaning or comprise the typographic(al) mark of special data
Only by using the text that has existed in the document, can realize a lot of aspects of this system.If yet document is to know that it may produce under the situation in conjunction with this system's use, extra functional can the interpolation by the extraneous information of printing special marking form then, described special marking can be used for identifying more closely text or required action or otherwise strengthen document and system alternately.The simplest and most important example is to indicate the document really can pass through this system access to the reader.For example, can indicate the document to have the online discussion forum related with it with special icon.
Such symbol can plan purely to be used for the reader, or they can be when scanning by this system identification and be used for starting certain action.Enough data of can encoding in this symbol are not only to identify this symbol: it can also store can by this system identification and read for example about the information of document, version and character position.7.4 by having the mandate of paper document
There is following certain situation: have and maybe can access document printing and will give the user some privilege, electronic copies or additional materials that for example can access document.Utilize described system, only catch textual portions or scan the result of the symbol of special printing from document as the user, just can authorize such privilege.Need to guarantee that in this system the user has in the situation of whole document, its possibility prompting user is from specific page scanning particular item or the phrase of for example " the 46th page of the second row ".
7.5 expired document
If the document of printing is to lead to additional materials and functional path, then also may be subjected to time restriction to the access of such feature.After expiry date, the user may need defrayment or obtain newer documentation release again to access this feature.Certainly, it is spendable that paper document remains, but will lose the electric function of its some enhancings.This may expect, for example owing to be profitable collecting the charges aspect the access electronic material or buying every now and then aspect the redaction publisher the needs user, or owing to has the drawback related with the expired version of document printing of reservation in the circulation.Reward voucher (coupon) is a kind of example that can have the business document type of expiry date.
7.6 the analysis of welcome property and publication determine
The statistic that the 10.5th joint is discussed with this system affects author's remuneration and advertisement price.
In certain embodiments, this system is from the welcome property of deduction publication the activity of the electronic communities related with publication and from the use of reproducing document.These factors can help publisher to make will to publish and so in future about them to determine.For example, become very popular if the chapter of existing books returns, then its probable value must expand to independent publication.
8. document access service
The importance of described system is the ability that the electronic version of access the document is provided to the user of reproduction copy that can access document.In some cases, document can freely obtain on common network that the user can access or dedicated network.This system with the text of catching identify, location and search file, also it is presented in some cases on user's the screen or with it and is placed in their email INBOX.
In some cases, document will can obtain with electronic form, but because a variety of causes, the user may not access the document.May not have enough connectivities to retrieve the document, the user may not be endowed its right of retrieval, may exist and its related cost of access, or the document may be withdrawn and may be replaced by redaction, only lift here several can property.This system provides feedback about these situations to the user usually.
As mentioning in the 7.4th joint, if known users can have been accessed the printable copy of the document, degree or the character of then authorizing specific user's access may be different.
8.1 the document access of authentication
Can be subject to specific user or satisfy the user of specified criteria the access of document, perhaps (for example when the user is connected to secure network) is available only in some cases.The 6th joint has been described some modes of the certificate that can set up user and scanner.
8.2 document is bought---copyright owner's remuneration
Be not that free obtainable document still can be addressable behind defrayment to general public, described expense is usually as the remuneration to publisher or copyright owner.This system can directly implement the method for payment that payment mechanism maybe can utilize other and user-association, is included in those methods described in the 6.2nd joint.
8.3 document is managed on behalf of another and initiatively retrieval
Electronic document often is temporary transient; The digital source version that reproduces document may be available now but be inaccessible in the future.Even if the user does not ask, this system also can representative of consumer retrieval and store existing version, if the user asks just to have guaranteed its availability in the future like this.This also makes its use that can be used for this system, for example is used for searching for as a part of identifying the process of catching in the future.
If need payment to visit document, then believable " document is managed on behalf of another " serves for example search file after the appropriate expense of payment of energy representative of consumer, guarantees if the user will obtain sufficient remuneration from this services request the document copyright owner in future.
If the document can not obtain with electronic form when catching, then can implement to change to this theme.If electronic document becomes available on the date after a while, then the user can authorize this service to represent him/her to submit to and to pay to the request of the document or to the document.
8.4 subscribe to other and account related
Sometimes can exempt, reduce with the existing related of another account or subscription or satisfy and pay based on the user.For example, can automatically be endowed the right of retrieve electronic version to the subscriber of newspaper printing version.
In other situation, this association may be really not so directly: the account that can set up based on the employer by the user or based on them to the scanning of the printable copy that had by the friend as the subscriber and the authorized user access.
8.5 with scanning-and-print to replace xerox
Catch text, identify electronic original part and print this original paper or form the replacement scheme that tradition is xeroxed and have many advantages with the process of catch certain part of this related original paper from reproducing document:
The document that reproduces need to be in the position identical with final printout, and needs in no instance simultaneously there
Can avoid wearing and tearing and the destruction to the document (particularly to old, frangible with valuable document) that are caused by the photomechanical printing process
It is high a lot of that the quality of copy is generally wanted
Which can preserve about document or documentation section by the most frequent record that copies
As the part of process, can pay the copyright owner
Can forbid undelegated copying
8.6 locate valuable original paper from photostat
When document was valuable especially, as in the situation of the legal document with history or other certain sense or document, people may process the copy of those documents for many years usually, and original paper leaves safe position in.
Described system can be coupled to the database of record original paper documents location (for example in the file warehouse), and these people that make it possible to access copy can locate the original paper document of file easily.
9. text identification technology
Optical character identification (OCR) technology is being absorbed in the image that includes a large amount of texts traditionally, for example from the image of catching whole page flat bed scanner.The OCR technology often needs the user to carry out a large amount of training and proofreaies and correct to produce useful text.The machine that the OCR technology often need to be carried out OCR has a large amount of processing poweies, and although many systems use dictionary, they are usually all expected in fact unlimited vocabulary is operated.
All above-mentioned traditional characteristic sections can be improved in described system.
Although this section focuses on OCR, a lot of problems of discussing map directly to other recognition technologies particularly on the speech recognition.As in the 3.1st joint, mentioning, can read aloud text by the user and to the equipment of capturing audio, realize from reproducing process that document catches.It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, also be applicable to audio samples, voiceband user model and phoneme in this principle of discussing about image, font and text fragments.
9.1 the suitably optimization of equipment
The scanning device that uses with described system is often very little, portable and power is lower.Scanning device once only can be caught several words, and in some embodiments once even can not catch complete character, but pass the dropping cut slice of text, many such sections are sewn to together can be from wherein inferring the discernible signal of text to form.This scanning device also may have very limited processing power or reservoir, although therefore itself can be carried out all OCR processes in certain embodiments, but many embodiment will rely on the connection (may in the time after a while) of more powerful equipment, convert text to the signal of will be caught.At last, it can have very limited device and be used for user interactions, therefore may need to be deferred to after a while any request that the user inputs to carry out, perhaps than present common operating with " best-guess " pattern to a greater degree.
" 9.2 uncertain " OCR
The main new features of OCR in described system are: it checks the image of the text that is present in other places and can retrieves in digital form usually.Therefore, always do not require the OCR engine to carry out definitely transcribing of text.The OCR system can export set or the matrix that may mate, and comprises in some cases probability right, and it still can be used to search for digital original paper.
9.3 the OCR-conjecture of iteration, disambiguation, conjecture ...
Can contact document index when processing if carry out the equipment of identification, then the OCR process can be apprised of the content of document collected works when carrying out, thereby larger identification accuracy is provided potentially.
Such connection also allows this equipment to inform the user when having caught the text that is enough to the discriminating digit source.
9.4 use the knowledge that to reproduce
When this system has had document
MayPrint that the knowledge of reproduction aspect-when the font printed words that use or page layout or which partly to use italic such as in printing, this also can help identifying (4.1.1 joint).
9.5 font cache-determine font at main frame downloads to client
When the candidate's source text in the document collected works was identified, font or its reproduction can download on this equipment to help identification.
9.6 auto-correlation and character skew
Although the composition character of text fragments may be expression can be as the most familiar mode of the text fragments of document signature, when other of text express possibility very effectively and to attempt to be positioned at text fragments in digital document and/or the database with box lunch maybe when the actual text that the expression disambiguation of text fragments is not needed to use text fragments during to readable form.The benefit that other expressions of text fragments can provide actual text representation to lack.For example, the optical character identification of text fragments often is easy to make mistakes, and unlike other expressions of the text fragments of catching, and the latter can be used for search and/or again create text fragments and need not whole fragment is carried out optical character identification.Such method may be more suitable concerning some equipment that use with current system.
Those of ordinary skill in the art and other people can understand, exist a lot of modes to describe the outward appearance of text fragments.Such sign of text fragments can include but not limited to word length, relative word length, character height, character duration, character shape, character frequency, mark frequency etc.In certain embodiments, the skew between the matched text mark (that is, the quantity of insertion mark adds) is used to characterize text fragments.
Conventional OCR uses the knowledge relevant with font, letter configuration and shape to attempt to determine character in the scan text.Embodiments of the invention are then different: they adopt the various methods of coming the aid identification process with reproduction text itself.These embodiment use character (or mark) to come " distinguishing each other ".A kind of mode that relates to this self-identifying is " template matches " and be similar to " convolution ".In order to carry out such self-identifying, this system flatly slips over textual transcript the matching area of himself also noting text image.Previous template matches comprises various relevant technology with convolution technique.Signifying word and/or distinguish that these technology of character/mark are called " auto-correlation " jointly at this, therefore text is used to carry out relevant with its oneself ingredient when mating character/mark.
When auto-correlation, interested is the complete connected region of coupling.This occurs in other examples of character (or character group) and identical characters (or group) when overlapping.The complete connected region automatic lifting of coupling is for the text mark is turned to the composition mark.When two copies of text slip over each other, note occuring the zone (that is, all pixels in the terrace cut slice are all mated) of perfect matching.When character/mark coupling self, the horizontal extent of this coupling (for example, the connection compatible portion of text) is also mated.
Be noted that the actual identification (that is, corresponding to specific letter, numeral or the symbol of token image or these group) that does not need to determine each mark in this stage, only need to determine the skew of next generation of identical mark in the scan text.Skew quantity is the distance (quantity of mark) to next generation of identical mark.If mark is unique in text string, then skew is zero (0).The marking bias sequence that generates thus is the signature that can be used for identifying scan text.
In certain embodiments, the marking bias of determining for the mark string of scanning compares (4.1.2 joint) with the marking bias based on their contents to the index that the electronic document collected works carry out index.In other embodiments, the marking bias of determining for the mark string of scanning is converted into text, and with based on its content the more conventional index that the electronic document collected works carry out index is compared.
As previously pointed out, when acquisition procedure comprised the audio samples of the word of saying, similarly the mark correlated process can be applied to the speech fragment.
9.7 " self-identifying " of font/character
Conventional template matches OCR compares the image of scanning with the character picture storehouse.In fact, for the image ratio of every kind of font memory word matrix and the image that will newly scan and storage to find out the character of coupling.This process has initial delay usually until identify correct font.After this, the OCR process can be relatively very fast because most documents use identical font in the whole text.Therefore, follow-up image can compare by the fontlib with nearest identification and be converted into text.
Character shape in the font of the most frequent use is correlated with.For example, in most fonts, letter " c " and letter " e " they visually are relevant---also such as " t " and " f " etc.By constructing the template of the letter that also is not scanned with this relation, thereby strengthen the OCR process.For example, the reader when scanning one short illustration and text juxtaposed setting this so that this system be not with relatively the image template set of institute scan image from the reproduction document of the font that before do not run into, this system can utilize may concern between (leverage) some character to construct the font template base, even if it does not also run into all letters in the alphabet.Then this system can distinguish the text of follow up scan and further improve the fontlib of constructing with the font template base of constructing.
9.8 send Unidentified any thing (comprising figure) to server
When image can not be transcribed into the form that is suitable for search procedure by machine, image itself can be saved for the user and use after a while, carrying out possible manual transcription, or can be used for later not processing of this system in homology.
10.P-commercial
Many actions that this system can realize cause the generation of some business transactions.Phrase P-commerce is used for describing the business activity that starts from reproducing document via this system at this.
10.1 sell the document from its physics printable copy
When the user catches text from document, can provide the document for purchase to this user with papery or electronic form.Can also provide relevant document to the user, for example in reproducing document, quote or those documents of otherwise reference or about those documents of similar theme or those documents of same authors.
10.2 reproduce the sale of any other that document starts or auxiliary thing
Catching of text can be linked to other business activities in every way.The text of catching can clearly be designed to sell in the catalogue of article, in the case the text very directly related with the purchase of article (the 18.2nd joint).Text can also be the part of advertisement, and the sale of the article of institute's advertisement may occur thereupon in the case.
In other cases, the user catches other texts that therefrom can infer their potential interest in the business transaction.For example, the reader of the novel take particular country as background may be interested in spending a holiday thereunto.Read that the new speed of a motor vehicle lookes at someone may consider buying car.The user can catch specific text fragments, know therefore to present some commercial opportunities to them, or it may be that they catch movable spinoff.
10.3 the catching the label on the article, icon, sequence number, bar code that causes selling
Sometimes in fact text or symbol are printed on article or its packing.Example be the back side of an electronic equipment or below label on sequence number or the product IDs often found.This system can provide a kind of by catching the original easy way of buying one or more identical items of this article to the user.Can also provide manually to them, support or repair service.
10.4 contextual advertisement
Except Direct Acquisition text from advertisement, this system also allows novel advertisement, and this advertisement needn't obviously be arranged in reproduces document but still be based on the thing that people are reading.
10.4.1 based on scanning context and historical advertisement
In traditional paper publication thing, advertisement expends a large amount of spaces usually with respect to the text of newspaper article, and the advertisement that can only place limited quantity on every side of certain articles.In described system, advertisement can be related with independent word or phrase, and can according to the user by the special interests of catching the text and showing and may consider the user in the past the history of scanning select.
Utilize described system, purchase can be tied to specific document printing and advertizer and can obtain the obviously more feedback relevant with the effect of its advertisement in the specific printed publication.
10.4.2 based on user's context and historical advertisement
This system can collect in a large number and oneself use (the 13rd joint) about the otherwise information of user's context for it; The estimation in user geographic position is exactly good example.Such data can also be used to make the advertisement that (tailor) presents to this system user.
10.5 remuneration model
This system has realized some new remuneration model of advertizer and marketer.The publisher that comprises the document printing of advertisement can collect some incomes from the purchase that comes from its document.No matter whether have advertisement in original printing form, this may all set up; It can be added by publisher, advertiser or certain electronic third-party ground, and such advertisement source can be subscribed to by the user.
10.5.1 the remuneration based on welcome property
Can be disclosed the welcome property (the 14.2nd joint) of some part of publication by the statistics quantitative analysis of this system's generation.For example, in newspaper, it can disclose the reader and spend in time quantum on specific webpage or the article or specific columnist's welcome property.In some cases, concerning author or publisher based on Readers Activities rather than to collect remuneration based on the more traditional measure such as the copy amount of the word of writing or distribution may be suitable.The author that its works become the authority of frequently reading about the quilt of certain theme can be different from contract in the future that its book has been sold equal number but the author that seldom is opened considers.(also referring to the 7.6th joint).
10.5.2 the advertisement based on welcome property
The decision-making relevant with the advertisement in the document also can be based on the statistic relevant with the readership.The price that advertising space around most popular columnist can be sold.Even may be after document be published a period of time based on about its received what kind of knowledge and to advertizer's charge or pay.
10.6 the marketing based on the life storehouse
The 6.1st with 16.1 joints in " the life storehouse " described or scanning history may be with user's interest and be accustomed to relevant very valuable information source.Be foundation in suitable agreement and privacy concern, such data can providing to user notification goods or service.Even if with the form of anonymity, collected statistic also may be very useful.
10.7 the sale/information of (in the time can obtaining) later
Advertisement and other chances of being used for business transaction can not offer the user immediately when text is caught.For example, the chance of buying the novel sequel may can not obtain when the user reads this novel, but this system can provide this chance to them when publishing sequel.
The user can catch and the data of buying or other business transactions are relevant, but can select not when catching, to start and/finish transaction.In certain embodiments, and catch relevant data and be stored in user's the life storehouse, and these life storehouse clauses and subclauses can keep " movable " (that is, can carry out follow-up alternately, be similar to that obtainable when catching those are mutual).Like this, the user can look back this in certain time after a while and catch, and randomly catches based on this and finish transaction.Because this system can follow the tracks of when and where original catching occurs, all sides that therefore relate in transaction can both obtain suitable remuneration.For example, appear at the therefrom author who writes story on the advertisement next door of capture-data-and publish the user of the publisher of story-can be after six months and visit their life storehouse, from history, select specificly to catch and receive remuneration from popup menu (this may be similar to or be equal to the menu that when catching, randomly presents) selection " buying this article at Amazon " time of user.
11. operating system and application integration
Modern operating system (OS) and other software packages have a lot of characteristics, and these characteristics can be utilized valuably to use with described system and can make amendment in every way and think that its use provides even better platform.
11.1 in metadata and index, merge scanning and print relevant information
New and upcoming file system and their relevant databases often have the ability of the various metadata of storage and each file association.Traditionally, the thing this metadata has comprised ID, date created, the at last modification such as the user who creates file and used at last.Newer file system allows the extraneous information of storage such as key word, picture characteristics, document source and user comment, and this metadata can be extended arbitrarily in some systems.Therefore, file system can be used for being stored in Useful Information in the enforcement current system.For example, the date of printing at last given document can be by this document system storage, with use described system from papery from which text of wherein catching the document and when catch and whom catches relevant details by also may be by this document system storage.
Operating system also begins to merge the easier search engine device that finds local file of permission user.These devices can be used valuably by this system.This means the 3rd with 4 joints in the relevant concept of many search discussed be not only applicable to now based on the Internet and similar search engine, but also be applicable to each personal computer.
In many cases, specific software application also comprises the support outside the device that OS provides to this system.
11.2 the OS to capture device supports
Along with the use such as the capture device of form of a stroke or a combination of strokes scanner becomes day by day common, with expectation is will their support be building up in the operating system with the almost identical mode that provides support as mouse and printer, because the applicability of capture device has exceeded single software application.Other aspect situations for system's operation also are like this.Some examples of discussing below.In certain embodiments, whole described system or its core are all provided by OS.In certain embodiments, to the support of this system by being provided by other software packages (those aspects of directly implementing that comprise this system) employed application programming interface (API).
11.2.1 the support to OCR and other recognition technologies
Most methods of catching text from reproducing document require certain identification software that source data (being generally the image of scanning or the word that some are said) is translated as the text that is suitable for this system.Some OS comprise the support to speech or handwriting recognition, but since in the past the use of OCR be generally limited among a small circle application, OS comprises the support of OCR uncommon.
When recognizer component becomes the part of OS, other devices that provided by OS can be provided better for they.Many systems comprise speed dictionary, grammatical analysis instrument, internationalization and localized device, for example all these can both be used for its identifying valuably by described system, particularly because they can customize the word and the phrase that comprise that he/her often runs into for the specific user.
If operating system comprises the full-text indexing device, then these devices also can be used to notify identifying, as described in the 9.3rd joint.
11.22 the action that will take scanning
If optical scanning or other are caught and are occured and be provided for OS, if then do not having OS under these proprietorial those situations of catching of other subsystem demands may take the action of giving tacit consent to.The example of default-action is the selection of alternatives to be provided or to submit the text of catching to the built-in searcher of OS to the user.
11.2.3.OS have the default-action for particular document or Doctype
If find to reproduce the digital source of document, then OS can have its when this particular document of scanning or such document with the standard operation of taking.Application and other subsystems can be used as specific potential processor of catching type and register to OS, and pattern register is similar to the application announcement, and it processes the ability of some file type.
With reproduce document or with the beginning application-specific that can comprise from the related flag data of catching of document to operating system, the instruction of delivery applications variable, parameter or data etc.
11.2.4 the explanation of attitude and be mapped to standard operation
The use of " attitude " is discussed in the 12.1.3 joint, is particularly discussed in the situation of optical scanning, the specific movement of wherein carrying out with hand held scanner may represent the standard operation such as beginning and the end in retrtieval zone.
This is similar to such as pressing at keyboard and uses in the shift key cursor key to select text filed or with the roll action of document of the roller on the mouse.Consequently they are made an explanation in the mode of system-wide (system-wide) by OS the enough standards of this action of being undertaken by the user, thereby have guaranteed consistent behavior.Action to scanner attitude and other relevant scanners is also expected so.
11.2.5. the response to the menu item of standard (and non-standard) icon/text printing is set
In a similar fashion, some of text or other symbols can be when being scanned so that standard operation occurs, and OS can provide the selection of these actions.An example may be the copy that the text " [printing] " in scanning any document can make OS retrieval and the printing text.OS also can provide the such action of registration and the mode that they are related with specific scanning.
11.3 in the system GUI assembly to the support of the activity of typical sweep start
Most software application are basically based on the test pattern user's interface unit that is provided by OS.
The developer assists in ensuring that a plurality of consistent behaviors of wrapping to the use of these assemblies, and for example pressing left cursor key in any text editing context should be with cursor movement to the left side, must independently implement identical functional and need not each programmer.
When these activities are to be caught or other aspects when starting by the text of described system, in these assemblies similarly consistance expect.Below provide some examples.
11.3.1. be used for finding out the interface of certain text content
It may be to allow scanning input reproduce the zone of document that the typical case of this system uses, and allow this system can show or the software package of editing electronic homologue in open this electronics homologue also so that this bag is rolled to and highlights the text (12.2.1 joint) of scanning.The first of this process (finding out and open electronic document) is generally provided by OS and is standard at software package.Yet, the specific text chunk in location of second portion-in document and so that this bag be rolled to text section and it highlighted-yet standardization and often differently being implemented by each bag.Standard A PI is used for the operation that this functional availability can significantly strengthen this system's this respect.
11.3.2. text is mutual
In case located one section text in document, then this system may wish the text is carried out various operations.As example, the text around this system may ask just can cause this system access to comprise their whole sentence or paragraph so that the user catches several words.Again, this functionally can usefully be provided rather than implemented in processing each software of text by OS.
11.3.3 context (ejection) menu
The certain operations that is realized by this system will need user feedback, and this can be best asks in the context of the application of deal with data.In certain embodiments, this system uses traditionally and the related application popup menu of right button of clicking the mouse at certain text.This system is inserted into extra option in such menu, and the result of conduct such as the activity of scanning reproduction document is so that they are shown.
11.4web/ network interface
In the networking world of now fast development, available most functionally also can conduct interviews by network on each machine, and functional no exception with described system relationship.As example, in working environment, can be printed by the machine of other users on the same companies network by a lot of reproduction documents that the user receives.May be for inquiring about other machines corresponding to this document of catching under suitable allowance control in catching in this system responses on the computing machine.
11.5 the printing of document causes preservation
Key factor in reproducing document and digital document integrated is the information that keeps the conversion about between the two as much as possible.In certain embodiments, the OS reserving document is when and by the simple record of whose printing.In certain embodiments, OS takes one or more meetings to make it be more suitable for other actions that this system uses.Example comprises:
Preserve with the digital reproduction version of each printed document and with the document from the relevant information in the source of its printing
Preserve the subset of the useful information relevant with printing edition-for example, the font of use and where occur that disconnected row-it may assist following scanning to explain.
Preserve the version of the source document related with any printed copy
When printing, automatically document is set up index and event memory to be used for following search
11.6 I (print/scanning) document
OS often safeguards file or the file of some kind with certain sense.For example, by convention or design, can in " my document " file, find user's document.The dialog box that opens file of standard can comprise the tabulation of the document of opening recently automatically.
Be optimized on the OS that uses with described system, can strengthening or enlarge such kind in the mutual mode of the reproduction documentation release of considering user and storage file.Kind such as " document that I print " or " document that I read recently " may usefully be identified and is combined in its operation.
11.7OS other mark layer of level
Because " mark " concept that the importance normal operation of this system is discussed in the 5th joint provides, therefore obviously advantageously supporting this mark that provided by OS by the mode that a plurality of application and OS itself access.In addition, can provide mark layer based on its knowledge and its device that can provide (facilities) to the document under its control by OS.
11.8OSDRM the use of device
Increasing operating system is supported " digital copyright management " of certain form: control ability to the use of particular data according to awarding the authority of specific user, software entity or machine.For example, it can forbid unauthorized copying or the distribution of particular document.
12. user interface
If the processing power of capture device is relatively weak and be connected to PC by cable, then the user interface of this system can be fully on PC, if perhaps capture device is very complicated and oneself have enough processing poweies, then the user interface of this system can be fully on this equipment.In some cases, some functional residing in each assembly.The part of this system functionality or even all also can realize at other equipment such as mobile phone or PDA.
Therefore, the mode that the description indication in following each joint in some embodiments may be desired, but they not necessarily are applicable to all embodiments and can make amendment in many ways.
12.1 on capture device
For all capture devices, particularly in the situation of optical scanner, user's concern is usually on this equipment and reproduction document when scanning.So expect very much not require that as the needed any input of the part of scanning process and feedback the user pays close attention to other places, for example pay close attention to the screen of computing machine, unless this is necessary.
12.1.1 the feedback on the scanner
Hand held scanner can have various ways to come to provide feedback about particular condition to the user.The most obvious type is: direct vision, wherein scanner merged pilot lamp or even complete show (fulldisplay); And be the sense of hearing, wherein scanner can sound a buzzer, ticktack or other sounds.Important alternatives comprises: tactile feedback, wherein scanner can vibration, buzz or the touch perception that otherwise stimulates the user; And the feedback of projection, wherein it is by projecting to from coloured hot spot to complex display anything to reproduce document and come indicating status.
The important immediate feedback that can provide on this equipment comprises:
Feedback about scanning process---scanning input is too fast, angle is too large or float De Taigao or too low at particular row
Thereby enough contents---have scanned enough contents and have quite be sure of to have found coupling (if present)---extremely important for incoherent operation
The source of known contexts---text is positioned
Known unique context---a unique text source is positioned
The availability of content---indicating this content is free available or pay available to the user
Come all or part of of display document for example if it has enough abilities, then on capture device, also may occur usually and the many user interactions related than after-stage of this system.
12.1.2 the control piece on the scanner
Except basic text was caught, this equipment can provide variety of way to allow the user that input is provided.For example, even this equipment and the main frame close association that has such as the input option of keyboard and mouse, it also may be very chaotic that the user is switched between manipulation scanner and use mouse back and forth.
Hand held scanner can have button, roller/runner (jog wheel), touch-sensitive surface and/or for detection of the accelerometer of equipment moving.In these some allow can to carry out when still holding scanner abundanter mutual.
For example, in response to a certain text of scanning, this system presents one group of several possible coupling document to the user.The user uses the roller in scanner one side to come to select one from tabulation, and button click is confirmed to select.
12.1.3 attitude
Be to catch text in the main cause of reproducing motion scan instrument on the document, but some move and may and be used to refer to other user view by this equipment Inspection.Such movement is referred to herein as " attitude (gesture) ".
As example, the user can be by with from left to right conventional sequential scanning several words at first and namely scan from right to left in reverse order the large zone that text indicated in last several words.The user can also be by moving down the vertical range that several row are indicated interested text with scanner along the page.Scanning backward may be indicated the previous scan operation of cancellation.
12.1.4 on-line/off-line behavior
A lot of aspects of this system may depend between the system component such as scanner and main frame on knee network connection or with the external world with the network connection to the form that is connected to of company database and Internet search.Yet this connectivity may not be to exist always, therefore will have the occasion that partly or entirely may be regarded as " off-line " of this system.What expect is to allow this system to continue usefully operation under those situations.
When other parts of this equipment and this system do not contact, can catch text with this equipment.Very simple equipment may can only be stored and catch related image or voice data, stores ideally the timestamp that its time is caught in indication.When next this equipment contact with the remainder of this system, the various remainders that can be uploaded to this system and then processed of catching.This equipment can also be uploaded and catch other related data, for example voice notes related with optical scanning or positional information.
Although disconnect, more complicated equipment itself also may can executive system some or all of operation.Various technology for improvement of its ability of doing are like this discussed in the 15.3rd joint.Situation often is that some expectations are moved but are not that all the expectation action can be performed when off-line.For example, text can be distinguished, but the identification in source may depend on the connection based on the search engine of the Internet.In certain embodiments, this equipment therefore storage proceed to what degree about each operation enough information during with convenient connectivity recovery the remainder of this system can efficiently process.
Generally speaking, available immediately connectivity is benefited from the operation of this system, but exists some wherein to carry out several situations that then they may be had advantage as a batch processing of catching.For example, as discussing in following the 13rd joint, the identification in specific source of catching can be caught and greatly strengthens by being checked other that carried out at about same time by the user.In the system that connects fully of on-the-spot feedback was provided to the user, this system only can use catching in the past when processing current catching.If yet catch be by this equipment store when the off-line batch in one catch, this system when analyzing, can consider can from later catch and before catch any data of obtaining.
12.2 on main equipment
Scanner usually with certain other devices communicatings such as PC, PDA, phone or digital camera to carry out many functions of this system, comprise more detailed mutual with the user.
12.2.1 in response to the activity of catching execution
When the main equipment reception was caught, it can start comings and goings.Being listed as follows fully with the non-of possible activity of being carried out by this system after this catches related electronics homologue document and the position in document in the location.
The details of catching can be stored in user's the history.(the 6.1st joint)
Can be from local reservoir or remote location retrieval the document.(the 8th joint)
The metadata of the operating system related with the document and other records can be updated.(the 11.1st joint)
The mark related with the document can be examined to determine ensuing associative operation.(the 5th joint)
Software application can be activated to edit, check or otherwise operate the document.The selection of using can depend on source document or the content of scanning or certain other aspect of catching.(11.2.2,11.2.3 joint)
Application can be rolled to, highlights, mobile insertion point to or the indication position of catching otherwise.(the 11.3rd joint)
The exact boundary of catching text can be modified, for example to select to catch text whole words, sentence or paragraph on every side.(11.3.2 joint)
Can provide to copy to the user and catch text and carry out other standards Operational System Control or use the option of proprietary operation to shear plate or to it.
Note can be related with document or the text of catching.These can or can be hunted down in early days from instant user's input, for example are exactly like this in the situation of the voice notes related with optical scanning.(the 19.4th joint)
Can think that the user determines one group of other possible operation will selecting by check mark.
12.2.2 context popup menu
Sometimes treat that the suitable action of being taked by this system is clearly, sometimes then need the user to make a choice.A kind of good mode that realizes this is by using " popup menu ", perhaps is also shown in the situation on the screen " context menu " that appears near the content with so-called in content.(referring to the 11.3.3 joint).In certain embodiments, scanning device projects to popup menu and reproduces on the document.The user can use such as the classic method of keyboard and mouse or by use control piece (12.1.2 joint) on capture device, attitude (12.1.3 joint) or by use scanner and graphoscope alternately (12.2.4 joint) from such menu, select.In certain embodiments, if respond if the popup menu that may occur as the result who catches comprises the expression user---for example the user ignores menu and carries out the acquiescence item that another catches the action of time generation.
12.2.3 the feedback about disambiguation
When the user began to catch text, there was its several documents that may mate or other text position in first meeting.Along with catching more text and consider other factors (the 13rd joint), the quantity of position candidate will reduce until identify actual position, if perhaps there is not the user to input just further disambiguation.In certain embodiments, this system for example provides the document found or the real-time demonstration of position with the form of tabulation, thumbnail or text chunk, and along with the quantity of the element of the continuation of catching on this display can reduce.In certain embodiments, this system shows the thumbnail of all candidate documents, and wherein the size of thumbnail or position rely on the probability that it is correct coupling.
When catching when being identified clearly, can for example come to emphasize this fact to the user with audible feedback.
Quoted passage can appear and be characterized as in the text of sometimes, catching in a lot of documents.This system can be for example by dividing into groups to the document that comprises the reference (reference) of quoting around original source document and on screen this being indicated.
12.2.4 from screen scanning
Some optical scanners may be able to be captured in screen and other reproduce the text that shows on the document.Therefore, term reproduces document and here is used to refer to: being printed onto on the paper is not unique form of reproducing, and when when electronic console shows the text, may be valuable equally for text or the catching of symbol of this system.
The user of described system may since various other former thereby need to be mutual with computer screen for example from option list, select.For the user, put down scanner and bring into use mouse or keyboard possibility inconvenience.Other each joints have been described as the physical control spare on the scanner of input method (12.1.2 joint) or attitude (12.1.3 joint), these methods do not need the change instrument, but originally with it scanner scans some text or symbol is the important alternatives that is provided by this system with screen.
In certain embodiments, the optical device of this scanner allows it to use in the mode that is similar to light pen, direct sensing its on screen the position and need not the actual scanning text, and may be by means of the special hardware on the computing machine or software.
12.2.5 screen scraping
Except scanning the screen with hardware separately, in certain embodiments, may expect to use software or hardware in document reproducer inside to come capture screen (for example, scan and OCR, or otherwise obtain to reproduce document information).Such embodiment can use resident (resident) on document reproducer (for example computing machine 212) to use, and it has all or part of transparent part (being with or without the border) that covers this device display.By having hyaline layer, the content that this resident applications can be accessed the screen buffer of the document reproducer and be used the information in screen buffer to come OCR to show at this device display.Even if such to be applied in it may be sightless concerning the user when transparent, but it can have wherein at least part of is visible different mode, and when it operates, can also provide visual cues (for example, the flicker, painted, make a noise or otherwise allow the user know it work).
Further embodiment may to some extent difference between different other are used, and so that only grasp the demonstration information of current application, always grasps some application or some and uses and never allow the information of its demonstration crawled etc.
Still further among the embodiment, can be crawled and be submitted to server (this locality, enterprise or long-range) to determine whether have any mark or note for this part of document in the display part of document.Can periodically check such submission or check such submission when obviously context and/or demonstration information have changed as can be known in the change from screen buffer.
13. context interpretation
The importance of described system is to use other factors to help identify used document except simply the catching of text string.Often catching of an amount of text can unique identification document, but it will identify some candidate documents under many circumstances.A solution is that prompting user is confirmed at the document that is scanned, but preferred alternatives is automatically to dwindle possibility with other factors.Such side information can reduce speed and the reliability that needs captive amount of text and/or increase the position in the identification electronics homologue significantly.This additional materials is called " context ", and is discussed briefly in the 4.2.2 joint.We will more in depth consider it now.
13.1 system and catch context
Perhaps, the most important example of this information is user's the history of catching.
Very possible is, any given catch all from before caught identical document or came the document of auto correlation, if particularly previous catching occurs in nearest a few minutes (6.1.2 joint).On the contrary, font changes between the twice sweep if this system detects, then more likely they from different documents.
The user catch for a long time historical and reading habit also is useful.These also can be used to development of user interest and related model.
13.2 user's real world context
The geographic position that useful contextual another example is the user.For example, the user in Paris more may read Le Monde rather than Seattle Times.The time of the printed copy of document (timing), size and geographic distribution therefore may be very important, and can infer from the operation of this system to a certain extent.
For example always read one type publication and read in the situation of dissimilar publications at lunch or the train of going home on the user is on duty the road, the moment in one day also may be correlated with.
13.3 relevant digital context
The user can be helpful index to the nearest use (comprising those uses of searching for or retrieve by more conventional means) of electronic document.
In some cases, such as on company's network, other factors also can usefully be considered:
Is which document printed recently?
Is which document modified on company's file server recently?
Has which document sent with Email recently?
These all examples may show that the user more may read the reproduction documentation release of these documents.On the contrary, if the resident storage vault of document can confirm that document never is printed or sends to it and may be printed Anywhere, then can be removed safely any being derived from the search of reproducing document.
13.4 other statistics-global context
The 14th joint has been contained the analysis by the data stream that produces based on the search of reproducing document, but should be noted in the discussion above that here about document to other readers' welcome property, about time of this welcome property and about all being the example that can be of value to other factors of search procedure by the statistic of the most frequent documentation section of browsing.This system takes the possibility of the page rank (ranking) of Google type to the document field of reproducing.
Also can save referring to 4.2.2 for the some other hint that context is used for search engine.
14. data-flow analysis
As spinoff, the use of this system generates very valuable data stream.This stream is that what and the record when read the user read, and is the record of the valuable especially thing found in the thing that they read under many circumstances.Never real for reproducing document before such data.
So that can be used in some modes of the user of this system and this system, these data in the 6.1st joint, are described.This section concentrates on these data to other purposes.Certainly, for any distribution of reading and so on data about people, exist considerable privacy concern to consider, but the problem such as the protected data anonymity is known to those skilled in the art.
14.1 document tracking
When this system knew which document any given user reading, it can also infer that who is reading any given document.This allows to follow the tracks of document by tissue, thus for example allow to analyze who read it and when read it, in much scopes, distribute, how long this distribution has spent and who has seen current version and other people copy when having seen still.
For having more eurytopic publication document, the tracking of each copy is more difficult, but readership's distributional analysis is remained possible.
14.2 the welcome property of reading rank---subregion and document
Catching the user in the situation of its interested especially text or other data, this system can infer the welcome property of the particular sub-area of some document and those documents.This can form to the valuable input of this system itself (4.2.2 joint) with to author, publisher and advertiser (important information source the 7.6th joint, the 10.5th joint).These data also are useful in being integrated in search engine and search index the time---for example, are used for auxiliary Search Results from the inquiry of reproducing document being carried out rank and/or auxiliary rank carried out in the routine inquiry of keying in the web-browsing device.
14.3 customer analysis---set up profile
The user is reading and so on knowledge so that this system can create quite detailed user interest and movable model.This may be useful on abstract statistical basis---" 35% the user who buys this newspaper also reads this author's up-to-date works "---but it can also allow to carry out with each user that other are mutual, as discussed below.
14.3.1 social networks
An example is that a user and other users with related interests are coupled together.These people may be the people that this user has been familiar with.A college professor also can inquire in this system, " you know that you are also reading this paper just the colleague of XYZ university? " the user can inquire in this system, " you want with you neighbours in those also link other people that read Jane Eyre? " such link can be or in real world or the basis of on-line automatic formation bookclub and similar social structure.
14.3.2 the marketing
The 10.6th joint has been mentioned the conception that products ﹠ services are provided to the individual consumer alternately based on its and this system.For example, current online bookman often based on the user previous with the recommending to the user alternately of this bookman.When such recommendation based on actual books mutual the time, such recommendation is more useful.
14.4 the otherwise marketing of data flow-based
We discussed this system may affect those activities of publishing document, advertise by their those are movable and from reproducing some modes (the 10th joint) of other sale that document starts.Some business activities may be not with reproduce the document direct interaction, but still affected by it.For example, may interestedly be to know that the people in the community are more in the time that the finance part spends than them in the time that the motion parts of reading newspaper spends for the people who sets up health club.
14.5 may captive data type
Except the statistic of discussing, such as whom read which segment of which document and when and where read, also may be interesting be the actual content that checks the text of catching, and no matter whether the document is positioned.
Under many circumstances, the user not only catches a certain text, but also will cause certain action as a result of to occur.For example, can be to send quoting the document with Email to the acquaintance.Even if in the information-related situation of shortage and user identity or email recipient, know that someone considers that it also is of great use that the document is worth sending with Email.
Except the whole bag of tricks for the value of inferring particular document or one section text of discussing, the user will be by clearly indicating this value to its allocation level in some cases.
At last, when known one group of specific user formed colony, for example when knowing that they are the employee of specific company, the tabulate statistics amount of this colony can be used to infer that particular document is to the importance of this colony.
15. apparatus characteristic and function
Be used for only needing a kind of mode of catching text from the reproduction version of document with the capture device that this system uses.(the 1.2nd joint) just as described earlier, this is caught and can realize by the whole bag of tricks, and described the whole bag of tricks comprises takes pictures or some keyboards is entered the mobile phone keypad partial document.This catch can use can once record delegation or two styles of writing this small hand-held optical scanner or read aloud text from document such as the user and realize to the audio capturing equipment of wherein voice recorder.Employed equipment can be these combination---for example, can also record the optical scanner of voice notes---and capturing function can be built in certain other equipment such as mobile phone, PDA, digital camera or portable music player.
15.1 input and output
A lot of additional input and the output units that may be useful that are used for such equipment be described at the 12.1st joint.Display, pilot lamp, audio frequency and tactile transducer that they comprise for button, roller and the touch pad of input and are used for exporting.Sometimes this equipment will merge many in these, sometimes then merge device seldom.Sometimes capture device can use for example wireless link and another devices communicating that has them (the 15.6th joint), and capturing function is integrated into (the 15.7th joint) in other such equipment sometimes.
15.2 connectivity
In certain embodiments, this equipment itself is implemented the major part of this system.Yet in certain embodiments, it usually use communicator and PC or other computing equipments and with more wide world communication.
These communicators often are with such as Ethernet, 802.11 or the conventional data network of UWB or such as USB, IEEE-1394 (live wire (Firewire)), bluetooth
TMOr the form of the peripheral interconnection network of infrared standard.When the wired connection used such as live wire or USB, this equipment can be by identical connection reception electric power.In some cases, capture device may look like the connection machine of the conventional peripheral hardware that is conduct such as USB memory device.
At last, in some cases this equipment can with another equipment " grafting ", or be combined with this equipment or be used for convenient storage.
15.3 buffer memory and other on-line/off-line are functional
The 3.5th and 12.1.4 joint the topic of discontinuous operation has been proposed.When capture device has the functional finite subset of total system, and when not communicating by letter with other parts of system, this equipment still comes in handy, but sometimes available functional meeting reduces to some extent.On the simplest level, this equipment can record the original image of catching or voice data and this and can process afterwards.Yet the interests for the user, may be importantly, provide in possible place about the data of catching on hand task possibility be enough, whether it can be distinguished maybe may be recognizable and whether data source can be identified or may be discernible feedback afterwards.Then the user will know what whether their activity of catching was worth.Even above-mentioned all the unknowns, raw data still can be stored so that the user at least can be afterwards with reference to them.For example when scanning can not be distinguished by the OCR process, can present to the user image of this scanning.
For some in the available options scope are described, below describe quite minimum optical scanning device and function more fully optical scanning device both.A lot of equipment are between between the two.
15.3.1 the off-line example of ease of scanner (SimpleScanner)---low side
Ease of scanner has scanner head, and it can be from page read pixel when the length along line of text moves.It can detect it along the movement of the page and utilize about these some information recording/pixels that move.It also has clock, and described clock allows for each scanning and stamps timestamp.When ease of scanner has connectivity, that this clock and main equipment is synchronous.Clock can not represent the actual moment, but can determine relative time so that main frame can be inferred the real time of scanning or can infer in the worst case the time that passs between scanning from it.
Ease of scanner itself does not have enough processing poweies and carries out any OCR, but it has some ABCs relevant with the relation of typical word length, word space and they and font size really.It has some basic pilot lamp, described pilot lamp tell the scanning input possibility be can read, scanner head reproduce whether move too soon on the document, too slowly or too out of true and it determine when may scan the enough words with intended size for the document that will identify.
Ease of scanner has USB connector and can be inserted into USB port on the computing machine, will be re-charged electricity this its.For computing machine, it looks like is the USB memory device that records the data file that is covered timestamp thereon, and the remainder of system software is taken over from this point.
15.3.2 super scanner (SuperScanner)---high-end off-line example
Super scanner also depends on connectivity and carries out its all operations were, but it has quite a large amount of plates and carries Storage and Processing, the data of catching when this can help it to judge off-line better.
When it moved along line of text, the pixel of catching was sewn to together and is delivered to the OCR engine of attempting to distinguish text.Some fonts (comprise from user those fonts of the publication of frequent reading) have been downloaded to and have helped carry out this task on it, as having with the synchronous dictionary of the user's spelling checker dictionary on their PC and therefore comprising many words that they frequently run into.Store also on scanner that the tabulation of word and phrase and their typical frequency of utilization---this can make up with dictionary.Scanner can frequency of utilization statistics help identifying and inform that when it about having caught the judgement of enough amount of text; The phrase of more frequent use is just more impossible useful as the basis of search inquiry.
In addition, to the user the newspaper of the most nearest several phases of frequent reading and all index of the article in the periodical be stored on this equipment, as the user is bought from online bookman recently or the user within recent months, browsed anything index to a book from it.At last, have to this system can with the title of several thousand most popular publications of data be stored so that the user can be scanned this title and catching after a while possibility and can retrieve with electronic form and have good idea from specific works just when not having other information.
In scanning process, the user informs in this system: the data of catching had enough qualities and enough character so that may be when recovering connectivity the retrieve electronic copy.This system often indicates to the user: success of known scanning and therein a plate carry and distinguished context in the index, or known related publication makes its data can be used for this system, therefore after a while retrieval should be able to be successful.
Super scanner is plugged in the support of the live wire that is connected to PC or USB port, and also upgrade its various plates based on nearest User Activity and new publication and carry index and other databases this moment except uploading the data of catching.But it has also that device is connected to wireless public network or via bluetooth and mobile phone communications and therefore at such device time spent and public network communication.
15.4 the feature of optical scanning
Some features that now our consideration may be expected in optical scanner equipment especially.
15.4.1 flexibly location and easily optical device
It is can easily use paper in the unrealistic or inconvenient various situations of for example computing machine that paper continues one of popular reason.Plan to catch the mutual equipment of a big chunk of user and paper so should be easy to use similarly.Situation is really not so concerning the scanner in past; Even if minimum handheld device is also a bit heavy.Be designed to also to move very carefully along the length of the text that will scan with the accurate angle gripping relative to paper with those scanners of page contact.This is acceptable when the business report on the scanning desk, but this may be unrealistic when scanning fictitious phrase when waiting for train.May be used for some situations similarly based on the scanner with the optical device that reproduces the camera type that document operates at a distance of certain distance.
Some embodiment of this system use and the scanner that reproduces document and contact to scan, and wherein this scanner is not with camera lens but with the fibre bundle conductron image is transferred to optical sensor device from the page.Such equipment can be shaped as the position that allows with nature and grip this equipment; For example, in certain embodiments, the part that contacts with the page is wedge shape, allows user's hand naturally more mobile at the page to be similar to the movement of using the fluorescence marking pen.Conductron or directly contact with the reproduction document or be in close proximity to it, and can have and can protect conductron to avoid the replaceable transparent ends that may damage.As mentioned in the 12.2.4 joint, scanner can be used to scan from screen and from paper, and can select this terminal material to reduce the possibility that such display is damaged.
At last, when scanning input ground too soon, too slowly, too inhomogeneous or float De Taigao or when too low at the row that scans, some embodiment of this equipment will be during scanning process provide feedback by using light, sound or tactile feedback to indicate to the user.
15.5 safety, identification, authentication, personalization and paying
As the 6th the joint described in, capture device can be formed for the pith of identification and the mandate of Secure Transaction, purchase and various other operations.Therefore, except such role required circuit and software, it can merge variously can make its safer hardware characteristics, for example intellignet card fetch, RFID, key in the keypad of PIN thereon.
It can also comprise that various biometric sensors help identify the user.For example, in the situation of optical scanner, scanner head is all right can fetching finger mark.For voice recorder, speech pattern that can the user.
15.6 device association
In certain embodiments, this equipment can form related to increase the functional of himself or them with other nearby device.For example, in certain embodiments, its uses the display close on PC or phone providing the more detailed feedback about its operation, or uses their network connection.On the other hand, this equipment can operate to authenticate the operation of being carried out by other equipment with its role as safety and identification equipment.Perhaps, it can form association simply so that the peripheral hardware of this equipment of being used as.
The interesting aspect of such association is that they can start with the acquisition equipment of this equipment and authenticate.For example, wish to scan code or the symbol on the specific region that is presented at this terminal screen with the scanister of this equipment and therefore realize key delivery to the user of public computer terminal security ground identification oneself.Can carry out similar process with the sound signal of being picked up by speech recording apparatus.
15.7 integrated with other equipment
In certain embodiments, the functional of capture device is integrated in a certain other equipment that used.Integrated equipment may can be shared power supply, data capture and storage capacity and network interface.Can be only for convenient and carry out so integrated to reduce cost or to realize disabled functional in other cases.
Some examples that capturing function can be integrated into equipment wherein comprise:
Existing peripheral hardware is such as mouse, stylus point (stylus), USB " network photograph " camera, bluetooth
TMHeadset or telepilot
Another processing/memory device is such as PDA, MP3 player, voice recorder, digital camera or mobile phone
Other the article that often carry, just to convenient---wrist-watch, jewelry, pen, a car key are buckled card (key fob)
15.7.1 mobile phone is integrated
As the example of integrated benefit, we consider the mobile phone of revising as capture device.
In certain embodiments, for example can carry out fully by speech recognition in the situation that text catches---wherein they can be in by phone directory reason or be processed or be stored in by the system at the call other end in the storer of phone in order to process in the future, and not revising telephony hardware just can back-up system.A lot of modern telephone have the ability of software that download can be implemented the some parts of this system.(for example when having very large ground unrest and at the best of times accurate speech recognition is being difficult to of task) is suboptimum yet such speech capturing may be under many circumstances.Preferably can catch voice notes with audio devices.
In certain embodiments, build the image that camera in a lot of mobile phones is used to catch text in.The telephone displays that is typically used as the view finder of camera can overlap with the quality of image and to which section of the applicability of OCR, text and be hunted down and even can carry out transcribing on the relevant on-the-spot camera images information of the text in the situation of OCR at phone.
In certain embodiments, revise that phone adds special-purpose acquisition equipment or at be connected with the bluetooth of separating of telephone communication outer if provide so functional in the clip adapter.Regardless of the character of capture mechanism, have a lot of other advantages with cellular phones integrated.Phone has the connectivity with the more wide world, and this means can be to other part submit Queries of remote search engines or system, and the copy of document can be retrieved for storing immediately or checking.Phone generally has a lot of functions of this system of the next local execution of enough processing poweies, and has enough reservoirs to catch the data of appropriate amount.Memory space can also be expanded by the user usually.Phone has goodish display and audio devices provides user feedback, and usually has the vibrating function for tactile feedback.They also have good power supply.
The most significant is that they are the equipment that most users has carried.
The example application of III part---this system
This section has been listed this system and the example of the application that can set up is thereon used.It is illustrative and never be exhaustive that this tabulation is only planned.
16. individual application
16.1 life storehouse
Life storehouse (referring to 6.1.1 joint) is that the subscriber wishes the digital archives of any important documents of preserving and is one group of embodiment of the service of this system.Important books, magazine article, newspaper cutting etc. can both be kept in the life storehouse in digital form.In addition, subscriber's note, comment and note can be preserved with document.Can be via the Internet and world wide web access life storehouse.
This system creates and managerial life database documents archives for the subscriber.The subscriber is by from file scanning information or by otherwise indicating the subscriber to wish to preserve which document his life storehouse to the life storehouse that the indication of this system will join particular document the subscriber.The information that scans generally is from the text of document but also can is the code of bar code or other identification the document.This system accepts this code and identifies source document with it.Behind the identification document, this system can store the copy of the document or to the link in the source that can obtain the document in user's life storehouse.
An embodiment of life storehouse system can check whether authorized subscriber is obtained electronic copies.For example, if scan text or identifier are in order to join this reader's life storehouse with this article in the article copy of reader from New Yorker Times (NYT), the storehouse system of then living will verify whether this reader has subscribed to the online version of NYT to NYT; If so, then this reader stores the copy of this article in his life storehouse account; If not, the information of then identifying the document and how ordering it is stored in his the life storehouse account.
In certain embodiments, this system safeguards the subscriber's profile that comprises access privileges information for each subscriber.Document access information can be worked out in several ways, wherein two kinds are: 1) subscriber offers life storehouse system with its account name and password etc. with document access information, or 2) life storehouse ISP is with subscriber's information query publisher, and if life storehouse subscriber be authorized to access this material then publisher by providing the access to electronic copies to respond.If life storehouse subscriber is not authorized to have the electronic copies of the document, then publisher provides price to life storehouse ISP, and life the storehouse ISP then provide the option of buying this electronic document to client.If fruit is like this, the storehouse ISP or directly pay and present the bill later on to life storehouse client to publisher of then living, otherwise life storehouse ISP gives client's credit card present the bill (bill) immediately for this purchase.Life storehouse ISP will obtain the certain percentage of purchasing price or a little fixed expense to facilitate this transaction.
In any other storehouse that this system can have the privilege of filing subscriber's personal library and/or this subscriber the document is filed.For example, as user during from the document printing scan text, life storehouse system can identify reproduces document and its electronics homologue.After having identified source document, life storehouse system can will have in the Population Sink of the privilege of filing user's personal library this subscriber that neutralizes about the information recording/of source document.Population Sink is the cooperation archives, such as being used for following document storage vault: be engaged in together a certain purpose colony, academic research person colony, the web of colony blog etc.
Regular organization activity storehouse in many ways: according to the age, press topic (topic), by subscriber's level of interest, by publishing type (newspaper, books, magazine, technical papers, etc.), reading position, reading time, press ISBN or press Dewey decimal, etc.In a kind of alternatives, this system can be based on other subscribers how to classify identical document and learning classification.This system can advise classifying or automatically for the user document being classified to the user.
In various embodiments, note can directly insert in the document or can be maintained in the independent file.For example, when the subscriber from newspaper article during scan text, this article is archived in his the life storehouse and highlights the document of scanning.Alternatively, this article together is archived to together with the comment file that is associated in his the life storehouse (like this, so that file document unmodified).The embodiment of this system can preserve the copy of source document in each subscriber's storehouse, preserve copy in the master library that many subscribers can access or be saved in the link of the copy of being held by publisher.
In certain embodiments, the user is only stored to the modification (for example, highlighting etc.) of document with to the link of the online version of (elsewhere storage) document in the life storehouse.When the subscriber retrieves the document subsequently, this system or subscriber will change and the document is combined.
If note is stored in the independent file, then source document and comment file are provided for the subscriber and the subscriber makes up to create the document of modification with them.Alternatively, this system made up them present existing these two files to the subscriber before.In another alternatives, comment file is the overlapping layer (overlay) to document files and can comes overlapping being somebody's turn to do to document by the software in subscriber's computing machine.

The mark of following text in reference to the accompanying drawings describes accompanying drawing in the back in detail.Can be used in a plurality of actions in the situation of single key word, some embodiment of native system carry out with the subset of these actions of various actions rules selection, and for example, rule can be given for determines which action has precedence over the level of other actions.For example, rule can stipulate that the big or small increasing order of the endomorph that this system is applied to according to action selects action.As example, specific Zhang Huizhong at the specific textbook of being published by specific publisher catches in the situation of key word, this system can select to return the first action that is associated with this chapter of textbook, being the second action that is associated with specific textbook afterwards, is the 3rd action that is associated with whole textbooks that publisher publishes afterwards.This system also can based on capture device 302 when catching residing geographic area or position, catch key word the time or date scope, agree that with the contextual information of catching relevant various other kinds, the various profile informations that are associated with the user and/or sponsor the money that is used for this action of patronage that provides or the number of other remunerations select action.
In certain embodiments, the hand-held optics of this system's utilization and/or acoustics capture device are such as acoustics and/or image-forming assembly in the hand-held optics that is wirelessly connected to computing machine 212 systems and/or acoustics capture device 302 or the cell phone or be integrated in similar assembly among the PDA (" personal digital assistant ").
In certain embodiments, this system comprises from the optics and/or the acoustics capture device 302 that reproduce that document is caught and communicate with the keyword server 440 of storage key register information.In certain embodiments, the key word register information is stored in the database of key word of registration.In certain embodiments, this information is stored in the database of flag data.In certain embodiments, this information is stored in and reproduces the marking document that document is associated.
In certain embodiments, capture device 302 is portable or hand held scanner, such as " pen type " scanner of the scan aperture with the text that is fit to line by line scan rather than scan " flat board " scanner of whole page or leaf at every turn.Flat bed scanner is not portable but more much larger than the volume of pen type scanner usually.The pen type scanner can have indicator to indicate to the user when key word is scanned into.For example, scanner can be lighted LED 332 to allow the user know that the word of scanning has been characterized as key word.The button (perhaps making attitude with scanner) that the user can press on the scanner starts processing, takes thus related action, for example sends the information relevant with key word to the user.
Capture device 302 can the related display device of tool.The example of related display device comprises the display (216) on personal computer displays 421 and the cell phone.Action may be displayed on the related display device with the menu of other mutual information data.When capture device 302 is integrated in the cell phone or uses cellular assembly, cellular telephone keypad can be used to select option from the menu that presents in cell phones displays, and is used for controlling described system and function and mutual with described system and function.
Capture device 302 between trapping period not with situation that keyword server 440 is communicated by letter under, may expect be in capture device 302, have popular key word, relevant action, flag data etc. local cache in case it can be local and begin independently action.Example local, independently action is that indication obtains key word, presents choice menus and receive the user to the response of this menu to the user.When next capture device 302 communicates by letter with keyword server 440, can determine the additional information relevant with key word, mark etc. and press its behaviour.
In various embodiments, with word or the phrase information (for example, label information) related with action can be stored in the capture device 302, in computing machine 212 systems that are connected to capture device 302 and/or can with other computer systems of described system communication in.Similarly various device can participate in carrying out the action of catching in response to key word.
Combine with capture device 302, keyword server 440 may be able to be identified the electronic version that document is reproduced in the document of catching from Chinese version and location automatically.For example, the content of text in catching can be by as document signature.Such signature usually need 10 or still less word come unique identification document---and 3 to 8 words are just enough as a rule.When known additional contextual information, the needed number of words of identification document just can further be reduced.All in the situation of signature match, most probable coupling (for example, comprising those couplings of catching at most of being done by this user or other users) can be presented to the user specially at a plurality of documents---for example as first in tabulation or the menu.When a plurality of document signature match, previous or follow-up catching can be used for eliminating the ambiguity of candidate item and correctly identify the reproduction document that the user has---and randomly, correctly locate its digital homologue.
User for the subscriber who serves as the file retrieval that in some embodiment of this system, provides, keyword server 440 can transmit and catch text dependent or catch the relevant content of the theme of residing context (for example, paragraph, the page, magazine article) with execution.Therefore, according to the context of catching and also according to user habit and preference known to the keyword server 440, can be dynamic to the response of catching.
This system allows the efficient digital content relevant with the text of catching or other information (trade mark, symbol, mark, image etc.) that transmit from reproduce publication.This has just realized a kind of based on the new mode of the reproduction publication such as newspaper and magazine to products ﹠ services advertisement and sell goods and service.In traditional newspaper, News Stories itself does not contain advertisement.This system allows the text of any article to comprise potentially advertisement by the use key word related with product, service, company etc.
It is to use the key word that reproduces text that this system transmits one of mode of the enhancing content that is used for the reproduction publication.When predetermined key word was caught by the user, the key word of catching triggered the transmission of the content related with this key word.In certain embodiments, key word distinguished by keyword server 440, so that extract content and be sent to equipment (the randomly output device such as display or loudspeaker) with user-association from database.This related equipment can be near display or printer.This system can be related with the advertisement of product or service with the key word (or combination of key word) of each reproduction.As example, if the user catches words " new car " from reproducing document (for example automobile journal), then can trigger this system the advertisement of local Ford agency is sent near the position of portable capture device 302 display.
Similarly, if the user catches trade mark with capture device 302 from reproduce document, then this system can send the information relevant with trade mark possessor's product line to the user.If the user has caught trade mark and ProductName, the information that then sends to the user will be by further constriction to provide this product distinctive information.For example, if the user has caught word " Sanford ", then this system can be characterized as this word the trade mark of Sanford Office Depot and the electronic copies (or this system can change the link of the Sanford webpage that is provided to the online copy with this catalogue into) of Sanford office appliance catalogue is provided to the user.As another example, if the user has caught " the single pearl of Sandfor ", then this system may be programmed to single pearl pen of those key words and Sandford company is interrelated.If like this, then this system will transmit the information relevant with the single pearl pen series of Sandford to the user.This system can send this information to user's electronic mail account with the form of Email (have the information relevant with the single pearl pen of Sandford or link to the focus of webpage of information that has about this), is sent near the display of user, sends near printer etc. as pamphlet as pushing (push) Multimedia Message.
This will be very useful with transmit the related method of additional content to the user for providing for advertisement and the other materials to target efficiently from the key word of catching reproducing publication.By the key word that identification is caught by the user, this system can provide timely Useful Information to the user.Printer manufacturer can pay when having caught key word " computer printer " as the user, and the advertisement of the printer of this manufacturer is sent to the user.And, can be about one or more contents (for example, in specific magazine; In the article related with specific topics or be applied near other key words of topic) sell or hire out the authority to special key words.This system can be related with single printer manufacturer exclusively with key word " computer printer ", maybe can these key words are related with many printers manufacturer (or the words key word " printer " in the context of the related article of its topic and key word " computing machine ").In the several printer manufacturer situation related with key word, this system can send (or each manufacturer can obtain the key word authority in the context that separates) such as advertisement from each manufacturer, reward vouchers.If the user clicks to utilize the website of arbitrary proposal or access manufacturer, then the operator of this system can collect nominal fee (being commonly referred to micropayments) to this manufacturer.In certain embodiments, capture device 302 or related computing machine 212 can be stored reward voucher in order to use after a while.
This system can also come key word and catches further classification with catching the relevant context of the situation of text with user wherein.Can based on catch relevant contextual systematic knowledge/identification and separate and process key word.Contextual example is about following knowledge: the user catch historical and interest, in identical document other users' the position of catching history, user, from the document of wherein catching text, catch neighbouring (such as with catch identical paragraph or on the identical page) other texts or information, execution moment of catching etc.For example, this system can appear at text on every side wherein and different reactions made in identical key word according to user's position or according to key word.The ISP can sell or hire out identical key word in different market by the position of knowing capture device 302.Example is that the user to New York sells identical key word to the #1 of advertiser and the user of Seattle is sold identical key word to the #2 of advertiser.The ISP can be sold to key word " hammer " the local hard ware store in different cities.
There are a variety of " taxis " or sell the mode of reproducing the key word in the document.This system can based on the time of catching, the position of catching, the document of therefrom catching and in conjunction with near other key word (for example, appearing at term " nail " or " structure " time " hammer ") to key word taxi divide.As an example of hiring out the common product description, key word " current title " and " best seller " can be sold to the bookman.When the user caught words " current title " or " best seller " from reproducing document (for example newspaper), the tabulation of best seller can be sent out with the link to bookman's webpage, so that the user can buy them.Alternatively, this link can be " by " link, it is by keyword server 440 routes (therefore allowing this system counts and audit point to advance transaction), so that the bookman can with the operator of this system share income that point advances to sell and so that the bookman can based on achievement (performance) for advertisement paying (namely, advance to pay nominal fee for the each point that is produced by this service, and no matter result how).Similarly, the advertiser in the document printing can based in its advertisement or near catching pay.
Catch in combination key word and can cause the transmission of different content.For example, near the key word " hammer " that is captured in the key word " nail " (for example, approach the time on or insert on the number of words order approaching) may cause sending the ad content from hard ware store.And near the key word of catching key word " M.C. " " hammer (hammer) " will cause transmitting the content relevant with artist M.C.Hammer.
When the user when reproducing file scanning trade mark possessor's trade mark, the trade mark possessor can transmit the advertisement relevant with its products ﹠ services and message with this system.
Can divide key word based on geography hires out.For example, key word " is bought new car " and can be hired out to full-sized car manufacturer nationally and/or can be hired out to the local vehicle dealer regionally.In " buying new car " and situation from local vehicle dealer's relevance, the behavior of catching " buying new car " in the New York may cause sending from New York car dealer's advertisement but " buy new car " and will cause sending the advertisement of the car dealer Paris near in the same phrases that Paris, FRA is caught.
Can hire out based on dividing key word from the document of wherein catching text.For example, catch key word from the firearms magazine and " forbid offensive weapon " and may cause sending support gun (pro-gun) content from national rifle association.Catch same keyword from liberalistic magazine (liberal magazine) and " forbid offensive weapon " and may cause sending anti-gun content from Brady handgun homicide center.
Star's name can send news and message to bean vermicelli with helping the star.For example, phrase " Madonna " can with the relevance relevant with performer Madonna.When the user catches words " Madonna " from reproducing document, this system can send the attached perigean Madonna's concert information of this catch position, Amazon.com buy Madonna's music link, from Madonna market the up-to-date sales promotion information (promotional release) of company, from brief MP3 montage of her up-to-date popular song etc.
The related cost of text that advertisement and certain are caught can change according to the time of catching.The taxi of term (term) may be more expensive and more cheap in the non-peak hours in some rush hour.For example, the taxi of term " diamond " may allow diamond dealer Christmas the shopping season peak period than more in the cost of the overdue time durations of annual income tax.As another example, may lack than the cost of the taxi between 9:00AM and 7:00PM in the taxi between midnight and the 5:00AM such as the term of " mower ", this is because (catching from reproducing document the user of text) spectators' estimation after midnight may be still less.
Particular advertisement or message can be related with a lot of key words.For example, the advertisement of Harley Davidson motorcycle can with key word " Harley ", " Harley Davidson ", " new motorcycle ", associations such as " classical motorcycles ".
Advertisement or message can with some key word between relation (such as their relative position) related.For example, if the user catches words " motorcycle " from reproduce document, and if key word " buy " in six words of key word " motorcycle ", then the advertisement relevant with motorcycle or message will be transmitted to the user.When the known document context, even if this system knows that also key word " buys " the interior fact of certain distance at catching words " motorcycle " when only catching words " motorcycle ".Therefore can be by only catching words " motorcycle " and using the words that the context of relevant the document caught with further explanation and trigger with the key word action that " to buy motorcycle " related.
Additional functional
Blog and trackback (track-back)
In some embodiment of described device, even if the bloger can the artificially creates link in any content or trackback---object content or home site do not provide the clearly support to trackback.In fact, technology described here allows the bloger to stay trackback and create link in any document or any material that presents---and no matter this material from website or the text of static document, book or magazine, private document also or personal email etc. is.Can also give the content still can not obtain in digital form (for example announcing not yet on the internet)---even to still non-existent content creating link and note.In order to finish this, the note author specifies when no matter in the future target and/or anchor when occurring the target material and/or the anchor material that use.As example, the note author can specify target and the anchor material that obtains from the printed copy of book---in such as the content that on dynamic display, presents this book to the user of this device, will call this note.
In some embodiment of described device, target and anchor can randomly comprise asterisk wildcard (wild-card) and/or fuzzy matching element.Like this, can create that the note related with " IBM is * company "---wherein " * " character represents the combination in any of word or character here.
Be used for realizing that the known manner of fuzzy matching is to use regular expression.For top example, we can be configured to the suitable regular expression of " IBM is * company ": " (IBM is) ([[: ^alnum :]] .+? [[: ^alnum :]]) (company) ".The character string of this regular expression registration " IBM is "---then is that---then being arbitrary string,---then being a non-alphanumeric characters---then is accurate character string " company " to a non-alphanumeric characters (for example, blank character or punctuation mark).
ToolTips and ToolTips menu
A very useful user UI model is the ejection note that uses " ToolTips " type, and described device is expanded this model to comprise menu in ToolTips is ejected in some cases.In one embodiment, for presenting the mutual logic of this UI be: { demonstration has the ToolTips of menu to If (user's mouse is above target); { If (the ToolTips menu item is by user selection) { carries out the menu action of selecting to While (user's mouse is above the target or above the ToolTips of user's mouse in association); Break; Remove the ToolTips with menu }
Link by note
A kind of use of described remarking technology is as a kind of means for transmitting reference.Like this, be not copy the content of article interested and with it by e-mail forward to friend's (under many circumstances property infringement) and be not that (this link may change the hyperlink that is forwarded to required article, so that hyperlink is unavailable), the user can alternatively catch the pocket that contains interested certain content and transmit this expression-association (presentation-association).Since the link of transmitting to content (and/or its anchor), therefore receive can check expection content (intended content)---add the note of any association---and no matter expect content and/or anchor be how to store or where be stored in.
In certain embodiments, the take over party of the note reference of forwarding can the artificially searches for and therefore checks the copy of expection content and need not to receive the infringement copy interested theme/object content (and anchor of optional it).In optional embodiment, to this note reference of based on network server registers, the example of this server record and/or search comments content.Like this, the take over party of the note reference of forwarding just can inquire about this webserver to find and to check the expection content.
Connection between the document

The expression document is the different editions that described technology is applied to single document to the special circumstances of the note of document links.In this case, where link note indication is from the content of the first document---perhaps the form to change---appears in the second version of identical document.
The expression document is for translation to the another kind of special circumstances of the note of document links.In one example, the first document links with annotated English arrives the second Spanish document.Be noted that the second Spanish document illustrates in addition same or similar material and appears at note where link in the English document.
Since some embodiment of described device allow user's intended target material and/or related anchor can be similar to (namely, this device is supported " bluring " coupling), so connection to any note, being included in the above-mentioned connection between " walking abreast " document, is quite healthy and strong (robust) to the moderate change of note material and related anchor.
Automatic document connects
A lot of documents have carried implicit link or note.For example, a lot of documents contain the element of quoting other elements in the identical document.And a lot of documents contain usually take quoted passage, specific chapter return, sections or the page number with reference to etc. as the reference to the content in other documents of form.Quote as proof is that a document can be linked to or usually with reference to another example of another document.
Activity (active) note can be found and convert to by described device to the link that is pre-existing between document automatically.After the conversion, the user for example can click quoting as proof also so that the document of quoting as proof is opened in the position of quoting as proof and shown on the document with its mouse, wherein highlights especially the motif material of quoting as proof like this.
Some versions of described device are also supported reverse note (reverse annotation).Like this, quoting motif material as proof and also can be converted into active annotations in above-mentioned example, this note chain takes back originally to be quoted as proof and quotes as proof as its theme original.
Similarly, many Blog contents are about appear at other text materials in the document that does not occur in blog itself.Described device can create note according to quoting in the blog to the motif material in another document automatically, and the note energy chain in the document of quoting takes back blog subsides (blog post).This last form that is noted that note is the trackback form---but it can finish with motif material and/or anchor material by described device, even if for originally not supporting the website of trackback technology or content also can finish.
Catalogue in document, index and bibliography are other examples that wherein can be created by described device automatic note.Clauses and subclauses in catalogue, index or the bibliography of document can be automatically or the note of the content quoted of artificially and sensing be associated, the content of quoting simultaneously can be associated with the note that points to catalogue, index or bibliography clauses and subclauses.
Regular expression and expert system technology be described device can rely automatic identification and be created in catalogue, index or the bibliography of document and these elements in two kinds of means of two-way note between the material quoted.
In certain embodiments, described device will cooperate with user's operating system to determine the text that presents at user display, and determine randomly that the user highlights or otherwise select to present indication and the position of the text on display of which part of text.Alternatively, responsible generation presents text and identification provides API by the application of the part of user selection, can determine these details by API.Application does not expose under the certain situation of (expose) suitable API as further alternatives and in the source, can inquire about " accessibility API ".Some modern operating system provide the information relevant with the content that presents at user display by means of accessibility API in order to used by the people with dysopia.Such API can transmit the information relevant with other guide with the text that shows, and this information and then can be used as the described comment server of inquiry to obtain the source of any associated annotation.

When adding note, some embodiment of described device also indicate the anchor text of automatic selection to the user, and described anchor text can be used to the note of retrieval user when its target appears in the follow-up reproduction.Randomly, the user can manually set the anchor text.
Mutual with hand held scanner
A kind of means that create note for the material that presents of numeral are users by means of can with mutual hand held scanner indicating target position or the target material of digital indicator.Such scanner may directly read the content that presents from the displaying contents that can check, or alternatively, may at first determine it in the position on the display and then set up object content (mentioning two kinds in the multiple possibility means) by inquiring about to described device in the content of this position display.
Similarly, can reuse in certain embodiments such as above-mentioned those technology of mentioning and utilize hand held scanner and the note that shows at dynamic display mutual and it is made response.
Hand held scanner be used for is created the environment that hardware device itself that interior perhaps mutual with it advantage that dynamically shows is that scanner separates as the computing machine with the user can create a safety, and it is so that the convenient and safety of the transaction relevant with cyber-net.For example, because described scanner can merge safety, encryption and authentication element etc., relate to the many tradition that to avoid alternately single cyber-net environment dangerous (phishing (phishing), deception (spoofing), man-in-the-middle attack etc.) of note.
In some cases, hand held scanner creates security context by the transaction that independent and based on network server communication confirmed and authenticated any proposal.For example hand held scanner be cell phone or with the situation of the scanner of cellular telephone communication under, can carry out the communication that separates by be connected the cellular network that separates with internet that subscriber computer is used.In another embodiment, hand held scanner is used the physical network identical with subscriber computer to connect but is used the safe lane (for example, the https session of encryption) that separates to communicate.
Note privacy and security
No matter be to come with shown note alternately with hand held scanner, or be responsible at the software that subscriber computer is carried out that these are mutual, carry out the mutual described device of presentation layer than having security advantages with the mutual classic method of dynamic displaying contents.The same application (being the web-browsing device here) that---for example when user check the web content by the web-browsing device and during with the web content exchange---presents this content and mutual chance in a lot of traditional environment also be responsible for finishing or realize mutual (no matter this be alternately the establishment note or to now annotated presenting made response).Comparatively speaking, these assemblies may be separated in described device---like this, require to attempt to disturb or intervene these two assemblies that mutual anyone slips into (and coordination) this device.
Existing note is presented in user's the dynamic display with the form of choice menus alternately.Yet, the device of demonstration original contents is traditional web-browsing device (it just in time also can be email client, word processor etc.), is once generated and is generated by this device or application by the diverse device of carrying out at subscriber computer or application and note is mutual.And, caught by this different application alternately and transmit or carry out by this different application from any of the note that presents---the therefore duplicity activity in the web-browsing device or content private data and the purchase/financial information that can not access the user who is controlled by this different application.
Such as displaying contents on the dynamic display that is applied in the user of web-browsing device.Described device is caught the information that just is shown to the user.Derive one or more signatures from the information of catching.The signature of deriving is sent to comment server to determine whether to exist for the content that shows the note of any association.With phrase Canon PowerShot A520 digital camera " related note is returned to this application and as being presented on user's the display with the related menu of original contents.
The follow-up of user and shown note alternately can be as described below.The user has selected in the shown annotation menus item: " buying at Amazon ".User's option is selected to send note realization server to by using via secure communication channel.The safety that this realization server is created to the amazon.com website connects, and user's privately owned shipment (shipping) and financial data is provided, and presents Amazon shopping cart view to the user.Be noted that the original web-browsing device that presents by the content of note is optional in follow-up purchase activity.
The content that record shows
In some embodiment of described device, preserve the record of the various contents that are shown to the user.Usually, this record is stored as the chronologically daily record of ordering of all contents that present.But when the time spent, the source application that presents this information also is recorded, as being used for the url or document locator of source material itself.Additional contextual information (such as constantly, the physical location of subscriber computer etc.) also is hunted down.The daily record that is created by this process is so that the user can search for the material that shows or check over to locate interested project.
In certain embodiments, the material that comes the focal application of tool on the comfortable user display is only caught and recorded to described device.In certain embodiments, only have and keep static and reach the set time amount or be captured to daily record to be lower than the material that fixed rate rolls (these times and speed indicating user read if having time or understand shown material).
Logic element is used to construct the meaningful history of the material of checking, even the optional position that the user may be rolled in the document with random order also is like this.When known the document (for example, but when the document metadata time spent), then easily store the composition/content of the document and then additionally recording user through the path of the document, so that the record of ordering indication order and time of checking material chronologically.Yet, in the disabled situation of document metadata, along with user scroll-up/down or up and down page turning in document, the sequence order (serial order) of document content is assigned to logically construct in the overlapping portion that presents material by analysis in possible situation.
Be the complete sequence of convenient document form in the time of can not recovering according to the material that is shown to the user (as when the user from document one when jumping to rapidly another place), these elements of the theme of paying close attention to as the user---for example can be seen enough time so that the user considers their those views---and be captured in the daily record with indicating each view when to be presented and to present time data how long on display.
Like this, described device each document, this movable time that occurs of can recording user opening/checking, check which material has spent and how long wait.Have the supplementary features that this historical content can be searched, described device becomes a kind of of great value storage utility appliance and storage vault to the valuable content of user.In addition, the great majority checked for the user of described device or full content provide one deck note mutual and based on the information of complementary annotations.
And can randomly move the cooperation that need not to the application of user's displaying contents owing to the device that proposes, need not the cooperation from operating system of user, need not the cooperation from web host, website design person, document author, application developer etc., so it has created the uniform computing experience that enriches that comprises the active annotations of any displaying contents.
Notice
Some embodiment of described device comprise notification of document author, note author or other interests sides when follow-up note is added to document (for example, publisher, editor or bloger's etc.) feature.
Some embodiment comprise the similar characteristics that notice is provided when particular individual or group membership add note to particular document.
For example, these features allow to notify the user when specific famous bloger adds note to any document, when note is added to the works that it creates, notify the author, when the online publishing thing of the up-to-date phase of any note being added to periodical publisher, notify this periodical publisher etc.
Such notice can be passed through Email, transmits as the content of note and the RSS seed of note etc.
In addition, the notice of described device support when note itself is the theme of additional comment or note.
Group, filtration and license
Described device allows some groups individual share notes and prevent that this group individuality outward from checking these notes.Each note randomly can comprise describing whom allows check or receive their license.When so namely convenient many notes from many users are stored on the single comment server, also be possible by the individual privately owned note that is created with each group and can check.Alternatively, the user can create and announce can be by anyone " public " note of checking.
Because note may be potentially from any source, the ability of therefore adding note in described device may be limited to some individuality.For example, only have to this device registration or the individuality having paid subscription charge or had the secure hardware equipment (for example, comprising such as the equipment that is used in the SIM card in the mobile phone) that this device identifies and just can be allowed to carry out note.
Also because note may be potentially from any source, therefore some embodiment of described device comprise and allow user selection they want to receive the filtering technique of which note.Filtering option comprises that the note that will receive is limited to those notes of being created by particular individual or group of individuals, those notes that contain (or not containing) commercial opportunity (comprising advertisement), (for example belong to those notes of particular category, comprise individual editorial review and viewpoint, but get rid of notes and commentary that pay or company) etc.In certain embodiments, this device is provided for setting some the application preference pane (preference pane) in these filtering options.
Encrypt note and anchor
Some embodiment of described device comprise the parts for the complete secret of content is checked and the complete secret of note is shared.User A is that the content (one piece of article that they notice in public web site) of checking creates note.The note of the user A anchor related with it is encrypted with the encryption key known to only user A and the user B at the local machine of user A.The note of encrypting and the anchor of encryption are transferred to central comment server.User B reception contains the Email by the article of the content of user A note.The content that user B checks also uses the identical private cipher key that uses with user A to be encrypted, and the result is sent to central comment server.Because comment server does not have this key, so it can not determine what user B reading.Yet its definite encrypted result from user B is mated the encrypted content by user A note.Therefore, comment server sends (encryption) note of user A to user B, and wherein the application of user B uses the key of sharing to present to user B to its deciphering and with the note of deciphering.
In certain embodiments, use single verification and (for example, MD5) indicate the content of reading by user A note and by user B and need not the character of disclosure.When comment server is determined from the verification of user A and user B with when consistent the suitable note of its transmission---from the actual content of not knowing also to have been read subsequently by note.
Dynamic annotation
In some embodiment of described device, automatic and dynamic creation note, rather than by individuals building site establishment note.In some cases, the means that are used for finishing this are via regular expression, and described regular expression can be used to identify various types of other content that suitable note can associated.The content object that is particularly suitable for this process is that those have the content object of rule schemata or tissue (and therefore can be identified by regular expression) and those belong to the content object of finite set (and therefore can be imported in tabulation or the database).
It is the content element such as telephone number, e-mail address, URL, physical address, concert (concert) and other events, intrinsic title (name, middle first name and last name---usually can by title and capitalization identification) etc. in regular expression group.Business Name, individual name (name, middle first name and last name), geographic position name, title, movie name, ProductName and part number/model in tabulation/set of databases, rare or abstruse word etc.
For the every class object in above-mentioned regular expression and tabulation/set of databases, described device can provide one or more standard comments, and described standard comments can randomly present when showing the anchor of related object and/or their association.For example, any title can both trigger the nearest commentary that is included in this book and automatically to the note of the link of the chance of buying this book from e-business or traditional bookstore.Similarly, any presenting of telephone number can generate note automatically, this note propose to add to this telephone number in user's the contact list or automatically from based on network telephone device call out this number and with this call connection to from the nearest any phone of user.And each rare or abstruse word can both proposing offers provides dictionary definition, pronunciation or shows the optional contextual note of this literal.
In some cases, described device can be found out relevant information for the content that shows automatically.For example, can randomly be shown as hyperlink to the quoting of any demonstration of exabyte, wherein said device has been searched for the website related with mentioned company and automatically generated has the note that links that points to this URL.
Update notification
In certain embodiments, described device is used from the display update of operating system or application and is notified to determine which zone of user display upgrades with fresh information.In this way, this device only needs to analyze a zone that changes and determines that fresh content is whether available and whether need potentially that this comment server is carried out new note and inquire about.
Alternatively, whole display---or by user selection that viewing area that is used for note---can periodically be checked by described device.A kind of means that check like this be by with the each several part and its oneself of display buffer the copy of morning (normally upper when once inquiring about comment server the copy of buffer memory) compare.
For fear of the cached version early of each pixel and its oneself of display buffer is compared, some embodiment of this device adopt sparse test (sparse testing) method: only the pixel of test selection is to check whether they change.In certain embodiments, these test pixel are selected because of its very high change possibility.For example, probably when showing new text, change in the borderline pixel between prospect character and the shown background.
In certain embodiments, if know document metadata, the described device note of (pre-fetch) whole document of looking ahead then.
The time attribute of note
Some embodiment of described device use the time relationship of the inquiry that is received by comment server and source address (for example, IP address) infer otherwise the relation between the note independently.For example, when comment server closely received search sequence from single ip address or on the time, probably these inquiries came from single document.So record this implicit relation allow comment server in addition do not have in the situation of document metadata (that is, even when these inquiries do not comprise this information) also transmit note with the machine of local cache the user on.
Manually set up note
Using the machine (native) to highlight pattern highlights in document.
Right click on highlighting, menu option comprises problem/option: note.
Think that the target of note is to highlight the zone.
Randomly any point of simple click and interpolation note---supposition scope here is zero.
If selected the Comments menu item, then randomly for example also highlighted color indication before this note with another and/or the scope of anchor text afterwards.Then present dialog box to accept text or other notes.Other notes are selected randomly in same dialog box, for example:---(for example be created to the link of other guide, add one or more hyperlink)---the record voice notes,------being created to link or the note of picture material (one or more picture)---is created to the link of commercial opportunity (for example, in the web address that can buy related with this note Amazon.com) to be created to the link of video content or create to point to the link of audio content.
Conclusion
According to foregoing, understand that this paper has described specific embodiment of the present invention for illustrative purposes, but in the situation that does not deviate from the spirit and scope of the present invention, can carry out various modifications.For example, the catching of this device, storage and display capabilities can use independently of one another.Therefore, the present invention is not subjected to the restriction except appended claims.
