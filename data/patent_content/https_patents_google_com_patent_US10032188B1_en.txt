- This media content can be user-generated content (i.e. content that is generated by a user of the media hosting website) or content that is owned and provided by a third party such as a television network.
- the media content may be monetized, that is, provided to users of the web site in conjunction with advertising content in exchange for funds.
- a user may be presented with a short commercial before being allowed to view video content.
- a user may be presented with information describing a product or service before being allowed to view the video content.
- the media hosting web site typically allows the advertiser to “bid” or specify an amount of funds they will provide to the media host in exchange for the media host providing advertising content in association with specific items of media content.
- the media host may provide the advertisers with information that describes the specific items of media content such as the frequency with which an item of media content is viewed so that the advertisers have a better understanding of the number of users their advertising content will be displayed to.
- the media host may provide advertisers with information about the content of videos upon which they can place advertisements (e.g., place ads on videos about cats). Similarly, the media host may provide allow advertisers to place their advertisements in connection with certain search terms entered on the site (e.g., place ads on video search results when the user types in “cats”). This method of placing ads is centered on the search terms entered by a particular user or particular video being watched by a user.
- the insight system enables advertisers to define an audience of video database users that are most likely to purchase the product or service the advertiser wishes to sell based on demographic information, geographic information, activity information and viewing information derived form the users' interaction with a video database.
- the insight system further identifies viewing groups comprised of users with greater-than-average interest in different categories of videos based on the frequency with which the users view video content associated with the categories and allows the advertiser to define audiences based on the viewing groups.
- the insight system further provides a graphical user interface that displays detailed information associated with the defined audience of video database users.
- the detailed information associated with the audience includes information derived from the demographic information, geographic information, viewing information, and activity information provided by the video database users.
- the detailed information associated with the audience includes videos frequently viewed by the audience; search terms frequently used by the audience; and the audience's relative interest in categories of video content.
- an advertiser can characterize the audience most likely to purchase the goods or service they wish to advertise. Also, the advertiser may wish to iteratively re-define the audience most likely to purchase the goods or service they wish to advertise based on the displayed detailed information.
- advertisers bid to display advertising content to the audience of users.
- the system provides users who are associated with an audience with advertising content.
- the system tracks activity information describing the number of times the advertising content is displayed to users and the number of unique users the advertising content is provided to.
- the insight system receives funds from the advertiser based on the activity information.

- Sharing of video content refers to the user's 150 transmission of links, emails or other information containing references to video content to other users 150 .
- the user group engine 116 communicates with the user viewing database 140 and the video database 114 to further refine the information stored in the user viewing database 140 .
- Items of video content stored in the video database 114 are stored in association with “verticals” or categories indicating specific types of video content.
- the categories can indicate any group of video content with similar characteristics, for example, a genre or a subject of video content.
- the user group engine 116 determines an average frequency with which users 150 view video content associated with each category. For each user 150 , the user group engine 116 determines whether the user 150 views video content associated with each category at a frequency that is significantly higher or significantly lower than the average frequency with which users 150 view video content associated with the category.
- the user 150 If the user 150 views video content associated with a category at a frequency that is significantly higher than the average frequency, the user 150 is associated with a “viewing group” of users 150 with higher-than-average interest in an interest topic corresponding to the category associated with the viewing group.
- the user group engine 116 stores viewing group information indicating categories of video content and the users 150 who view videos associated with the categories of video content in the user viewing group database 160 .
- the advertisers 103 access the insight system 100 through the advertiser interface 107 .
- the advertisers 130 can define an audience of users 150 they feel is most likely to purchase their product or service that they seek to advertise.
- the advertisers 130 can define the audience of users 150 based on demographic information, geographic location information and viewing group information. For example, an advertiser 103 seeking to market a beauty product within North America may define an audience of users 150 within Canada, Mexico and the United States between the ages of 15-30, who are associated with a viewing group of users who view videos associated with the category ‘Beauty & Personal Care’ at a higher-than-average rate.
- the insight engine 150 combines information stored in the user viewing group database 160 , the user viewing database, the user demographic database 130 and the user activity database 120 to provide the advertiser 103 with detailed information about the audience.
- the detailed information about the audience can include video content that is frequently viewed by the audience, search terms that are frequently used by the audience, the activities frequently performed by the audience, the audience's relative interest in different categories of video content and detailed demographic information associated with the audience.
- Video content that is frequently viewed by the audience may be displayed in association with the categories or verticals.
- the advertiser 103 may be presented with other viewing groups the audience has association with.
- an advertiser 103 may define an audience of male users with a greater than average interest in automobiles and view information indicating their relative interest in news and current events, taste in music (as indicated by the music videos the audience frequently views) and sense of humor (as indicated by the comedy videos the audience frequently views). This characterization provided by the detailed information associated with the audience allows the advertiser 103 to better develop and direct advertising content to the user.
- the advertisers 103 can refine or modify their definition of an audience of viewers they feel is most likely to purchase their product or service which they seek to advertise. For instance, an advertiser 103 may determine that only a subgroup of the audience they originally defined is likely to purchase their product or service based on the different sub-categories of videos that are most frequently watched by the viewing group. In this way, the advertisers 103 can “browse” audiences of users by re-defining different audiences, allowing the detailed information associated with the different audiences to guide them as to the correct definition of the audience most likely to purchase their product or service.
- the insight server 100 may provide any form of digital advertising content to the users including: video advertising content, audio advertising content, program code encoding an executable interactive program, hyperlinks to web pages containing advertising content and textual advertising content.
- the advertising engine 117 communicates with the advertising interface to receive the bids and advertising content provided by the advertisers 103 .
- the advertising content provided by the advertisers 103 may be textual advertising content, a link to a web page, program code (e.g. program code for an interactive advertisements), audio advertising content or video advertising content.
- the advertising engine 117 communicates with the user interface 106 to provide the advertising content to the audience of users 150 , tracking activity information that specifies the number of times the advertising content is provided to the audience of users 150 and the number of unique users 150 in the audience that the advertising content is provided to.

- the audience defined by the advertiser 103 comprises male users 150 in the United States of America associated with viewing group of users 150 that has been determined to have a higher-than-average interest in the category “Beauty & Personal Care”.
- the user interface 500 comprises a summary display section 501 , a demographics display section 510 , a video thumbnail wall section 520 , a search term section 530 and a video categories section 540 that perform the same function as the corresponding sections illustrated in FIG. 4 .
- the video categories section 540 displays bars that represent the audience's relative interest in the categories of video content based on the frequency with which users in the audience view videos associated with the different categories, where the size of the bar is proportional to the frequency.
- the summary display section 510 displays the audience definition, the number of users 150 in the audience within the last week, the number of times the audience has viewed video content within the last week and the number of times the audience has viewed video content provided by partners of the media host who maintains the insight server 100 and/or the video database 114 .
- the video thumbnail wall section 520 displays small images (“thumbnails”) representing videos corresponding to the category “Beauty & Personal Care” that are frequently viewed by the audience of male viewers associated with a viewing group with a higher-than-average interest in the category “Beauty & Personal Care”.
- the thumbnails of the videos corresponding to this category are primarily comprised of images of male bodybuilders. Using a set of thumbnails to provide a graphic representation of the videos corresponding to a category provides important information to the advertiser 103 who wishes to direct advertising to an audience.
- an advertiser who wishes to advertise a hair product for men may determine that this audience is not more likely to purchase their hair product as their interest in Beauty & Personal Care is primarily directed to bodybuilding. Based on this determination, the advertiser may wish to re-define the audience based on a selection of a sub-category of the category “Beauty & Personal Care.”
- This type of information associated with the audience enables an advertiser to better characterize and/or redefine the audience most likely to purchase the goods or services they wish to purchase.
- an advertiser 103 who wishes to advertise a product to an audience of bodybuilders may already be aware that the audience of users 150 most likely to purchase their product or service is primarily composed of young men.
- the demographics display section 510 in the selected example provides the advertiser with a complete age based breakdown of the users 150 in their audience, showing that the majority of the audience is within the age ranges of 18-24 and 25-34. Based on this breakdown, the advertiser may re-define the audience to only include men within the age ranges of 18-34.
- the detailed information also enables the advertiser to identify interests of the audience that may be used to develop advertising content specific to the audience.
- a search term 588 for the actress “denise austin” is displayed in the search term section 530 in a larger font, indicating that the audience performed searches using this search term at a high frequency. Therefore, an advertiser 103 who seeks to develop an advertisement for a product that is likely to be purchased by an audience with a higher than average interest in bodybuilding such as a nutritional supplement for bodybuilders may seek to have a spokeperson who is popular with bodybuilders endorse their product.

- the video categories section 540 displays a set of categories that are ranked according to the audience's interest in the category in association with bars that represent the audience's relative interest in the categories.
- the audience has only a moderate interest in the category ‘Sports’, although the audience has a higher-than-average interest in the category ‘Cycling’ that is a sub-category of ‘Sports’. This discrepancy can partially explained if the audience very rarely views other videos associated with the category “Sports” other than videos associated with the sub-category “Cycling”. It is further noted, that the audience has a higher interest in the categories “Science” and “Travel” than the category “Sports” thus providing valuable insight into the other interests of the users 150 in the audience.
- FIG. 10 provides another view of the user interface 500 illustrated in FIG. 9 .

Abstract
A graphical interface is provided that enables advertisers to iteratively define an audience of video database users that is most likely to purchase the good or service they are advertising and view detailed information associated with the audience.
Description
The present invention is generally related to the identification of information that can be used to define an audience of video database users. In particular, the present invention is directed to an engine that provides advertisers with detailed information associated with defined audiences of video database users derived from the video database users' interaction with a video database.
The proliferation of media hosting web sites that host multimedia content (e.g., music content and video content) for mass viewing has enabled users of the web sites to browse and access large amounts of media content. This media content can be user-generated content (i.e. content that is generated by a user of the media hosting website) or content that is owned and provided by a third party such as a television network.
In some instances, the media content may be monetized, that is, provided to users of the web site in conjunction with advertising content in exchange for funds. For example, a user may be presented with a short commercial before being allowed to view video content. Alternatively, a user may be presented with information describing a product or service before being allowed to view the video content. In order to monetize content, the media hosting web site typically allows the advertiser to “bid” or specify an amount of funds they will provide to the media host in exchange for the media host providing advertising content in association with specific items of media content. The media host may provide the advertisers with information that describes the specific items of media content such as the frequency with which an item of media content is viewed so that the advertisers have a better understanding of the number of users their advertising content will be displayed to. The media host may provide advertisers with information about the content of videos upon which they can place advertisements (e.g., place ads on videos about cats). Similarly, the media host may provide allow advertisers to place their advertisements in connection with certain search terms entered on the site (e.g., place ads on video search results when the user types in “cats”). This method of placing ads is centered on the search terms entered by a particular user or particular video being watched by a user.
The insight system enables advertisers to define an audience of video database users that are most likely to purchase the product or service the advertiser wishes to sell based on demographic information, geographic information, activity information and viewing information derived form the users' interaction with a video database. The insight system further identifies viewing groups comprised of users with greater-than-average interest in different categories of videos based on the frequency with which the users view video content associated with the categories and allows the advertiser to define audiences based on the viewing groups.
The insight system further provides a graphical user interface that displays detailed information associated with the defined audience of video database users. The detailed information associated with the audience includes information derived from the demographic information, geographic information, viewing information, and activity information provided by the video database users. The detailed information associated with the audience includes videos frequently viewed by the audience; search terms frequently used by the audience; and the audience's relative interest in categories of video content. Using the detailed information, an advertiser can characterize the audience most likely to purchase the goods or service they wish to advertise. Also, the advertiser may wish to iteratively re-define the audience most likely to purchase the goods or service they wish to advertise based on the displayed detailed information.
In one embodiment, advertisers bid to display advertising content to the audience of users. The system provides users who are associated with an audience with advertising content. The system tracks activity information describing the number of times the advertising content is displayed to users and the number of unique users the advertising content is provided to. The insight system receives funds from the advertiser based on the activity information.
The figures depict preferred embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.
The user system 150, advertiser system 103, and the insight system 100 each comprise one or more computer systems, each computer system comprising a memory and a processor. The user system 150, advertiser system, and the insight system 100 can be a laptop, desktop, cell phone, handheld device, thin or thick client device, or any other appropriate computing platform. In most embodiments, the insight system 100 will comprise one or more server computers (e.g. blade servers), where the one or more server computers exclusively perform the functions of the insight system 100. It will also be understood that the described uploading of video content by the user system 150 is not intended to be limited to content uploaded or downloaded via the Internet or the http protocol. Further, in general, functions described in one embodiment as being performed by the insight server 100 can also be performed by the advertiser system 103 and/or the user system 150 in other embodiments if appropriate.
The insight system 100 is maintained by a media host that maintains the video database 114 and provides video content stored in the video database 114. In other embodiments, the insight system 100 may receive user information from a third party media host in conjunction with the video database 114 maintained by the media host.
The users 150 access the video database 114 via the user interface 106. The user interface 106 provides controls and elements that allow the user to browse or search video content within the video database 114 and view video content within the video database 114. The user interface 106 further provides controls that allow the user to upload video content to the video database 114.
The user interface 106 further provides controls that allow the users 150 to register to access the video database 114. Upon registration, the user 150 provides demographic information, contact information (e.g. an email address), a user name (or other information that uniquely identifies the user 150) and a password. According to the embodiment, the user 150 may provide demographic information including age, geographic location, gender and interests. The user registration engine 104 communicates with the user interface 106 to store and access the user registration information. The user registration engine 104 stores the user registration information in association with unique identifiers for the users (e.g. the user name of the user 150, the email address of the user 150) in the user demographic database 130. The user registration engine 104 communicates with the user interface 106 to retrieve password, contact and/or user names for the users 150 from the user demographic database 130 for verification purposes when the users 150 log in to access the video database 114.
The user registration engine 104 further communicates with the activity engine 108 to provide data associated with the users 150 when the users 150 access the video database 114. The activity engine 108 communicates with the user interface 106 and the video database 114 to record the activities that the users 150 perform using the video database. The activity engine 108 receives unique identifiers for the registered users 150 from the user registration engine 104 and stores the recorded user activity information for the users 150 in association with the unique identifiers for the users 150.
The activity engine 108 can record and store any type of information associated with the activities the users 150 perform using the video database 114. The activity engine 108 records the search terms the users 150 use to search the video database 114 and stores the search terms in the user search database 135. The activity engine 108 records information indicating the video content the users 150 view and stores the viewing information in the user viewing database 140. Information indicating the video content the users 150 view or “viewing information” can include: the duration of an item of video content viewed, the number of videos the users 150 watch when they log in to access the video database 114 and a number of times an item of video content is viewed by a user 150. The activity engine 108 records activities performed by the users 150 and stores the activities in the user activity database 120. Activities performed by the users 150 can include: the number of times the users 150 access the video database 112 (e.g. the number of times the users 150 log into the video database 112), comments on video content provided by the users 150, ratings for video content provided by the users 150, video content uploaded by the users 150 and sharing of video content by the users 150. Sharing of video content, as used herein, refers to the user's 150 transmission of links, emails or other information containing references to video content to other users 150.
The user group engine 116 communicates with the user viewing database 140 and the video database 114 to further refine the information stored in the user viewing database 140. Items of video content stored in the video database 114 are stored in association with “verticals” or categories indicating specific types of video content. The categories can indicate any group of video content with similar characteristics, for example, a genre or a subject of video content. Based on the information stored in the user viewing database 140, the user group engine 116 determines an average frequency with which users 150 view video content associated with each category. For each user 150, the user group engine 116 determines whether the user 150 views video content associated with each category at a frequency that is significantly higher or significantly lower than the average frequency with which users 150 view video content associated with the category. If the user 150 views video content associated with a category at a frequency that is significantly higher than the average frequency, the user 150 is associated with a “viewing group” of users 150 with higher-than-average interest in an interest topic corresponding to the category associated with the viewing group. The user group engine 116 stores viewing group information indicating categories of video content and the users 150 who view videos associated with the categories of video content in the user viewing group database 160.
The advertisers 103 access the insight system 100 through the advertiser interface 107. Using the advertiser interface 107, the advertisers 130 can define an audience of users 150 they feel is most likely to purchase their product or service that they seek to advertise. The advertisers 130 can define the audience of users 150 based on demographic information, geographic location information and viewing group information. For example, an advertiser 103 seeking to market a beauty product within North America may define an audience of users 150 within Canada, Mexico and the United States between the ages of 15-30, who are associated with a viewing group of users who view videos associated with the category ‘Beauty & Personal Care’ at a higher-than-average rate.
The insight engine 150 combines information stored in the user viewing group database 160, the user viewing database, the user demographic database 130 and the user activity database 120 to provide the advertiser 103 with detailed information about the audience. The detailed information about the audience can include video content that is frequently viewed by the audience, search terms that are frequently used by the audience, the activities frequently performed by the audience, the audience's relative interest in different categories of video content and detailed demographic information associated with the audience. Video content that is frequently viewed by the audience may be displayed in association with the categories or verticals. In some embodiments, if the audience is defined based on a viewing group, the advertiser 103 may be presented with other viewing groups the audience has association with.
Providing the advertiser 103 with the detailed information associated with the audience allows the advertiser 103 to characterize the audience based on their activities, tastes, interests and behaviors as indicated by the video content that they frequently view, the search terms they frequently use and the behaviors/activities associated with the audience. For instance, an advertiser 103 may define an audience of male users with a greater than average interest in automobiles and view information indicating their relative interest in news and current events, taste in music (as indicated by the music videos the audience frequently views) and sense of humor (as indicated by the comedy videos the audience frequently views). This characterization provided by the detailed information associated with the audience allows the advertiser 103 to better develop and direct advertising content to the user.
Based on the information provided by the insight engine 150, the advertisers 103 can refine or modify their definition of an audience of viewers they feel is most likely to purchase their product or service which they seek to advertise. For instance, an advertiser 103 may determine that only a subgroup of the audience they originally defined is likely to purchase their product or service based on the different sub-categories of videos that are most frequently watched by the viewing group. In this way, the advertisers 103 can “browse” audiences of users by re-defining different audiences, allowing the detailed information associated with the different audiences to guide them as to the correct definition of the audience most likely to purchase their product or service.
Once the advertisers have defined an audience that is most likely to purchase the goods and/or services they are advertising, the advertisers 103 may use the advertiser interface 107 to place bids specifying an amount of funds they are willing to provide to the media host who maintains the insight server 100 in exchange for displaying their advertising content to the audience. The insight server 100 may provide any form of digital advertising content to the users including: video advertising content, audio advertising content, program code encoding an executable interactive program, hyperlinks to web pages containing advertising content and textual advertising content.
The advertising engine 117 communicates with the advertising interface to receive the bids and advertising content provided by the advertisers 103. The advertising content provided by the advertisers 103 may be textual advertising content, a link to a web page, program code (e.g. program code for an interactive advertisements), audio advertising content or video advertising content. The advertising engine 117 communicates with the user interface 106 to provide the advertising content to the audience of users 150, tracking activity information that specifies the number of times the advertising content is provided to the audience of users 150 and the number of unique users 150 in the audience that the advertising content is provided to. The advertising engine 117 further functions to receive funds from the advertisers based on the activity information.
The audience insight module 200 communicates with the advertiser interface 107. The audience insight module 200 receives definitions of audiences from the advertiser interface 107 and transmits detailed information associated with the audiences to the advertiser interface 107. According to one embodiment, the received definition of the audience may include: a selection of a range of ages of users 150 in the audience, a selection of one or more topics representing viewing groups associated with users 150 in the audience, a geographic location associated with users 150 in the audience, a gender associated with users 150 in the audience or activities associated with users 150 in the audience. The audience insight module 200 communicates with the user demographic database 130, the use activity database 120 and the user viewing group database 160 to retrieve a set of unique identifiers for users 150 who correspond to the audience definition.
The audience insight module 200 transmits the set of unique identifiers to the video content retrieval module 220, the demographic retrieval module 240, the activity retrieval module 260 and the search tem retrieval module 280. The demographic retrieval module 240 communicates with the user demographic database 130 to retrieve detailed geographic, demographic and gender information associated with an audience of users 150 based on the set of unique identifiers. The detailed geographic information may include a set of geographic locations associated with the audience of users 150 and the percentage of the audience of users 150 associated with each geographic location. The detailed gender information associated with the audience of users 150 may include the percentage of the audience of users 150 associated with each gender. The activity retrieval module 260 communicates with the user activity database 120 to retrieve detailed activity information corresponding to an audience of users 150 based on the set of unique identifiers. The search term retrieval module 280 communicates with the user search database 135 to retrieve search terms frequently used by an audience of users 150 based on the set of unique identifiers. According to the embodiment, the search terms frequently used by the audience of users may be the search terms that are most frequently used by the audience of users or the search terms that are more frequently used by the audience of users than all users of the video database.
The video content retrieval module 220 communicates with the user viewing database 140 and the user viewing group database 160 to retrieve information describing videos that are frequently viewed by the users 150 in the audience based on a set of unique identifiers associated with users 150 in the audience. Information indicating videos that are frequently viewed by the users 150 may include: a frequency with which each video is viewed by the audience 150, videos associated with a set of categories of video content that are most frequently viewed by the audience 150, the number of times per week the audience accesses the video database 114 and the number of users 150 within the audience 150 who access the video database 114 each week.
The audience insight module 200 receives detailed information from the video content retrieval module 220, the demographic retrieval module 240, the activity retrieval module 260 and the search term retrieval module 280. The audience insight module 200 transmits the detailed information to the advertiser interface 107.
In the illustrated example, a topic selection region 325 displays set of interest topics corresponding to categories of video content associated with viewing groups (i.e. the categories of video content associated with viewing groups are the same as the interest topics). In the illustrated embodiment, the categories correspond to “interest topics”. In other embodiments the categories may correspond to any type of class or group of video content with similar characteristics. The topic selection region 325 displays a hierarchy of categories (“parent categories”) and sub-categories that advertisers 103 may navigate by selecting the parent categories. The topic selection region 320 further comprises controls 321 that enable the advertisers 130 to add a viewing group associated with a category or a sub-category corresponding to an interest topic to a definition of an audience. The user interface 300 further comprises a selected topics region 335 that displays the viewing groups the advertisers has selected to add to the audience definition. In the illustrated example, the selected topics region 335 indicates that the advertiser has defined the audience to include users 150 associated with a viewing group with a higher-than-average interest in “Autos & Vehicles”.

Similar to the user interface 400 illustrated in FIG. 4 , the user interface 500 comprises a summary display section 501, a demographics display section 510, a video thumbnail wall section 520, a search term section 530 and a video categories section 540 that perform the same function as the corresponding sections illustrated in FIG. 4 . In the embodiment illustrated, the video categories section 540 displays bars that represent the audience's relative interest in the categories of video content based on the frequency with which users in the audience view videos associated with the different categories, where the size of the bar is proportional to the frequency. In the embodiment illustrated, the summary display section 510 displays the audience definition, the number of users 150 in the audience within the last week, the number of times the audience has viewed video content within the last week and the number of times the audience has viewed video content provided by partners of the media host who maintains the insight server 100 and/or the video database 114.
In the example illustrated, the video thumbnail wall section 520 displays small images (“thumbnails”) representing videos corresponding to the category “Beauty & Personal Care” that are frequently viewed by the audience of male viewers associated with a viewing group with a higher-than-average interest in the category “Beauty & Personal Care”. In the example illustrated, the thumbnails of the videos corresponding to this category are primarily comprised of images of male bodybuilders. Using a set of thumbnails to provide a graphic representation of the videos corresponding to a category provides important information to the advertiser 103 who wishes to direct advertising to an audience. For example, an advertiser who wishes to advertise a hair product for men may determine that this audience is not more likely to purchase their hair product as their interest in Beauty & Personal Care is primarily directed to bodybuilding. Based on this determination, the advertiser may wish to re-define the audience based on a selection of a sub-category of the category “Beauty & Personal Care.”
This type of information associated with the audience enables an advertiser to better characterize and/or redefine the audience most likely to purchase the goods or services they wish to purchase. For instance, an advertiser 103 who wishes to advertise a product to an audience of bodybuilders may already be aware that the audience of users 150 most likely to purchase their product or service is primarily composed of young men. However, the demographics display section 510 in the selected example provides the advertiser with a complete age based breakdown of the users 150 in their audience, showing that the majority of the audience is within the age ranges of 18-24 and 25-34. Based on this breakdown, the advertiser may re-define the audience to only include men within the age ranges of 18-34.
The detailed information also enables the advertiser to identify interests of the audience that may be used to develop advertising content specific to the audience. In the example illustrated, a search term 588 for the actress “denise austin” is displayed in the search term section 530 in a larger font, indicating that the audience performed searches using this search term at a high frequency. Therefore, an advertiser 103 who seeks to develop an advertisement for a product that is likely to be purchased by an audience with a higher than average interest in bodybuilding such as a nutritional supplement for bodybuilders may seek to have a spokeperson who is popular with bodybuilders endorse their product.
In the example illustrated, the video thumbnail wall section 520 displays small images derived from videos corresponding to the category “Beauty & Personal Care” that are frequently viewed by the audience of female viewers within the United States of America that are associated with a viewing group with a higher-than-average interest in the category “Beauty & Personal Care”. In the example illustrated, the thumbnails of the videos corresponding to this category are primarily comprised images of females wearing or applying cosmetics. These images provides important information to an advertiser 103 who wishes to direct advertising to this audience of users 150 such as the type of cosmetics that the audience is interested in. For instance, the advertiser may determine the type of cosmetics the audience is most interested in or the type of application instructions of the greatest interest to the audience.
In the example illustrated, the video thumbnail wall section 520 displays small images derived from videos corresponding to the category “Cycling” that are frequently viewed by the audience of male viewers within the ages of 18-24 in Great Britain that are associated with a viewing group with a higher-than-average interest in the category “Cycling”. The video categories section 540 provides another example of unexpected information associated with audience of users. The video categories section 540 displays a set of categories that are ranked according to the audience's interest in the category in association with bars that represent the audience's relative interest in the categories. In the example illustrated, it is noted that the audience has only a moderate interest in the category ‘Sports’, although the audience has a higher-than-average interest in the category ‘Cycling’ that is a sub-category of ‘Sports’. This discrepancy can partially explained if the audience very rarely views other videos associated with the category “Sports” other than videos associated with the sub-category “Cycling”. It is further noted, that the audience has a higher interest in the categories “Science” and “Travel” than the category “Sports” thus providing valuable insight into the other interests of the users 150 in the audience.
In the example illustrated, the video thumbnail wall section 520 displays small images derived from videos corresponding to the category “Entertainment/Movies” that are frequently viewed by the audience of male viewers within the ages of 18-24 in Great Britain that are associated with a viewing group with a higher-than-average interest in the category “Cycling”. The ability to select to view the video content such represents tastes and interests associated with an audiences such as the users 150 in the audience's taste in Movies, interest in News & Current events or taste in music allows the Advertiser 103 to better characterize the users 150 in the audience and get a sense of type of advertising content that would be persuasive to the users 150 in the audience. Using this information, the advertiser 103 may develop advertising content specifically target to the audience. For instance, by determining that an audience associated with a viewing group with a higher than average interest in Cycling frequently watches science fiction movies, an advertiser 103 may create advertising content that advertises bicycles with a look-and-feel similar to that of popular science fiction movies.
Once an advertiser has defined an audience of users 150 that are most-likely to purchase the good and or service they are advertising, they may bid to display advertising content to the audience. FIG. 11 is a process diagram illustrating the flow of information and funds between the users 150, the insight server 100 and the advertiser 103 according to one embodiment.

The insight system 100 receives 115 an audience definition from an advertiser 103. The insight system 100 provides detailed information associated with the audience to the advertiser 103. The insight system 100 receives 1119 an advertising bid associated with the defined audience from the advertiser 103. The insight system 100 receives 1121 advertising content 1121 from the advertiser 103. Responsive receiving requests from users 150 associated with the defined audience to view video content, the insight system 1123 provides 1123 the advertising content to the users 150 associated with the audience in conjunction with the video content, tracking advertising content activity information that describes the number of times the advertising content is provided to users 150, the number of times the users 150 in the audience interacted with the advertising content (e.g. a click through rate), and/or the number of unique users 150 associated with the audience that the advertising content is provided to. The insight system 1125 provides 1125 the advertising content activity information to the advertiser 103. The insight system 1127 receives funds from the advertiser based on the number of times the advertising content is provided to the users 150, the number of times the users 150 in the audience interacted with the advertising content (e.g. a click through rate), and/or the number of unique users 150 in the audience the advertising content was provided to.
The advertiser 103 provides 1129 an audience definition to the insight server 100. The advertiser 103 receives 1131 the detailed information associated with the audience from the insight server 100. The advertiser 103 (along with other advertisers) provides 1133 an advertising bid to the insight server 100, the advertising bid specifying an amount of funds the advertiser 103 is willing to provide in exchange for advertising content to provided to users 150 associated with an audience. The advertiser 103 (along with other advertisers) provides advertising content to the insight server 100, the advertising content to be provided to users 150 associated with the audience. The advertiser 103 receives activity information indicating the number of times the advertising content was presented to users 150 associated with the audience, the number of times the users 150 in the audience interacted with the advertising content (e.g. a click through rate), and/or the number of unique users 150 in the audience the advertising content was provided to. The advertiser 103 provides funds to the insight server 100 based on the activity information. According to the embodiment, the advertiser may provide funds based on the number of times the advertising content was provided to the users, the number of times the users 150 in the audience interacted with the advertising content (e.g. a click through rate), and/or the number of unique users 150 in the audience the advertising content was provided to.
